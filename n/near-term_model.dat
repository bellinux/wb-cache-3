40|$|ABSTRACT. The European Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS) {{reported}} {{in the summer of}} 2004. Several conceptual designs (“Models”) for commercial fusion power plants were developed, spanning a range from relatively near term to more substantial extrapolations. The parameters of the Models were chosen by systems analysis to be economically optimal, given the assigned constraints on plasma and technology performance. The conceptual designs were developed in some detail and analyses were made of their safety, environmental impacts and economic performance. The calculated cost of generating electricity from the Models is in the range of published estimates for the future costs from other sources. Even the <b>near-term</b> <b>Models</b> are economically viable. External costs are very low, for all the Models: similar to wind power and much less than for fossil fuels. Economic optimization of the designs did not jeopardize their safety and environmental performance. All the Models proved to have the attractive and substantial safety and environmental advantages found in earlier studies, now established with greater confidence...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract This paper summarizes {{the development process}} and main characteristics of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), a set of four new pathways developed for the climate modeling community {{as a basis for}} long-term and <b>near-term</b> <b>modeling</b> experiments. The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i. e. from 2. 6 to 8. 5 W/m 2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0. 5 × 0. 5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs ar...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} has remained open if <b>near-term</b> gate <b>model</b> quantum computers {{will offer a}} quantum advantage for practical applications in the pre-fault tolerance noise regime. A class of algorithms which have shown some promise in this regard are the so-called classical-quantum hybrid variational algorithms.

We introduce a method which employs the quantum approximate optimization algorithm as a subroutine in order to approximately sample from Gibbs states of Ising Hamiltonians. We use this approximate Gibbs sampling to train neural networks for which we demonstrate training convergence for numerically simulated noisy circuits with depolarizing errors of rates of up to 4 %.

40|$|Chloroquine is {{frequently}} used during pregnancy in malaria-endemic countries, but no {{data are available}} about fetal exposure to the drug. Prophylactic use during labour to obtain effective concentrations in the newborn is also documented. In the present study, the placental transfer of chloroquine was investigated in the pregnant, <b>near-term</b> sheep <b>model.</b> Chronic catheterization allowed blood sampling of maternal and fetal blood. Following a single intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion to the ewe, chloroquine was slowly distributed to the fetus. Peak concentrations in the fetus reached up to +/- 280 ng/ml within 2 - 4 h after administration while maximal concentrations in the mother reached up to 2, 850 ng/ml. The terminal half-life of chloroquine in pregnant sheep was very long, amounting to 65. 1 +/- 34. 9 h (range 27. 4 - 119 h). Tissue binding was high, as reflected by the extensive volume of distribution (V(area) : 19. 0 +/- 11. 0 l/kg). Total clearance was equal to 3. 42 +/- 0. 60 ml/min/kg. The transfer rate of chloroquine from the mother to the fetus was low in all animals. So, the placenta is quite an effective barrier for the drug. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intrauterine growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) affects 5 – 10 % of all newborns and {{is associated}} with increased risk of memory, attention and anxiety problems in late childhood and adolescence. The neurostructural correlates of long-term abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR are unknown. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to provide a comprehensive description of the long-term functional and neurostructural correlates of abnormal neurodevelopment associated with IUGR in a <b>near-term</b> rabbit <b>model</b> (delivered at 30 days of gestation) and evaluate the development of quantitative imaging biomarkers of abnormal neurodevelopment based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters and connectivity. Methodology: At + 70 postnatal days, 10 cases and 11 controls were functionally evaluated with the Open Field Behavioral Test which evaluates anxiety and attention and the Object Recognition Task that evaluates short-term memory and attention. Subsequently, brains were collected, fixed and a high resolution MRI was performed. Differences in diffusion parameters were analyzed by means of voxel-based and connectivity analysis measuring the number of fibers reconstructed within anxiety, attention and short-term memory networks over the total fibers. Principal Findings: The results of the neurobehavioral and cognitive assessment showed a significant higher degree of anxiety, attention and memory problems in cases compared to controls in most of the variables explored.

40|$|The Department of Homeland Security {{and others}} rely on results from {{atmospheric}} dispersion models for threat evaluation, event management, and post-event analyses. The ability to simulate dry deposition rates {{is a crucial}} part of our emergency preparedness capabilities. Deposited materials pose potential hazards from radioactive shine, inhalation, and ingestion pathways. A reliable characterization of these potential exposures is critical for management and mitigation of these hazards. A review of the current status of dry deposition formulations used in these atmospheric dispersion models was conducted. The formulations for dry deposition of particulate materials from am event such as a radiological attack involving a Radiological Detonation Device (RDD) is considered. The results of this effort are applicable to current emergency preparedness capabilities such as are deployed in the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center (IMAAC), other similar national/regional emergency response systems, and standalone emergency response models. The review concludes that dry deposition formulations need to consider the full range of particle sizes including: 1) the accumulation mode range (0. 1 to 1 micron diameter) and its minimum in deposition velocity, 2) smaller particles (less than. 01 micron diameter) deposited mainly by molecular diffusion, 3) 10 to 50 micron diameter particles deposited mainly by impaction and gravitational settling, and 4) larger particles (greater than 100 micron diameter) deposited mainly by gravitational settling. The effects of the local turbulence intensity, particle characteristics, and surface element properties must also be addressed in the formulations. Specific areas for improvements in the dry deposition formulations are 1) capability of simulating near-field dry deposition patterns, 2) capability of addressing the full range of potential particle properties, 3) incorporation of particle surface retention/rebound processes, and. 4) development of dry deposition formulations applicable to urban areas. Also to improve dry deposition modeling capabilities, atmospheric dispersion models in which the dry deposition formulations are imbedded need better source-term plume initialization and improved in-plume treatment of particle growth processes. Dry deposition formulations used in current models are largely inapplicable to the complex urban environment. An improved capability is urgently needed to provide surface-specific information to assess local exposure hazard levels in both urban and non-urban areas on roads, buildings, crops, rivers, etc. A model improvement plan is developed with a near-term and far-term component. Despite some conceptual limitations, the current formulations for particle deposition based on a resistance approach have proven to provide reasonable dry deposition simulations. For many models with inadequate dry deposition formulations, adding or improving a resistance approach will be the desirable <b>near-term</b> update. Resistance <b>models</b> however are inapplicable aerodynamically very rough surfaces such as urban areas. In the longer term an improved parameterization of dry deposition needs to be developed that will be applicable to all surfaces, and in particular urban surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} cause of newborn failure to {{transition}} at birth is perinatal asphyxia. Asphyxia is a multi-causal condition of simultaneous hypoxia and hypercapnia that leads to acideamia. Severely asphyxiated newborn infants are born bradycardic and apneic and require resuscitation to establish pulmonary gas exchange and restore cardiac function after birth. However, as {{there is a lack of}} evidence to support any specific resuscitation regime, there is currently no globally accepted resuscitation strategy for asphyxiated newborns. The evidence-base for current neonatal resuscitation guidelines remains low and data is extrapolated largely from adult or animal resuscitation studies. Most animal studies have been conducted in adult models or newborn animals that were hours or days into postnatal life, which is not reflective of the newborn circulation. This is because the fetal shunts (ductus arterious and foreman ovale) are functionally closed in these models, thus the circulation is more reflective of an adult as opposed to the newborn. Therefore, most of the information from these studies is of limited applicability to neonatal delivery room resuscitation. In my thesis, I have utilised for the first time a relevant animal <b>model</b> where <b>near-term</b> lambs are asphyxiated immediately after delivery. This almost exactly mimics that which occurs in the neonatal intensive care unit, and for the first time examines the pulmonary and cerebral circulatory response to different ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation strategies. Therefore, the global aim of my thesis is to determine the effects of different resuscitation strategies on the cardiorespiratory transition in an appropriate animal model of asphyxia immediately after birth. The outcomes from these studies provide a better understanding of the critical relationship between initial respiratory support in the delivery room and cardiorespiratory haemodynamics in asphyxiated newborns. A cornerstone of neonatal resuscitation teaching describes a rapid vagal-mediated bradycardic response to asphyxia and is one of the first signs of perinatal compromise. As such, heart rate is the primary parameter used to assess the well-being of the newborn. This understanding is based primarily on fetal studies. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate the heart rate response to asphyxia depending upon whether lambs were in utero or ex utero (Chapter 3). Heart rate response to asphyxia was markedly different depending upon whether the lamb was in utero or ex utero. Heart rates in in utero lambs rapidly decreased, while heart rates in ex utero lambs initially increased following cord occlusion before they started to decrease. Mean arterial pressure initially increased then decreased in both groups. This data indicates that our current understanding of the cardiovascular responses that indicate the stage and severity of a perinatal asphyxic event may not be as accurate as previously assumed. International neonatal resuscitation guidelines vaguely state that shorter or longer inflation times to can be used to establish initial lung inflation in apnoeic newborn infants. The second aim of this thesis was to compare three different ventilation strategies immediately after delivery asphyxiated near-term lambs on the cardiovascular and respiratory transition at birth (Chapter 4). Immediately after asphyxia, animals were either resuscitated with i) immediate start of ventilation with inflation times of 0. 5 s at a rate of 60 inflations per minute (conventional ventilation) ii) five initial inflations of 3 s duration (European approach) or iii) one long inflation of 30 s duration (experimental approach). A single sustained inflation of 30 s duration improved speed of circulatory recovery and lung compliance in this <b>near-term</b> lamb asphyxia <b>model.</b> However, the restoration in heart rate and blood pressure was so rapid that the resulting increase in cerebral blood flow may induce or enhance brain pathology. Therefore, ventilation with an initial single 30 s SI improves circulatory recovery, but is also associated with a rapid increase in cerebral blood flow, which may exacerbate brain injury suffered by asphyxiated newborns. The use an initial 30 s SI was found to rapidly improve circulatory recovery in asphyxiated lambs Chapter 4. The mechanism of this dramatic response in heart rate is unknown. It is known that aeration of the lungs is associated with a rapid increase in pulmonary blood flow (PBF). The third aim of this thesis was to determine if the entry of gas into the lungs was the major mechanism driving the cardiopulmonary transition in asphyxiated newborns (Chapter 5). It was found that an SI using nitrogen did not increase heart rate or PBF. Therefore, oxygen content during an SI is important in increasing heart rate in asphyxiated lambs. The increase in heart rate is likely driven by the increase in PBF and venous return to the heart. Chest compressions (CC) and adrenaline administration are recommended in asphyxiated newborns that have persistent bradycardia despite effective ventilation. Although this improves circulatory recovery in adults and infants, the effects of CC on cerebral blood flow in newborns at birth, when ductal shunts are patent, is unknown. The final aim of this thesis was to determine the effects of CC, with or without adrenaline administration on the return of spontaneous circulation, carotid blood flow (CBF) and carotid arterial pressure in asphyxiated near-term lambs (Chapter 6). We found that CC with adrenaline administration was required to increase CBF and restore spontaneous circulation in asphyxiated lambs. We also found the presence of a low CBF and retrograde diastolic CBF during CC, which was only abolished when adrenaline was administered, leading to the return in spontaneous circulation. In conclusion, the studies contained in this thesis increase our understanding of the effects of different resuscitation strategies on the cardiovascular transition at birth in an appropriate model of perinatal asphyxia. The knowledge of how these strategies influences cardiovascular and cerebrovascular haemodynamics will benefit the future design of ventilation strategies that aerate the lungs without compromising cardiac output...|$|R
