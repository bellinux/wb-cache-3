5|$|The {{mood was}} now so {{volatile}} that Charles feared a full-scale London {{rebellion against the}} monarchy. Food production and distribution had been disrupted {{to the point of}} non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would be brought into the City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter. These markets were for buying and selling; there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> distributing emergency aid.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic. However, a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions. She was {{silent on the}} subject of his relationships with other women, suspected or otherwise. In turn, she was treated with utmost respect and there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> her position ever being threatened or called into question. No more children were born after July 1848, even after the death of her two sons in infancy. A likely reason for the halt to childbearing is that the Emperor became more attracted to other women who possessed beauty, wit and intelligence which the Empress could not provide.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, since there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds {{should be subject to}} cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E

5|$|Van Overstraten {{is desperately}} keen for strong British counterattack. Either {{north or south}} of Leie could help restore the situation. Belgians expect to be {{attacked}} on the Ghent front tomorrow. Germans already have a bridgehead over canal west of Eecloo. There can be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the Belgian withdrawal to Yser. One battalion on march NE of Ypres was practically wiped out today in attack by sixty aircraft. Withdrawal over open roads without adequate fighter support very costly. Whole of their supplies are east of Yser. They strongly represent attempt {{should be made to}} restore the situation on Leie by British counter-attack for which opportunity may last another few hours only.|$|E
25|$|The Astor Library {{suffered}} from its name. There was actually no proprietorship, and <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> family fiefdom. It {{was a free}} public library. But the public, though free to criticize, was reluctant to contribute towards its support. That was left to the Astors.|$|E
25|$|India's Home Minister, Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant, {{during his}} visit to Srinagar in 1956, {{declared}} that the State of Jammu and Kashmir {{was an integral part of}} India and there could be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> a plebiscite to determine its status afresh, hinting that India would resist plebiscite efforts from then on.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Royal Automobile Club (RAC), {{under the}} {{chairmanship}} of Wilfred Andrews, set its mind upon running a Grand Prix and started to cast around public roads on the mainland. There was no possibility of closing the public highway as could happen on the Isle of Man, or the Channel Islands; {{it was a time}} of austerity and there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> building a new circuit from scratch so some viable alternative has to be found.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} resistance, since {{first he was}} ordained a monk in the Kadampa {{tradition}} and for various reasons, {{for hundreds of years}} the Kadampa school had eschewed the adoption of the tulku system to which the older schools adhered. Tsongkhapa largely modelled his new, reformed Gelugpa school on the Kadampa tradition and refrained from starting a tulku system. Therefore, although Gendun Drup grew to be a very important Gelugpa lama, after he died in 1474 there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> any search being made to identify his incarnation.|$|E

25|$|According {{to another}} theory, by the {{historian}} Harjinder Singh Dilgeer, Bhim Chand's son was not {{married to the}} daughter of Fateh Shah and there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> dispute with Fateh Shah on this ground. Instead, Fateh Shah had been instigated by Gurbakhsh (a masand of Raja Ram Rai of Assam) that the Guru intended to attack his Garhwal territory and occupy it. As a result, Fateh Shah decided to attack the Guru. The Guru got the news of attack before hand and reached Bhangani, from where people usually crossed the Yamuna river. The battle was fought here on 18 September 1688.|$|E
25|$|Justice Brennan's opinion did {{not reach}} any of the {{questions}} on the limitations of sovereign immunity, or waiver thereof, that were considered by both the Court and the other dissents. Instead, Brennan argued that the Eleventh Amendment does not immunize states from being sued by their citizens at all. His position {{is that there is}} <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> what the purported immunity covers, or whether it can be waived, because there is no immunity. He notes that the Eleventh Amendment, by its language, only bars suits against a state by citizens of other states. This leaves common law sovereign immunity, which Brennan asserts was surrendered by the states at the time they agreed to join into the United States.|$|E
25|$|Karmas {{are often}} wrongly {{interpreted}} as a method for reward and punishment of a soul for its good and bad deeds. In Jainism, there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> there being any reward or punishment, as each soul is the master of its own destiny. The karmas {{can be said to}} represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires of a soul. They enable the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience. They ultimately mature when the necessary supportive conditions required for maturity are fulfilled. Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karmas that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the fruits.|$|E

50|$|It {{was divided}} into twenty-three articles, some of which closely {{approached}} the Protestant view; but it decided <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> dogma and did not exclude the Catholic positions.

In spite of the apparent concessions made {{in regard to the}} doctrine of justification, he perceived that the proposed articles of agreement could be accepted by neither party.|$|R
60|$|From all which Mrs Dale {{learned that}} some care which had sat heavy on Lily's heart was now lightened, if not {{altogether}} removed. She had asked <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> her daughter, {{but she had}} perceived {{during the past few}} days that Lily was in trouble, and she knew that such trouble had arisen from her engagement. She had asked <b>no</b> <b>questions,</b> but <b>of</b> course she had been told what was Mr Crosbie's income, and had been made to understand that {{it was not to be}} considered as amply sufficient for all the wants of matrimony. There was little difficulty in guessing what was the source of Lily's care, and as little in now perceiving that something had been said between them by which that care had been relieved.|$|R
25|$|Although {{letting the}} Countess escape was morally questionable, {{it was not}} uncommon. In The Nemean Lion, Poirot sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, {{allowing}} her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who, Poirot discovered, had plans to commit murder. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign. In The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare {{the feelings of the}} murderer's relatives. In The Augean Stables, he helped the government to cover up vast corruption. In Murder on the Orient Express, Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in the murder. The victim had been responsible for a disgusting crime which had led to the deaths of no fewer than five people. There was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> his guilt, but he had been acquitted in America in a miscarriage of justice. Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted him and twelve people had stabbed him, Poirot produced an alternate sequence of events to explain the death.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1882 R. Mowat {{published}} an inscription in which Fortuna is called daughter of Jupiter, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in {{the theology of}} Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this aporia would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the Not-Bound or Enemy of Bondage, that shows that there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> choosing {{one of the two}} apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign who represents the Creative Energy, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs. Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.|$|E

500|$|A 1959 revolt in East Timor {{against the}} Portuguese was not {{endorsed}} by the Indonesian government. A 1962 United Nations document notes: [...] "the government of Indonesia has declared that it maintains friendly relations with Portugal and has no claim to Portuguese Timor...". These assurances continued after Suharto took power in 1965. An Indonesian official declared in December 1974: [...] "Indonesia has no territorial ambition... Thus there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> Indonesia wishing to annex Portuguese Timor." ...|$|E

He is an old man, not strong physically. He is a man of much personal charm and impressive personality, which qualifications make him a dangerous man calculated to mislead the unthinking and affording excuse for those with criminal intent." ...|$|E

[...] "This is an attack on the eurozone by certain other interests, political or financial". The Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has also suggested that the recent financial market crisis in Europe is an attempt to undermine the euro. He ordered the Centro Nacional de Inteligencia intelligence service (National Intelligence Centre, CNI in Spanish) to investigate the role of the [...] "Anglo-Saxon media" [...] in fomenting the crisis. So far, no results have been reported from this investigation.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theme is}} a kind of {{military}} racism, or species-ism. The Mushrooms are clearly described as different, although they would seem to be human, to some extent. However, when it comes to battle, the Mushrooms are treated like non-humans or animals—alien. Killing them is necessary, impersonal, and raises <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> conscience. The Minnipins feel no pity for their enemy, even as the story describes the shrieks from the Mushrooms as they are killed.|$|R
