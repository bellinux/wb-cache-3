25|$|Secondly, {{the novel}} gives {{an insight into}} the power {{structure}} which dominates a large institution of learning, where an individual teacher can <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> whether a perceived attack on his own well-being has happened out of malice or sheer stupidity, {{or a combination of}} both. Siding with the winners or those in power to prevent such nuisances from happening or to advance one's own career {{is only one of the}} many human weaknesses which are on display in a professional environment where teamwork is actually supposed to be a prerequisite.|$|E
25|$|Train-based ICBMs do {{offer some}} {{advantages}} over missiles in fixed silos, namely {{that the enemy}} can <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> where they are—or, more accurately, where {{all of them are}} at any given moment. But as a 2014 RAND study pointed out, rail and truck launchers have their drawbacks. Maintaining a missile on a train is more difficult than in a silo, while rail lines and roads can be blocked by snow, which tends to restrict railroad ICBMs to warmer climates. In addition, because there are {{only a limited number of}} rail lines and highways in an area, enemy surveillance can focus on a few areas. And, once located, mobile missiles are more vulnerable than ICBMs in hardened silos.|$|E
25|$|Although the USA is most {{commonly}} known as the cradle of graffiti, American writers were also influenced by European tendencies. BG138 from Tats Crew confirmed in an interview that Europe was more advanced in some aspects, among those also being the 3D-style and a very cooperative working process – DAIM and Loomit shaped both. DAIM also realized works in Los Angeles and Miami among other cities in the USA. Crome, a writer from Miami commented on getting to know DAIM and Loomit and being impressed by how much planning was involved in their working process. In that way the graffiti could be finished at the location at a much faster pace. After the meeting Crome began to plan his works in advance, too. He also talked about his insights into proportions that he got from the Europeans. The writer Pest from Miami talks about DAIM and Loomit bringing the first Belton cans there, which changed the colour palette of the local writers. Freek used the (German) Belton cans only very economically and only as a crowning finale mixed with American colour, because he could <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> when the next shipping was going to happen.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} empire (30 BC– AD 235) the Roman {{government}} paid {{for what it}} needed in gold and silver. The coinage was stable. Requisition, forced purchase, was used to supply armies on the march. During the third century crisis (235–285), the government resorted to requisition rather than payment in debased coinage, since it could <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> {{of the value of}} money. Requisition was nothing more or less than seizure. Diocletian made requisition into tax. He introduced an extensive new tax system based on heads (capita) and land (iugera) – with one iugerum equal to approximately [...]65 acres – and tied to a new, regular census of the empire's population and wealth. Census officials traveled throughout the empire, assessed the value of labor and land for each landowner, and joined the landowners' totals together to make citywide totals of capita and iuga. The iugum was not a consistent measure of land, but varied according to the type of land and crop, and the amount of labor necessary for sustenance. The caput was not consistent either: women, for instance, were often valued at half a caput, and sometimes at other values. Cities provided animals, money, and manpower in proportion to its capita, and grain in proportion to its iuga.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+, considering {{that despite the}} [...] "convoluted plot" [...] the episode [...] "pays off in white-knuckle tension." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club labeled the episode as a [...] "good" [...] stand-alone story. He described it as [...] "a memorable episode, due {{in no small part}} to its humor", praising the [...] "simultaneously absurd and frightening" [...] story with scenes that make the viewer [...] "snicker even as you shudder". In addition, Handlen praised William Sanderson's performance, as well as the ending, calling it [...] "the punchline [...] of Mulder's deepest fears, a group [...] so secret that you <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> they exist at all". Starpulse named the episode the tenth best of the series, defining it as [...] "very creepy" [...] and what turned The X-Files [...] "from a mere creepfest to a show that offered real psychological thrills". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two wrote positively of the episode's flourishes, noting [...] "minute by minute, there is tons to enjoy." [...] However, Shearman and Pearson argue that the premise is [...] "disjointed and not a little frustrating" [...] {{due to the lack of}} overall coherence and narrative. The plot for [...] "Blood" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title Fear.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of the {{sensation}} S Wittgenstein argues that there is no criterion for the correctness of such an ostensive definition, since whatever seems right will be right, 'And that only means that here we can't talk about [...] "right".' The exact reason for the rejection of private language has been contentious. One interpretation, which has been called memory scepticism, has it that one might remember the sensation wrongly, and that as a result one might misuse the term S [...] The other, called meaning scepticism, has it that one can <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of the meaning of a term defined in this way.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{view is that}} {{assurance}} is of {{the essence}} of saving faith. This view holds that faith is, by definition, a conviction that what Jesus promises is true. If a person has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>sure</b> that he had eternal life which could <b>never</b> <b>be</b> lost (i.e., <b>sure</b> that he <b>was</b> once-for-all justified, <b>sure</b> that he <b>is</b> going to heaven no matter what), then it is posited that he has not yet believed in Christ in the Biblical sense (cf. John 11:25-26 and Jesus' question, [...] "Do you believe this?").|$|R

2500|$|Montana voters {{approved}} {{the creation of}} a state constitutional convention in 1971 to update and revise the 1889 constitution. By this time, water rights in the state were almost impossible to verify or enforce. The Montana Supreme Court had held in [...] that inter se proceedings were not required when adjudicating water rights. This meant that even when the Montana Supreme Court ruled on a water rights conflict, there often many appropriators not bound by the decision. Water rights records were dispersed (sometimes across many counties), grossly inaccurate, and incomplete. Many water rights laid claims to amounts of water that could never be used, calling into question the legality of the claim, and purchasers of water could <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of obtaining the amount of water they had bought.|$|E
