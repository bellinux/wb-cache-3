50|$|A <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> only acquires a {{right of}} action to enforce his benefit once he has {{accepted}} the benefit provided for in the contract. Under the South African interpretation, however, prior to formal acceptance of the benefit, the <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> only has a spes, or expectation; in other words, {{he does not have}} the right to accept, but rather a mere competency. Acceptance may also be a suspensive condition in certain contracts. Under Scots law, acceptance is not necessary to be vested in {{a right of}} action, but is necessary to be liable. Before acceptance, however, the ius quaesitum tertio is tenuous so that acceptance of a benefit does not create a right, but rather entrenches that right. In either case, the contracting parties may vary or rescind the contract until acceptance or reliance.|$|R
40|$|Journal articleContemporary jurisdictions of {{continental}} Europe {{are familiar}} with the legal concepts of a contract in favour of a <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> who is not present when the contract is entered into as well as the right of this third party to enforce such a contract.

5000|$|He {{noted that}} {{in cases where the}} agency {{exception}} did not apply, as in this case, courts [...] "may nonetheless undertake the appropriate analysis, bounded by both common sense and commercial reality, in order to determine whether the doctrine of privity with respect to <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> should be relaxed".

40|$|The article {{examines}} how courts in different jurisdictions have addressed restrictive employment covenants for physicians and proposes {{a new approach}} drawn from the <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> analysis in contract law. Physicians hired into existing practices often must sign substantial non-compete agreements. In evaluating the enforceability of any restrictive covenant, courts consider, among other factors, the agreement 2 ̆ 7 s effect on the public. Surprisingly, {{the vast majority of}} jurisdictions treat the 2 ̆ 2 public interest 2 ̆ 2 analysis vis-a-vis physician restrictive covenants no differently than any other commercial restrictive covenant; this approach neglects the impact that such agreements can have on a physician 2 ̆ 7 s existing patients. Although at first glance physician restrictive covenants may seem like a somewhat insular area of the law, it is an area that is reflective of some of the primary forces acting on the perceived health care 2 ̆ 2 crisis 2 ̆ 2 in this country - the often contradictory pressures of serving patients and running a profitable business. This article suggests courts should consider a physician 2 ̆ 7 s incumbent patients as quasi <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> to the physician 2 ̆ 7 s employment agreement when deciding whether to enforce the physician restrictive covenant. This more nuanced approach will allow courts a finer balance of the business interests of physicians against the often weighty public interest in protecting physicians 2 ̆ 7 relationships with their patients...|$|R
50|$|Plaintiff {{alleged that}} she and {{similarly}} situated individuals were intended <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of Google's Advertising Terms which include a Content Policy requiring that mobile subscription service advertisers display certain information about their products, including whether downloading the products will result in charges to the consumer. In Barnes v. Yahoo!, Inc. the court addressed the immunity of Yahoo! against Barnes' claim that it was either negligent in undertaking to remove, or breached an oral contract to remove, offensive and unauthorized content posted about the plaintiff by her ex-boyfriend on one of Yahoo!'s public profile pages. The court found that claims alleging that a website negligently undertook to remove harmful content are barred by the CDA. However, the court noted that certain promissory conduct by a defendant may remove it from the protections of the CDA even where the alleged promise was to remove or screen third-party content. Barnes implies that when a party engages in conduct giving rise to an independent and enforceable contractual obligation, that party may be liable not as a publisher or speaker of third-party content but instead under contract law.Here, however, there was no allegation that Google ever promised Plaintiff or anyone else that it would enforce its Content Policy. Also, even if Google had promised to enforce its Content Policy, Plaintiff {{would not be a}} <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of that promise: Google would be the promisor and the allegedly fraudulent MSSP would be a promisee. Thus, the court also rejected Plaintiff's contract claim.|$|R

50|$|A theory sustains that is {{feasible}} to typify {{letter of credit}} as a collateral contract for a <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity and in application {{of the theory of}} Jean Domat the cause of a letter of credit is that a bank issue a credit in favor of a seller to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller with legal tender. There are in fact three different entities participating in the letter of credit transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Therefore, a letter of credit theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct, or in other words, an implied-in-fact contract.|$|R
50|$|A <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> {{in the law}} of contracts, is {{a person}} who may have the right to sue on a contract, despite not having {{originally}} been an active party to the contract. This right, known as a ius quaesitum tertio, arises when the third party (tertius or alteri) is the intended beneficiary of the contract, as opposed to a mere incidental beneficiary (penitus extraneus). It vests when the third party relies on or assents to the relationship, and gives the third party the right to sue either the promisor (promittens, or performing party) or the promisee (stipulans, or anchor party) of the contract, depending on the circumstances under which the relationship was created.|$|R

40|$|Under Maryland case law, a {{plaintiff}} in an estate planning malpractice action {{must be in}} strict privity with the attorney who drafted the will. To date, Maryland has not extended the <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> exception to the estate planning arena. Legatees specifically identified in a will by name or class are generally precluded from bringing a cause of action against {{the attorney for the}} attorney 2 ̆ 7 s alleged negligence, because in Maryland in order to recover for legal malpractice, {{a plaintiff}} must:show: 2 ̆ 2 (1) the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s employment; (2) his neglect of a reasonable duty; and (3) loss to the client proximately caused by that neglect of duty. 2 ̆ 2 See Noble v.

Client - Privity, Malpractice, and the Lack of Respect for the Primacy of the Attorney-Client Relationship in Estate Planning, 68 Tenn. L. Rev. 261, 267 (2001). Maryland is in the minority of states that still adhere to the strict privity rule in the context of estate planning. Most other jurisdictions have relaxed the privity barrier in order to allow a legitimately aggrieved beneficiary to have a means of recourse against an attorney who planned the distribution of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate in a negligent manner. Other jurisdictions following strict privity, have carved out the <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> exception in the estate-planning context-where the attorney 2 ̆ 7 s negligence was 2 ̆ 2 facially demonstrated 2 ̆ 2 on the will itself.

In a second part, we deal with the controversial issue of efficient breach due to inducement by a third party.

50|$|Reasonable and {{non-discriminatory}} terms (RAND), {{also known}} as fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms (FRAND), denote a voluntary licensing commitment that standards organizations often request from the owner of an intellectual property right (usually a patent) that is, or may become, essential to practice a technical standard. Put differently, a F/RAND commitment is a voluntary agreement between the standard-setting organization and the holder of standard-essential patents. U.S. courts, as well as courts in other jurisdictions, have found that, in appropriate circumstances, the implementer of a standard—that is, a firm or entity that uses a standard to render a service or manufacture a product—is an intended <b>third-party</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of the FRAND agreement, and, as such, is entitled to certain rights conferred by that agreement.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the law on}} {{this subject}} varies, there is {{nonetheless}} a commonly accepted construction of third-party rights in the laws of most countries.

A promisee nominates a third party usually for one of two reasons—either the promisee owes something to the third party and the performance of this new obligation will discharge it, or the promisee will somehow get a material benefit by giving something to the third party.A says to B offer to sell my car for Rs.50000/- B repalis [...]"I will purchases it for 45000/- ...|$|R
