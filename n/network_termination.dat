An econometric model that estimates the effects attests {{to the formation of}} bandwagon behavior among network subscribers. It is shown that networks with a large subscriber base will recruit a disproportionately greater share of new users ceteris paribus compared with low-penetration operators. The strength of the subscriber bandwagon varies closely with the price differential of intra- and inter-network calls. Also, analysis of network traffic reveals that an average mobile phone user consumes considerably less inter-network than intra-network airtime; consequently, mobile phone use is largely clustered within respective networks and hindered from traversing others.

40|$|Abstract—A general {{method to}} {{determine}} the <b>termination</b> <b>network</b> of multiple coupled lines for lowest input return loss is presented. Each line {{is connected to the}} ground and its nearest neighbors by resistors whose val-ues are determined by minimizing the reflected power. It is demonstrated that under these conditions the optimum <b>termination</b> <b>network</b> depends on the excitation. The inequality of the modal propagation constants requires that the length of the lines be properly taken into account when designing a <b>termination</b> <b>network</b> which ensures maximum power delivery to the loads. Matching networks for five and seven coupled transmission lines under different excitations are presented. For the more practical case of unknown excitations, a design procedure based on minimizing the reflected power for independent random-incident voltage variables is presented.

40|$|To control reflections, the {{impedance}} {{of integrated}} circuit output pad drivers must be matched to {{the impedance of}} the transmission lines to which the pads are connected. HP’s HSTL (high-speed transceiver logic) controlled impedance I/O pads use an on-chip impedance matching network that compensates for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Transmission line reflections {{are one of the}} major factors limiting high-speed I/O performance. These reflections can be controlled by matching the driver output impedance to that of the transmission line. Traditional solutions require the use of off-chip components to implement matching <b>termination</b> <b>networks.</b> This adversely impacts board density, reliability, and cost. Integration of the <b>termination</b> <b>network</b> on-chip removes these negative attributes while providing additional advantages. In this paper, we review a solution for an on-chip impedance matching network. Our HSTL (high-speed transceiver logic) family of controlled impedance I/O pads includes single-ended and differential drivers and receivers, along with com-pensation circuitry for process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Mea-sured HSTL signal integrity in a large, complex board environment is presented. Parallel versus Series Termination When I/O signal integrity and speed are of utmost importance, many pad designers turn to parallel <b>termination</b> <b>networks.</b> Parallel <b>termination</b> eliminates transmission line reflections. However, parallel termination exacts a costly toll on power dissipation because a dc component is added to power consumption. An alternative termination approach is source series termination. In a point-to-point environment, series termination provides an output driver with a means to absorb incident waves, effectively damping any reflections in the transmission line. Matching a driver’s output impedance to that of the board impedance increases signal integrity and speed while keeping power dissipation to a minimum...|$|R
