40|$|<b>Nestling</b> birds solicit {{food from}} their parents with {{vigorous}} begging displays, involving posturing, jostling and calling. In some species, such as canaries, begging is especially costly because it causes a trade off against <b>nestling</b> growth. Fitness costs of begging like this are predicted by evolutionary theory because they function to resolve conflicts of interest within the family over the provision of parental investment. However, the mechanism that links these costs with <b>nestling</b> behaviour remains unclear. In the present study, we determine if the relationships between <b>nestling</b> androgen levels, <b>nestling</b> begging intensities and <b>nestling</b> growth rates {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that testosterone is responsible for the trade-off between begging and growth. We test this idea with a correlational study, using fecal androgens as a non-invasive method for assaying <b>nestling</b> androgen levels. Our results show that fecal androgen levels are positively correlated with <b>nestling</b> begging intensity, and reveal marked family differences in each trait. Furthermore, changes in fecal androgen levels between 5 and 8 days after hatching are positively associated with changes in <b>nestling</b> begging intensity, and negatively associated with <b>nestling</b> growth during this time. Although these correlational results support our predictions, we suggest that that experimental manipulations are now required to test the direct or indirect role of testosterone in mediating the trade-off between begging and growth. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Capsule <b>Nestling</b> {{provisioning}} rates {{depend on}} <b>nestling</b> age and number, and on time of season, {{but not on}} time of day. Aims To determine patterns of <b>nestling</b> provisioning, the effort made by the parents, and the factors which affect them. Methods Mechanical counters to determine food provisioning patterns in 229 Great Tit Parus major nests over 4 years. Results Feeding frequency per chick showed a linear increase with <b>nestling</b> age and total feeding frequency stabilized {{towards the end of}} the <b>nestling</b> period. The number of visits per nest increased linearly, while those per <b>nestling</b> decreased linearly with brood-size. Feeding rates per nest declined throughout the breeding season parallel to the seasonal brood-size decline; feeding frequencies per <b>nestling</b> did not vary seasonally. Adult effort was almost constant throughout the day, independently of variations in brood-size, ambient temperature and date. Conclusion Previous studies of <b>nestling</b> provisioning patterns were either contradictory or poorly supported by low sample sizes. The present study involved a much larger sample and clarifies <b>nestling</b> provisioning patterns and the factors with which they are associated. The rate of food provisioning to young is a basic aspect of the study of foraging behaviour in wild animals, which has been studied primarily in birds (e. g. Gibb & Bett...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that discrimination and rejection of the nestlings of avian brood parasites are most likely to evolve when the parasite <b>nestling</b> is raised alongside the host nestlings, for example, many cowbird-host systems. Under these circumstances, the benefits of discrimination are high because the host parents may save most of their brood. However, there is a general absence of <b>nestling</b> rejection behavior among hosts of nonevicting parasites. In a cost-benefit equilibrium model, {{based on the premise that}} host species learn to recognize their offspring through imprinting on first breeding, we show that <b>nestling</b> recognition can be adaptive for hosts of cowbirds, but only under strict conditions. Namely, when host <b>nestling</b> survival alongside the parasite is low, rates of parasitism are high and the average clutch size is large. All of these conditions are seldom simultaneously achieved in real systems. Most importantly, the parasite <b>nestling,</b> on average, does not sufficiently depress host <b>nestling</b> survival to outweigh the costs of <b>nestling</b> recognition and rejection errors. Thus, we argue that <b>nestling</b> acceptance behaviors by hosts of nonevicting brood parasites may be explained as an evolutionary equilibrium in which recognition costs act as a stabilizing selection pressure against rejection when most of the host's offspring survive parasitism.

40|$|Begging {{signals and}} {{endogenous}} testosterone (T) levels of young birds {{have been shown}} to be positively correlated. If T is causally involved in controlling the level of begging effort, an endocrine control mechanism could explain the evolution of begging as a costly signal reflecting need. We tested experimentally whether elevated circulating T levels enhanced begging behaviour in <b>nestling</b> pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca. A pilot study confirmed that <b>nestling</b> T levels could be elevated within a natural physiological range using an oral dose of T. After T-dosing, <b>nestling</b> begging behaviour was measured as: i) the duration of begging displays and ii) the maximum height of begging stretches. Our results show that <b>nestling</b> T levels were elevated at 90 min post dosing and that at this time point both measures of begging behaviour were performed more intensely by T-dosed nestlings than controls. <b>Nestling</b> begging displays in response to dosing varied between individuals, which in part was explained either by the date in the breeding season or <b>nestling</b> mass. The results of this study confirm the causal nature of T in controlling <b>nestling</b> begging signals and suggest that it may be part of the mechanism that controls begging behaviour in <b>nestling</b> birds. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The fitness-related {{consequences}} of egg mass, independent of confounding influences associated with parental quality, remain poorly understood for wild birds {{in general and}} for passerines in particular. We performed cross-fostering experiments {{to test the hypothesis}} that egg mass, independent of parental quality, is the primary determinant of fitness-related traits in <b>nestling</b> house wrens (Troglodytes aedon), an insectivorous passerine. <b>Nestling</b> mass was significantly correlated with the mass of the eggs from which nestlings hatched early but not late in the <b>nestling</b> period in early-season broods. In contrast, in late-season broods, <b>nestling</b> mass was correlated with egg mass until nestlings achieved asymptotic mass. Neither <b>nestling</b> growth nor survival to nest leaving was related to egg mass in either early- or late-season broods; however, nestlings in late-season broods grew more slowly than did nestlings in early-season broods. We propose that <b>nestling</b> mass and egg mass remained correlated throughout the <b>nestling</b> period in late-season broods because decreased arthropod food resources late in the breeding season constrain parents' ability to provision nestlings. We conclude that female house wrens in this population trade-off clutch size for greater egg mass to maximise reproductive success in late-season broods...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} <b>nestling</b> begging {{behaviors}} and parental provisioning {{responses of the}} phainopepla (Phainopepla nitens), a sexually dichromatic silky flycatcher native to Mexico and the southwestern United States deserts. Because of its small clutch size (usually two eggs) and synchronous hatching strategy, we predicted that size- based <b>nestling</b> competitive interactions and brood reduction strategies would be absent, so that parental food allocation would accurately reflect <b>nestling</b> need. At eight nests we temporarily removed one <b>nestling</b> to deprive it of food, and video-taped the <b>nestling</b> and adult behaviors after the <b>nestling</b> was returned to the nest. Both male and female parents preferentially allocated food to the hungry <b>nestling,</b> but used different provisioning strategies and <b>nestling</b> cues to achieve this result. Males increased their visit rate and food load and used begging start order and initial beak height, as well as beg duration and intensity, as cues to allocate food. By contrast, females only increased food load and allocated resources to the <b>nestling</b> that begged more intensely. Most of our study nests were attended by only one parent. Hungry nestlings in male and female nests used different begging strategies associated with the cues employed by the parent (start/height in male nests, beg intensity in female nests). Nestlings appear to learn which begging signal components {{are most likely to}} generate food rewards. We suggest that conditioned learning could be a common mechanism by which nestlings adjust their begging behavior to their need, but would lead to an honest parent -offspring signaling system only when conflicts of interest between sender and receiver are absent and competing senders experience similar conditioning regime...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to know the age of <b>nestling</b> birds for many ecological and behavioural studies. Various methods have been developed for individual species; most are based on measurements of growth in wings, tarsi or heads/bills, or observations of changes in size, plumage and behaviour over time. However, techniques for aging nestlings have not been established for most avian species. This paper sets out two methods to age <b>nestling</b> Carnaby's cockatoo, Calyptorhynchus latirostris, an endangered species endemic to southwestern Australia. One method is based on the physical changes in size and plumage during the 10 to 11 weeks of the <b>nestling</b> period, and the other on the relationship between the length of the nestling's folded left wing and its age developed from data obtained from nestlings of known age. The estimated age of nestlings may be used to extrapolate egg-laying, hatching and fledging dates by taking the 29 days of incubation and the 76 days of the <b>nestling</b> period into account. The method of estimating <b>nestling</b> age based on length of folded left wing provides a more accurate estimate of <b>nestling</b> age than observations of changes in <b>nestling</b> size and plumage. However in situations where {{it is not possible to}} handle nestlings, the observation method should provide a reasonable basis for calculating the commencement and end of the breeding season, the length of egg-laying and <b>nestling</b> periods; important population parameters specified for monitoring under the species' recovery plan...|$|R

40|$|Parental food {{allocation}} {{decisions are}} based on information about <b>nestling</b> condition conveyed by begging signals. It is expected that parents should have evolved the ability to obtain detailed information about their nestlings' condition through multiple independent signals, thus allowing them to use optimal food allocation strategies depending on resource availability. In this study, we explore 1) which components of acoustic and visual begging signals produced by European starling nestlings (Sturnus vulgaris) vary independently {{from each other and}} consequently have evolved as separate signals and 2) whether these multimodal signals convey multiple or redundant information about <b>nestling</b> condition. We measured <b>nestling</b> stature and an estimate of lipid reserves, 2 independent indices of <b>nestling</b> phenotypic quality that have been suggested to be used in parental food allocation decisions. In multivariate analyses, we show that 1) acoustic and visual begging signals consist of several components that vary independently from each other and that 2) begging components correlated with <b>nestling</b> lipid reserves were different from those correlated with stature. Our results show that <b>nestling</b> begging signals include independent components in multimodal sensory channels that can provide parents with information about 2 independent indices of <b>nestling</b> condition that could be used by parents for flexible allocation strategies when facing changing environmental conditions.

40|$|Capsule The {{effect of}} <b>nestling</b> age (7, 10 and 13 days old) on prey choice by Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus {{seems to be}} related to time {{constraints}} on food selectivity rather than chick gape-size limitations. Aims To study age differences in the <b>nestling</b> diet of Blue Tits and how the relative contribution of each parent varies as the nestlings grow older. Methods The provisioning activity of Blue Tit parents was recorded using infrared video cameras when chicks were 7, 10 and 13 days old. Results <b>Nestling</b> age had no influence on the percentage of folivorous caterpillars in the diet of nestlings. Male and female parents changed their provisioning strategy with <b>nestling</b> age; this change was similar in adults of both sexes. Blue Tit nestlings received a smaller proportion of spiders and a greater proportion of Tortricid larvae (small, low-mobility caterpillars) as they grew older. At the age of seven days, females brought a lower proportion of Noctuids (large caterpillars) to the nest than their mates. The role of each parent in provisioning young varied with <b>nestling</b> age. Males fed their young at a lower rate when they were seven days old compared with later in the <b>nestling</b> period, whereas females tended to invest more in provisioning effort early in the <b>nestling</b> period in comparison with subsequent age-classes. Conclusion Contrary to what would be expected based on the gape-size constraint hypothesis, the youngest nestlings (seven days old) were fed with a higher proportion of large caterpillars (Tortricidae).

Overall, apparent nesting success was 58 % and Mayfield nesting success was 53 %. Nest survival during incubation (64 %) was lower than during the <b>nestling</b> period (83 %). During incubation, clutches were lost to rain, desertion, predation, egg ejection, egg damage, and egg disappearance. During the <b>nestling</b> period, losses occurred due to offspring disappearance, <b>nestling</b> death by starvation, predation and falling. During both incubation and <b>nestling</b> periods, predation was low, while egg ejections and <b>nestling</b> starvation were the main causes of nest failure. Nest survival during incubation was directly proportional to clutch size, while during the <b>nestling</b> period it was inversely proportional to the brood size. Apparently, there seemed to be an advantage to having more eggs during incubation. However, if all eggs were to hatch during unfavorable weather the nest success could be low. These results suggest that when the breeding pairs face adversity during incubation, they control the brood size by ejecting part of the clutch...|$|R
