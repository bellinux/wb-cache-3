40|$|The {{effect of}} DNA binding on {{poisoning}} of human DNA TOP 1 {{has been studied}} using a pair of related anthracyclines which differ only by a nogalose sugar ring. We show that the nogalose sugar ring of <b>nogalamycin,</b> which binds to the minor groove of DNA, {{plays an important role}} in affecting topoisomerase-specific poisoning. Using purified mammalian topoisomerases, menogaril is shown to poison topoisomerase II but not topoisomerase I. By contrast, <b>nogalamycin</b> poisons topoisomerase I but not topoisomerase II. Consistent with the biochemical studies, CEM/VM- 1 cells which express drug-resistant TOP 2 alpha are cross-resistant to menogaril but not <b>nogalamycin.</b> The mechanism by which <b>nogalamycin</b> poisons topoisomerase I has been studied by analyzing a major topoisomerase I-mediated DNA cleavage site induced by <b>nogalamycin.</b> This site is mapped to a sequence embedded in an AT-rich region with four scattered GC base pairs (bps) (at - 10, - 6, + 2, and + 12 positions). GC bps embedded in AT-rich regions are known to be essential for <b>nogalamycin</b> binding. Surprisingly, DNase I footprinting analysis of nogalamycin-DNA complexes has revealed a drug-free region from - 2 to + 9 encompassing the major cleavage site.

40|$|The {{anthracycline}} antibiotic <b>nogalamycin,</b> which binds to DNA, {{is composed}} of a planar aglycone substituted on each end to form an unusual dumbbell-shaped molecule. At one end <b>nogalamycin</b> contains an uncharged nogalose sugar and a methyl ester. At the other end <b>nogalamycin</b> contains a positively charged bicyclo amino sugar. We report the crystal structure of <b>nogalamycin</b> bound to the self-complementary DNA hexamer d(m 5 CGTsAm 5 CG). In this complex, the cytosines are methylated at the 5 position and the DNA contains a phosphorothioate linkage at the TpA step. Two <b>nogalamycin</b> molecules bind to the 6 -base-pair fragment of double-helical DNA. The drug has threaded between the phosphodiester backbones with three aromatic rings intercalated within the DNA. In the major groove, the bicyclo amino sugar forms two direct hydrogen bonds to span a CG base pair and interacts indirectly with the next base pair of the duplex via a water-mediated hydrogen bond. In the minor groove, a carbonyl oxygen of <b>nogalamycin</b> forms a hydrogen bond directly to N 2 of a guanine. The DNA base pairs are severely buckled by up to 26 degrees and are also distorted in directions perpendicular to the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. This complex illustrates the deformable nature of DNA...|$|E

40|$|Platelet-derived {{growth factor}} (PDGF) is a broadly {{expressed}} mitogenic and chemotactic factor with diverse roles {{in a number}} of physiologic and pathologic settings. The zinc finger transcription factors Sp 1, Sp 3 and Egr- 1 bind to overlapping elements in the proximal PDGF B-chain promoter and activate transcription of this gene. The anthracycline <b>nogalamycin</b> has previously been reported to inhibit the capacity of Egr- 1 to bind DNA in vitro. Here we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays to show that <b>nogalamycin</b> added to cells in culture did not alter the interaction of Egr- 1 with the PDGF-B promoter. Instead, it enhanced the capacity of Sp 1 to bind DNA. <b>Nogalamycin</b> increased PDGF-B mRNA expression at the level of transcription, which was abrogated by mutation of the Sp 1 binding site in the PDGF-B promoter or overexpression of mutant Sp 1. Rather than increasing total levels of Sp 1, <b>nogalamycin</b> altered the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor. Overexpression of dominant-negative PKC-ζ blocked nogalamycin-inducible Sp 1 phosphorylation and PDGF-B promoter-dependent expression. <b>Nogalamycin</b> stimulated the phosphorylation of PKC-ζ (on residue Thr 410).

40|$|<b>Nogalamycin</b> is {{a member}} of the {{anthracycline}} family of antitumour antibiotics. These are potent cytotoxic agents and are routinely used in cancer chemotherapy. Though <b>nogalamycin</b> is clinically insignificant, it does exhibit three distinct types of non-covalent binding to DNA. Since most other anthracyclines bind to DNA by only one or two of these mechanisms, <b>nogalamycin</b> is an excellent model with which to probe the interaction of this class of anti-tumour agents with DNA. Here, we investigate the binding orientation and stoichiometry of <b>nogalamycin</b> in adjacent TpG(CpA) (and CpG(CpG)) intercalation sites using a combination of NMR techniques and NOE-restrained molecular dynamics simulations. These methods are also employed to investigate the structure of GNA hairpin loops, which are considered to have important biological functions, and assess how their structure and stability are influenced by the introduction of <b>nogalamycin</b> at an adjacent site. The effect of <b>nogalamycin</b> on extrahelical thymine bases incorporated onto either face of the intercalation sites is also investigated in this context. Binding of quadruplex-specific antibodies to telomeric DNA in Stylonychia lemnae macronuclei has recently been detected using immunofluorescence, providing direct evidence for the formation of quadruplex DNA structures in vivo. Guanine-rich quadruplex structures have been extensively studied by NMR and x-ray crystallographic methods. Previous structural studies have failed to unambiguously resolve the conformation preferred by less-stable A-tetrads incorporated into DNA quadruplexes. Additionally, little effort has been made to address the exact number of ions bound to these adenine-containing structures. This forms the basis of our study into quadruplex DNA. Finally, we endeavour to investigate the extent of hydration of both duplex and quadruplex structures using rMD methods, and to comapre hydration patterns in the liquid- and solid-state.

The elastic response of single DNA molecules to an externally applied force was investigated by the single molecule AFS approach. Characteristic mechanical fingerprints in the overstretching behaviour clearly distinguished the nogalamycin/daunomycin-treated dsDNA from untreated dsDNA-the former appearing less elastic than the latter, and the nogalamycin-treated DNA distinguished from the daunomycin-treated DNA-the classically intercalated dsDNA appearing the least elastic.

40|$|The role of deoxyribonucleic {{acids in}} the cell has made DNA an {{attractive}} target for drug molecules. The anthracycline antitumour antibiotics are potent cytotoxic agents that have found widespread use in cancer chemotherapy. <b>Nogalamycin</b> binds DNA through intercalation, preferentially to 5 '-TpG and 5 '-CpG sites, by threading through the DNA helix and interacting with both the major and minor grooves simultaneously. In this thesis, the interaction of <b>nogalamycin</b> with the 5 '-TpG site has been investigated using synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes and a combination of high-resolution NMR techniques and NOE-restrained molecular dynamics simulations. The solution structure of the 1 : 1 complex with d(ATGCAT) 2 is described with NOE data unambiguously identifying the position and orientation of the bound drug molecule, allowing conclusions to be drawn regarding the specificity for the TpG site. Binding at one TpG site sterically blocks the interaction at the symmetrically equivalent CpA site. The structural studies are extended to investigate by NMR the role of solvation in drug- DNA recognition and binding. Based on the sign and magnitude of solute-solvent NOEs, it is shown {{that only a small}} subset of water molecules visible in the crystal and MD structures are found to be bound in the solution complex, and that a number of these are involved in mediating drug-DNA interactions. The role of the dynamic network of water molecules in stabilising the complex in solution is discussed. Finally, the binding of <b>nogalamycin</b> at a TpG site carrying a DNA strand break has been investigated using a novel designed single-stranded intermolecular duplex consisting of two hairpins stabilised by GAA loops [d(ACGAAGTGCGAAGC) ]. Although stacking of the two hairpins is weak, <b>nogalamycin</b> is shown to bind and stabilise a 1 : 1 complex by binding at the intercalation site.

The pyrindamycins bind via non-covalent interactions in the minor groove of DNA with subsequent alkylation of the N 3 of adenine (particularly within 52 ̆ 7 -AAA and 52 ̆ 7 - TTA sequences). The relative stability of adducts with different oligonucleotides can be inferred from the ESI mass spectra. M S / M S spectra of alkylated adducts enable facile identification of the site of alkylation. W e show here that the site(s) of alkylation by the pyrindamycins are strongly influenced by {{the location of the}} preferred high affinity binding sites within these short oligonucleotides. Alkylation of guanine by pyrindamycin A is shown to occur only upon binding to single-stranded oligonucleotides, providing further confirmation {{of the importance of the}} initial non-covalent interaction in conferring sequence selectivity. These data clearly demonstrate value of using ESI-MS/MS to prescreen ligand-oligonucleotide complexes prior to performing more detailed structural studies. In the second part of this work, the binding of <b>nogalamycin</b> to unusual DNA structures was explored by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The first of these was an oligonucleotide 52 ̆ 7 -d(GCGAAGCACGAAGT) - 32 ̆ 7, which was designed to form a double hairpin or loop sequence. T w o further oligonucleotides, 52 ̆ 7 -d(GTGCGAAGCTAC) - 32 ̆ 7 and 52 ̆ 7 -d(GCTACGAAGTGC) - 32 ̆ 7 were designed to incorporate a mispaired thymine, which may then form a bulge. The folding of the hairpins was evidenced by anomalous chemical shift values for the sugar H 42 ̆ 7, H 52 ̆ 7 and H 52 ̆ 2 protons (characteristic of the adenine involved in the loop) and the presence of imino protons (protected from exchange by hydrogen bonding interactions in the stem). <b>Nogalamycin</b> formed 1 : 1 complexes with each of the oligonucleotides with the ligand bound at the TpG step. Upon ligand binding, changes in chemical shift values for the DNA resonances were observed, with the largest differences noted for the nucleotides in the intercalation site. <b>Nogalamycin</b> bound to 52 ̆ 7 -d(GCGAAGCACGAAGT) - 32 ̆ 7 at the nicked site and stabilised the double hairpin structure through co-axial stacking interactions. The intercalation of <b>nogalamycin</b> to 52 ̆ 7 -d(GTGCGAAGCTAC) - 32 ̆ 7 gave rise to an equilibrium in solution between a frame-shifted conformation and bulged conformation. The binding of <b>nogalamycin</b> to 52 ̆ 7 -d(GCTACGAAGTGC) - 32 ̆ 7 stabilised the bulge positioned at T 3.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Mithramycin, <b>nogalamycin</b> and aclacinomycins are {{aromatic}} polyketide antibiotics that exhibit antitumour activity. The precursors {{of these}} antibiotics are formed via a polyketide biosynthetic pathway in which acetate (for mithramycinone and nogalamycinone) or propionate (for aklavinone) {{is used as}} a starter unit and nine acetates are used as extender units. The assembly of building blocks is catalyzed by the minimal polyketide synthase (PKS). Further steps include regiospecific reductions (if any) and cyclization. In the biosynthesis of mithramycin, however, ketoreduction is omitted and the regiospecificity of the first cyclization differs from that of anthracycline antibiotics (e. g. <b>nogalamycin</b> and aclacinomycins). These significant differences provide a convenient means to analyze the determinants for the regiospecificity of the first cyclization step. Results: In order to analyze a possible role of the minimal PKS in the regiospecificity of the first cyclization in polyketide biosynthesis, we expressed the mtm locus, which includes mithramycin minimal PKS genes, in Streptomyces galilaeus, which normally makes aclacinomycins, and the sno locus, which includes <b>nogalamycin</b> minimal PKS genes, in Streptomyces argillaceus, which normally makes mithramycin. The host strains are defective in the minimal PKS, but they express other antibiotic biosynthesis genes. Expression of the sno minimal PKS in the S. argillaceus polyketide-deficient strain generated mithramycin production. Auramycins, instead of aclacinomycins, accumulated in the recombinant S. galilaeus strains, suggesting that the mithramycin minimal PKS is responsible for the choice of starter unit. We also describe structural analysis of the compounds accumulated by a ketoreductase-deficient S. galilaeus mutant; spectroscopic studies on the major polyketide compound that accumulated revealed a first ring closure which is not typical of anthracyclines, suggesting an important role for the ketoreductase in the regiospecificity of the first cyclization. Conclusions: These experiments cleary support the involvement of ketoreductase and a cyclase in the regiospecific cyclization of the biosynthetic pathway for aromatic polyketides...|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} between a novel antitumor drug <b>nogalamycin</b> with the self-complementary DNA hexamer d(CGTACG) {{have been studied}} by 500 MHz two dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. When two nogalamycins are mixed with the DNA hexamer duplex in a 2 : 1 ratio, a symmetrical complex is formed. All non-exchangeable proton resonances (except H 5 ' & H 5 ") of this complex have been assigned using 2 D-COSY and 2 D-NOESY methods at pH 7. 0. The observed NOE cross peaks are fully consistent with the 1. 3 A resolution x-ray crystal structure (Liaw et al., Biochemistry 28, 9913 - 9918, 1989) in which the elongated aglycone chromophore is intercalated between the CpG steps {{at both ends of}} the helix. The aglycone chromophore spans across the GC Watson-Crick base pairs with its nogalose lying in the minor groove and the aminoglucose lying in the major groove of the distorted B-DNA double helix. The binding conformation suggests that specific hydrogen bonds exist in the complex between the drug and guanine-cytosine bases in both grooves of the helix. When only one drug per DNA duplex is present in solution, there are three molecular species (free DNA, 1 : 1 complex and 2 : 1 complex) in slow exchange on the NMR time scale. This equilibrium is temperature dependent. At high temperature the free DNA hexamer duplex and the 1 : 1 complex are completely destabilized such that at 65 degrees C only free single-stranded DNA and the 2 : 1 complex co-exist. At 35 degrees C the equilibrium between free DNA and the 1 : 1 complex is relatively fast, while that between the 1 : 1 complex and the 2 : 1 complex is slow. This may be rationalized by the fact that the binding of <b>nogalamycin</b> to DNA requires that the base pairs in DNA open up transiently to allow the bulky sugars to go through.

40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} {{has been used}} to study the non-covalent interactions between Tus and TerB. The Tus-Ter complex was very stable using a spray solvent of 10 m M ammonium acetate at pH 8. Initial attempts to distinguish binding affinities of Tus and mutant Tus proteins for Ter DNA were unsuccessful. Increasing the ammonium acetate concentration in the elctrospray solvent (800 mM) increased the dissociation constants sufficiently such that relative orders of binding affinities for Tus and various mutant Tus proteins for various DNA sequences could be determined. A dissociation constant of 700 x 10 - 9 M for the binding of the mutant Tus protein A 173 T (where residue 173 is changed from alanine to threonine) or TerDNA was estimated, compared with a value of ≤ 2 x 10 - 9 M for Tus where A 173 T was unchanged. These results were in agreement with solution studies and are the first example in which ESI-MS {{has been used to}} compare binding affinities for a DNA-binding protein with mutant proteins for specific D N A recognition sequences. Overall, this work demonstrates that ESI is a powerful technique for the observation of non-covalent DNA-drug and DNA-protein interactions. In the second part of this work, the use of ESI-MS for studying the non-covalent interactions between the anti-tumor drugs daunomycin and <b>nogalamycin</b> to duplex DNA. Ions corresponding to the complex were most abundant relative to free DNA when prepared in the pH range 8 - 9 and acquired using gentle ESI-MS conditions on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Titration experiments gave ESI-mass spectra in which the most intense ions correspond to three molecules of <b>nogalamycin</b> or 4 molecules of daunomycin dound to the duplex 8 mers (d(CGGCGCCG) 2 and d(GGCTAGCC) 2) and 4 molecules of <b>nogalamycin</b> or 6 molecules of daunomycin bound to the duplex 12 mer (d(TGAGCTAGCTCA) 2). These data are consistent with the neighbour exclusion principle. Competition experiments involving a single drug in an equimolar mixture of two oligonucleotides (d(TGAGCTAGCTCA) 2 with either d(CGGCGCCG) 2 or d(GGCTAGCC) 2) showed that the intercalators bound preferentially to d(CGGCGCCG) 2 compared to d(GGCTAGCC) 2 relative to the 12 mer. This shows that ESI-MS has the potential to detect differences in sequence selectivity. ESI-mass spectra from experiments in which both drugs were reacted with the same oligonucleotide were more complicated and as such, a clear preference for one drug could not be established. Similar studies were done using longer 16 mer self-complementary oligonucleotides (d(ATATATATATATATAT) 2, d(ATATATACGTATATAT) 2 and d(CCATATACGTATATGG) 2). These data showed only small amounts of dsDNA-drug complex. Most ions observed were from single stranded oligonucleotides complexed to drug. Non-self-complementary oligonucleotides were subsequently used to avoid ambiguities in assigning dsDNA-drug peaks. Extensions of these studies using a quadrupole-time-of-flight instrument, showed no evidence of these non-specific single stranded DNA-drug complexes. Different CID experiments (cone voltage, capillary voltage, desolvation temperature and collision energy) all showed that the order of binding of the intercalators was ethidium 3 ̆enogalamycin 3 ̆edaunomycin. Preliminary results on the observation of the retamycin-dsDNA complex were also presented...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{bacterial}} artificial chromosomal {{library of}} Planobispora rosea, a genetically intractable actinomycete strain, was constructed using Escherichia coli-Streptomyces artificial chromosome (ESAC) and screened {{for the presence}} of genes known {{to be involved in the}} biosynthesis of antibiotics. Results: One clone with a 40 kb insert showed antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria. Insert sequence analysis and subcloning experiments revealed that the bioactivity was due to a 3. 5 kb DNA fragment containing two open reading frames. These orfs encode two proteins with high similarity to a putative membrane protein of Streptomyces coelicolor and to the <b>nogalamycin</b> resistance protein SnorO of Streptomyces nogalater, respectively. The role of these two Orfs is unknown in Planobispora. Disruption and complementation experiments revealed that both proteins are necessary for the antibacterial activity and chemical analysis demonstrated that the antibiotic activity was due to thiostrepton, antibiotic used as recombinant clone selection marker.

40|$|SnoaL {{belongs to}} a family of small polyketide cyclases, which {{catalyse}} ring closure steps in the biosynthesis of polyketide antibiotics produced in Streptomyces. Several of these antibiotics {{are among the most}} used anti-cancer drugs currently in use. The crystal structure of SnoaL, involved in <b>nogalamycin</b> biosynthesis, with a bound product, has been determined to 1. 35 Å resolution. The fold of the subunit can be described as a distorted α+β barrel, and the ligand is bound in the hydrophobic interior of the barrel. The 3 D structure and site-directed mutagenesis experiments reveal that the mechanism of the intramolecular aldol condensation catalysed by SnoaL is {{different from that of the}} classical aldolases, which employ covalent Schiff base formation or a metal ion cofactor. The invariant residue Asp 121 acts as an acid/base catalyst during the reaction. Stabilisation of the enol(ate) intermediate is mainly achieved by the delocalisation of the electron pair over the extended π system of the substrate. These polyketide cyclases thus form of family of enzymes with a unique catalytic strategy for aldol condensation...|$|E

40|$|Plasmodium falciparum has {{developed}} resistance to most anti-malarials; therefore, {{an investigation of}} potential targets should be performed. DNA helicases are enzymes that catalyse the unwinding of double-stranded DNA to provide single-stranded templates for DNA replication, repair and recombination. In this study, a DNA helicase (PfDH A) was purified from a crude extract of Plasmodium falciparum. DNA helicase activity was measured by assaying unwinding activity. The apparent molecular weight of PfDH A as determined by SDS-PAGE was 90 kDa. PfDH A moved unidirectionally in the 3 ' -to- 5 ' direction along the bound strand and preferred a fork-like substrate structure and could not unwind blunt-ended duplex DNA. Unwinding activity required Mg 2 + and could be inhibited by 200 mM NaCl or KCl and was dependent on hydrolysis of ATP or dATP. Anthracyclines, including daunorubicin, <b>nogalamycin,</b> doxorubicin, and aclarubicin, inhibited PfDH A activity with IC 50 values of 2, 5, 8 and 9 5 M, respectively. Based on the results, PfDH A differs from all known human DNA helicases. However, its function and roles in parasite DNA replication need to be elucidated in the future...|$|E
40|$|Four {{well-characterised}} DNA-binding ligands {{have been}} tested for effects on reconstituted nucleosome core particles containing the 160 bp tyrT DNA fragment. Two, netropsin and berenil, were found to change the rotational orientation of the DNA {{on the surface of}} the protein as judged by marked alterations in the pattern of fragments produced by exposure to DNAase I. Qualitatively their effects were very similar to those previously reported for the related antibiotic distamycin, suggesting that the phenomenon of induced rotation may be a characteristic property of ligands which bind in the narrow groove of the DNA helix. Two intercalators did not produce the effect but, at high concentrations, caused gross disruption of the nucleoprotein structure with apparent release of DNA from the histone octamer. At moderate concentrations little or no effect was detectable with <b>nogalamycin,</b> suggestive of failure to bind as a result of constraints on local opening of the DNA helix. With moderate concentrations of actinomycin, protection of GpC sequences was clearly visible together with some evidence of increase in helix pitch, but no sign of altered phasing of DNA within the nucleosome core particles...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposition}} that the 2 -amino group of guanine plays {{a critical role in}} determining how antibiotics recognise their binding sites in DNA has been tested by relocating it, using tyrT DNA derivative molecules substituted with inosine plus 2, 6 -diaminopurine (DAP). Irrespective of their mode of interaction with DNA, such GC-specific antibiotics as actinomycin, echinomycin, mithramycin and chromomycin find new binding sites associated with DAP-containing sequences and are excluded from former canonical sites containing I. C base pairs. The converse is found to be the case for a group of normally AT-selective ligands which bind in the minor groove of the helix, such as netropsin: their preferred sites become shifted to IC-rich clusters. Thus the binding sites of all these antibiotics strictly follow the placement of the purine 2 -amino group, which accordingly must serve as both a positive and negative effector. The footprinting profile of the 'threading' intercalator <b>nogalamycin</b> is potentiated in DAP plus inosine-substituted DNA but otherwise remains much the same as seen with natural DNA. The interaction of echinomycin with sites containing the TpDAP step in doubly substituted DNA appears much stronger than its interaction with CpG-containing sites in natural DNA...|$|E
