A 1979 study examined the stomach contents of all fishers trapped in the state of New Hampshire; cat hairs were found in only 1 of over 1,000 stomachs. More recent studies in suburban upstate New York and Massachusetts found <b>no</b> <b>cat</b> remains in 24 and 226 fisher diet samples (scat and stomach contents) respectively. While there is popular belief for more frequent attacks on pets, zoologists suggest bobcats or coyotes are more likely to prey upon domestic cats and chickens.|$|E

40|$|Autor objavljuje jednu stelu vrlo loše očuvanog natpisa, ulomak sarkofaga, 12 ulomaka stela i ulomke dvaju natpisa kojima je nemoguće odrediti karakter. Cjelovita stela iz Žrnovnice nosi gentilicij Septimius, jedan ulomak stele očuvao je gentilicij Iulius, a drugi ulomak stele ima prenomen Gaius. Dio ostalih ulomaka sačuvao je samo ostatke gentilicija i kognomena koje se pokušalo restituirati prema epigrafski posvjedočenim primjerima iz provincije Dalmacije. Slaba očuvanost velike većine natpisa onemogućila je uže datiranje pa tako samo ulomak stele može biti smješten u 1. stoljeće, a ostali u različite periode između 1. i 3. odnosno 4. stoljeća. In {{the paper}} {{published}} are 15 fragments of inscriptions from Salona and of one stela from Žrnovnica. In two fragments (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 14, 15) preserved are one letter in each {{making it hard}} to establish what sort of inscriptions they belonged to. The other 14 inscriptions are of sepulchral character: a sarcophagus fragment (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 13), a whole stela with almost totally illegible inscription (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 9), 12 stela fragments with partial inscriptions (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 1 - 12), and a stela fragment with <b>no</b> preserved inscription (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 16). Significant damages to the inscriptions have made any reliable restitution impossible, completely preserved being only the gentilicium Iulius (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 6) and Septimius (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 9), and the praenomen Gaius (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 8). Other fragments contain preserved just parts of the gentilicia and cognomina, restitutions of which have been attempted in accordance with other known inscriptions from the province of Dalmatia. Names {{from other parts of the}} Empire were not taken into consideration because that would have taken too much room and time, and would have produced no result. At the stela fragment (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 3) most probably inscribed was the gentilicium Sempronius, and if it was followed by a cognomen, at least four of these would be possible. At the stela fragment (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 1) most probably preserved is the final part of the gentilicium Antonius, although Nertonius and Catonius are possible as well. The stela fragment (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 2) could have contained the gentilicium Trosius or Sos(s) ius. In the case of the stela fragment (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 7) possible are at least five cognomina. In the first letters COLL- at the stela fragment (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 6) may make name of an association or the gentilicium Collius, or this is mentioning of the deceased or the commemorator (collegae). To the 1 st century with certainty is dated only the stela fragment (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 11), others being dated much wider: between the 1 st and the 3 rd centuries (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 7, 12, 14, 15), to the 2 nd or the 3 rd centuries (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 2, 4, 5, 8), to the late Principate period (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 16), and from the late 2 nd to the 4 th centuries (<b>cat.</b> <b>no.</b> 13) ...|$|R

60|$|THEOSOPHY, n. An ancient faith {{having all}} the certitude of {{religion}} and all the mystery of science. The modern Theosophist holds, with the Buddhists, that we live an incalculable number of times on this earth, in as many several bodies, because one life is not long enough for our complete spiritual development; that is, a single lifetime does not suffice for us to become as wise and good as we choose to wish to become. To be absolutely wise and good--that is perfection; and the Theosophist is so keen-sighted as to have observed that everything desirous of improvement eventually attains perfection. Less competent observers are disposed to except cats, which seem neither wiser nor better than they were last year.
