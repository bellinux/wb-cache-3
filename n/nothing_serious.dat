5|$|Military bases {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} call the Army Control Station in Hiroshima. The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time. A young officer was instructed to fly immediately to Hiroshima, to land, survey the damage, and return to Tokyo with reliable information for the staff. It was felt that <b>nothing</b> <b>serious</b> had taken place and that the explosion was just a rumor.|$|E
25|$|After {{learning}} {{their best}} man and bridesmaid cannot {{make it to}} their wedding, Sonya Mitchell and Toadfish Rebecchi are relieved when their friends Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) and Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) step in. Sonya wonders if it will be weird using stand-ins on such an important day, but Toadie assures her {{that it will be}} fine. He also mentions that he is starting to feel relieved that <b>nothing</b> <b>serious</b> has gone wrong. Just as they discuss their honeymoon, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) calls round to tell the couple that the ballroom at Lassister's Hotel has raw sewage running through it and the kitchen is out of order. Toadie asks Paul how they can have the reception there and Paul tells them that he has arranged a marquee for them in the hotel's grounds. He will also give them the use of a suite for the day, as a gesture of good will. After Paul leaves, Sonya tries to calm Toadie down.|$|E
25|$|Asafa {{opened his}} 2011 season on 16 April at the National Stadium in Kingston, Jamaica. He ran the 200m {{where he came}} in third after {{what looked to be}} a good first 140m, slowing down {{significantly}} at {{the last quarter of the}} race. His time was 20.55s for the race behind Yohan Blake and Daniel Bailey. Powell ran his next race was the 4x100m relay USA vs The World at the Penn Relays 2011, on 28 April. He ran the unusual first leg for Jamaica as he blasted off like a bullet to give Jamaica the lead. Jamaica won the event in a world leading time of 38.33s, ahead of USA Red and USA Blue teams respectively. He stated after the run that he was in good shape and was looking forward to do great things in the year ahead. Powell next ran the 200m at the Jamaica International Invitational Meet on 7 May. He looked promising in the first 120m, after which he slowed down drastically, finishing in last place with a time of 21.40s, in a race won by Jamaican Nickel Ashmeade. He later stated that he felt a minor pain in his hamstring and he backed off as a precaution, but insisted that it was <b>nothing</b> <b>serious.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} {{meeting of the}} 2011 IAAF Diamond League at Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, Powell won the 100m {{with a time of}} 9.95 seconds. Powell next ran at the IAAF Diamond League in Rome against Usain Bolt on 26 May. Powell had a superb start and mid but he faded towards the end, only to allow the world record holder to surpass him in the final 10–12m of the race. Bolt won in 9.91s and Powell came second in 9.93s. He said that he had lost focus, but is {{confident}} about beating Usain after what he had done that day. Powell next competed in the IAAF World Challenge in Rabat, Morocco, in a low key meet. There, after running the first 20m, he pulled up and finished last in 36.13s, citing a precaution against a serious hamstring injury. Reports said that it was <b>nothing</b> <b>serious</b> and he would be ready for the Jamaican Trials later in the month. At the Jamaican Trials 23–24 July, Powell looked impressive as he qualified through the rounds. He posted a season best of 9.90s in his semi-final, despite easing off in the final 15m. Later, after overcoming a bad start, Powell won the final to be titled National Champion for the fifth time in his career. He won in a time of 10.08s into a 1.8m/s headwind. Yohan Blake and Steve Mullings were second and third respectively with 0.01s separating them.|$|E

So, you know, people are just kicking it around like that." [...] Actor Bob Balaban, who portrayed NBC executive Warren Littlefield in The Late Shift {{said he would like}} to portray Jeff Zucker, and said Jason Alexander would also be a good choice to play Zucker. Andy Richter jokingly told Movieline that he would want Justin Bieber to portray him in a film adaptation of the book.|$|E

500|$|On April 5, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted that The Path to Prosperity was [...] "a path {{to poverty}} for America's seniors and children". On April 13, 2011, {{speaking}} of Ryan's budget proposal, Obama said: [...] "I don't think there's anything courageous about asking for sacrifice {{from those who}} can least afford it. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>serious</b> about a plan that claims {{to reduce the deficit}} by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires." [...] The House passed the Ryan plan on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235–193. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against it. On an April 27, 2011, conference call with reporters Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that passage of the Ryan plan [...] "would be {{one of the worst things}} to happen to this country". On May 25, 2011, the Ryan budget plan was defeated in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is like watching a dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that <b>nothing</b> <b>serious</b> would come from it.|$|E

2500|$|During 2001, Stjärnström and Hellmer, {{together}} with friend Tomi Tauriainen formed the short-lived punk rock side-project, FLAK.

2500|$|The California Street (Line 61) line runs {{east and}} west on California Street from a {{terminal}} at California and Market Streets, close to the famed Embarcadero to Van Ness Avenue. The California street cable-cars use double-ended cars with [...] "grip" [...] levers {{at either end of}} the longer cars which are operated in each direction without the cars being turned at the ends of the line, where the double tracks converge into a single [...] "stub-end" [...] track. The line once ran a much longer distance from Presidio Avenue to Market Street but service west of Van Ness Avenue was discontinued in 1954. Calls to restore the route to its original length are heard from time to time but <b>nothing</b> <b>serious</b> towards this end has been proposed. This route runs only on California Street, running at first uphill to the summit of Nob Hill, then more gently downhill to a terminus at Van Ness Avenue. This line is used to a greater extent by commuters, with majority of passengers on weekdays being commuters.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, O'Neal reiterated {{his belief}} that Bryant {{deserved}} the MVP award. Bryant {{went on to win}} the award for the first time in his career that season. During the offseason, O'Neal was at a party, and got up to rap in front of the crowd. O'Neal mentioned Bryant multiple times in the rap, saying that [...] "Kobe couldn't do it without me", referring to Bryant and the Lakers loss in the 2008 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics. He also rapped, [...] "Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes". During the rap, O'Neal also blamed his divorce on Bryant's comments to investigators in 2004 about O'Neal paying off women. Bryant commented that he [...] "didn't take (O'Neal's rap) any kind of way whatsoever." [...] O'Neal later said he was freestyling and that [...] "it was all done in fun. <b>Nothing</b> <b>serious</b> whatsoever ... I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all."

2500|$|When the Lakers {{faced the}} Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made {{headlines}} {{by engaging in}} handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify {{the end of the}} so-called [...] "Bryant–O'Neal feud" [...] that had festered since the center left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant. However, on June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant {{for not being able to}} win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times [...] "Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes." [...] O'Neal justified his act by saying [...] "I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. <b>Nothing</b> <b>serious</b> whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all." [...] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal, Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to [...] "use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language".
