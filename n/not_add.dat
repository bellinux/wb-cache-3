5|$|Modern {{commentators}} of Thucydides, {{with other}} modern historians and writers, take varying stances {{on the issue}} of how much of the speeches of Pericles, as given by this historian, do actually represent Pericles' own words and how much of them is free literary creation or paraphrase by Thucydides. Since Pericles never wrote down or distributed his orations, no historians are able to answer this with certainty; Thucydides recreated three of them from memory and, thereby, it cannot be ascertained that he did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> his own notions and thoughts.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 1919, President João do Canto e Castro {{granted the}} town {{the title of}} Dame of the Military Order of the Tower and of the Sword, of Valour, Loyalty and Merit (Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada do Valor, Lealdade e Mérito). Unlike other places {{similarly}} honoured, Caldas did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> the honour's collar to its coat of arms. The town was elevated {{to the status of}} city (cidade) in August 1927.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would <b>not</b> <b>add</b> more than 5GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5GB of additional free space without having to wait for the TRIM command to come from the OS.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who swapped {{computer}} disks to make edits. They stuck to a rule whereby they could <b>not</b> <b>add</b> back material the other had removed. The script was collaboratively edited by the cast members of Blackadder Goes Forth during read-throughs. Elton was primarily responsible for the sequence in which Blackadder explains how the First World War started; the running gag of Baldrick using mud and bodily fluids to make coffee throughout the episode was greatly expanded during rehearsals.|$|E
5|$|Viva el Príncipe {{received}} a positive review from David Jeffries of Allmusic praising Botija's production and Castro's vocal delivery. It earned a negative review from {{an editor of}} Terra Networks who felt that the album did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> anything to the originals. The album {{received a}} nomination for a Latin Grammy, two Billboard Latin Music Awards nominations, and an Oye! award. The success led to a 2011 release of more José José songs titled Mi Amigo El Príncipe.|$|E
5|$|Although the RAF claimed six Italian {{aircraft}} {{destroyed and}} two probables, including Cullen's, on 20February, Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the 361a Squadriglia as shot down, killing the pilot, and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of 395a Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat. On 23February, Cullen attacked a CANT Z.506 three-engined floatplane {{as it was}} taking off at Preveza in Greece, at first simply attempting {{to prevent it from}} getting airborne but then, when it refused to stop, destroying it on a second pass. The result did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> to his official score, however, as the Italian plane was not in full flight {{at the time of its}} destruction.|$|E

5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more sensitive about the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E
5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature {{had been present}} during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010 United States Census, Utica's {{population}} was 62,235. Sixty-ninepercent of the {{population was}} European American (of which 64.5percent was non-Hispanic white), 15.3percent was African American, and 0.3percent was American Indian or Alaska Native.

5|$|The Delmar Bypass {{was opened}} in December 1963, {{connecting}} Elm Avenue {{in the west}} to U.S. Route9W in the east. The state did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> traffic lights to any of the four intersections on the bypass as a late 1963 study indicated that the signals were unnecessary. In mid-January 1964, the Bethlehem Town Board pushed the state to add traffic lights to every intersection in the wake of several accidents and near-misses at the crossings. This request was eventually granted. The Delmar Bypass did not have a signed route number until the 1970s when NY32 was realigned to follow the highway. As a result, NY335 no longer connected to a signed route at its south end.|$|E
5|$|With that, the Yuan dynasty, {{established}} by Genghis Khan's grandson Khublai Khan, {{became the first}} foreign dynasty to rule all of China. Despite being {{the head of the}} Mongol Empire, Khublai Khan's rule over China was not free from the threat of the steppe nomads. The Yuan dynasty faced challenges from rival claimants to the title of Great Khan and from rebellious Mongols in the north. Khublai Khan dealt with such threats by using both military blockades and economic sanctions. Although he established garrisons along the steppe frontier from the Juyan Lake Basin in the far west to Yingchang in the east, Khublai Khan and the Yuan emperors after him did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> to the Great Wall (except for the ornate Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass). When the Venetian traveller Marco Polo wrote of his experiences in China during the reign of Khublai Khan, he did not mention a Great Wall.|$|E
5|$|Late on {{the third}} day, Toshack {{was part of a}} rearguard Australian action that minimised England's first innings lead. He came to the crease at 9/403 to {{accompany}} Lindwall, featuring in a 55-run stand and lasting the final 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get Toshack on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so that he faced most of the balls. On the next morning of play, Toshack did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> to his score before Lindwall was dismissed and Australia ended at 458 in the third over of the day, leaving the tourists 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Toshack did not bowl in the second innings as England made 8/365 and set Australia a target of 404 for victory on the last day. Australia achieved the runs with seven wickets in hand, setting a new world record for the highest successful run-chase in Tests.|$|E

5|$|Yardley {{continued}} {{to employ a}} leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then {{put his hands on}} his hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did <b>not</b> <b>add</b> a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he cover drove Bedser to reach his century in 218 minutes. It was his 28th Test century, and his 18th in Ashes Tests. The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, and it was one of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After Bradman had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen.|$|E
