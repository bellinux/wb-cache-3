25|$|A <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier,</b> or more {{commonly}} simply a feedback amplifier, is an amplifier which uses negative feedback {{to improve performance}} and reduce sensitivity to parameter variations due to manufacturing or environmental uncertainties. It was invented by Harold Stephen Black in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Feedback is used {{to better}} match signal sources to their loads. For example, a direct {{connection}} of a voltage source to a resistive load may result in signal loss due to voltage division, but interjecting a <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> can increase the apparent load seen by the source, and reduce the apparent driver impedance seen by the load, avoiding signal attenuation by voltage division. This advantage is not restricted to voltage amplifiers, but analogous improvements in matching can be arranged for current amplifiers, transconductance amplifiers and transresistance amplifiers.|$|E

The achieved results show that under the maximum flat group delay conditions, {{it is possible to}} reach 100 % bandwidth improvement for the closed loop case, when compared to the non-delayed case...|$|R
2500|$|This section {{describes}} the step response {{of a simple}} <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> shown in Figure 1. The feedback amplifier consists of a main open-loop amplifier of gain AOL and a feedback loop governed by a feedback factor β. This feedback amplifier is analyzed to determine how its step response depends upon [...] the time constants governing {{the response of the}} main amplifier, and upon the amount of feedback used.|$|E
2500|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1855, {{two years before}} Cauchy's death, he discussed some theorems, {{one of which is}} similar to the [...] "Argument Principle" [...] in many modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks, the Cauchy argument principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist stability criterion, which can be used to predict the stability of <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> and negative feedback control systems. Thus Cauchy's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.|$|E
2500|$|During Trapp's quarter-century tenure, {{the church}} grew considerably, drawing many members from Bell Labs. [...] Among these were Harold Black, {{inventor}} of the <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and James William Welsh. [...] To accommodate the many new members {{and the need for}} religious education classes, the church instituted two services on Sunday mornings and bought an additional property to house the religious education program. [...] Trapp was a voice of conscience in a conservative time, working with local civil rights leaders to integrate Summit's movie theater and YMCA.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to improve the}} GBW (gain-bandwidth product) on <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> The proposed method {{is based on the}} introduction of time-delay elements in the feedback loop, which can be exploited to retrieve significant bandwidth enhancements. This delayed feedback concept is analyzed, and considerations are presented for first-order amplifiers, based on theoretical analysis. The concept is simulated and further demonstrated in a practical example using a series-shunt <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> with a TL 081 operational amplifier (OA) and a 36 -m-long coaxial cable as a delay element. Measured experimental results show a maximum bandwidth improvement of almost 90 %, from a theoretical maximum of 141 %. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Structured {{design has}} raised as an {{alternative}} to the traditional and design approach. In the structured design, the process starts by establishing the ideal solution, which obviously fulfills a set of specifications. Hereafter, the design procedure consists in achieving a series of modifications to the ideal solution until the specs are met. One of the key topics in the design of amplifiers is to reach a desired bandwidth (BW). This work focuses on the automation of BW design for <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifiers</b> through the synthesis of the nullor with active devices based on the guidelines provided by structured design.

2500|$|A Negative {{feedback}} {{occurs when}} the fed-back output signal has a relative phase of 180° {{with respect to the}} input signal (upside down). This situation is sometimes referred to as being out of phase, but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations, as in [...] "90° out of phase". Negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations. In feedback amplifiers, this correction is generally for waveform distortion reduction or to establish a specified gain level. A general expression for the gain of a <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> is the asymptotic gain model.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{amplification}} stage, vacuum-tube electronics remain popular, despite {{most other}} applications having since abandoned tubes for solid state amplifiers. Also vacuum-tube amplifiers often have higher total harmonic distortion, require rebiasing, are less reliable, generate more heat, are less powerful, and cost more. [...] There is also continuing {{debate about the}} proper use of <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> in <b>amplifier</b> design.|$|R
5000|$|The {{asymptotic}} gain model (also {{known as}} the Rosenstark method) is {{a representation of the}} gain of <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifiers</b> given by the asymptotic gain relation:where [...] is the return ratio with the input source disabled (equal to the negative of the loop gain {{in the case of a}} single-loop system composed of unilateral blocks), G∞ is the asymptotic gain and G0 is the direct transmission term. This form for the gain can provide intuitive insight into the circuit and often is easier to derive than a direct attack on the gain.Figure 1 shows a block diagram that leads to the asymptotic gain expression. The asymptotic gain relation also can be expressed as a signal flow graph. See Figure 2. The asymptotic gain model is a special case of the extra element theorem.|$|R

5000|$|Fifty {{years after}} his 1927 invention, he {{published}} an article in IEEE Spectrum regarding the historical background of his invention. He published a classical paper on <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> in 1934, which has been re-printed in the Proceedings of IEEE two times in 1984 and 1999 Inside his 1934 classical paper [...] "Stabilized feed-back amplifiers", he mentioned Harry Nyquist's work on stability criterion because a <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be unstable and oscillate. Thus, {{with the help of}} Nyquist's theory, he managed to demonstrate a stable <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> which can be used in reality. Bernard Friedland wrote an introduction for the 1999 re-print in Proc. IEEE. James E.

50|$|Thus, high {{damping factor}} values do not, by themselves, say {{very much about}} the quality of a system; most modern {{amplifiers}} have them, but vary in quality nonetheless. Given the controversy that has long surrounded the use of feedback, some extend their distaste for <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> (NFB) <b>amplifier</b> designs (and so a high damping factor) as a mark of poor quality. For them, such high values imply a high level of NFB in the amplifier.|$|R

50|$|After {{years of}} work Black invented the <b>{{negative}}</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> which uses negative feedback to reduce the gain of a high-gain, non-linear amplifier and makes it act as a low-gain, linear amplifier with much lower noise and distortion. The <b>Negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> allowed Bell system to reduce overcrowding of lines and extend its long-distance network by means of carrier telephony. It enabled the design of accurate fire-control systems in World War II, and it {{formed the basis of}} early operational amplifiers, as well as precise, variable-frequency audio oscillators.|$|E
50|$|Harold Stephen Black (April 14, 1898 - December 11, 1983) was an American {{electrical}} engineer, who {{revolutionized the}} field of applied electronics by inventing the <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> in 1927. To some, his invention is considered the most important breakthrough {{of the twentieth century}} in {{the field of}} electronics, since it has a wide area of application. This is because all electronic devices (vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors and MOS transistors) are inherently nonlinear, but they can be made substantially linear with the application of negative feedback. Negative feedback works by sacrificing gain for higher linearity (or in other words, smaller distortion/intermodulation). By sacrificing gain, it also has an additional effect of increasing the bandwidth of the amplifier. However, a <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be unstable such that it may oscillate. Once the stability problem is solved, the <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> is extremely useful in the field of electronics. Black published a famous paper, Stabilized feedback amplifiers, in 1934.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary {{cybernetics}} {{began as}} an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems, electrical network theory, mechanical engineering, logic modeling, evolutionary biology and neuroscience in the 1940s; the ideas are also related to the biological work of Ludwig von Bertalanffy in General Systems Theory. Electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of Bell Telephone Laboratories engineer Harold S. Black on using <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> to control <b>amplifiers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{was invented}} by Harold Stephen Black at Bell Laboratories in 1927, and granted a patent in 1937 (US Patent 2,102,671 [...] "a {{continuation}} of application Serial No. 298,155, filed August 8, 1928 ...").|$|E
5000|$|Typically the {{open-loop}} {{phase lag}} (relative to input) varies with frequency, progressively increasing to exceed 180°, at which frequency the output signal becomes inverted, or antiphase {{in relation to}} the input. The PM will be positive but decreasing at frequencies less than the frequency at which inversion sets in (at which PM = 0), and PM is negative (PM < 0) at higher frequencies. In the presence of <b>negative</b> <b>feedback,</b> a zero or negative PM at a frequency where the loop gain exceeds unity (1) guarantees instability. Thus positive PM is a [...] "safety margin" [...] that ensures proper (non-oscillatory) operation of the circuit. This applies to amplifier circuits as well as more generally, to active filters, under various load conditions (e.g. reactive loads). In its simplest form, involving ideal <b>negative</b> <b>feedback</b> voltage <b>amplifiers</b> with non-reactive <b>feedback,</b> the phase margin is measured at the frequency where the open-loop voltage gain of the amplifier equals the desired closed-loop DC voltage gain.|$|R
