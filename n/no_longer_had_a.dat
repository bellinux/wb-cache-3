5|$|The Johns Hopkins Science Review, a DuMont {{public affairs}} program, {{was awarded a}} Peabody Award in 1952 in the Education category. Sheen's Emmy and the Science Review Peabody were the only {{national}} awards the DuMont Network received. Though DuMont series and performers continued to win local TV awards, by the mid-1950s the DuMont network <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> national presence.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimate}} power officially rested {{with the}} country's {{government in the}} form of Sovnarkom and the Executive Committee (VTSIK) elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (ARCS), the Communist Party was de facto in control in Russia, as acknowledged by its members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> role in governing Russia. During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the soviets. Russia had become a one-party state.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany had at its {{disposal}} fifty {{divisions in}} France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway. Fifteen divisions {{were in the process}} of formation in Germany. Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the Eastern Front, meant that the Germans <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pool of able young men from which to draw. German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were Ostlegionen (eastern legions)– conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union. They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport. Many German units were under strength.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the morning}} of June21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15mi (20km) south-southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico. Centered just {{off the coast of}} Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening. Hours later, {{convection}} rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system's structure, the NHC downgraded Beatriz to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on Beatriz. The storm's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175mi (280km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1968, No.79 Squadron <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> clear role at Ubon. The USAF had {{sufficient}} fighters based in Thailand {{to defend the}} country and was reluctant to use the Australian fighters—which were now regarded as obsolete—to intercept potentially hostile aircraft, as the squadron's rules of engagement did not allow it to pursue contacts that left Thai airspace. As a result, the Australian military's chiefs of staff determined that the RAAF presence in Thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw the squadron without replacement. No.79 Squadron was taken off alert status on 26July and disbanded {{at the end of}} the month. On 31March 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to Ubon between May 1962 and August 1968.|$|E
5|$|Within an {{environment}} characterized by low wind shear, high atmospheric humidity, and warm sea surface temperatures, Earl intensified, reaching a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) by 0600UTC on August15. Initial forecasts from the National Hurricane Center depicted gradual intensification into a powerful hurricane {{as the system}} entered the central Caribbean Sea, but these forecasts were lowered in later advisories. Despite an impressive satellite presentation associated with Earl as it passed through the southern Leeward Islands, a hurricane hunter flight reported that the system <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> low-level circulation late on August15. As a result, the NHC discontinued advisories on the system and declared it an open tropical wave. While not entirely sure, it is suspected that the fast motion of the cyclone attributed to its dissipation. The remnant wave eventually entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, developing into Hurricane Frank by August23.|$|E

5|$|In the 1976–77 {{season the}} Flyers' win total slipped from 51 to 48, {{but they still}} managed a 0.700 winning percentage. This marked the fourth {{consecutive}} year of having a 0.700 or better win percentage – once again winning their division and finishing first in the Campbell Conference. In the post season the Flyers again reached the semi-finals, but lost to the Bruins in four straight games. The following season the Flyers' record fell to 45–20–15 finishing second to the Islanders in both the division and the Conference. Shero again led the Flyers to the semi-finals, where they lost to the Bruins once more. At {{the end of the}} season Shero, who had one more year left on his contract, submitted a letter of resignation stating that the Flyers needed a change whether they realized it or not. Flyers management had previously heard rumors about Shero wanting to leave Philadelphia and re-join the Rangers organization, and refused to accept his letter of resignation. Shero then signed a $250,000, five-year contract with the Rangers to be their new Head Coach and General Manager, believing he <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> contractual agreement to the Flyers. A few weeks after signing Shero, the Rangers gave the Flyers their first-round pick in the 1978 draft (Ken Linseman) and cash as compensation, allowing the Rangers to avoid tampering charges.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the church}} had been {{deprived}} of property in 1918, and the clergy had no fields to till as a result, along with the facts that the wealthier members of their congregation were being liquidated and the clergy were still forbidden to collect membership dues, they often <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> financial base to maintain their churches.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{selection}} process was changed. ESPN <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hand in {{the selection}} of the teams.

25|$|After the Dutch fleet declined, {{merchant}} interests became {{dependent on}} the goodwill of Britain. The main focus of Dutch leaders was reducing the country's considerable budget deficits.
