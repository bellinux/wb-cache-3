40|$|Separation and {{characterization}} of nitrated variants {{of the major}} birch pollen allergen by CZE-ESI-TOF MS A CZE-ESI-TOF MS method has been optimized for the separation and identification of nitrated variants of the major birch pollen allergen from Betula verrucosa, isoform 1 a (Bet v 1 a). In-house nitration of recombinant Bet v 1 a was done by peroxynitrite. As a BGE, 10 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate with pH 7. 50 provided best resolution. Nebulizer gas pressure and sheath liquid flow rate of 0. 4 bar and 6 L/min, respectively, maintained CZE selectivity and constituted stable electrospray conditions. A sheath liquid composition of 75 % v/v methanol with 0. 1 % v/v formic acid in ultrapure water resulted in highest signal intensities. Alternatively, methanol could be replaced by 50 % v/v isopropanol. Two modified allergen products derived from reaction mixtures that contained different amounts of the nitration reagent were compared by the elaborated CZE-ESI-TOF MS method. Up to twelve different Bet v 1 a variants with one- to sixfold nitration could be distinguished. Several allergen fractions of equivalent <b>nitration</b> <b>grade</b> were resolved. Their different migration times indicate site-specific nitration with concomitant differences in pI and maybe also in hydrodynamic radius. The method allows for a {{characterization of}} in-house nitrated allergen samples that are intended for testing the postulated enhanced allergenicity of nitrated Bet v 1 a variants...|$|E
