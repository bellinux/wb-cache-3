500|$|The 2014 Winter Olympics, officially the XXII Olympic Winter Games, or the 22nd Winter Olympics, {{took place}} from 7 to 23 February 2014. A record 2,800 {{participants}} from 88 countries competed. The Games {{were the most}} expensive so far, with a cost of £30 billion. Following their disappointing performance at the 2010 Games, and an investment of £600 million in elite sport, the host nation topped the medal table, taking 33 medals including 13 golds. However Grigory Rodchenkov, {{the former head of}} the Russian <b>national</b> <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratory,</b> subsequently claimed that he had been involved in doping dozens of Russian competitors for the Games, and that he had had the assistance of the Russian Federal Security Service in opening and re-sealing bottles containing urine samples so samples with banned substances could be replaced with [...] "clean" [...] urine. A subsequent investigation commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency led by Richard McLaren concluded that a state-sponsored doping programme had operated in Russia from 2011 to 2015 across the [...] "vast majority" [...] of Summer and Winter Olympic sports. On the snow, Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen took two golds to bring his total tally of Olympic medals to 13, overtaking his compatriot Bjørn Dæhlie to become the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time. Another Norwegian, cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen took three golds: her total of ten Olympic medals tied her as the female Winter Olympian with most medals, alongside Raisa Smetanina and Stefania Belmondo. Snowboarder Ayumu Hirano became the youngest medallist on snow at the Winter Games when he took a silver in the halfpipe competition at the age of 15. On ice, the Dutch dominated the speed skating events, taking 23 medals, four clean sweeps of the podium places and at least one medal in each of the 12 medal events. Ireen Wüst was their most successful competitor, taking two golds and three silvers. In figure skating, Yuzuru Hanyu became the first skater to break the 100-point barrier in the short programme on the way to winning the gold medal. Among the sledding disciplines, luger Armin Zöggeler took a bronze, becoming the first Winter Olympian to secure a medal in six consecutive Games.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the number of cases and the profiles of Polish athletes who had occasionally been using marijuana or hashish throughout the period of 1998 - 2004, with respect to: sex, age, and discipline of sport as well as the period of testing (in- and out-of-competition). Results of the study were compared with some data reported by other WADA accredited <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Totally, 13 631 urine samples taken from Polish athletes of both sexes, aged 10 - 67 years, performing 46 disciplines of sport were tested. Cannabinoids were detected in 267 samples. Among Polish athletes the relative number of positive THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) samples was one of the highest in Europe. The group of young Polish athletes (aged 16 - 24 years) was the most THC-positive. THC-positive cases were noted more frequently in male athletes tested during out of competitions. The so-called contact sports (rugby, ice hockey), skating, boxing, badminton, body building and acrobatic sports were those sports, where the higher risk of cannabis use was observed. The legal interpretation of some positive cannabinoids results would be difficult because of some accidental and unintentional use of the narcotics by sportsmen. It was concluded that <b>national</b> <b>anti-doping</b> organizations (NADO’s), which are competent to judge whether the anti-doping rules were violated, should take into account the possibility of non-intentional doping use of cannabinoids via passive smoking of marijuana...|$|R

40|$|A {{seemingly}} endless series of scandals has focused increasing public {{attention on the}} issue of doping among elite athletes. But we still do not know how many elite athletes really make use of banned drugs. In addition, we recognize the literature suffers a lack of appropriate game theory models for complex social interactions related to doping. Therefore, we think that an agent-based approach may allow doping behavior patterns in professional sports to be explored and elucidated. We conceptualize an agent-based model on three interacting objectives, namely (i) elite athletes, (ii) <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratory</b> and (iii) <b>anti-doping</b> agency. The latter agency announces antidoping rules and imposes penalties; the <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratory</b> executes doping controls and elite athletes compete for income. In particular, we focus on presenting an agent-based concept to analyze elite athletes’ doping behavior. Using such an agentbased framework and computational simulations may lead in the future to policy recommendations for the fight against doping...|$|R
40|$|Diuretics are {{drugs that}} {{increase}} the rate of urine flow and sodium excretion to adjust the volume and composition of body fluids. There are several major categories of this drug class and the compounds vary greatly in structure, physicochemical properties, effects on urinary composition and renal haemodynamics, and site and mechanism of action. Diuretics are often abused by athletes to excrete water for rapid weight loss and to mask {{the presence of other}} banned substances. Because of their abuse by athletes, diuretics have been included on The World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) list of prohibited substances; the use of diuretics is banned both in competition and out of competition and diuretics are routinely screened for by <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratories.</b> This review provides an overview of the pharmacology and toxicology of diuretics and discusses their application in sports.

40|$|Urine {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) {{concentration}} is routinely measured in all <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratories</b> to exclude recombinant LH abuse and to test any potential alteration of the hypophyseal-gonadal axis. Before establishing proper reference values among professional top level athletes, an extended validation of two commercial immunoassays for LH measurements was performed. Elecsy (R) 1010 and Access (R) are two automated immunoanalyzers for central laboratories. The limit of detection, {{the limit of}} quantification, intra-laboratory, inter-technique correlation, precision, accuracy were determined. Furthermore, reference urinary LH distribution values {{for male and female}} top level athletes were determined. Stability studies of LH in urine following freezing and thawing cycles (n = 3) as well as storage conditions at room temperature, 4 degrees C and - 20 degrees C were performed. Male and female subjects showed important urinary corrected (specific gravity correction) LH distribution differences. Intra-assay precision for the Access (R) analyzer was less than 8. 0 % whereas inter-assay was close to 11 %. Intra and inter-assay precision for the Elecsys (R) 1010 analyzer was slightly better. A good inter-technique correlation was obtained ([Elecsys (R) 1010] = 1. 0434 [Access (R) ] + 1. 146, R = 0. 953). No urinary LH loss was observed after two freezing and thawing cycles. On the other hand, time and bad storage conditions such as elevated temperature can deteriorate rapidly urinary LH. In conclusion, both analyzers showed acceptable performances and are suitable for screening anti-doping analyses. Each <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratory</b> has to settle its own reference distribution values and then determine when to launch a confirmation procedure. This takes place then depending on the positivity criteria the <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratory</b> has established and validated. This study also clearly showed that the time delay between the urine collection and the analysis should be reduced as much as possible and urine samples should be transported in optimal conditions (low temperature and quickly) to decrease urinary LH deterioration...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to provide preliminary information on the potential impact of metabolic drug-drug interaction on the effectiveness of doping control strategies currently followed by the <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratories</b> to detect the intake of banned agents. In vitro assays based on the use of human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP isoforms were designed and performed to characterize the phase I metabolic profile of the prohibited agent toremifene, selected as a prototype drug of the class of selective oestrogen receptor modulators, both in the absence and in the presence of medicaments (fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, cimetidine, ranitidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, nefazodone) not included in the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances and methods and frequently administered to athletes. The results show that the in vitro model developed in this study was adequate to simulate the in vivo metabolism of toremifene, confirming the results obtained in previous studies. Furthermore, our data also show that ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole and nefazodone cause a marked modification in the production of the metabolic products (i. e. hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites) normally selected by the <b>anti-doping</b> <b>laboratories</b> as target analytes to detect toremifene intake; moderate variations were registered in the presence of fluconazole, paroxetine and fluoxetine; while no significant modifications were measured in the presence of ranitidine and cimetidine. This evidence imposes that the potential effect of drug-drug interactions is duly taken into account in anti-doping analysis, also for a broader significance of the analytical results.
