60|$|Madame <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly,</b> {{as always}} {{when she did}} her calculations.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked up}} at her sharply. She <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly,</b> like a {{porcelain}} mandarin.|$|E
60|$|Pyecroft <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly,</b> and the Sergeant {{called all}} {{the powers of}} {{darkness}} to witness his bewilderment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Worn out! Worn out!" [...] Madame said, <b>nodding</b> <b>slowly</b> up and down. Her black veil, pushed up, sagged {{over her}} brows like a {{mourning}} band. [...] "You cannot afford to waste the stamina. And will {{you keep on}} the theatre--with Mr. May--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{that might}} do," [...] replied the Captain, <b>nodding</b> <b>slowly,</b> [...] "only {{it may be}} that a man without means may {{hesitate}} about marryin' a girl without means, especially if he didn't want her, and she didn't want him. I don't quite see how to get over all these difficulties." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Gascoigne <b>nodded</b> more <b>slowly,</b> the {{perpendicular}} line on {{his brow}} deepened, and Anna's trembling increased.|$|R
60|$|She <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly.</b> He {{held out}} his hand, {{but she did not}} at once part with it.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Fentolin <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly.</b> He {{moistened}} {{his lips}} for a moment. One might {{have imagined that}} he was anxious.|$|E
6000|$|Dixon <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly</b> in agreement. [...] "With the {{variable}} man helping, Sherikov has undoubtedly completed work {{well ahead of}} schedule." ...|$|E
60|$|Anna <b>nodded,</b> and <b>slowly,</b> for {{her limbs}} were stiff, sank down {{on to the}} step of the fountain.|$|R
60|$|They all acquiesced to this, even Kells <b>slowly</b> <b>nodding</b> his head.|$|R
60|$|Job Haskers <b>nodded,</b> and <b>slowly</b> and {{cautiously}} {{the pair}} crawled over the rocks until they gained a position {{close to the}} three men. Then they settled back, to listen to whatever might be said.|$|R
6000|$|... "As Josiah Crabtree {{tried to}} {{influence}} your mother," [...] whispered Dick, and Dora <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "Well, let us forget it, and -- My gracious!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly,</b> thoughtfully. [...] "You {{have very}} well disposed, Charles," [...] she {{approved}} him. [...] "If your father lives, {{it should not}} be a difficult matter--" ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{a moment}} Steven {{looked up at}} him. There was a strange {{expression}} on his face. He <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "Yes. Yes, it works. It works fine." ...|$|E
60|$|Louis <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} <b>slowly,</b> but {{he paused for}} several moments before speaking.|$|R
60|$|The eyes {{of every}} one were bent upon the Duke. He <b>nodded</b> his head <b>slowly.</b>|$|R
60|$|The doctor {{frowned and}} <b>nodded</b> his head <b>slowly</b> with {{the corners of}} his mouth drawn in.|$|R
6000|$|Dorle <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "The soft {{underbelly of}} the dragon. In the legend, the dragon's armor doesn't cover its stomach." [...] He began to laugh. [...] "That's right. That's {{perfectly}} right." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{man looked}} at me but said nothing. He seemed to show neither any desire nor any ability for speech. Only as I {{repeated}} my question he <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly</b> as one who barely understands.|$|E
60|$|Madame <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly</b> up and down. A secret {{satisfaction}} {{came over}} her pallid, waxy countenance, {{in which her}} black eyes were like twin swift extraneous creatures: oddly like two bright little dark animals in the snow.|$|E
60|$|Madame <b>slowly</b> <b>nodded</b> {{her head}} up and down, as if she put {{thousands}} of two-and-two's together.|$|R
60|$|Madame scrutinized, and <b>slowly</b> <b>nodded</b> her head. Then {{she looked}} into Alvina's eyes, really a little jealous.|$|R
60|$|In {{answer to}} Leeby's <b>nods,</b> Hendry <b>slowly</b> {{pulled out his}} boots from beneath the table, and sat looking at them, preparatory to putting them on. He was {{beginning}} at last {{to be a little}} scared, though his face did not show it.|$|R
6000|$|Occasionally Likeman <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly,</b> as a {{physician}} might do at the recital of familiar symptoms. [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I have been through most of this.... A little different in the inessentials.... How clear you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|His lordship <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly,</b> {{and fell}} very thoughtful, the letter before him, his eyes {{wandering}} ever and anon to con again {{some portion of}} it. [...] "It is {{a game in which}} I stake my head," [...] he muttered presently.|$|E
6000|$|His lordship considered, and <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "I {{admit that}} it is. Yet I do not see how this {{publicity}} is to be avoided {{in the course of}} the further investigations into the manner in which Count Samoval came by his death." ...|$|E
60|$|Madame Duburg {{sat down}} upon a garden seat, raised her hands, and <b>nodded</b> her head <b>slowly</b> and solemnly.|$|R
60|$|To his satisfaction, Collot grunted a surly assent. Very leisurely he {{rose from}} his chair, {{stretched}} out his loose limbs, shook himself like a shaggy cur, and without uttering another word he gave his colleague a curt <b>nod,</b> and <b>slowly</b> lounged out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|Next morning, {{we came to}} a deep, green wood, <b>slowly</b> <b>nodding</b> {{over the}} waves; its margin frothy-white with foam. A charming sight! ...|$|R
60|$|With a slight, {{imperceptible}} movement--imperceptible {{to every}} one save to him, she {{had seemed to}} handle {{a piece of paper}} in her kerchief, then she had <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly,</b> with her eyes--steadfast, reassuring--fixed upon him, and his glance gave answer that he had understood.|$|E
6000|$|Deane <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly.</b> [...] "I daresay {{you were}} right, Gray," [...] he said. [...] "Since {{the young lady}} is so persistent, you had better show her in. See that I am not {{disturbed}} again this afternoon, however. I have a good deal to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Irwine <b>nodded</b> <b>slowly,</b> and Adam went on rather tremulously, [...] "You was t' ha' married me and Hetty Sorrel, you know, sir, o' {{the fifteenth}} o' this month. I thought she loved me, and I was th' happiest man i' the parish. But a dreadful blow's come upon me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He confessed it?" [...] she cried, {{seemingly}} aghast. The friar <b>slowly</b> <b>nodded.</b> [...] "Don Rodrigo confessed?" [...] she insisted, as {{will the}} incredulous.|$|R
6000|$|Maxwell, {{who still}} looked pale and thin {{from the effects}} of his late accident, <b>nodded</b> his head <b>slowly,</b> and growled, [...] "Two thousand--jus' so." ...|$|R
60|$|Rachael <b>nodded</b> {{her head}} <b>slowly,</b> her eyes glittered in the firelight. Wrapped {{in her black}} shawl, she looked like some quaint effigy--something {{scarcely}} human.|$|R
