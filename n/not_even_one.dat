This Test will be remembered - if, indeed, it is recalled at all in after years - because the fortunes changed so rapidly {{and because of the}} deed of individuals, chiefly the bowlers. Some, but only a few, came out with their reputations enhanced.|$|E
25|$|The tour {{ended with}} four more matches and Miller played {{in all of}} them. He scored 17 as Australia reached 8/226 before the match against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's was washed out with <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>one</b> innings completed. Johnson had let Miller captain the team in his final {{appearance}} at Lord's but it was marked by a black eye sustained when he edged a bouncer into his face. He was eventually out hit wicket.|$|E

25|$|Ovechkin {{went right}} away and scored the {{equalizer}} after Per-Åge Skrøder gave Norway the lead. After Russia took the lead, Patrick Thoresen made it a tied game just 28 seconds after the second period started, with his 18th point of the tournament. The game went into the last period tied, 2–2. <b>Not</b> <b>even</b> <b>one</b> minute into the third period, Alexei Emelin gave Russia the lead. After Russia raised the lead to two, Ilya Nikulin finished Norway off by making it a 5–2 lead with just five minutes to go. Norway was outshot 45–21 and eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Everett {{has also}} {{recently}} reinterpreted even the limited form of embedding {{in the example}} above as parataxis. He now states that Pirahã does not admit any embedding at all, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>one</b> level deep. He says that words that appear to form a clause in the example are actually a separate unembedded sentence, which, in context, expresses the same {{thought that would be}} expressed by a clause in English. He gives evidence for this based on the lack of specialized words for clause-formation, the pattern of coreferring tokens in the purported clause-constructions, and examples where the purported clause is separated {{from the rest of the}} sentence by other complete sentences.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Navy {{attempted}} {{to locate and}} pursue the American task force. The Second Fleet, its main striking force, was near Taiwan, returning from the Indian Ocean Raid to refit and replace its air losses. Spearheaded by five aircraft carriers and its best naval aircraft and aircrews, the Second Fleet was immediately ordered to locate and destroy the U.S. carrier force, but failed to do so. Nagumo and his staff on the Akai heard that an American force was near Japan but expected {{an attack on the}} next day. Mitsuo Fuchida and Shigeyoshi Miwa considered the one-way raid excellent strategy, with the bombers evading Army fighters by flying much lower than anticipated. Kuroshima said the raid passed like a shiver over Japan and Miwa criticised the Army for claiming to have shot down nine aircraft rather than <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 491, the Chronicle {{records that}} the Saxons Aelle and Cissa [...] "besieged Andredadsceaster and slew all the inhabitants; there was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>one</b> Briton left there." [...] It is {{uncertain}} whether habitation {{of the fort}} continued after this event, which is now thought to have happened around 471 rather than the date recorded by the Chronicle (due to a dating error by Gildas, on whose work the Chronicle draws). The fort {{appears to have been}} resettled by about the middle of the 6th century by a Saxon community which left evidence of its occupation in the shape of pottery, glass and other items. By the late Anglo-Saxon period, Pevensey had become a well-established fishing port and producer of salt. Whereas the modern village of Pevensey is situated entirely outside the walls, the 11th century village appears to have been situated within the Roman walls. At the time of the Norman Conquest it had a population of 52 burgesses with a harbour and saltworks outside the walls. A civilian settlement within the castle walls evidently persisted for some considerable time after the Conquest, as a licence of 1250 refers to the Roman fortress as the [...] "outer wall of the town".|$|E

2500|$|The late 1950s saw {{the virtual}} {{liquidation}} of the anti-communist partisans; part of Drăghici's responsibilities included commanding troops to combat that guerrilla force.

2500|$|The discord Melkor created {{would have}} dire consequences, as this singing {{was a kind}} of {{template}} for the world: [...] "The evils of the world were not at first in the great Theme, but entered with the discords of Melkor." [...] However, [...] "Sauron was not a beginner of discord; and he probably knew more of the Music than did Melkor, whose mind had always been filled with his own plans and devices." [...] Apparently Sauron was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>one</b> of the spirits that immediately began to attune their music to that of Melkor, since it is noted elsewhere that his fall occurred later (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Émile Benveniste {{states that}} [...] "there is no common [...] term to {{designate}} religion itself, or cult, or the priest, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>one</b> {{of the personal}} gods". There are, however, terms denoting ritual practice reconstructed in Indo-Iranian religion which have root cognates in other branches, hinting at common PIE concepts. Thus, [...] the stem *hrta-, usually translated as [...] " [...] order" [...] (Vedic ṛta and Iranian artaAra (a Hittite goddess).). Benveniste states, [...] "We have here one of the cardinal notions of the legal world of the Indo-Europeans, {{to say nothing of}} their religious and moral ideas" [...] (pp.379–381). [...] He also adds that an abstract suffix -tu formed the Vedic stem ṛtu-, Avestan ratu- which designated order, particularly in the seasons and periods of time. [...] The same root and suffix, but a different formation, appears in Latin rītus [...] "".|$|E

I don't know why, it {{was as much a}} surprise to us as it was to anybody. Warner Bros. Records then said to us, due to it starting to show some action, would we want to release it over there as a major release. We thought [...] "why not?" [...] – and now it's the number one album over there!" [...] Speaking of [...] "I'm a Rocker", Holder said: [...] "That was the track getting the most airplay from the album. But it's not just a case of that applying in Belgium – we've had so many people writing to us asking why we've not released it as a single. [...] "I'm a Rocker" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>one</b> of our songs though – it's a Chuck Berry number." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, Fatih Birol, {{the chief}} {{economist}} of the International Energy Agency, described additional greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's oil sands as [...] "extremely low".

[...] The IEA is charged with responsibility for battling climate change, but Dr. Birol said he spends little time worrying about carbon emissions from oil sands. [...] "There is a lot of discussion on oil sands projects in Canada and the United States {{and other parts of the}} world, but to be frank, the additional CO2 emissions coming from the oil sands is extremely low." [...] Dr. Birol acknowledged that there is tremendous difference of opinion on the course of action regarding climate change, but added, [...] "I hope all these reactions are based on scientific facts and sound analysis." ...|$|E
