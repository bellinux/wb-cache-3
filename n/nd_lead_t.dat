Characterization of the composites by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reveal uniform distribution of the ND particles with no agglomeration in the matrix. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals that the crystallinity of the polymer increases with increasing ND content, indicating a strong interaction between ND and PVA.

We describe three cases with intraoperative bradycardia during device testing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At our hospital 111 patients have received a VNS system. Intraoperative device testing is performed under ECG-monitoring. We reviewed the patients and their VNS-therapy follow-up outcome who experienced a change in heart rate, during device testing (<b>Lead</b> <b>Test).</b> RESULTS: Three patients with medically refractory epilepsy showed a bradycardia during intraoperative <b>Lead</b> <b>Test.</b> Postoperative the VNS-therapy started under ECG-monitoring.
