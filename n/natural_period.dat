2500|$|It is {{conventionally}} {{believed that}} SSI is a purely beneficial effect, {{and it can}} conveniently be neglected for conservative design. SSI provisions of seismic design codes are optional and allow designers to reduce the design base shear of buildings by considering soil-structure interaction (SSI) as a beneficial effect. The main idea behind the provisions is that the soil-structure system can be replaced with an equivalent fixed-base model with a longer period and usually a larger damping ratio. Most of the design codes use oversimplified design spectra, which attain constant acceleration {{up to a certain}} period, and thereafter decreases monotonically with period. [...] Considering soil-structure interaction makes a structure more flexible and thus, increasing the <b>natural</b> <b>period</b> of the structure compared to the corresponding rigidly supported structure. [...] Moreover, considering the SSI effect increases the effective damping ratio of the system. [...] The smooth idealization of design spectrum suggests smaller seismic response with the increased natural periods and effective damping ratio due to SSI, which is the main justification of the seismic design codes to reduce the design base shear when the SSI effect is considered. The same idea also forms the basis of the current common seismic design codes such as ASCE 7-10 and ASCE 7-16. Although, the mentioned idea, i.e. reduction in the base shear, works well for linear soil-structure systems, it is shown that it cannot appropriately capture the effect of SSI on yielding systems. More recently, Khosravikia et al. evaluated the consequences of practicing the SSI provisions of ASCE 7-10 and those of 2015 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which form the basis of the 2016 edition of the seismic design standard provided by the ASCE. They showed that SSI provisions of both NEHRP and ASCE 7-10 result in unsafe designs for structures with surface foundation on moderately soft soils, but NEHRP slightly improves upon the current provisions for squat structures. For structures on very soft soils, both provisions yield conservative designs where NEHRP is even more conservative. Finally, both provisions yield near-optimal designs for other systems.|$|E

60|$|It {{very rarely}} happens that the nominal price of labour universally falls, but we well {{know that it}} {{frequently}} remains the same, while the nominal price of provisions has been gradually increasing.

60|$|These {{attempts}} {{to extend the}} influence of what was called freethinking and philosophy, were carried on, as we have hinted, with a caution dictated by the timidity of the philosopher's disposition. He was conscious his doctrines were suspected, and his proceedings watched, by the two principal sects of Prelatists and Presbyterians, who, however inimical to each other, were still more hostile to one who was an opponent, not only to a church establishment of any kind, but to every denomination of Christianity. He found it more easy to shroud himself among the Independents, whose demands were for a general liberty of conscience, or an unlimited toleration, and whose faith, differing in all respects and particulars, was by some pushed into such wild errors, as to get totally {{beyond the bounds of}} every species of Christianity, and approach very near to infidelity itself, as extremes of each kind are said to approach each other. Bletson mixed a good deal among those sectaries; and such was his confidence in his own logic and address, that he is supposed to have entertained hopes of bringing to his opinions in time the enthusiastic Vane, as well as the no less enthusiastic Harrison, provided he could but get them to resign their visions of a Fifth Monarchy, and induce them to be contented with a reign of Philosophers in England for the <b>natural</b> <b>period</b> of their lives, instead of the reign of the Saints during the Millenium.|$|E

40|$|A multi-degree {{of freedom}} lumped mass model with {{rotational}} springs {{was built to}} investigate the influence of outrigger system on the <b>natural</b> <b>periods</b> and mode shapes of a structure. The presence of outrigger system was found to significantly stiffen the structure, reducing the <b>natural</b> <b>periods</b> and distorting the mode shapes. The influences of outrigger system on the modal properties of a structure vary with the change of its number, locations and rotational stiffness. Wind-induced along-wind and across-wind responses of structures with and without outrigger system were analyzed, compared and discussed. It {{was found that the}} outrigger system can effectively decrease the along-wind responses (peak displacements and accelerations) and its influence is the most significant when it's located at the middle of the structural height. For across-wind responses, the outrigger system(s) could help with the prevention of vortex-induced resonance, if its location(s) is(are) appropriately chosen, by shifting the <b>natural</b> <b>periods</b> of the original structure without outrigger away from the frequency of vortex shedding. Two methodologies were proposed for the design of outrigger systems in two different scenarios, one with the number and locations of outrigger(s) preset and the other not. For the first scenario, the corresponding methodology is a checking process and for the second, it is a designing process. Both methodologies are aimed at preventing vortex-induced resonance and minimizing along-wind peak displacements and accelerations, satisfying related human comfort criteria for motions and lateral drifts requirements. by Xiaoxiao Wu.

40|$|This thesis was {{initiated}} by Trond Landb&# 248; from Dr. techn. Olav Olsen after an internship {{there during the}} summer of 2012. Amongst other projects, Dr. techn. Olav Olsen works with different concepts for floating concrete hulls to support wind turbines in deep seas. They have a patented structural concept under development which inspired this master thesis. The main goal of this thesis was to modify the design of the basic concept to fulfill requirements with respect to higher <b>natural</b> <b>periods</b> in heave, pitch and roll. To reach this goal, calculations made by hand and analysis in Wadam were to be used. Another aim was to utilize a new IFE-program, called 3 DFloat, to gain experience of the new software that?s under development. The design criteria for the <b>natural</b> <b>periods</b> were set to at least 20 seconds in heave and 25 seconds in pitch/roll, with a distance of 4 - 6 seconds between the periods. The first part of the work was a literature study into hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, and also how to use the two computational tools needed for the analysis. Once the setup-phase was completed, calculations of the basic concept were made. The basic concept was given as input to this thesis and calculations were therefore made to allow for a comparison with that of Dr. techn. Olav Olsen and thus explore whether the methods for calculation and analysis were correct. The results matched, with <b>natural</b> <b>periods</b> on 15. 9 seconds in heave and 22. 5 in pitch/roll for the basic concept. The second phase of the design was to alter the outer geometries and examine the effects of different parameters on the <b>natural</b> <b>periods.</b> This thesis chose to study five parameters of the outer geometry. Through the use of hand calculations and Wadam, the necessary outer geometry was found with <b>natural</b> <b>periods</b> over the criteria. Graphs depicting the increase/decrease in concrete volumes as a result of changing the parameters were also added as a way to monitor the effects such changes have on cost. Lastly, the final concept was adjusted with regards to the wall thickness and concrete volumes, before it was modeled and analyzed. <b>Natural</b> <b>periods</b> were found to be 21. 5 seconds in heave and 26 seconds in pitch/roll, fulfilling the criteria. Static tilt was calculated at 6. 593 degrees, which is was little high, as ideally it should not exceed 6 degrees. With the help of 3 DFloat, a check was made of the forces that would result the wave regime at the intended location of the hull. During this process, it was discovered that 3 DFloat calculates all waves with period Tp= 10 seconds. Comparing the forces from the waves against the capacity of the hull gave a utilization of below 50 % of the hulls capacity. The use of 3 DFloat was very interesting. Modeling of the basic concept was succesful and it behaved as intended, but the final concept did not. This was {{due to the fact that}} at present, 3 DFloat, is only able to calculate with cylindrical elements. The adaptations required between rectangular elements and conical elements for the final concept therefore seem to have created some problems for 3 DFloat that were not solved by the time this thesis was completed. ...|$|R
