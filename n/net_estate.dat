40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Concern {{over the}} {{apparent}} {{disparity between the}} farm use value and current market value of property in agricultural areas continues to remain a source of concern in many areas. This concern has intensified in recent years, particularly in those agricultural areas situated near urban centers and recreational areas. The main thrust {{of the study was}} directed toward determining the relationship between <b>net</b> real <b>estate</b> income per acre and sale price pier acres of properties in selected agricultural areas of Oregon. Three areas, ostensibly called agricultural areas, were selected for analysis. The areas, as classified, included a basic agricultural production area (dry land grain area in northcentral Oregon), an urban-recreation influenced area (Douglas County in southwestern Oregon bordered by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the Umpqua National Forest on the east) and an urban influenced area (Marion County in the populous and productive Willamette Valley in northwestern Oregon). In addition to determining the influence of <b>net</b> real <b>estate</b> income on property prices, the influence of other property characteristics on property prices was analyzed in each area. The other property characteristics included: year of sale, number of acres in sale, assessed value of buildings per acre, miles to nearest paved road, and miles to nearest town of at least 1, 000 population. Simple and multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the influence of particular property characteristics on sale price per acre. The same six-variable model was used in each area to test whether partial regression coefficient values on corresponding variables differed significantly among areas. Overlapping of 95 percent confidence intervals around corresponding partial regression coefficient values among areas was observed for all independent variables except <b>net</b> real <b>estate</b> income per acre. The income variable was an important determinant of sale price per acre only for grain area and Douglas County sales. However, the partial regression coefficient value of 49. 71 in urban-recreation influenced Douglas County implies an approximate 2. 0 percent capitalization rate compared to a coefficient value of 17. 11 and a 5. 8 percent implied capitalization rate in the grain area. Year of sale was an important influence on sale price per acre in areas influenced more strongly by nonagricultural influences, i. e., Douglas and Marion Counties, as evidenced both by the level of significance of the coefficient value and the value of the coefficient in each of these areas. The annual rate of property price appreciation at the mean was 14. 3 percent in urban-recreation influenced Douglas County and 12. 1 percent in urban influenced Marion County. While not significantly different from zero, the rate of price change was slightly negative in the grain area. Conclusions from the study were (1) that there is {{a significant difference in the}} influence of <b>net</b> real <b>estate</b> income and other property characteristics on prices of properties among selected agricultural areas of Oregon, (2) that the nature and degree of relationship between prices oi property sales analyzed and property characteristics of these sales varied considerably within each agricultural area selected for analysis, but especially in the urban-recreation and urban influenced areas, and (3) that in spite of relatively low mean rates of return in all three areas studied, a disparity between the farm use value and current market value of land was found to exist only in urban-recreation influenced Douglas County. Implication of these results are that variously influenced agricultural areas do exist, and that motives for and sources of satisfaction from ownership of property in agricultural areas vary within and among areas...|$|R

40|$|A {{revocable}} {{trust is}} a popular estate planning tool used to disinherit a spouse in sixteen jurisdictions. In common law jurisdictions, a surviving spouse, who is dissatisfied {{with his or her}} inheritance, has the right to receive an elective share of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate regardless of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate plan. However, sixteen jurisdictions have defined a dissatisfied spouse 2 ̆ 7 s rights with a fractional share of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 <b>net</b> probate <b>estate,</b> 2 ̆ 2 allowing one spouse to disinherit the other, by single-handedly transferring his or her assets to a revocable trust. To add insult to injury seven of these common law jurisdictions have recently codified trust law making it seamless for the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s creditor to be paid from revocable trust assets. The elective share is one of few limitations imposed on testamentary freedom. Common law property jurisdictions have created a public policybased statute for married persons that prohibit the first-to-die spouse from disinheriting his or her surviving spouse. To avoid disinheritance, common law jurisdictions statutorily protect a surviving spouse (spouse) with an elective share. The elective share arose {{in the early nineteenth century}} as a replacement of dower and curtesy rights. At that time the nature of wealth shifting from real to personal property made dower and curtesy obsolete. The elective share protected the spouse from disinheritance by guaranteeing him or her with a fractional share of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s <b>net</b> probate <b>estate,</b> a method known as the traditional elective share. 2 ̆ 7 However, like the shift from real to personal property there has been a subsequent shift in wealth from probate to non-probate assets (like revocable trusts) making the traditional elective share equally obsolete and inadequate to protect a spouse from disinheritance...|$|R

40|$|The paper investigates how (public) REITs managers’ {{compensation}} schemes influence {{capital structure}} and consequently REITs’ share value. The analysis focuses on “gross asset value” versus “net asset value”-based compensation structures and investigates the issue if NAV-based REITs outperform GAV-based REITs. This by considering Italian REIT market {{data and the}} Italian and European regulatory context. Due to regulatory and market constraints, Italian GAV and NAV-based REITs have a strong incentive to leverage {{in order to maximize}} management fees. However, NAV-based REITs are expected to be more selective in investment decisions compared to GAV-based REITs because of the different compensation base. Moreover, leverage produces different effects on share value if measured upon market price or net asset value due to the different implicit valuation methodologies. The empirical results seem to support the theoretical expectations. GAV-based REITs experience higher debt trends in respect to NAV-based REITs. At the same time, GAV-REITs register lower real <b>estate</b> asset returns <b>net</b> of management fees both for current as well as for growth returns.

40|$|Italian) REIT managers’ {{compensation}} structure typically {{provides a}} payment based alternatively on (i) “gross asset value” [GAV] or (ii) “net asset value” [NAV]. In addition, managers also gain a performance fee when REIT total return exceeds some minimum level. In this respect, the paper analyses {{how the two}} alternative compensation schemes influence REITs’ investment decisions and capital structure and, consequently, REITs’ share performance at the investor level. The final issue addressed is whether one compensation scheme is superior to the other, i. e. if REITs having a fee-structure based on net asset values outperform REITs with a compensation indexed on gross asset value. Due to the severe market price discount on net asset values and the inability to issue new shares, both fee structures incentive managers to leverage – even in a tax-free environment – {{in order to maximize}} the calculation basis of management fees. However, it will be shown that leverage motivation is stronger for GAV-based REITs than for NAV-based REITs, which are also expected to be more selective in investment decisions because only positive net present value investment projects increase their compensation basis. Overall, considering initial fee percentage, GAV-based REITs are expected to pay higher management fees than NAV-based REITs due to the leverage effect. Moreover, debt recourse produces different effects on share value if measured upon market price or net asset value due to the different implicit valuation methodologies. The empirical analysis supports the theoretical expectations. GAV-based REITs have higher debt trends and levels than NAV-based REITs. At the same time, GAV-REITs generally experience lower real <b>estate</b> asset returns <b>net</b> of management fees for both current and growth yields.

The estate tax affects only a small {{fraction}} of households [...] taxable decedents represented only 1. 4 percent of all deaths in 1995 [...] but the affected households account for a substantial fraction of household <b>net</b> worth. The <b>estate</b> tax can be viewed as a tax on capital income, with the effective rate depending on the statutory tax rate as well as the potential taxpayer's mortality risk. Because mortality rates rise with age, the effective estate tax burden is therefore greater for older than for younger individuals. The estate tax adds approximately 0. 3 percentage points to the average tax burden on capital income for households headed by individuals between the ages of 50 and 59. For households headed by individuals between the ages of 70 and 79, however, the estate tax increases the tax burden on capital income by approximately 3 percentage points. The effects are even larger for older households. The paper also explores the fraction of the net worth held by households that are subject to the estate tax that could be transferred to the next generation with a program a per donee exemption from gift tax. While roughly one quarter of potentially taxable assets could be transferred in this way, actual levels of inter vivos giving are much lower than the levels that would one would expect if households were taking full advantage of this tax avoidance strategy. ...|$|R

The multi-strategy platform was added in 1993 {{as a way to}} offer investors a single fund which captured many of Angelo, Gordon’s investment strategies and which could tactically allocate as markets shifted. In 1998, the leveraged loan business was added {{as an extension of the}} distressed debt business. The firm began buying real estate as early as 1990 through investments in the distressed debt of bankrupt real estate companies. In 1993, as real estate markets buckled under the weight of too much debt, the firm launched its opportunistic real estate strategy investments with the goal of improving and repositioning the property by increasing operating income. In early 2002, the company added core plus real estate to its real estate strategies as it was able to benefit from its operating partner network, and purchase high quality real estate. Since 2005, the firm has expanded its real estate offerings through a dedicated opportunistic Asian real estate strategy. In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European banking crisis of 2011, Angelo, Gordon added European real estate to its strategies as prices were depressed and liquidity was severely curtailed in the region. <b>Net</b> Lease real <b>estate</b> strategy was established in 2005 to focus on below investment grade tenants. Angelo, Gordon further expanded into the intersections of real estate and credit with the addition of real estate debt in 2006 and residential and consumer debt in 2008. In 2009, Angelo, Gordon was one of only nine private investment firms to partner with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in PPIP—the Private-Public Investment Partnership. The U.S. government invested alongside the selected firms to unlock the frozen credit markets in the wake of the global financial crisis. This was a successful program.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Son yıllarda, ülke ekonomisi üzerindeki olumlu etkisi oldukça hissedilen gayrimenkul sektörü, tüm metropollerde olduğu gibi İstanbul metropolünde de plansız büyüme ve kent merkezinde sanayi alanlarının yer alması sonucu geliştirilen dönüşüm ve iyileştirme projeleri doğrultusunda önemli bir rol oynamaktadır. Kent merkezi ve çeperlerinde geliştirilen bu tip dönüşüm ve iyileştirme projeleri, arsa stoğunun da azalması nedeniyle, alan kullanımını maksimize etmek amacıyla birden fazla kullanımın yer aldığı karma kullanımlı projeler olarak geliştirilmektedir. Karma kullanımlı projelerin gayrimenkul yatırımcıları tarafından tercih edilmesinin bir başka nedeni ise, farklı kullanımların bir araya gelmesiyle ortaya çıkan sinerji sonucu projedeki kira değerleri ve doluluk oranlarının artması, satış ve kiralama emiliminin hızlanması, dolayısıyla yatırımcının karının olumlu yönde etkilenmesidir. Kent merkezlerinde yapılan dönüşüm sürecinde, arsa üzerinde geliştirilecek proje, yapılaşma koşullarını belirleyen şehir plancıları ile projenin finansmanını sağlayan gayrimenkul yatırımcıları ve geliştiricilerine bağlıdır. Ancak arsa için hangi kullanımın daha uygun olduğu, genellikle gayrimenkul geliştiricileri tarafından yapılan en etkin ve verimli kullanım analizi sonucu ortaya çıkmaktadır. Tez kapsamında, yakın zamana kadar sanayi işletmelerinin yer aldığı ve dönüşümünün gündeme getirilmesiyle birlikte gayrimenkul açısından hızla hareketlilik kazanan Seyrantepe bölgesinde geliştirilecek karma kullanımlı bir projenin en etkin ve verimli kullanım analizine yer verilmiştir. Öncelikle, İstanbul geneli ve inceleme alanı olan Seyrantepe bölgesi özelinde ofis, rezidans, otel ve perakende sektörlerinin genel piyasa analizi yapılmıştır. Edinilen bilgiler doğrultusunda, iki farklı alternatif içeren bir karma kullanımlı gayrimenkul projesi yatırım analizi çalışması yapılmıştır. 1. alternatifte ofis, rezidans, otel ve perakende, 2. alternatifte ise rezidans, otel ve perakende kullanımlarına yönelik bir çalışma yapılmıştır. En etkin ve verimli kullanım analizi için oluşturulan nakit akış tablolarında, piyasa analizleri doğrultusunda gelir ve giderler öngörülerek, karma kullanımlı iki alternatif projenin net karına ulaşılmıştır. Projenin hangi kullanımlar ile daha karlı olacağı, iki alternatifin net bugünkü değerleri kıyaslanarak tespit edilmiştir. Sonuç bölümünde ise, gayrimenkul projelerinin hayata geçirilmeden önce, gayrimenkul geliştiricileri tarafından piyasa analizlerinin yapılması, doğru ve gerçekçi varsayımlar ile oluşturulacak en etkin ve verimli kullanım analizi sonucu projenin kullanımına karar verilmesi gerektiği konuları üzerinde durulmuştur. Bu şekilde geliştirilen gayrimenkul projeleri, toplum, ekonomi ve çevre için önemli bir katma değer sağlayacak ve yatırımcılarının finansal açıdan beklentilerini karşılayacaktır. Istanbul {{has been}} the commercial, control and {{coordination}} center {{for many years and}} provides laboring and transportation facilities for all over Turkey, Middle East, and Balkan states. Central Business District (CBD) is declared as the main retail and business area of the city and attracts occupiers mainly from financial and business sectors. Real estate sector which affects the country's economy positively in recent years, has a major role in Ýstanbul through the urban renewal projects caused by unplanned growth and the industrial places took place in the city center like all other metropolitan areas. The urban renewal projects in the city center and peripheries  are developed as “mixed used project” for maximize the use of space {{because of the lack of}} land stock.   A mixed use project which is an important land use trend in terms of city planning comprises two or more significant revenue producing uses such as residence, office, shopping center, hotel, hospital and school. Mixed use projects have significant functional and physical integration of the different usages and provide a living environment day and night.   Mixed use projects are not a land use option of new planning. Mixed use projects were the norm before the development of modern zoning and land use practices. This land use trend has been apparent in both urban and suburban areas, but the more urban areas such as center of larger cities.   Typical mixed use projects are designed with commercial space on the ground floor and residential and/or office above and this become typical living arrangement for the users of the projects. To maximize the use of space, mixed use projects are prefered to be developed in the scope of urban renewal projects. Another reason why real estate investors prefer mixed use projects is the synergy resulted by the combination of different functions. Rental values  and occupancy rates increase, take up values of both sale and lease accelerate by the synergy and consequently, investor makes more profit. Mixed use projects are more apparent in the cities of Europe and America than Turkey. In our country, mixed use project development is a new trend. Therefore, examples of mixed use real estate projects in Turkey is limited. The mixed use projects, especially apparent in Ýstanbul, are mostly prefered by developers with the success of initial examples of mixed use projects. In the process of urban renewal in the city centers, the real estate projects depend on both city planners who determine the construction conditions of the land and the real estate investors and developers who provide financing of the projects. Urban renewal projects in former industrial areas of city center has a big significance in respect of both urban planning and real estate development. In these projects,  it is very important for city planners and real estate developers to decide which function is the best for the area. Real estate developers and/or investors try to look for the answer with the highest and best use analysis. Highest and best use analysis is the only way to determine which function will be more convenient and efficient for the land. Within the scope of the thesis, financial analysis techniques are aimed to be investigated while a mixed use real estate development is in project phase. Financial feasibility determines the situation when the return on the investment in a mixed use development meets or exceeds the expected or the required return of the developer and/or the investor in the project.   In the scope of defining highest and best use analysis, basic valuation methods such as comparable transactions approach, cost approach and income capitalization approach should be examined as the basis of the analysis. Market analysis for a mixed use development is important in determining the demand and supply of each use in the subject area.   The valuation methods are used in the phases of highest and best use analysis and cash flows are created according to the assumptions from the result of the market analysis. As a consequence of the analysis, net present value of the project is calculated. Real estate developer or investor realizes the project if the value meets the developer or investor’s expectation. The success of the project is measured regarding the financial success of the project. That’s why market analysis and assumptions should be done accurately.   Within the scope of the thesis, highest and best use analysis of a mixed use project in Seyrantepe region where industrial plants located at until recently and real estate development facilitate movement after revive of urban renewal is presented. City planning is a technical and political process concerned with the use of land and design of the urban environment. The building conditions of the lots and space organization are determined by the development plans made by city planning departments of the municipalities. Development plans also provide distribution of unearned income with direction of real estate developments and investment. City planning has a major role in the development of real estate projects in the cities because city plans effect feasibility of investments directly. Nowadays, new mixed use projects become dominant in Seyrantepe. When the master plan of the region is examined, it is seen that combining the lots and constructing large scale mixed use projects is encouraged by the plan.  And also, in environmental plan of Ýstanbul, subject region is determined as the urban renewal area that will be an integration area of central business district and contain commercial and service sectors in the future. After an examination of the plans, general market analysis comprises office, residence, hotel and retail market of Ýstanbul and Seyrantepe as the study area have done. The data have been evaluated under the light of office, residence, hotel and retail market analyses, and the current rent and sales values have been studied. The demand and supply of each usage in the subject area is determined.   Based on the market research, a mixed use real estate project investment analysis has been carried out with two different alternatives. First alternative has been regarding office, residence, hotel and retail functions and second alternative has been regarding residence, hotel and retail functions. The reasons why office usage wasn’t included to second alternative are subject area is a new developing area and outside of the central business district. And also, office market analysis shows that there will be a huge office supply in Ýstanbul in near future.   Income and expenses have been created and net profit of the mixed use real estate project have been found by calculating cash flows within the scope of highest and best use analysis. The most profitable functions for the study area have been found by comparing the net present values of the two alternatives. In the conclusion part, the importance of determining the functions in the project in terms of highest and best use analysis before implementation with market research and accurate and realistic assumptions by real estate developers has been discussed.   In order to identify the net profit of the mixed use project, income and expenses for different alternatives have been examined. The impact of the real <b>estate</b> <b>net</b> income caused by the project components on the project profit have been identified and it is found out that in terms of highest and best use analysis, the functions with higher net present values would be the most profitable. Finally, it is emphasized that the real estate projects will provide a significant added value to society, economy and environment and meet the investors’ financial expectation in terms of doing an accurate highest and best use analysis.
