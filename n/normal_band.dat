5000|$|We can regard hazard {{then as a}} {{geophysical}} event which when {{it occurs}} in extremes and a human factor is involved may be called risk of hazard. In this context {{we can see that}} there may be an acceptable variation of magnitude which can vary from the estimated normal or average range with upper and lower limits or thresholds. In these extremities the natural occurrence will become an event that presents risk to the environment or people. Smith says [...] "most social and economic activities are geared to some expectation of the 'average' conditions. As long as the variation of the environmental element remains fairly close to this expected performance, insignificant damage occurs and the element will be perceived as beneficial. However when the variability exceeds some threshold beyond the <b>normal</b> <b>band</b> of tolerance, the same variable starts to impose a stress on society and become a hazard." [...] Thus above average wind speeds resulting in a tropical depression or hurricane according to intensity measures on the Sapphire Simpson Scale will provide an extreme natural event or hazard.|$|E

Adhesion of P. falciparum-infected red blood cells to CD36 is enhanced by the cerebral malaria-protective SAO trait [...] Higher efficiency of sequestration via CD36 in SAO individuals could determine a different organ distribution of sequestered infected red blood cells.
