40|$|Perception is {{characterized}} by the formation of spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that embody mental categories of the material events provided by the senses. The patterns are constructed by modifications of the background activity, which is maintained and self-regulated at criticality, such that all frequencies and wavelengths coexist in neural activity, from the atomic level to the whole brain. Pattern formation depends on energy dissipation and occurs by phase transition upon the coincidence of two events, both endogenous. One event is the null spike in the Rayleigh noise, which is generated by mutual excitation and then band pass filtered by feedback inhibition. The frequencyspecific drop in background amplitude enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of sensory-driven activity in each sensory sample taken by an action-perception cycle under limbic control. The other event is the sensory-selected activity from a Hebbian <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> <b>assembly</b> constituting reactivation of a memory of experience from past learning that is mobilized by the limbic system. The neural mechanisms of the phase transition that mediates perception may be subject to description in terms of a renormalization group based on systematic segmentation of the temporal spectra of various measures of brain activity. 1...|$|E

Information in neural networks and cell-substrate interactions have been heretofore studied separately. Understanding whether surface nano-topography can direct <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> <b>assembly</b> into computational efficient networks may provide new tools and criteria for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this work, we used information theory approaches and functional multi calcium imaging (fMCI) techniques to examine how information flows in neural networks cultured on surfaces with controlled topography. We found that substrate roughness S a affects networks topology. In the low nano-meter range, S a [*]=[*] 0 - 30 [*]nm, information increases with S a. Moreover, we found that energy density {{of a network of}} cells correlates to the topology of that network.

A novel model employs the properties of thermodynamic systems operating far from equilibrium, which is analyzed by linearization near adaptive operating points using root locus techniques. Such systems construct order by dissipating energy. Reinforcement learning of conditioned stimuli creates a landscape of attractors and their basins in each sensory cortex by forming <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies</b> in cortical connectivity. Retrieval of a selected category of stored knowledge is by a phase transition that is induced by a conditioned stimulus, and that leads to pattern self-organization. Near self-regulated criticality the cortical background activity displays aperiodic null spikes at which analytic amplitude nears zero, and which constitute a form of Rayleigh noise. Phase transitions in recognition and recall are initiated at null spikes {{in the presence of}} an input signal, owing to the high signal to noise ratio that facilitates capture of cortex by an attractor, even by very weak activity that is typically evoked by a conditioned stimulus...|$|R
40|$|Using T 1 -weighted MRI at two {{different}} magnetic field strengths, the enhanced longitudinal relaxivity due to paramagnetic manganese ions in mouse brain in vivo {{is shown to}} reflect reduced intracellular mobility. One day after systemic administration of manganese chloride, increases of the longitudinal relaxation rate DR 1 in several brain regions are significantly higher at 2. 35 T than at 9. 4 T. The corresponding relaxivity ratios 100 r 1 / 400 r 1 = 100 DR 1 / 400 DR 1 range from 2. 4 (striatum) to 4. 4 (cerebellar cortex). In contrast, the DR 1 values after intraventricular administration of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd- DTPA) are not significantly different between both field strengths yielding 100 r 1 / 400 r 1 ratios from 1. 0 to 1. 1. The same observation holds true for manganese and Gd-DTPA relaxivities in aqueous solution. The pronounced field strength dependence of manganese relaxivities indicates a reduced mobility of manganese ions in vivo by confinement to a viscous fluid compartment and/or due to macromolecular binding. Moreover, preferential enhancement of <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies</b> by manganese ions and the observation of additional contrast enhancement by magnetization transfer suggest an intracellular localization of manganese. This is further supported by a slow release of manganese from <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> postmortem, which occurs despite a high permeability of damaged cellular membranes as demonstrated by a rapid uptake of extracellular Gd-DTPA...|$|R
40|$|SummaryEpilepsy is an {{important}} problem in neurological disorders. The common features {{of all types of}} epilepsy are the synchronized and uncontrolled discharges of <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Recent studies claimed that gap junctions have a critical role in epileptic neuronal events. The aim of present study is to investigate the effects of connexin 36 (Cx 36) channel blocker quinine on penicillin-induced experimental epilepsy. For this purpose, 4 months old male Wistar rats were used in the present study. Permanent screw electrodes allowing EEG monitoring from conscious animals and permanent cannula providing the administration of the substances to the brain ventricle were placed into the cranium of rats under general anesthesia. At the end of the postoperative recovery period, epileptiform activity was generated by injecting 300 IU crystallized penicillin through the ventricular cannula. When the epileptiform activity, monitored from a digital recording system, reached maximal frequency and amplitude, quinine (200, 400 or 1000 nmol) was administered similar to penicillin. Effects of quinine on epileptiform activity were assessed by both electrophysiological and behavioral analysis. Quinine suppressed epileptiform activity by decreasing the amplitude and frequency of epileptiform spikes and by attenuating the epileptiform behavior. The outcomes {{of this study suggest that}} the blockade of Cx 36 channels may contribute to the amelioration of epileptic activity...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{analysis}} with preamplifier arrays and computers offers fresh perspectives on brain function. Realization {{of its potential}} depends on development of appropriate procedures for data processing and display, experimental paradigms to serve as benchmarks, and theories of brain function to predict {{what to look for}} and how to distinguish valid results from artifacts. Measurement of EEGs from arrays of 64 electrodes chronically implanted on the olfactory bulbs of rabbits that are trained to discriminate odorant conditioned stimuli show that the odorants induce spatially distinctive amplitude patterns of neural activity. The odor-specific information density is inferred to be uniform over the whole main bulb. The neural dynamics that produce these activity patterns emerge from the synaptically interactive sheet of excitatory mitral and inhibitory granule cells with distributed input and output tracts and with static non-linearities deriving from the nerve impulse mechanism. Excitatory synapses between mitral cells are subject to modification when odorants are paired with unconditioned stimuli, thus forming <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Odorant-specific information established by a stimulus locally in the bulbar unit activity is integrated with past experience by an assembly, disseminated over the entire bulb on the order of 100 mm 2 in area in a time period of 2. 5 ms, and sustained for a time period on the order of 0. 1 s. An arbitrary spatial sample on the order of 20 % of bulbar EEG activity captures the entire integrated information albeit at lesser resolution than the whole. This synaptic mechanism of local input and global output may be common to all of the cerebral cortex. The implications are discussed for neocortical sensory systems, motor pattern generators, and goal-directed behavior in the context of self-organizing non-linear dynamic systems...|$|R

By means of the double immunoperoxidase technique evidence was provided that somatostatin- and choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> in the striatum do not contain glucocorticoid receptor immunoreactivity. The density of glucocorticoid receptor-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> in the grey matter and the presence of clusters of glucocorticoid receptor-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> have been investigated in three fields located in the medial and central dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens at the coronal level A 8620 microns according to the König and Klippel atlas using computer-assisted image analysis. Every aggregate containing three or more glucocorticoid receptor-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>cells,</b> which had an intercenter distance less than the mean diameter (10 - 11 microns) of the striatal cells, was considered an island. A higher density of both glucocorticoid receptor-immunoreactive <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei and islands was found in the nucleus accumbens with respect to dorsal striatal areas. The most frequent island formed consisted of three to ten <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> both in dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens.
