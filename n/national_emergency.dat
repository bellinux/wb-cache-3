5|$|A second auction was held, with {{bids for}} natural gas given equal weight to those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would be obliged to maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} <b>national</b> <b>emergency.</b> Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful. Its bid of $143,127,000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property to the private sector following World War II.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} <b>national</b> <b>emergency</b> has an {{adverse effect on}} these rights. Under such a state, the rights conferred by Article 19 (freedoms of speech, {{assembly}} and movement, etc.) remain suspended. Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the President may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no desire to do so unless a <b>national</b> <b>emergency</b> that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E

5|$|On October26, the Honduran Permanent Contingency Commission {{coordinated with}} {{neighboring}} countries regarding the storm. Officials initially issued {{a state of}} emergency for the offshore islands and five coastal departments, which was later extended {{to the rest of the}} country. The government increased emergency spending and created a <b>National</b> <b>Emergency</b> Commission. Officials advised residents to evacuate in flood-prone areas, although many people stayed for fear of being looted. Some left to stay with relatives during the hurricane. Prisoners in Tegucigalpa Central Penitentiary were evacuated to the national stadium.|$|E
5|$|Over {{a stretch}} of four days, sixteen {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with Iris, affecting the Dominican Republic, the Cuban provinces of Granma and Santiago de Cuba, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Guatemala, Honduras and Belize.

5|$|Portions of {{the country}} faced {{shortages}} of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, {{as well as from}} Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year. This caused prices to increase, resulting in street protests. As a result, the World Food Programme provided 45tons of rice to affected residents, although persistent flooding disrupted relief work. In general, damage from Ernest and Felapi were less than that from Gafilo in the previous year. Madagascar's <b>National</b> <b>Emergency</b> Centre deployed workers to do search and rescue missions and provide water to storm victims.|$|E
50|$|Love FM {{guided the}} nation through the <b>national</b> <b>emergencies</b> {{brought on by}} Hurricanes Mitch, Keith, Chantal and Iris. In many villages, {{especially}} those in Southern Belize, Love FM's signal {{was the only one}} they could receive. An independent survey conducted by British Forces in 2006 showed that despite {{the fact that there are}} 36 radio stations in Belize today some 66.6 percent of those surveyed still rely on Love FM during <b>national</b> <b>emergencies</b> such as in Hurricane Dean in 2007.|$|R

Members of the active reserve have an annual minimum training obligation. Army and RAAF reservists may also volunteer for the high readiness reserve; this category of reservists have higher training and active service obligations. Members of the standby reserve are not required to undertake training, and would only be called up in response to a <b>national</b> <b>emergency</b> or to fill a specialised position. Most standby reservists are former full-time members of the ADF.|$|E

The cast included Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Eddie Izzard, Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was issued for the coastal locations north of Belize City with the forecast of 150mph (240km/h) winds. The government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from Belize City to the Mexican border. On August 16and17, Prime Minister Said Musa chaired two meetings of Belize's <b>National</b> <b>Emergency</b> Management Organization (NEMO). He instructed {{the newly created}} Coastguard to evacuate popular tourist sites Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye by boat and plane. Authorities also evacuated Belize City's three hospitals, moving high-risk patients inland to the capital Belmopan. The mayor urged residents to leave Belize City and {{to make use of}} shelters in the capital.|$|E
50|$|The {{signing of}} this Directive was {{generally}} {{not covered by the}} mainstream U.S. media or discussed by the U.S. Congress. While similar executive security directives have been issued by previous presidents, with their texts kept secret, this is the first to be made public in part. It is unclear how the National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive will reconcile with the <b>National</b> <b>Emergencies</b> Act, a U.S. federal law passed in 1976, which gives Congress oversight over presidential emergency powers during such <b>emergencies.</b> The <b>National</b> <b>Emergencies</b> Act is not mentioned in the text of the National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive.|$|R

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in <b>national</b> <b>emergency</b> broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, local Red Cross volunteers {{provided}} {{meals and}} clothing {{to thousands of}} storm victims. The government allocated $5.1million (Trinidad and Tobago dollars) for relief work, to be coordinated by the <b>National</b> <b>Emergency</b> Relief Organization of Trinidad and Tobago, which was established following the damaging Hurricane Flora in 1963. This helped rebuild damage houses, clear roads, and assist affected farmers. The United States Agency for International Development sent about $5,000 (USD) in assistance, after the country's ambassador sent a formal request to Washington, D.C. The Amoco oil company also sent a $500 (USD) donation to the country's Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on November27 and {{continuing}} through December3, the <b>National</b> <b>Emergency</b> Management Office in Palau issued {{more than ten}} detailed public announcements warning residents of the approaching storm and how to prepare. In response, numerous families boarded up their homes and sought refuge in the 45 public shelters opened across the republic. On December1, a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case requests for assistance were made after the storm. As a precautionary measure, the nations electric grid was shut down at 6:00p.m. local time on December2. All flights to and from Roman Tmetuchl International Airport were suspended during the morning of December3. A strict curfew {{was put in place}} for the city of Koror {{for the duration of the}} typhoon.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, sensing {{they were}} close to {{achieving}} suffrage, Rathbone & Stewart-Bright created Municipal Women's Association as {{a branch of the}} society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women voters and teaching women what to do when they had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women Suffrage Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's Suffrage Societies was taking, with its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the <b>national</b> <b>emergency</b> and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of war or}} <b>national</b> <b>emergency,</b> the Naval Staff was {{to become}} {{directly}} subordinate to the Supreme Command. The Naval Staff would command the fleet, river flotilla, Maritime Air Force and Naval Coastal Command. All other naval establishments would remain {{under the control of}} the Navy Section of the Ministry of Army and Navy. There were a few exceptions to these general arrangements. For example, the naval detachments on Lake Ohrid and Lake Scutari were subordinated to the local army districts, and the Naval Coastal Command was subordinated to the Royal Yugoslav Army's Coastal Defence Command. In case of mobilisation, the navy would need to requisition about 250 sea-going and 25 river vessels.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to last two weeks were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of <b>national</b> <b>emergency,</b> for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a general call to arms) {{in response to an}} invasion. The sejm could be extended if all the deputies agreed. No set time of a year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in late fall or early winter.|$|E
