5|$|After {{thirteen}} months, {{a shortage}} of funds forced Johnson to leave Oxford without a degree, and he returned to Lichfield. Towards the end of Johnson's stay at Oxford, his tutor, Jorden, left Pembroke {{and was replaced by}} William Adams. He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father because he could <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> transport them, and also because he hoped to return to Oxford soon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season. Hooper, along with three other strikers, was listed for {{transfer}} as Tilson looked to re-build his attack. Hereford had a bid accepted for Hooper after his successful loan spell, but could <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> match the larger transfer fees offered by other teams. Several other League One clubs were interested in him. Cheltenham Town had a bid accepted but Hooper eventually decided to move to Scunthorpe United.

5|$|Because of {{the need}} to defend against these incursions, the Byzantines could <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> use all their forces against the Persians. Heraclius sent an envoy to the Avar Khagan, saying that the Byzantines would pay a tribute in return for the Avars to {{withdraw}} north of the Danube. The Khagan replied by asking for a meeting on 5 June 623, at Heraclea in Thrace, where the Avar army was located; Heraclius agreed to this meeting, coming with his royal court. The Khagan, however, put horsemen en route to Heraclea to ambush and capture Heraclius, so they could hold him for ransom.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{time was}} {{on the side of}} the defenders; most armies could <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> wait out the {{prosecution}} of a siege, especially of a well-fortified, well-provisioned city. Until the invention of gunpowder-based weapons (and the resulting higher-velocity projectiles), the balance of power and logistics definitely favored the defender. With the introduction of large-caliber mortars and howitzers (in modern times), the traditional methods of defense became less effective against a determined siege, although many of the trace italienne fortresses presented a formidable challenge well into the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In late 1923, having {{decided not}} to return to Cambridge, Allen took {{a job in the}} City (London's {{financial}} district) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter.

He played cricket as often as he could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald's {{more than}} 15 years as premier brought {{fundamental}} changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government {{spent more than}} $100million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting the jobless to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government could <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.|$|E

By2007, most of the earmarked money was spent on preliminary engineering and planning. Without the money, Morgan Township officials could <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> upgrade the road, andODOT was barred from spending money on local roads. In2011, deputy director Steve Williams devised a new plan that made the township road a state route, and Morgan Township officials transferred the road to ODOT.|$|E

When he was 12 he heard a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony conducted by Erich Kleiber, which gave him the ambition to become a conductor. His parents could <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay for years of musical education, and his rich uncles did not consider music a suitable profession; from the age of 13 Solti paid for his education by giving piano lessons.|$|E

50|$|Many black farmers {{across the}} nation {{experienced}} discrimination in their dealings with U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies in their states.

On a national level, farm subsidies that were <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> white farmers were <b>not</b> <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> black farmers. Since they were denied government loans, emergency or disaster assistance, and other aid, many black farmers lost their farms and their homes.|$|R

The territory's primary source of revenue was from the sale of federal lands; the territory collected 3% of the proceeds of each sale. Property tax and trading ventures with the Native American tribes also provided lesser revenues.|$|E

The Edmonton Eskimos could <b>not</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> bring their players' families to the championship game.
