2500|$|Joplin {{moved to}} Sedalia, Missouri, in 1894 {{and earned a}} living as a piano teacher; there he taught future ragtime composers Arthur Marshall, Scott Hayden and Brun Campbell. Joplin began {{publishing}} music in 1895, and publication of his [...] "Maple Leaf Rag" [...] in 1899 brought him fame. This piece had a profound influence on subsequent writers of ragtime. It also brought the composer a steady income for life, though Joplin did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problems. In 1901 Joplin moved to St. Louis, where he continued to compose and publish music, and regularly performed in the St. Louis community. The score to his first opera A Guest of Honor was confiscated in 1903 with his belongings because of a <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills,</b> and is now considered lost. He continued to compose and publish music, and in 1907 moved to New York City to find a producer for a new opera. He attempted to go beyond the limitations of the musical form that made him famous, without much monetary success. His second opera, Treemonisha, was not received well at its partially staged performance in 1915.|$|E

In 2010 the average operational cost recovery was 105%, varying from 46% to 130% in Mulonga. According to one study, higher levels of cost recovery are impeded by a high level of non-revenue water (44% in 2010) and low collection efficiency due to a large extent to the <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> water <b>bills</b> by public institutions. Cost recovery is almost nonexistent in rural areas where most communities do not pay anything.|$|R

40|$|Purpose– This paper aims {{to report}} on the partial {{findings}} of a research project on risk allocation in public–private partnership (PPP) water projects. It identifies risk factors encountered in PPP water infrastructure projects, evaluates their associated risk levels and presents an authoritative risk factor list to assist the sector institutions to understand the important risks associated with such projects in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach– A ranking-type Delphi survey was conducted to develop a rank-order list of critical risk factors. Findings– Twenty critical risk factors with high impact on water PPPs were established. The top-five risks relate to foreign exchange rate, corruption, water theft, <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> and political interference. Originality/value– Being the pioneering study, it holds implications for practitioners. By prioritising the risks according to their relative impacts on the success of water PPP projects, public and private participants will become more aware of and leverage efforts and scarce resources to address those significant factors with serious consequences on projects objectives. The paper adopts a research approach that can be used by future researchers in similar environments where PPP is novel and experts are hard to find. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 2004, NTWH began having several {{financial}} problems which {{caused it to}} go into arrears on mortgage payments both with its New York studio and Belfast campus. This nearly culminated in a foreclosure auction in 2005, though NTWH was able to temporarily satisfy its debts by selling auxiliary buildings in Belfast. Later years, however, were more difficult for NTWH, and in 2010 the City of Belfast temporarily seized the Maine campus for <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> a sewer <b>bill.</b> Belfast City Manager Joe Slocum toured the building in January 2011 and found it abandoned and neglected.

40|$|Abstract Electricity is {{now more}} than a {{necessity}} and its need is increasing day by day resulting in power theft and power scarcity. The purpose of this project is to provide automatic control and monitoring of the Domestic Energy Meter enabling the Electricity Department to read meter readings without anyone visiting each house and also prevent electricity theft. This {{can be achieved by}} the use of a Microcontroller Unit that continuously monitors and records the Energy Meter readings in its permanent memory location. This system also makes use of a GSM module for remote monitoring and control of Energy Meter {{with the help of an}} interfacing circuitry. The Microcontroller based system continuously records the readings and the live meter reading can be sent to the Electricity department after a count period or on request. This system also can be used to disconnect the power supply to the house in case <b>of</b> <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>bills.</b> The Substation will be the receiving end. The data received is fed to a microcontroller at the Substation which will automatically calculate the bill based on tariff provider and display it...|$|R
40|$|Lagos {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing cities in Africa, which is {{grappling}} with the challenges of poorly managed urbanisation. With an estimated population of about 17. 5 million, solid waste management {{is one of the}} most pressing environmental challenges currently faced in the city. It is estimated that more than 9071847. 4 kg of urban waste is generated every day in the city. The city lacks the capacity to deal with such magnitude of waste. Consequently, the city has involved the private sector (private sector participation) in its waste management drive. This article examines the effectiveness of this public–private sector collaboration model in waste management in informal settlements in Lagos using empirical data. Major findings of the article include the irregularity of waste collection owing to a poor road network, an inadequate transport infrastructure and the desire to maximise profit, as well as poor waste handling and disposal methods by the private sector participation operators who are not chosen based on competence and capacity to perform. Another major finding is the lack of cooperation from residents evidenced in <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> and poor packaging of wastes, resulting in wastes being littered. The article concludes on the need to restructure the scheme through proper sensitisation of residents, selection of operators with demonstrable delivery capacity and provision of a well-maintained road network to facilitate access of operators to settlements...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{identify}} and evaluate the most significant risk factors that strongly affect the implementation of public–private partnership (PPP) water supply projects. PPP for water supply infrastructure services has seen continued growth {{over the past two}} decades, following public sector’s budgetary constraints and inability to provide infrastructure-based water services efficiently and cost effectively. However, these projects are often subjected to major risks leading to failures. Design/methodology/approach – Following extensive literature review and case study analyses, an international questionnaire survey was conducted with practicing and experienced PPP experts to establish the significant risks in PPP water projects. Both the probability of occurrence and severity of 40 risks were evaluated by the expert panel to determine their significance and impact on water projects procured under the PPP arrangement. Findings – The paper presents a derived risk factor list, ranks the factors and describes the “top-ranked” risk factors as: poor contract design, water pricing and tariff review uncertainty, political interference, public resistance to PPP, construction time and cost overrun, <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills,</b> lack of PPP experience, financing risk, faulty demand forecasting, high operational costs and conflict between partners. Originality/value – This factor list broadens PPP stakeholders’ view of important project risks, rather than relying on culture-dependent studies – an area that has received less attention in PPP risk management research. The identified risk factors would provide governments and investors a useful tool in implementing constructive water PPPs by facilitating the development of risk mitigation strategies, particularly for developing countries with poor risk management practices.

40|$|Purpose– The public‐private {{partnership}} (PPP) procurement approach {{enables the}} development and management of public infrastructure and services through leveraging private capital, management expertise, and creative commercial skills. This approach, pursued by the Ghanaian Government in {{the development and}} management of water supply services, contains a plethora of risks resulting from the complexity and dynamic interactions between municipal and central governments (pursuing monetary and political goals), public movements, private water operators, and international donors pursuing their own objectives. The paper seeks to increase awareness of the risks that can erode or reduce potential benefits of PPPs in the water supply sector. Design/methodology/approach– A research approach integrating a literature survey and case study is adopted. A rigorous literature review of PPP risks is first undertaken. Based on six case studies carried out in the Ghanaian water supply sector, this paper identifies and categorises the risks specific to water supply PPP contracts in Ghana. Findings– A total of 40 risk factors are identified, classified into eight categories based on their sources and their content presented in detail. Common risks which are worth practitioners' attention include weak regulatory and monitoring regime; financing; absence of risk allocation mechanisms; inexperience in PPPs; public opposition; delayed and <b>non‐payment</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills,</b> etc. Originality/value– A comprehensive list of risks associated with water supply projects in Ghana has been identified. This list will aid practitioners, municipal and central government authorities, and the domestic and the (potential) international private sector audience in managing risks involved in such projects.

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} how rainwater harvesting can satisfactorily reduce {{the social and}} economic impact on the population, resulting from development and increasing water tariff within the Colombo metropolitan area of Sri Lanka. The vision of the government of Sri Lanka is to stimulate substantial growth, by the development of the Colombo metropolitan area, which will be a hub of economic and development activities in the 21 st century. This will result in a major increase in the demand for suitable water, which is presently met by surface water resources. The population in the area will encounter serious problems of using ground water {{due to a lack of}} lands to dig wells and the issue of increasing ground water pollution. Thus people will have to depend on pipe borne water for their domestic needs. However due to increasing water tariff, many have found difficulty in paying their water <b>bills.</b> <b>Non-payment</b> <b>of</b> water <b>bills</b> result in disconnection of water supply. Unlike other services such as electricity and telecommunication, water is a critical human need and people experience adverse social pressures without access to adequate amounts of water.

25|$|During {{her life}} as a courtesan, her {{discretion}} and loyalty to her benefactors became the focal point of her career. There were many rumours about her being involved with certain wealthy men of the time, but she never confirmed or denied these rumours. This gave her great weight in the courtesan lifestyle, and made her a sought-after commodity. It also gave long life to her career, and helped her to retire a wealthy woman of society around 1890. Her estate was worth a very considerable £2,764 19s. 6d at her death. As well as her home in Mayfair, which according to DNB she had from 1872, she seems to have had other addresses, judging from a court case in which she was sued for <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> a tailoring <b>bill.</b> The other addresses may have been properties she owned.

500|$|Joplin's {{principal}} {{claim to fame}} was the publication in 1899 of the Maple Leaf Rag, which became a best-selling instrumental hit, and provided the composer with a steady income {{for the rest of}} his life from the royalties. Despite this success early on in his career (he was named as the [...] "King of Ragtime" [...] by numerous contemporaries), he had continued financial problems and never repeated the success of the Maple Leaf Rag. In the fall of 1903, Joplin lost a large amount of money on the national tour of his first opera, A Guest of Honor, when the box office receipts were stolen by an unidentified associate. Joplin's belongings, including the score for the opera, were confiscated for <b>non-payment</b> <b>of</b> his boarding-house <b>bills.</b> The opera is now considered lost, as no copy was registered with the Copyright Office, and none has been found since.
