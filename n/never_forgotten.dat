5|$|Wiesenthal {{has been}} the subject of several documentaries. The Art of Remembrance: Simon Wiesenthal was {{produced}} in 1994 by filmmakers Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel for River Lights Pictures. The documentary I Have <b>Never</b> <b>Forgotten</b> You: The Life and Legacy of Simon Wiesenthal, narrated by Nicole Kidman, was released by Moriah Films in 2007.

5|$|It is {{commonly}} thought that Bachelier's work gained little attention and was forgotten for decades {{until it was}} rediscovered in the 1950s by the Leonard Savage, and then become more popular after Bachelier's thesis was translated into English in 1964. But the work was <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> in the mathematical community, as Bachelier published a book in 1912 detailing his ideas, which was cited by mathematicians including Doob, Feller and Kolomogorov. The book continued to be cited, but then starting in the 1960s the original thesis by Bachelier began to be cited more than his book when economists started citing Bachelier's work.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked outside was {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> it. Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E

25|$|Historian Donald R. Shaffer {{maintained}} that the gains during Reconstruction for African Americans were not entirely extinguished. The legalization of African-American marriages and families and the independence of black churches from white denominations were a source of strength during the Jim Crow era. Reconstruction was <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> within the black community and it remained a source of inspiration. The system of sharecropping granted blacks {{a considerable amount of}} freedom as compared to slavery.|$|E
25|$|Under Sultans Selim I and Ahmed II {{there were}} two Ottoman {{attempts}} to convert the church into a mosque (the last one, pursued by Grand Vizier Ali Koprülü {{at the end of}} the seventeenth century, was thwarted by Dimitrie Cantemir) and, thanks to the grants of Mehmed II and Bayazid II, the church remained a parish of the Greek community. Thus, Saint Mary of the Mongols is one among the few Byzantine churches of Istanbul whose ancient dedication was <b>never</b> <b>forgotten.</b>|$|E
25|$|Around 1836, Prešeren finally {{realized}} that his love for Julija would never become mutual. The same year, he met Ana Jelovšek, with whom he entered into a permanent relationship. They had three children, but never married. Prešeren supported Ana financially and treated her as his rightful mate, but engaged in several other love affairs at the same time. He also {{spent a lot of}} time travelling throughout Carniola, especially to Lake Bled, from the scenery of which he drew inspiration for his poems. In 1846, Prešeren was finally allowed to open his own law firm and moved to Kranj with his family. He died there on 8 February 1849. Upon his deathbed he confessed that he had <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> Julija.|$|E

Since 1997, SURF has been advocating and fundraising internationally in support of the efforts of grassroots survivors organisations in Rwanda, including IBUKA (National Umbrella of Survivors’ Organisations), AVEGA (Association of Widows of the Genocide), AOCM (Association of Orphan-Headed Households), Uyisenga N'Manzi (Organisation of Child Survivors with HIV/AIDS) and Solace Ministries (Christian Survivors Support Organisation). Its focus is to ensure that the voices of survivors are listened to and heard, memories of the genocide are kept alive, victims of the genocide are <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> and survivors of the genocide are supported in Rwanda, and in the UK where it is based.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{economic}} growth and success in diplomatic relations, the government that gained power by coup d'etat was essentially a military regime and the public's support and trust in it was low when the promises for democratic reform never materialized. In the 1985 National Assembly elections, opposition parties won more votes than the government party, clearly indicating that the public wanted a change. Many started to sympathize with the protesting students. The Gwangju Massacre was <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> and in January 1987, when a protesting Seoul National University student died under police interrogation, public fury was immense. In April 1987, President Chun made a declaration that measures would be taken to protect the current constitution, instead of reforming it {{to allow for the}} direct election of the president. This announcement consolidated and strengthened the opposition; in June 1987, more than a million students and citizens participated in the nationwide anti-government protests of the June Democracy Movement.|$|E
500|$|In 1912, when Olivier was five, {{his father}} secured a {{permanent}} appointment as assistant priest at St Saviour's, Pimlico. He held the post for six years, and a stable family life was at last possible. Olivier {{was devoted to}} his mother, but not to his father, whom he found a cold and remote parent. Nevertheless, he {{learned a great deal}} of the art of performing from him. As a young man Gerard Olivier had considered a stage career and was a dramatic and effective preacher. Olivier wrote that his father knew [...] "when to drop the voice, when to bellow about the perils of hellfire, when to slip in a gag, when suddenly to wax sentimental... The quick changes of mood and manner absorbed me, and I have <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> them." ...|$|E

500|$|Conditions, however, had not {{improved}} since the earlier attempt. Temperatures had risen {{and it was}} uncomfortably warm, with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges. [...] On 27 December ship’s carpenter Harry McNish rebelled and refused to work. He argued that Ship’s Articles had lapsed since Endurance’s sinking, {{and that he was}} no longer under orders. Shackleton’s firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel, but the incident was <b>never</b> <b>forgotten.</b> [...] Two days later, with only seven and a half miles’ (12km) progress achieved in seven back-breaking days, Shackleton called a halt, observing: [...] "It would take us over three hundred days to reach the land". The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called [...] "Patience Camp", which would be their home for more than three months.|$|E
500|$|Pismachi' (sometimes {{referred}} to as Ismachi') occupies a small plateau [...] south of the site core and is surrounded by steep ravines. The plateau is separated from the Q'umarkaj plateau by the ravine containing the Ismachi' river. Pismachi' was the K'iche' capital before it was moved to nearby Q'umarkaj, and was probably founded early in the 14th century. Its location was <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> by the local K'iche's although it was {{from time to time}} lost by outside investigators. French missionary Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg located Pismachi' {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, it was then lost until it was relocated in 1956 by Jorge Guillemín, working in collaboration with the government of Guatemala, the location was reconfirmed by Robert Carmack in 1969. Although the Pismachi' plateau is twice the size of the Q'umarkaj plateau, the ruins occupy a small area on the southeast portion of the hilltop. The ruins are still used for the rituals of modern K'iche' shamans.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Ward, then a {{probate court}} judge in Wayne County, said that Ford never {{mentioned}} the incident to him, but that Ford's brother later {{told him about}} it. [...] “Jerry was very concerned,” Ward recalled. [...] “His brother told me, ‘Jerry was so upset he wrote father asking him if he should quit the team. He was that angry.’” [...] At Ford's funeral, President George W. Bush also spoke about the Willis Ward incident. Bush said: “Long before he was known in Washington, Gerald Ford showed his character and his leadership. As a star football player for the University of Michigan, he {{came face to face}} with racial prejudice when Georgia Tech came to Ann Arbor for a football game. One of Michigan's best players was an African American student named Willis Ward. Georgia Tech said they would not take the field if a black man were allowed to play. Gerald Ford was furious at Georgia Tech for making the demand, and for the University of Michigan for caving in. He agreed to play only after Willis Ward personally asked him to. The stand Gerald Ford took that day was <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> by his friend.” ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the banquet, the Globe {{published}} an interview with “Hike”’s high school football coach, Robert Reihsen. On the day of the banquet, the Bessemer Herald ran an editorial urging the city of Ramsay to name a street or park in Heikkinen’s honor: “Ramsay has never received the national publicity that its native son, Ralph Heikkinen, has brought to it this fall. By newspapers, magazines and radio the Gogebic range’s first All-American football star has brought renown to himself, his home town and his school. If Ramsay has any street, public building, park or athletic field, that are now without title, or the names of which can be changed, why not dedicate something to Ralph Heikkinen who has so nobly proved himself to be Bessemer township’s leading citizen for 1938? Other communities have done as much for their heroes. As far as the University of Michigan is concerned Heikkinen has already written his name forever on the athletic scroll of honor. He takes his place with a long line of All-American Wolverines. They are <b>never</b> <b>forgotten</b> at the Ann Arbor institution.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} {{is regularly}} the subject or inspiration of other artistic projects. In 1931, Will Longstaff painted Ghosts of Vimy Ridge, depicting ghosts of {{men from the}} Canadian Corps on Vimy Ridge surrounding the memorial, though the memorial was still several years away from completion. The memorial {{has been the subject}} of stamps in both France and Canada, including a French series in 1936 and a Canadian series on the 50th anniversary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The Canadian Unknown Soldier was selected from a cemetery in the vicinity of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and the design of the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is based upon the stone sarcophagus at the base of the Vimy memorial. The <b>Never</b> <b>Forgotten</b> National Memorial was intended to be a [...] statue inspired by the Canada Bereft statue on the memorial, before the project was cancelled in February 2016. A 2001 Canadian historical novel The Stone Carvers by Jane Urquhart involves the characters in the design and creation of the memorial. In 2007, the memorial was a short-listed selection for the Seven Wonders of Canada. The Royal Canadian Mint released commemorative coins featuring the memorial on several occasions, including a 5cent sterling silver coin in 2002 and a 30dollar sterling silver coin in 2007. The Sacrifice Medal, a Canadian military decoration created in 2008, features the image of Mother Canada on the reverse side of the medal. A permanent bas relief sculpted image of the memorial is presented in the gallery of the grand hall of the Embassy of France in Canada to symbolize the close relations between the two countries. The memorial is featured on the reverse of the Frontier Series Canadian polymer $20 banknote, which was released by the Bank of Canada on 7 November 2012.|$|E
