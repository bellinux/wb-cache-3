5|$|In 2006, Luka Ploče d.d. started {{developing}} a new bulk cargo terminal, a <b>new</b> <b>container</b> terminal and a distribution center, implementing IT systems throughout port facilities and operations, and enhancing logistical support to increase the competitiveness of the Ploče transport route. Funding of €91million was approved on November 20, 2006, consisting of a €58.8million loan from the World Bank, a €11.2million loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a provision of €21million by Croatia. By August 2010, €44.2M of the total had been spent, and the <b>new</b> <b>container</b> terminal was opened.|$|E
25|$|The ancient port {{stretched}} from the 'Am Zollhafen' street northwards to the Nordbrücke. Since {{the area had}} become constrained for modern-day port operations, a section of riverfront {{to the north of}} the bridge had been selected for a <b>new</b> <b>container</b> terminal. Part of the existing areas of the harbor will be transformed into a residential quarter. The <b>new</b> <b>container</b> terminal is intended to raise the container volumes sufficiently to push the port back into the Top 5 of German river container ports.|$|E
25|$|The Port of Oslo is {{developing}} a <b>new</b> <b>container</b> terminal at Sjursøya.

40|$|The {{markets for}} glass {{container}} cullet can be broadly thought of in two main categories: (1) <b>new</b> glass <b>containers,</b> and (2) all other uses. While the glass container manufacturers can theoretically {{use all the}} color sorted cullet collected to make <b>new</b> <b>containers,</b> for many communities, there are significant barriers of transportation cost {{and the problem of}} either marketing mixed colors, or, more recently, having them processed with electro-mechanical glass sorting equipment. On the other hand, the recovery of glass for non-container uses has been growing rapidly, in fact, much faster than the recovery of glass to make <b>new</b> <b>containers,</b> as shown in the next table: US Glass Recovery, in Ton...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the application of}} dengue mosquito-proof water containers in the reduction of dengue mosquito population (both adult and larvae) and the acceptance and satisfaction of community in <b>new</b> <b>containers</b> usage. Methods: A community intervention was carried out from July- 2008 to October- 2009 in Dong Thanh commune, Can Giuoc district, Long An province, Vietnam. A cluster of 100 households that has a relative separate position from surrounding areas were supplied with mosquito-proof water containers, every household with two containers installed under the roof-gutters; and another cluster of households in another hamlet of the same commune used normal water containers. Evaluation {{of the changes in}} Aedes aegypti (A. aegypti) population and usage of <b>new</b> water <b>containers</b> were conducted quarterly. Assessment of the acceptance and satisfaction of community was done {{by the end of the}} project. Results: The number of larvae per concrete tank in the intervention area were lower than those in the control area in most survey rounds with statistic significance in the first, second and fourth surveys (P < 0. 05). The number of larvae per new tank were lower than those per jars in the intervention site with statistic significance from the second to fifth surveys (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 001, P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05 respectively). However, with the presence of old containers, vector indices did not change in the intervention area. More than 94 percent households kept their containers tightly covered with two nets and used their <b>new</b> <b>containers</b> by taps in all the survey rounds. Average of times of cleaning <b>new</b> water <b>containers</b> during three months were small, changing from 0. 40 to 0. 80 times. Number of old jars decreased regularly from means of 5. 3 to 2. 24 by survey rounds and the number in the fifth suvey were statistically lower than in the second survey (P < 0. 001). 100 percent households accepted the <b>new</b> <b>containers</b> and 96 percent households said they had ability to repair a broken nets/tapa or their materials. Conclusions: <b>New</b> <b>containers</b> prevented the development of A. aegypti mosquitos better than the same normal concrete containers and jars with statistic significance. Most households accepted, satisfied and used <b>new</b> <b>containers</b> in correct way and they could maintain <b>new</b> <b>containers</b> by themselves. However, the continuance of use of old water containers affected on the entomological indices...|$|R

25|$|In the 1970s, {{containerisation}} revolutionised shipping, eventually {{coming to}} New Zealand as well. The local harbour boards wrought massive changes on those ports selected (after much political wrangling) {{to handle the}} new giant vessels, such as Lyttelton and Auckland Port. Gantry cranes, straddle carriers and powerful tugboats were built or purchased, and shipping channels dredged deeper, while large areas of land were reclaimed to enable the <b>new</b> <b>container</b> terminals. The changes {{have been described as}} having been more radical than the changeover from sail to steam a century before.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2012 the FEC {{began an}} {{aggressive}} project to reopen direct rail {{service to the}} ports of Miami, and Port Everglades. This is {{in anticipation of the}} expansion of the Panama Canal and the expected increase of intermodal traffic. In 2013 the drawbridge at the Port of Miami was repaired and reactivated and trains began to roll. In 2014 a <b>new</b> <b>container</b> shuttle was put into operation between Hialeah Yard and the Port of Miami. Also in 2014, the new rail lines into Port Everglades were opened allowing direct access for FEC trains into the port. Further a new transfer facility in Hialeah Yard will add additional intermodal transfer between trains, trucks, and planes. This facility will open by 2015. Additional capacity improvements are planned at other ports as well as the FEC's mainline.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Gulftainer {{signed a}} major joint venture {{agreement}} with Prominvest, the financial and investment arm of Russian State Corporation, Russian Technologies to develop projects in Russia.

In the same year Gulftainer was awarded the concession to develop and operate a <b>new</b> <b>container</b> terminal at the Port of Tripoli in Northern Lebanon The concession is for 25 years with an investment of over USD 60 million in new equipment and machinery. In June 2013, Gulftainer completed a major acquisition by securing the majority shareholding in Saudi Arabia's Gulf Stevedoring Contracting Company (GSCCO) almost doubling the company size.

25|$|Containers are {{intended}} to be used constantly, being loaded with new cargo for a new destination soon after having been emptied of previous cargo. This is not always possible, and in some cases, the cost of transporting an empty container {{to a place where}} it can be used is considered to be higher than the worth of the used container. Shipping lines and container leasing companies have become expert at repositioning empty containers from areas of low or no demand, such as the US West Coast, to areas of high demand, such as China. Repositioning within the port hinterland has also been the focus of recent logistics optimization work. However, damaged or retired containers may also be recycled in the form of shipping container architecture, or the steel content salvaged. In the summer of 2010, a worldwide shortage of containers developed as shipping increased after the recession, while <b>new</b> <b>container</b> production had largely ceased.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads region had {{achieved}} the greatest growth and prosperity, chiefly because of employment related to Federal {{government agencies and}} defense, {{as well as an}} increase in technology in Northern Virginia. Shipping through the Port of Hampton Roads began expansion which continued into the early 21st century as <b>new</b> <b>container</b> facilities were opened. Coal piers in Newport News and Norfolk had recorded major gains in export shipments by August 2008. The recent expansion of government programs in the areas near Washington has profoundly affected the economy of Northern Virginia whose population has experienced large growth and great ethnic/ cultural diversification, exemplified by communities such as Tysons Corner, Reston and dense, urban Arlington. The subsequent growth of defense projects has also generated a local information technology industry. In recent years, intolerably heavy commuter traffic and the urgent need for both road and rail transportation improvements have been a major issue in Northern Virginia. The Hampton Roads region has also experienced much growth, as have the western suburbs of Richmond in both Henrico and Chesterfield Counties.|$|E
