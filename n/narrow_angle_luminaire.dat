40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} the mechanical effects of pilocarpine on the trabecular-iris angle opening in eyes with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles,</b> compared with {{its effects on}} healthy control subjects with wide <b>angles.</b>  METHODS—A <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> was defined as 25 ° or less of trabecular-iris angle on ultrasound biomicroscopic examination. The change in anterior chamber depth (ACD), trabecular-iris angle (TIA), angle opening distance (AOD, distance between trabecular meshwork and iris) measured at 250  µm and 500  µm from the scleral spur (AOD 250 and AOD 500), and iris thickness was determined in 30  eyes of 30  patients (13  men and 17  women, between 63  and 82  years (mean 70. 4  years)) with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> and in 30  sex and age matched control subjects with wide angles before and 1  hour after the instillation of 2 % pilocarpine hydrochloride by ultrasound biomicroscopy.  RESULTS—In all eyes with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles,</b> pilocarpine increased the TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; these changes increased significantly and linearly as the corresponding pretreatment values decreased (r =  0. 807, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 787, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 852, p =  0. 0001). Of 30  eyes with wide angles, 23  eyes whose ACD was 2670  µm and more showed {{a decrease in the}} TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500; the changes in TIA, AOD 250, and AOD 500 also significantly correlated with the corresponding pretreatment values (r =  0. 913, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 882, p =  0. 0001; r =  0. 895, p =  0. 0001). Pilocarpine induced a smaller decrease in ACD in eyes with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> than in those with wide angles (p =  0. 0001). There was a linear correlation between the increase in ACD change and the decrease in pretreatment ACD in eyes with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> and those with wide angles (r =  0. 781, p =  0. 0003; r =  0. 798, p =  0. 0001).  CONCLUSIONS—The finding that pilocarpine increases angular width in patients with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> indicates that this agent is useful for treating patients with <b>narrow</b> <b>angles</b> and angle closure glaucoma. The prediction of the pilocarpine induced change in the angle may assist ophthalmologists in treating such patients. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} biometrically {{the differences}} between plateau iris configuration (PIC) eyes and primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes. METHODS: A comparative study involving a case series with 20 eyes of 11 plateau iris configuration patients and 45 eyes of 27 primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes patients was done. The following measurements were taken: corneal curvature, central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness (LT), axial length (AL), lens thickness and axial length ratio, lens position (LP) and relative lens position (RLP). RESULTS: The plateau iris configuration eyes presented a higher corneal cuvature value than primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes eyes but not with clinical and statistical difference (P= 0. 090). The plateau iris configuration eyes demonstrated a higher central corneal thickness, with statistical significance, when compared to primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes (P= 0. 010). Statistical significant difference between plateau iris configuration and primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes was found in axial length (21. 69 ± 0. 98 vs. 22. 42 ± 0. 89; P= 0. 003). No {{significant difference was found}} when anterior chamber depth (2. 62 ± 0. 23 vs. 2. 71 ± 0. 31; P= 0. 078), LT (4. 67 ± 0. 36 vs. 4. 69 ± 0. 45; P= 0. 975), LT/AL (2. 16 ± 0. 17 vs. 2. 10 ± 0. 21; P= 0. 569), LP (4. 95 ± 0. 25 vs. 5. 06 ± 0. 34; P= 0. 164) and RLP (0. 23 ± 0. 01 vs. 0. 22 ± 0. 14; P= 0. 348) were evaluated. CONCLUSION: The eyes with plateau iris configuration presented statistical significantly shorter axial length and higher central corneal thickness than primary open <b>angle</b> glaucoma with <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> eyes...|$|R

The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200mm focal length wide-angle lens with an aperture of f/3 (the wide angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1500mm narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> camera).|$|R
40|$|An optics {{study was}} {{performed}} to establish a candidate optical system design for the proposed NASA Mariner Jupiter/Saturn 77 mission. The study was performed over the 6 -month period from January through June 1972. The candidate optical system contains both a wide angle (A) and a <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> (B) lens. An additional feature is a transfer mirror mechanism that allows image transfer from the B lens to the vidicon initially used for the A lens. This feature adds an operational redundancy to the optical system in allowing for <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> viewing if the <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> vidicon were to fail. In this failure mode, photography in the wide angle mode would be discontinued. The structure of the candidate system consists mainly of aluminum with substructures of Invar for athermalization. The total optical system weighs (excluding vidicons) approximately 30 pounds and has overall dimensions of 26. 6 by 19. 5 by 12. 3 inches...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a technique that allows SIM to measure relative stellar positions with an accuracy of 1 micro-arcsecond {{at any time during}} its 5 -yr mission. Unlike SIM's standard narrow-angle approach, Gridless <b>Narrow</b> <b>Angle</b> Astrometry (GNAA) does not rely on the global reference frame of grid stars that reaches full accuracy after 5 years. GNAA is simply the application of traditional single-telescope <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> techniques to SIM's <b>narrow</b> <b>angle</b> optical path delay measure-ments. In GNAA, a set of reference stars and a target star are observed at several baseline orientations. A linearized model uses delay measurements to solve for star positions and baseline orientations. A conformal transformation maps observa-tions at different epochs to a common reference frame. The technique works on short period signals (P=days to months), allowing it to be applied to many of the known extra-solar planets, intriguing radio/X- ray binaries, and other periodic sources. The technique's accuracy is limited in the long-term by false acceleration due to a combination of reference star and target star proper motion.
