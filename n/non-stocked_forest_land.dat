The farm analysed is situated in the highest parts of the Novohradské Hory mountain region, District of Český Krumlov. The altitude of anthropogenic <b>non-stocked</b> <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> oscillates about 850 m above sea level, and covers an area which {{was included in the}} border zone of the state border with Austria until recently. The main production programme of the farm is animal production, namely cattle breeding without a market milk production. The SWOT analysis method was used to analyse subjective as well as objective presumptions of suitability of the farm for conversion purposes. It was used to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The results achieved were used for assessment and comparison with information processed in bibliography. The facts revealed indicated that the current state of conventional farming already fully corresponds to the principles and requirements applied in the organic farming systems. At the end it was stated that the farm has the best presumptions for a successful conversion...|$|E

Vegetational areas were defined in five broad classes: Merchantable Douglas-fir Stands, Non-merchantable Douglas-fir Stands, Oak- Madrone Stands, Non- <b>forest</b> <b>Lands,</b> and <b>Non-stocked</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Lands.</b> Rate of spread, difficulty of control, and final size were used as indications of fire behavior. Fire weather severity, slope steepness, aspect, and the vegetational cover type in vicinity of the fire were the environmental factors considered. Five hundred twenty-four fires were sampled in this analysis. The data were fitted to a statistical model for analysis. From this analysis, the importance of the environmental factors on rate of spread, difficulty of control, and final size was tested; tri-variate response surfaces were developed, representing rate of fire spread and difficulty of control according to each vegetational cover type. There were marked differences in the rate of fire spread and resistance to control of a fire in the five generalized cover types studied. Each vegetational cover type, therefore, possesses certain characteristics that suggest a certain level of fire hazard existing during the fire season...|$|R

The analysis of the communes around studied urban centres allows for the assessment of the local governments’ spatial development policy with reference to <b>forest</b> <b>lands.</b> The paper shows how local authorities prevent these lands from disappearing and how closely this task is related to the usage of the spatial information instruments such as land use plans (spatial development plans).

40|$|We {{evaluated}} how {{the management}} and use of public <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> administered by Minnesota county land departments changed once these forests were transferred to private ownership. To characterize these changes, the individuals and organizations who purchased <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> from Minnesota's county land departments were surveyed using a mail questionnaire. The sale of county <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> {{did not appear to}} produce noticeable changes in timber harvesting or the level of investment in forest management. However, the level of professional forestry expertise overseeing the management of these lands declined considerably. Additionally, while nearly all <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> managed by county land departments {{is open to the public}} for recreation, more than half became posted to prohibit public trespass after it was sold. From 2002 - 2005, county land departments generated approximately US$ 12. 3 million in real annual net income, or US$ 4. 53 per acre.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{economics}} of conversion and fragmentation of <b>forest</b> <b>land.</b> The forestry economics literature has generally focussed on the management of a single stand for timber and nontimber forest benefits with little attention being paid to <b>forest</b> level <b>land</b> use decisions, and in particular forest stand interactions. As noted by Bowes and Krutilla (1989), the focus on a single stand may be a considerable weakness of the multiple-use <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use models given that the provision of nontimber forest benefits, such as biodiversity storage, watershed protection and micro-climatic maintenance, often depend on the setting of a single stand within a larger forest area. If this is the case, then decisions about <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use and allocation need {{to take account of}} the interaction between the stand and the total stock of <b>forest</b> <b>land.</b> The nature of the relationship between stand and total stock of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> is of central importance. In this paper, we define three cases that reflect a range of typical stand-stock relationships that may arise: those being constant, diminishing and increasing marginal returns to the scale of the total forest stock. We explore the <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> use decision {{from the perspective of a}} social planner. Taking stand-total forest stock interactions effects into account has important implications for the choice of framework for the economic analysis as well as for the <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation decision. This paper shows that it is not just the level of forest conversion that may be affected by taking stand-stock interactions into account, but also the spatial distribution of the remaining patches of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> for the provision of non-timber forest benefits. The insights from this paper are particularly applicable to those tropical forest regions facing high rates of forest conversion and fragmentation. Policy implications, such as the establishment of minimum viable forest stocks, buffer zones and corridors, are discusse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Although forest {{devolution}} {{has become}} a major trend in forest governance in developing countries over the last two decades, there is increasing concern about the legitimacy of this well-intentioned policy. Examination of Vietnam’s <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation policy helps assess this concern. After the collapse of Vietnam’s state forestry in the late 1980 s, the Vietnamese government allocated <b>forest</b> <b>lands</b> to individuals, households and organizations for more effective forest protection and rehabilitation. Despite this expectation, the policy has been challenged by increasing conflicts between forestry agencies and local people over lands. This paper uses a case study in Tay Ninh province, South Vietnam, to examine the legitimacy of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation, with particular focus on local support for the policy. Initial research findings reveal that, because of some gaps in the policy strategy to gain legitimacy, calculations on short-term incomes have overwhelmed other determinants of local support for <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> allocation.

Research on <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> changes at the county level about its characteristics, rules, and spatial patterns is, therefore, important for regional resource protection and the sustainable development of the social economy. In this study we selected the GIS and Geoda software package to explore the spatial disparities of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> changes at the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area county level, based on the global and local spatial autocorrelation analyses of exploratory spatial data. The results show that: 1) during 1985 - 2000, the global spatial autocorrelation of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> change is significant in the study area. The global Moran's I value is 0. 3122 for the entire time period and indicates significant positive spatial correlation (p < 0. 05). Moran's I value of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> change decreases from 0. 3084 at the time stage I to 0. 3024 at the time stage II; 2) the spatial clustering characteristics of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> changes appear on the whole in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Moran's I value decreases from the time stage I to time stage II, which means that trend of spatial clustering of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> change is weakened in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area; 3) the grid map of the local Moran's I for each county reflects local spatial homogeneity of <b>forest</b> <b>land</b> change, which means that spatial clustering about regions of high value and low value is especially significant.
