40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the behavior of}} spherical pulse solutions of semilinear wave equations {{in the limit of}} short wavelength. In three space dimensions we study the behavior of solutions which are described by <b>nonlinear</b> geometric <b>optics</b> away from the focal point. With a natural subcriticality hypothesis on the nonlinearity we prove that the possibly nonlinear effects at the focal point do not affect the usual description in terms of the Maslov index. That is one has <b>nonlinear</b> geometric <b>optics</b> before and after the focal point with only the usual phase shift of- 1. The reason is that the nonlinear effects occur on too small a set. We obtain a global asymptotic description which includes an approximation near the caustic, which is a solution of the free wave equation. 1.

40|$|Abstract. The proles (a. k. a. amplitudes) which {{enter in}} the {{approximate}} solutions of <b>nonlinear</b> geometric <b>optics</b> satisfy equations, {{sometimes called the}} slowly varying amplitude equations, which are simpler than the original hyper-bolic systems. When the underlying problem is conservative one often nds that the amplitudes are dened for all time and are uniformly bounded. The approximations of <b>nonlinear</b> geometric <b>optics</b> typically have percentage error which tends to zero uniformly on bounded time intervals as the wavelength tends to zero. Under suitable hypotheses when the amplitude is uniformly bounded {{in space and time}} we show that the percentage error tends to zero uniformly on time intervals [0; Cj ln j] which grow logarithmically. The proof relies in an essential way on the fact that one has a corrector to the leading term of geometric optics. 1...|$|R
