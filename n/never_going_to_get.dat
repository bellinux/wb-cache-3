500|$|As {{with the}} ISKCON-inspired [...] "Awaiting on You All", Allison views the {{conditions}} that Harrison imposes in the song's choruses as a rare exception within the singer's work. Elsewhere, Allison continues, Harrison's songwriting reveals [...] "a strong belief in the efficacy of unmerited divine grace". In a 1982 interview, Harrison described his statement on God rewarding those who first look to God as a [...] "flexible" [...] one, adding: [...] "In one way, I'm <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of here [...] unless it's by His grace, but then again … he amount of grace I would expect from God should be equal {{to the amount of}} grace I can gather or earn." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards breaking up with someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are not all about how [...] "a boy broke your heart and you're <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on your feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E

Theroux and a BBC film crew spent three weeks in Topeka, Kansas, gathering information on the 71 members of the organisation. In an article for The Guardian, Theroux noted, [...] "It was fascinating to see {{the power of a}} family to create its own bizarre ideology and pass it down through the generations." [...] In a statement in The Age, Theroux posited, [...] "Maybe, through my enthusiasm, people reveal more of themselves than they may have intended. The show is laughing at me, adrift in their world, as much as at them." [...] The Western Mail quoted Theroux on how he selects subject matter which interests him, [...] "The subjects I'm interested in are quite extreme.

500|$|Abrams had {{at first}} been {{concerned}} about casting a Korean-American as a Japanese character, but George Takei reassured him that Sulu had been meant to represent all of Asia on Enterprise, so Abrams went ahead with Cho. Cho acknowledged that being an Asian-American, [...] "there are certain acting roles that you are <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get,</b> {{and one of them}} is playing a cowboy. [...] is a realization of that dream – going into space." [...] He cited the masculinity of the character as being important to him, and spent two weeks fight training. Although Cho suffered an injury to his wrist during filming, a representative reassured the public that the injury was [...] "no big deal". James Kyson Lee had originally been interested in playing the part of Sulu, but both he and Quinto, who had already been cast as Spock, were at the time members of the cast of the television series Heroes, and its producers told Lee they did not want to lose another cast member for three months.|$|E
500|$|Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng {{wanted the}} film to look [...] "grittier and less clean and glossy" [...] than other superhero films, and decided to shoot with digital cameras but add film grain in {{post-production}} to keep texture in the images. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, opposed to Panavision primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. Exterior scenes in the film have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with [...] "unpredictable" [...] weather. For instance, the production had use of the Georgia Viaduct for two weeks, and [...] "just had to keep shooting, rain or shine, because once our permit expired on the bridge, we were <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it back." [...] Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep the look consistent. Production designer Sean Haworth also worked closely with Miller, who had specific ideas for the sets. The production {{had to be very}} specific about which elements of each set were built physically to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI, and a gimbal was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with a lot of digital elements. That final sequence was filmed in a naval yard, and was dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.|$|E

By close of {{play on the}} first day, Australia were in the driving seat at 86 for 1. Whilst England {{recovered}} to dismiss them for 197 and then made 232 themselves, they were <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop Australia <b>getting</b> the 169 runs they needed to win. The third Test was even more one-sided. England got 188. Then Australia made 262, with Percy McDonnell making 147, Alec Bannerman 70, and no other batsman scoring more than 7! England again collapsed to 134, and Australia won by 6 wickets.|$|R

Neagle was also on the team roster for the Houston Dynamo and Kansas City Wizards games but sat on the bench. Neagle played in the Kitsap Pumas game which yielded a 6-0 victory. Neagle made his unofficial debut with a friendly against Chelsea on July 18, 2009. When asked about playing against English Premier League team, Neagle responded “It’s kind of surreal.

Her version is briefly heard over an establishing shot of Central Park in the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada. Morissette said of the cover, [...] "it's poking fun not only at how I've been perceived but also at what I've accurately been perceived as."

2500|$|Prior to his {{signing with}} WWE, Sting's legacy was perpetuated by the organization. It hailed him as [...] "one of sports-entertainment's elite", and ranked him at {{number one in}} listings of the {{greatest}} wrestlers to never perform in WWE, and the greatest stars in WCW history. In 2013, the company named Sting's WCW World Heavyweight Championship contest against Diamond Dallas Page, on April 26, 1999, as the greatest match ever aired on WCW's flagship Monday Nitro program. At Night of Champions 2013, WWE organized a viewer poll to determine the greatest United States Champion of all time: Sting, a two-time champion, beat out the other four contenders – all WWE Hall of Famers – in a landslide victory with 53% of the overall vote. In regard to Sting's creative handling after he signed with WWE, PWInsider editor Dave Scherer wrote that [...] "he really represented WCW so he was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that [...] treatment".|$|E
2500|$|During production, it was Gilliam's {{intention}} that {{it should}} feel like a drug trip from beginning to end. He said in an interview, [...] "We start out at full speed and it's WOOOO! The drug kicks in and you're on speed! Whoah! You get the buzz – it's crazy, it's outrageous, the carpet's moving and everybody's laughing and having a great time.

[...] To convey {{the effects of the}} various drugs, Gilliam and Pecorini assembled a list of [...] "phases" [...] that detailed the [...] "cinematic qualities" [...] of each drug consumed. For ether, Pecorini said they used a [...] "loose depth of field; everything becomes non-defined"; for adrenochrome, [...] "everything gets narrow and claustrophobic, move closer with lens"; mescaline was simulated by having [...] "colors melt into each other, flares with no sources, play with color temperatures"; for amyl nitrite, the [...] "perception of light gets very uneven, light levels increase and decrease during the shots"; and for LSD, [...] "everything extremely wide, hallucinations via morphs, shapes, colors, and sound." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent {{said of the}} series; [...] "When {{you start}} this job, you <b>never</b> think you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> bored," [...] {{said one of the}} lumpy-jacketed {{characters}} in Bodyguards. It was a remark that might have been designed to extract a moan of sympathy from television reviewers, coming, as it did, halfway through this dim and derivative thriller, one of those professionals-with-guns series that give a distinguished theatrical actor the opportunity to look steely and say [...] "shit". In this case, the man in question is John Shrapnel, taking the role of the sternly parental head of a police protection unit. His charges are played by Louise Lombard and Sean Pertwee, as well as disposable cannon-fodder who can be dispatched relatively early in the story to demonstrate that theirs is not just a nine-to-five job. In last night's episode, they were assigned to protect a businessman, back in England to give evidence before a select committee about a dodgy arms deal. Cue tough jargon ("Red One. Position set. Principal landed. 11.04") and a pretty standard plot involving conspiracy in high places." ...|$|R

After leaving Senafe the plain falls for some distance, and after about five miles’ ride we came down to the lowest point, where, in ordinary times, a small stream of water crosses the road, but which at present is perfectly dry, except where it has accumulated in large pools. By the side of one of these, about two miles to our left, we saw the camp of cavalry and sick animals.
