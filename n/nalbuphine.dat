25|$|<b>Nalbuphine</b> HCL is {{currently}} available {{only as an}} injectable in the US and the European Union. Nubain, the brand name for injectable <b>nalbuphine</b> HCL, was discontinued from being marketed in 2008 in the United States for commercial reasons (Federal Register 2008), however other commercial suppliers now provide generic injection formulation <b>nalbuphine</b> for the market.|$|E
25|$|Nubain was {{approved}} for marketing in the United States in 1978 and remains {{as the only}} opioid analgesic of this type (marketed in the U.S.) not controlled under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). When the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was enacted in 1971, <b>nalbuphine</b> was placed in schedule II. Endo Laboratories, Inc. subsequently petitioned the DEA to exclude <b>nalbuphine</b> from all schedules of the CSA in 1973. After receiving a medical and scientific review and a scheduling recommendation from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, forerunner to the Department of Health and Human Services, <b>nalbuphine</b> was removed from schedule II of the CSA in 1976.

25|$|<b>Nalbuphine</b> is also {{available}} in a sulfite and paraben-free formulation in two concentrations, 10mg and 20mg of <b>nalbuphine</b> hydrochloride per mL.

2500|$|In {{the search}} for opioid analgesics with less abuse {{potential}} than pure mu agonist opioids, a number of semi-synthetic opiates were developed. These substances {{are referred to as}} mixed agonist–antagonists analgesics. <b>Nalbuphine</b> (brand name Nubain, Raltrox) belongs to this group of substances. [...] The mixed agonists-antagonists drug class exerts their analgesic actions by agonistic activity at opioid kappa (“κ”) receptors. While all drugs in this class possess opioid mu (“μ”) receptor antagonistic activity leading to less abuse potential, <b>nalbuphine</b> is the only approved drug in the mixed agonist-antagonist class listed in terms of its pharmacological actions and selectivities on opiate receptors as a full mu antagonist as well as a full kappa agonist. (Gustein et al. 2001).|$|E
2500|$|Like pure µ-opioids, {{the mixed}} agonists-antagonist opioid class of drugs can cause side effects with initial {{administration}} of the drug but which lessen over time (“tolerance”). [...] This is particularly true for {{the side effects of}} nausea, sedation and cognitive symptoms (Jovey et al. 2003). [...] These side effects can in many instances be ameliorated or avoided at the time of drug initiation by titrating the drug from a tolerable starting dose up to the desired therapeutic dose. An important difference between <b>nalbuphine</b> and the pure mu opioid analgesic drugs is the “ceiling effect” on respiration. [...] Respiratory depression is a potentially fatal side effect from the use of pure mu opioids. [...] <b>Nalbuphine</b> has limited ability to depress respiratory function (Gal et al. 1982).|$|E
2500|$|It is also marketed {{under the}} brand name Kinz and Nalbin in Pakistan by Sami and Global Pharmaceuticals.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the relief of pain, the drug has been studied {{as a treatment for}} morphine induced pruritus (itching). [...] Pruritus is a common side effect of morphine or other pure mu agonist opioid administration. [...] Kjellberg et al. (2001) published a review of clinical trials relating to the prevalence of morphine induced pruritus and its pharmacologic control. The authors state that <b>nalbuphine</b> is an effective anti-pruritic agent against morphine induced pruritus. [...] The effect may be mediated via central nervous system mechanisms.|$|E

The authors investigated the relative abilities of various opioids to induce histamine release mediated increased capillary permeability and tissue edema (“wheal response” [...] ) and cutaneous vasodilatation and local redness (“flare response”) when subjects were intradermally injected with 0.02 ml equimolar concentrations of 5 x 10-4 M. [...] <b>Nalbuphine</b> did not produce either a wheal or flare response.|$|E
