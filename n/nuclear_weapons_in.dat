5|$|The French author Jules Roy {{suggests}} that Admiral Radford discussed with the French {{the possibility of}} using <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> support of the French garrison. Moreover, John Foster Dulles reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Điện Biên Phủ, and a similar source claims that the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden was aware of the possibility of the use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> that region.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981 President Reagan {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a neutron bomb. While contentious, this had the desired effect of bringing the Soviets to the bargaining table, and negotiations on limiting <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> Europe started on November 30.|$|E

50|$|Research {{into the}} {{development}} of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> was undertaken during World War II by the United States (in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada), Germany, Japan, and the USSR. The United States {{was the first and}} is the only country to have used a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> war, when it used two bombs against Japan in August 1945. With their loss during the war, Germany and Japan ceased to be involved <b>in</b> any <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> research. <b>In</b> August 1949, the USSR tested a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon.</b> The United Kingdom tested a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> October 1952. France developed a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> 1960. The People's Republic of China detonated a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> 1964. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974, and Pakistan conducted a series of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> tests <b>in</b> May 1998, following tests by India earlier that month. In 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test.|$|R

5|$|Another popular view among {{critics of}} the bombings, {{originating}} with Gar Alperovitz in 1965 and becoming the default position in Japanese school history textbooks, {{is the idea of}} atomic diplomacy: that the United States used <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> order to intimidate the Soviet Union {{in the early stages of}} the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 White Paper {{was seen}} by many as an attempt to {{strengthen}} Australia's relationship with the United States, which had been damaged by New Zealand's stance against <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> its ports. In line with this policy, the RAN was structured to become more self-reliant and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within Australia's local region.|$|E
5|$|World War II was {{the deadliest}} {{conflict}} in human history, marked by 50 million to 85 million fatalities, {{most of which}} were civilians in the Soviet Union and China.

5|$|A related {{experiment}} {{which also}} had Teller's endorsement {{was a plan}} to extract oil from the tar sands in northern Alberta with nuclear explosions, titled Project Oilsands. The plan actually received {{the endorsement of the}} Alberta government, but was rejected by the Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to having any <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> Canada. After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to have nuclear weapons, from a US nuclear sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as {{outlined}} in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of whom were civilians) and remain the only use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> the history of warfare.|$|E

While waiting for his Q clearance, he was put in charge of a board investigating a crash of an AJ Savage, then the Navy's frontline nuclear bomber, an aircraft that did not impress Ramage. After his clearance came through, he worked in the AFSWP's Operations Division, writing and reviewing war plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} {{confirmed}} that the United States stockpiled <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> Greenland until 1965, contradicting assurances by Danish foreign minister Niels Helveg Petersen that the weapons were in Greenland's airspace, but never on the ground. The DUPI report also revealed details of Project Iceworm, a hitherto secret United States Army plan to store up to 600 nuclear missiles under the Greenland ice cap.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Britain {{commenced}} {{a nuclear}} weapons project, known as Tube Alloys, but the 1943 Quebec Agreement merged it with the American Manhattan Project. Several key British scientists worked {{as part of the}} British contribution to the Manhattan Project, but after the war the Americans ended cooperation on <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> <b>In</b> January 1947, a cabinet sub-committee decided, in response to an apprehension of American isolationism and fears of Britain losing its great power status, to resume British efforts to build nuclear weapons. The project was called High Explosive Research, and was directed by Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, with William Penney in charge of bomb design.|$|E

Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|Mastodon {{called for}} the {{deployment}} of two squadrons of eight Handley Page Victors to Tengah and one of eight Avro Vulcans to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> 1958, {{most of which were}} of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each Vbomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the Vbomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.|$|E

5|$|On 12December 1979, {{in light}} of a {{build-up}} of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and PershingII theatre <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> Europe. The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the western negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. This policy was called the Dual Track policy. Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations {{in the event of}} war. This action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for the deployment wavered as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.|$|E
