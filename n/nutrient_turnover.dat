30|$|Conventional farm {{systems have}} been {{characterized}} by a high input of chemical fertilizer leading to qualitative deterioration of soil as well as agricultural yield (Diacono and Montemurro 2010; Singh et al. 2007). However, a growing awareness of the adverse impacts of inorganic fertilizers on crop production as well as increasing environmental and ecological concerns has stimulated greater interest in the utilization of organic amendments for crop production. Organic manures act {{not only as a}} source of nutrients and organic matter, but also increase microbial diversity and activity in soil, which influence soil structure and <b>nutrients</b> <b>turnover,</b> in addition to improvement in other physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil (Albiach et al. 2000; Edmeades 2003). Thus organic amendments/manures are environmentally benign and help in maintaining soil fertility as well as agricultural productivity. Among various organic products, vermicompost has been recognized as potential soil amendment.|$|R

Endocytosis is classified as clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) or clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) according to its dependence on clathrin. Several different CIE pathways have been proposed, including caveolin-dependent endocytosis, flotillin-dependent endocytosis, the clathrin-independent carrier pathway, ARF 6 -dependent endocytosis, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, the IL 2 Rβ pathway (Doherty and McMahon, 2009), the newly identified fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis pathway (Boucrot et al., 2015) and the EGFR-NCE pathway (Caldieri et al., 2017).|$|R
40|$|Management of wild {{ungulates}} is seldom undertaken {{with a focus}} on the effects on forest health and productivity but rather focusing on populations of the ungulates and their habitat needs. Consequently, only limited research has examined grazing and browsing by ungulates in coniferous forests as a chronic disturbance factor affecting <b>nutrient</b> <b>turnovers,</b> competitive interactions among plant species, and rates and trajectories of successional pathways. Local effects are quite variable and depend on ecosystem productivity. Grazing can have mixed effects on species richness and the spread of exotic plants at the landscape scale. Grazing also can affect nitrogen fixation and rate of nitrogen mineralization. Ungulate density relative to carrying capacity of the site largely determines the effects of herbivory. High population densities of ungulates have been shown to change plant species composition, growth of trees, and to damage regeneration. Grazing also reduces accumulation of fine fuels on the forest floor, which formerly carried low-intensity, high-frequency ground fires. Effects of {{wild ungulates}} can be controlled by hunting regulations, and in some cases, by artificial contraception. Effects of grazing by livestock can be controlled through management actions such as changes in livestock numbers, changes in timing and duration of grazing, altering livestock distribution with fencing and placement of salt and supplemental feed, and specialized rotational grazing systems such as deferred and rest rotation.

50|$|Marine {{bacteriophage}} form {{an important}} part of deep sea ecosystems. There are between 5x1012 and 1x1013 phage per square metre in deep sea sediments and their abundance closely correlates with the number of prokaryotes found in the sediments. They are {{responsible for the death of}} 80% of the prokaryotes found in the sediments, and almost all of these deaths are caused by cell lysis (bursting).

This explains the high rate of <b>nutrient</b> <b>turnover</b> in deep sea sediments. The release of nutrients from infected bacteria stimulates the growth of uninfected bacteria and then these also become infected.

5000|$|Trophic {{dynamics}} can strongly influence {{rates of}} decomposition and nutrient cycling {{in time and}} in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation. Insect herbivory {{has been shown to}} increase rates of decomposition and <b>nutrient</b> <b>turnover</b> due to changes in litter quality and increased frass inputs. [...] However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.|$|E

[...] Humboldt State University, Biological Sciences, 2006 The {{tropical}} monodominant tree Dicymbe corymbosa, vegetatively regenerates via epicormic shoots and roots, {{resulting in}} multi-stemmed trees with stabilizing pseudotrunks and root mounds. In two 1 -ha forest plots on the Guiana Shield, we quantified the regenerative structure and aboveground soil development of D. corymbosa individuals ??? 10 cm dbh and investigated the potential adaptive significance of reiteration {{in terms of}} genet persistence and root exploitation of aboveground litter and soil accumulations. We also investigated the incidence of the heart rot fungus Phellinus robustus in D. corymbosa and examined {{its role in the}} reiteration process. Large trees contained more and larger shoots, greater trunk, root mound, and organic soil volumes, and a higher incidence of Phellinus. Roots and ectomycorrhizas were abundant in aboveground soils on the trees, occurred at higher densities than those from the surrounding forest floor, and may be important in recycling mineral <b>nutrients.</b> Shoot <b>turnover</b> and regeneration, while stimulated by Phellinus rot, appeared to be cumulative over time, resulting in stable, structurally complex trees of indeterminate lifespan which successfully recruit through mast fruiting.

Four F 1 -hybrids (Talina, Nilo, Birgah and Black Bell) were grown into pots in trough benches in a recirculating water system. The EC value of the nutrient solution, prepared using NaCl-enriched water (10 mM), was 3. 2 - 3. 5 dS m- 1 until the first fruit harvest and reduced to 2. 3 - 2. 5 dS m- 1 afterwards; the salinisation induced a <b>nutrient</b> solution <b>turnover</b> whenever the EC value exceeded 7. 0 dS m- 1 . Nutrient solution supply with drip irrigation was 32 % more than with subirrigation, due to runoff and the need of a more frequent complete renewal. As a consequence, subirrigation allowed a higher fertigation efficiency (91 vs 79 %) and an easier and cheaper management of the nutrient solution; nevertheless, the water use efficiency referred to the fruit yield was similar with both the irrigation methods, since the higher water supply with drip irrigation was counterbalanced by the significant higher yield (roughly + 50 %) compared with subirrigation, which caused a very high accumulation of salts in the upper layer of the substrate. These results suggest that subirrigation of eggplant may be problematic with high water EC, due to high water requirements of this species...|$|R

Microbial C, N and P, extractable N and P, and plant-available nutrients as estimated by plant root simulator probes were measured. We then used geostatistical techniques to determine the scale of spatial autocorrelation in the forest floor and mineral soil. Several of the measured variables were spatially autocorrelated at a scale of tens to hundreds of meters. Although more variables were autocorrelated in the mineral soil than in the forest floor, spatial patterns in gravimetric moisture content and nutrient concentrations in the two horizons generally overlapped. The spatial patterns were probably caused by differences in topography, except for ammonium whose shorter range of spatial autocorrelation may reflect variations in nitrogen content of the canopy...|$|R

We tested the prediction that on fertile soils species {{with very different}} biomass and <b>nutrient</b> allocation and <b>turnover</b> would converge on a common value of nutrient use efficiency. Due to high soil fertility, nutrient use efficiencies of the species studied were low (95 – 150 and 433 – 962 for N and P use efficiency, respectively). Nutrient use efficiency was examined {{in terms of its}} components, nutrient productivity and the mean residence time of nutrients. Although the species converged on the same nitrogen (but not phosphorus) use efficiency, differences in nutrient productivity and nutrient residence time may confer varying abilities to deal with nitrogen limitation. A combination of high nutrient productivity and longer nutrient retention (e. g., Hyeronima) signals an ability to prosper on infertile sites, whereas high nutrient productivity in the absence of long nutrient retention (e. g., Cedrela) indicates a capacity for high productivity, but only on fertile soil.

Moreover, leaf nutrient translocation was higher in C. ladanifer than in C. salviifolius.

The dietary effects on <b>nutrient</b> assimilation, isotopic <b>turnover</b> rates, and discrimination factors were assessed using exponential models. Of the four dietary treatments evaluated over the 15 -day feeding trial, larvae fed C. calcitrans and PTC had the best growth and high survival. Larvae in all dietary treatments had relatively high isotopic turnover rates (0. 075 – 0. 327 /day), although some discrimination factors found in this study were out of the normal range for aquatic invertebrates (Δ 13 C: 0. 4 ‰– 4. 1 ‰ and δ 15 N: 0. 1 ‰– 5. 3 ‰). Overall, the turnover rates and discrimination factors for δ 13 C and δ 15 N indicated that C. gigas larvae assimilate C. calcitrans and PTC best under hatchery rearing conditions.

For decades, researchers have studied stream hydrology and solute chemistry in disturbed and undisturbed watersheds at Experimental Forests - a continental-scale research platform that spans gradients of precipitation, atmospheric deposition, nutrient limitation, biomes, topography, and soil types. To increase our understanding of water quality responses to disturbance, we examine: 1) How the short and long-term responses of stream nutrients to forest harvest and various disturbance types differ across North America; and 2) Which biotic and abiotic factors explain variability in the magnitude, timing and duration of stream solute responses within and among sites.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Total {{length and}} biomass of fungal {{mycelium}} {{in the soil}} of a young Douglas-fir stand in the central Oregon Coast Range were estimated over 27 months with the agar-film technique. In a second study, phenology and taxonomy of hypogeous (belowground) sporocarps were studied over 32 months in a nearby, young Douglas-fir stand. Mycelial mass was at maximum in fall and spring and significantly lower in summer. Melanized hyphae dominated those with other colors, averaging 66 percent of monthly litter and 73. 7 percent of soil hyphal weight. The mycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophilum Fr. had significantly larger average diameter than other hyphae and contributed from 1. 2 to 64. 8 percent of monthly hyphal volume. Multiple regression analyses with temperature, moisture, and litterfall produced no adequate predictive equations for monthly fungal biomass. Nine ascomycete and 21 basidiomycete species were collected during the sporocarp phenology study. Production was dominated by {{a small number of}} species; taxa accounting for 5 percent or more of total annual dry weight were Gautieria monticola, Hysterangium crassum, H. separabile, and Melanogaster ambiguus. Annual productivity estimates ranged from 5, 815 to 6, 648 sporocarps ha⁻¹ and 2. 0 to 3. 2 kg dry weight ha⁻¹. Peaks in production generally resulted from a large contribution by one or two species. Pronounced seasonal trends in production were not evident, but sporocarp number and biomass were greater in spring than fall. Annual fruiting period for individual species ranged from only three months for some species to as much as 11 months for others. Fungi produce the greatest biomass of all soil organisms in temperate coniferous forests. Mycelium and sporocarps are nutrient and energy sources for decomposers and consumers. In addition, they are essential as mycorrhizal symbionts to the growth of most forest-dwelling vascular plants. Consequently, ecosystem studies dealing with <b>nutrient</b> allocation, <b>turnover</b> rates, or mycophagy by soil fauna or vertebrate populations need to account for the contributions of fungal hyphae, sporocarps, and/or mycorrhizae.

Regulation of this pathway, widespread in living organisms including humans and many bacteria, {{is very important to}} vitamin B 6 homeostasis but poorly understood. Although some information is available on the enzymatic regulation of PNPOx and PLK, little is known on their regulation at the transcriptional level. In the present work, we identified a new MocR-like regulator, PtsJ from Salmonella typhimurium, which controls the expression of the pdxK gene encoding one of the two PLKs expressed in this organism (PLK 1). Analysis of pdxK expression in a ptsJ knockout strain demonstrated that PtsJ acts as a transcriptional repressor. This is the first case of a MocR-like regulator acting as repressor of its target gene. Expression and purification of PtsJ allowed a detailed characterisation of its effector and DNA-binding properties. PLP is the only B 6 vitamer acting as effector molecule for PtsJ. A DNA-binding region composed of four repeated nucleotide sequences is responsible for binding of PtsJ to its target promoter. Analysis of binding stoichiometry revealed that protein subunits/DNA molar ratio varies from 4 : 1 to 2 : 1, depending on {{the presence or absence of}} PLP.

The quantity and quality (i. e., chemistry) of these materials is sensitive to land manage-ment practices. Monitoring alterations in the chemistry of water soluble orgat~ics resulting from land management practices is difficult because of the complexity and low concentration of these compounds. A procedure is described in which the water soluble organics are quantitatively derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride and then ariatyzed by liquid state proton nuclear magnetic resonance ('H NMK). The procedure was applied to sample amounts as low as 0. 03 mg from the forest floor and root exudates. The root exudate samples were dominated by aliphatic coinpounds with relatively few 0 -alkyl, olefinic and aromatic compounds.

The important regulatory capacities of dissolved organic compounds on enzyme reactivity was examined experimentally and coupled to the wetland-littoral organic carbon flux budgets...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the phenotypical differences in feed conversion, carcass composition, and meat quality of two cattle breeds representing either the accretion type (Charolais) or the secretion type (Holstein). Eighteen Charolais bulls and 18 German Holstein bulls were raised and fattened under identical conditions on a high energy level with concentrates and hay. The animals were slaughtered at the age of 18 months. Charolais bulls had a body weight (BW) of 750. 6 kg and an average daily gain (ADG) of 1377 g. German Holstein bulls were 84. 7 kg lighter with an ADG of 1197 g. The energy expense per kg BW gain was 14 % lower in the Charolais bulls compared with German Holstein. Charolais bulls gained more energy in protein than the Holstein bulls and needed less energy per kg protein gain in the hot carcass weight (HCW). The Charolais bulls showed a greater carcass weight and a higher yield grade as well as a greater cross sectional area of the M. longissimus dorsi (LD). Holstein bulls showed a greater marbling score, darker color, and more water binding capacity of the LD. The Holstein bulls gained more subcutaneous, intramuscular, and visceral fat during growth, which reflects the ability of the Holstein as a dairy breed to deposit fat as an energy source for milk production and points out the capability of Charolais for extended protein accretion. The genetic background of the recorded different <b>nutrient</b> utilization and <b>turnover</b> will be investigated in further experiments...|$|R

We describe a representation of the terrestrial phosphorus cycle for the ORCHIDEE land surface model, and evaluate it with data from nutrient manipulation experiments along a soil formation chronosequence in Hawaii. ORCHIDEE accounts for the influence of the nutritional state of vegetation on tissue nutrient concentrations, pho-tosynthesis, plant growth, biomass allocation, biochemical (phosphatase-mediated) mineralization, and biological nitrogen fixation. Changes in the nutrient content (quality) of litter affect the carbon use efficiency of decomposition and in return the nutrient availability to vegetation. The model explicitly accounts for root zone depletion of phosphorus as a function of root phosphorus uptake and phosphorus transport from the soil to the root surface. The model captures the observed differences in the foliage stoichiometry of vegetation between an early (300 -year) and a late (4. 1 Myr) stage of soil development. The contrasting sensitivities of net primary productivity to the addition of either nitrogen, phosphorus, or both among sites are in general reproduced by the model. As observed, the model simulates a preferential stimulation of leaf level productivity when nitrogen stress is alleviated, while leaf level productivity and leaf area index are stimulated equally when phosphorus stress is alleviated. The nutrient use efficiencies in the model are lower than observed primarily due to biases in the <b>nutrient</b> content and <b>turnover</b> of woody biomass. We conclude that ORCHIDEE is able to reproduce the shift from nitrogen to phosphorus limited net primary productivity along the soil development chronosequence, as well as the contrasting responses of net primary productivity to nutrient addition...|$|R
40|$|Olive can be {{considered}} a paradigm species for Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. In conventional olive growing, adopted by the majority of the farmers, frequent soil tillage has reduced soil microbial diversity and microbiota complexity that strongly contribute to the overall soil fertility. Therefore, the conventional agronomic practices should evolve in a more sustainable olive management addressed to improve soil microbial diversity. A better understanding of the ecology of soil microorganisms could lead to identify agricultural management practices that stimulate and select the soil microorganisms having beneficial purposes in agriculture, such those interested in nitrogen cycle. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of sustainable practices (grass cover and pruning residues recycling) on soil microbioligical quality in a Mediterranean olive orchard. The trials were carried out in a mature olive grove (Olea europaea L. – cv Maiatica) located in Basilicata Region (Southern Italy.) and managed for 13 years (medium-term) according to two different soil management systems: the sustainable treatment (ST) and the conventional treatment (CT). Soil microorganisms in the two systems were monitored by both microbiological cultural-dependent and molecular methods, and by microscopy. In the ST olive orchard, soil microbiota showed a higher complexity and metabolic diversity. The adoption of ‘innovative’, sustainable, agricultural practices had positive effects on soil microbiota and its biodiversity, which in turn can influence soil fertility and plant growth by increasing <b>nutrients</b> availability and <b>turnover.</b> The results of this study encourage the use of sustainable agricultural practices able to enhance physico-chemical and microbial soil fertility and promote good-quality fruit production without detrimental effects on water and soil resources. The role of the identified microorganisms in the soil microbial netwo rk is discussed, in order to provide a detailed view of the impact that man-made selection had on soil microorganisms of agricultural relevance in a typical Mediterranean agronomic biosystem...|$|R
