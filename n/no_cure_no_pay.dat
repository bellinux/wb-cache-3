With the help from M. Hilver, Zwart remixed this medley and renamed it LUV Dance-Medley to adapt it to the Eurodance sound which dominated the European charts at this time (2 Unlimited, Culture Beat, 2 Brothers on the 4th Floor, Snap!, U96...). Moreover, a song taken from the For You EP, <b>No</b> <b>Cure</b> <b>No</b> <b>Pay,</b> was also rearranged in the Dance style in order to be added to the Maxi single. LUV Dance-Medley was only available in German speaking countries and as an import record in Benelux. Despite Zwart's efforts to conform to the Dance music standards and because of the lack of promotion by Luv', the Medley didn't top the charts. However, the Megamix '93 single recorded by {{the original}} trio reached the Dutch Top 40.|$|E

40|$|Even {{enterprises}} {{with very}} advanced management systems seldom monitor efficiency of energy usage and materials flows within their processes and have, therefore, difficulty to effectively manage their resource efficiency. This paper is built upon experiences from a pilot {{implementation of a}} new tool for promotion of energy management and cleaner production, developed within the Energy Management and Performance Related Savings Scheme project to promote an effective energy management system in industrial enterprises. The combination of soft managerial approaches (Monitoring and Targeting technical services) with financing provided on a <b>no</b> <b>cure,</b> <b>no</b> <b>pay</b> basis provided by Energy Service Companies, is the foundation for this new tool for promotion of energy management and cleaner production on <b>no</b> <b>cure,</b> <b>no</b> <b>pay</b> basis. It enabled us to test the introduction of cleaner production projects with no technical or financial risks for enterprises or for the need of financing {{from the side of}} the enterprises. Consequently, it removed some of the important barriers for implementing cleaner production. This paper distinguishes between auditing and accounting approaches in the promotion of cleaner production and argues that auditing approaches are not sufficient for completion of the learning needed for integration of cleaner production into the practice of an enterprise.

40|$|In Denmark {{there is}} a {{developed}} and well-organised advisory system. However, {{there is room for}} improvement. Many advisors experience that the farmers don't follow their advice, and therefore the same problems are discussed over and over. This entails that the advisors feel they lack impact and farmers feel the advising is inefficient and expensive. The job is therefore to make the utility value of the advising more visible, to motivate the farmers to exploit the full potentials of their production, and to make it clear to the farmer that the work of the advisors isn't just an expense, but a way to increase profits. The paper describes our work with advisers and farmers to find and develop methods, which can assist in obtaining these objectives. - Key account manager - <b>No</b> <b>Cure</b> <b>No</b> <b>Pay</b> - Benchmarking as a tool for motivation. In some regions the "key account manager"- idea is developing. The farmer has one advisor who is responsible for customer relations including optimisation {{of the relationship between the}} various advisors and the farmer. The paper describes how the advisors ensure that they meet the farmers' expectations. To make the value of advises even more obvious, we also work with contracts with integrated objectives for the farm. This ensures that the advisors are aware of the farmer's expectations and that the follow up part of the advising is at natural part of the process. Institutional and Behavioral Economics,...|$|E

40|$|Being {{struck down}} by a fatal disease is not {{something}} anyone wants to think about, but it does happen. The human body is a complex system with checks and balances that helps to keep it healthy. One of the things our body has to help keep it going at optimum is a Negative Feedback Control System. This system is inhibitory and opposes a change such as body temperature. This helps maintain a constant internal environment. For example, if the temperature decreases, the receptors in the skin will send {{a signal to the}} brain, which then sends a message to the muscles to shiver that works to restore equilibrium in the body. Yet sometimes the body cannot handle an illness on its own. When this happens, we often seek our doctors looking for a cure. The doctors set up tests to help determine the problem, and if possible, they can prescribe anti-biotic medication or suggest surgery to rectify the condition. Although doctors have at their disposal an arsenal of things that they can do to help patients, there are also diseases that have <b>no</b> <b>cure,</b> <b>no</b> corrective therapy an...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community at author's request from May 9, 2011 - May 9, 2012 The Human Immunodeficiency Virus - 1 (HIV- 1) has {{been the source of}} substantial human misery since it was first discovered in the early 1980 s. Despite remarkable progress that has been made towards understanding HIV- 1, there is <b>no</b> <b>cure,</b> <b>no</b> vaccine and life-prolonging therapies are beyond the reach of millions in need. Our research sought to both gain insight into potential therapeutic targets as well as the preclinical testing of drug candidates. We demonstrate that a RhoA derived peptide is an effective inhibitor of HIV- 1 entry. Although this peptide inhibits HIV- 1 due to its poly-anionic nature, it nevertheless demonstrates that endogenous host proteins may be repurposed for novel therapeutic uses. We also characterized the mechanism and effectiveness of Basant, a polyherbal topical microbicide candidate for the prevention of HIV- 1 transmission. Our data demonstrate that it inhibits the entry of both CCR 5 and CXCR 4 tropic HIV- 1 at non-toxic concentrations. Finally, data is presented on the characterization of a novel HIV- 1 protein expressed from an alternative reading frame of the HIV- 1 polymerase gene. We demonstrate that this protein is localized to the nucleolus and is likely expressed from a novel HIV- 1 transcript. This work lays the foundation for further studies to target this protein for drug development...|$|R

I am only relating what I know, or have heard, or believe, of the particular cases, and what fell within the compass of my view, and the different nature of the infection as it appeared in the particular cases which I have related; but this may be added too, that though the former sort of those cases, namely, those openly visited, were the worst for themselves as to pain (I mean those that had such fevers, vomitings, headaches, pains, and swellings), because they died in such a dreadful manner, yet the latter had the worst state of the disease; for in the former they frequently recovered, especially if the swellings broke; but the latter was inevitable death. <b>No</b> <b>cure,</b> <b>no</b> help, could be possible; nothing could follow but death.

40|$|Huntington disease (HD) is {{a genetic}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{for which there}} is currently <b>no</b> <b>cure</b> and <b>no</b> way to stop or even slow the brain changes it causes. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether FTY 720, the first approved oral therapy for multiple sclerosis, may be effective in HD models and eventually constitute an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of the disease. Here, we utilized preclinical target validation paradigms and examined the in vivo efficacy of chronic administration of FTY 720 in R 6 / 2 HD mouse model. Our findings indicate that FTY 720 improved motor function, prolonged survival and reduced brain atrophy in R 6 / 2 mice. The beneficial effect of FTY 720 administration was associated with a significant strengthening of neuronal activity and connectivity and, with reduction of mutant huntingtin aggregates, and it was also paralleled by increased phosphorylation of mutant huntingtin at serine 13 / 16 residues that are predicted to attenuate protein toxicity...|$|R
