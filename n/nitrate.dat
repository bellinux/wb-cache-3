5|$|Lead(II) <b>nitrate</b> is an {{oxidizing}} agent.

40|$|Aspirin (ASA) and <b>nitrates</b> inhibit {{platelet}} aggregation by different mechanisms, {{and it has}} been suggested that their antiaggregating effects could be additive. To analyze the influence of previous treatment with aspirin (ASA) or <b>nitrates</b> on the clinical manifestations of acute coronary syndrome, a series of 323 pts consecutively admitted to the cardiology emergency room with unstable angina (UA) or acute myocardial infarction (MI), and with a previous history of coronary heart disease, was prospectively characterized. A standardized questionnaire was used to determine risk factors, previous cardiac history, and use of drugs preceding the index event. Previous use was defined as any dose of ASA during the week before, or of oral or transdermal <b>nitrates</b> during the 24 h before the onset of the event. The final diagnosis by serial ECGs and enzyme determinations, was UA in 226 pts, and MI in 95. Fifty-one pts had received previous treatment with ASA but not with <b>nitrates,</b> 51 had received <b>nitrates</b> but not ASA, 105 had received both drugs and 94 had received neither ASA nor <b>nitrates.</b> The final diagnosis was MI in 12 (24 %) pts who had received ASA, 12 (24 %) in pts who had received <b>nitrates,</b> 21 (20 %) in pts on both ASA and <b>nitrates,</b> and 43 (46 %) in those receiving neither ASA nor <b>nitrates</b> (p= 0. 0003). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified prior ASA and prior <b>nitrates,</b> but not age, sex, risk factors, previous myocardial infarction, or prior treatment with betablockers or Ca++ entry blockers, as independent predictors of UA vs MI. The regression model did not detect any interaction between ASA and <b>nitrates.</b> These results suggest that both prior treatment with ASA and with <b>nitrates</b> modify the clinical manifestations of acute ischemic syndrome reducing its severity, and that these effects are compatible with their effects being additive...|$|R

40|$|Alkyl and {{multifunctional}} organic <b>nitrates,</b> {{molecules of}} the chemical form RONO 2, are products of chain terminating reactions in the tropospheric HO x and NO x catalytic cycles and thereby impact ozone formation locally. Many of the molecules in the class have lifetimes that are long enough {{that they can be}} transported over large distances. If the RONO 2 then decompose to deliver NO x to remote regions they affect ozone production rates in locations distant from the original NO x source. While measurements of total RONO 2 (ΣANs) and small straight chain alkyl <b>nitrates</b> are routine, measurements of the specific multifunctional RONO 2 molecules that are believed to dominate the total have rarely been reported and never reported in coincidence with ambient ΣANs measurements. Here we describe observations obtained during the BEARPEX 2009 experiment including ΣANs and a suite of multifunctional <b>nitrates</b> including isoprene derived hydroxynitrates, oxidation products of those <b>nitrates,</b> 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol (MBO) derived hydroxynitrates, and monoterpene <b>nitrates.</b> At the BEARPEX field site, the sum of the individual biogenically derived <b>nitrates</b> account for two-thirds of the ΣANs, confirming predictions of the importance of biogenic <b>nitrates</b> to the NO y budget. Isoprene derived <b>nitrates,</b> transported to the site, are a much larger fraction of the ΣANs at the site than the <b>nitrates</b> derived from the locally emitted MBO.

40|$|Inhalation of {{nitrogen}} and {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) is known to induce lung inflammation, which is prevented by enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems. These agents form <b>nitrated</b> allergens that were shown to enhance allergenicity. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the influence of <b>nitrated</b> proteins on inflammation and antioxidant status of the lung. Ovalbumin (OVA) in <b>nitrated</b> form (nOVA) was intraperitoneally (ip) injected in mice for sensitization and in <b>nitrated</b> or unmodified form for challenge to induce allergic bronchial inflammation. To study the allergen potential of unrelated protein and verify cross-reactivity, <b>nitrated</b> and unmodified keyhole limpet hemocyanin (nKLH, KLH) was used for challenge. Challenge with OVA or nOVA reduced lung function and increased eosinophilia and protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Challenge with <b>nitrated</b> or native OVA or KLH elevated glutathione (GSH) ratio in type II pneumocytes. Reduced mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 3, glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2, and catalase (CAT) was most prominent after challenge with <b>nitrated</b> OVA and <b>nitrated</b> KLH, respectively. Challenge with nOVA enhanced SOD 1 mRNA reduction. Immunostaining of GPX 3 and SOD 2 increased after challenge with OVA or nOVA, while reactivity of GR and reactivity of SOD 2 were reduced after challenge with KLH or nKLH. SOD 1 immunostaining was diminished after challenge with nonnitrated OVA or KLH. CAT immunoreaction was similar in all groups. <b>Nitrated</b> proteins without allergenic potential triggered mRNA reduction of antioxidants in type II cells after sensitization with a <b>nitrated</b> allergen but did not induce bronchial inflammation...|$|R

However, it has been lost by sputtering and photochemical loss to space [1, 2], impact erosion [3], and chemical oxidation to <b>nitrates</b> [4]. <b>Nitrates,</b> produced early in Mars history, are later decomposed back into N 2 by the current impact flux [5], making possible a nitrogen cycle on Mars.

Water samples were collected between October 2003 and April 2005 in areas with contrasting catchments. Water samples collected at the outlet of the mountain part (almost no human activities) had lower concentrations of <b>nitrates</b> than the samples collected donwstream in the rural area. The differences were smaller during the warm period of the year.

Samples collected along the creek in March and April 2005 showed increasing concentrations with increasing urbanization.

In the present study, <b>nitrated</b> alpha-synuclein with four 3 -nitrotyrosines (Tyr(39), Tyr(125), Tyr(133), and Tyr(136)) was obtained non-enzymatically by incubation with nitrite.

The <b>nitrated</b> alpha-synuclein could induce cell death in a time-and concentration-dependent manner when SH-SY 5 Y cells (a human neuroblastoma cell line) were incubated with the dimers and polymers.
