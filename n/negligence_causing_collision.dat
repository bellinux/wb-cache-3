5000|$|On October 2, 1983, the Elwha ran aground in Grindstone Harbor, near Orcas Island, on a {{submerged}} reef while carrying 100 passengers. The collision {{was initially}} {{blamed on the}} failure of a steering component, but was later found to have been caused by Captain Billy Fittro going off-course to give a visitor a view of her waterfront home. The captain resigned in lieu of being discharged {{a few days after the}} incident; ferry chief Nick Tracey was fired the following month, after failing to report captain Fittros past <b>negligence.</b> The <b>collision</b> <b>caused</b> $250,000 in damage and forced the ferry out of service for several weeks. The rock was later named [...] "Elwha Rock" [...] in 1989 after the ferry; the incident also inspired the song [...] "Elwha on the Rocks", performed by the Island City Jazz Band.|$|R

50|$|Like {{other common}} law jurisdictions, Canada's Criminal Code {{specifically}} enumerates offences {{to account for}} instances where (a) person(s) is/are unintentionally killed during the commission of a crime (for example, criminal <b>negligence</b> <b>causing</b> death and impaired driving causing death). In cases where multiple deaths are caused by the same criminal act, the accused will face a separate charge for each death caused. While such charges are {{not considered to be}} murder under Canadian law, the maximum penalty for such offences is still life imprisonment - although unlike murder this is not a mandatory sentence and is only very rarely imposed. The main difference between a sentence of life imprisonment for murder and a sentence of life imprisonment for an offence such as criminal <b>negligence</b> <b>causing</b> death is that in the latter case, the offender is eligible for parole after serving seven years.|$|R
