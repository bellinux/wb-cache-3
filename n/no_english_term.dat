5000|$|In the 1970s, {{after reading}} Eugene Nida’s Toward A Science Of Translation, Harris asked himself {{why there was}} <b>no</b> <b>English</b> <b>term</b> for [...] "science of translation". He {{reasoned}} that [...] "phonetics" [...] is used rather than [...] "science of speech sounds". There was discussion that a term similar to [...] "phonetics" [...] was needed. In 1972, Harris proposed [...] "translatology". At {{the same time a}} French professor of translation, René Ladmiral, introduced traductologie in French. Traductologie caught on and was soon borrowed into other Romance languages as traductología, etc.; translatology never caught on and was eclipsed by ‘translation studies’, though a few people still use it.|$|E
5000|$|Originating in Germany {{before the}} World War I, this European {{tradition}} of honoring special achievements {{in science and}} culture was carried to the United States by scientists who escaped the Nazis. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century the practice has become used internationally. Since <b>no</b> <b>English</b> <b>term</b> for such a book to mark a special occasion had been in use, the German word Festschrift has been incorporated into the English language and typically is used without the italics that designate a foreign term, although the capitalization of the first letter is usually retained from German. Its plural may be either the original [...] "Festschriften" [...] or anglicized as [...] "Festschrifts". Festschriften are often titled something like Essays in Honour of... or Essays Presented to...|$|E
50|$|According to some (such as ArtScroll/Mesorah) {{the three}} subdivisions of skin tzaraath are best left transliterated, rather than translated, {{because there are}} <b>no</b> {{equivalent}} <b>English</b> <b>terms</b> and any attempt to translate them greatly diminishes the distinctiveness and focus of the Hebrew term. Though {{this is not the}} view of the Jewish Publication Society nor of the Bible Society. Additionally, a diagnosis of tzaraath is not to be performed by anyone but a kohen (Jewish priest).|$|R

50|$|There is <b>no</b> single {{accepted}} <b>English</b> <b>term</b> for fil or filmjölk. In the United States it {{is referred}} to as 'long milk'. Fil and/or filmjölk has been translated to English as sour milk, soured milk, acidulated milk, fermented milk, and curdled milk, all of which are nearly synonymous and describe filmjölk but do not differentiate filmjölk from other types of soured/fermented milk. Filmjölk has also been described as viscous fermented milk and viscous mesophilic fermented milk,. Furthermore, articles written in English can be found that use the Swedish term filmjölk, as well as the Anglicised spellings filmjolk, fil mjölk, and fil mjolk.|$|R
40|$|The fashion style called La Mode à l’Écossaise flourished {{during the}} early years of the French Second Empire (1852 - 1870). There is <b>no</b> {{equivalent}} <b>English</b> <b>term</b> for it except maybe “tartanmania. ” In the early 1850 s Queen Victoria’s fondness for wool tartans had already popularized this textile as clothing for women and children in England. Tartans came to France as a full-fledged fashion style after Empress Eugénie wore a tartan gown for the trip to England. The six-day State Visit of the French Imperial couple started on April 16 th, 1855, a very foggy Sunday, when Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie set sail from Calais aboard the mail-steamer the Pélican while another boat the Pétrel carried the Empresses’ hairdresser, her wardrobe and the Imperial jewels. At Dover, they were greeted by His Royal Highness Prince Albert who accompanied them for the rest of the journey to Windsor Castle, where they were received by Queen Victoria. Ivor Guest (1952) in his book Napoleon III In England wrote about this State visit in great detail describing the outfits of the Imperial couple upon arrival: “The Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie could be seen quite clearly standing on deck, the former in the uniform of a French General with blue tunic and red trousers, the latter in a dress of Royal Stuart tartan, grey paletot and straw bonnet, [after lunch] the Empress had changed her cloak for a black velvet mantle trimmed with lace, and now wore a blue silk chip bonnet with a plaid ribbon to match the tartan of her dress, and a black veil” (p. 103) ...|$|R
