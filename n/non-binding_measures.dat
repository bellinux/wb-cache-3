40|$|In 2009 the European Union and its Member States jointly {{provided}} {{development assistance}} totaling 49 billion Euro, amounting {{to more than}} half of all the world's development assistance. About one fifth - or 12 billion Euro - was managed by the European Commission. The regulation of how these very considerable amounts are to be spent to a very large extent is made in the form of soft law measures (i. e. <b>non-binding</b> <b>measures)</b> rather than as hard law measures (i. e. binding measures). This is surprising, not least when one takes the importance and the size of the amounts into account. In a recent DIIS Working Paper, consulting senior researcher Morten Broberg demonstrates this peculiarity and examines its likely causes. Moreover, Broberg argues that the extensive use of soft law measures affects the power balance between the different actors, in particular by strengthening the position of the Member States at the cost of, first of all, the Commission and the European Parliament...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims to {{describe}} the fundamental elements of the public regulation of financial markets’ evolution in Europe, from an institutional perspective. Starting from the analysis of changes that concerned some peculiar paradigms of domestic administrative law {{and the role of}} the State in the economy, chapter I deals with the evolutive direction of public intervention in this peculiar sector and the rise of a new approach in the public markets regulation, under a diachronic point of view. While chapter II examines the means of regulation and supervisory terms and the manner in which public authorities regulate financial industry, with particular reference to <b>non-binding</b> <b>measures</b> (soft law), and ensure broader participation of stakeholders to rules making process, chapters III and IV describe, by a structural and functional perspective and throught the analisys of ineherent laws, the morphology of national and european regulatory authorities on securities and financial markets (Consob and ESMA) and their powers, tasks and purposes. Finally, in the last chapter considerations are exposed on the kind of interests protected and on the nature of power that regulatory authorities exercise in this sector; moreover, some thoughts are developed on the ESMA’s institutional framework and upon the tendency of its reform in action...|$|E

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{sustainability of}} space activities is an emerging issue to which {{actors in the}} global space community –including governments, agencies, and industry– are devoting increasing amounts of attention and resources. Considering the sustainability of space activities involves {{taking into account the}} present population of space debris, the size of the debris population in the most commonly-used Earth orbits in the future, and the possibility of collision events between objects in space. Addressing space debris and other threats to space sustainability involves both technological and political solutions. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (copuos) has led a major effort to define such solutions and has established a working group tasked with the development of non-binding long-term sustainability (lts) guidelines. This article includes an overview of the concept of space sustainability, a discussion of the need, development, and current status of the lts guidelines, as well as an analysis of some of the guidelines themselves. It concludes with a broader discussion of space as an area without state sovereignty – one of the key aspects that have influenced the development of <b>non-binding</b> <b>measures</b> to address the space sustainability challenge. In this context, and given the governance questions that arise from the interaction between states and non-state actors in this domain, this discussion should be of interest to international relations scholars and practitioners. ...|$|E
40|$|When {{international}} {{soft law}} framework and host states fail to ensure effective {{protection of human}} rights from business-related harm, the involvement of a home state {{can be considered as}} the best solution. The research aims to explore the role of a developed home state in protecting human rights from violations by extractive industries abroad. The major focus of the study is the example of the UK – a developed state where a number of corporations operating in extractive industries are domiciled. This study explores legally binding and <b>non-binding</b> <b>measures</b> taken by the UK, considers how business development policy intersects with human rights protection, and analyses to what extent access to judicial and non-judicial remedies for business-related harm are ensured in the UK. Case study has been conducted in the light of two different theoretical perspectives, and has tried to find out whether the UK gives priority to business development over human rights protection or considers that responsible corporate behaviour is conducive to economic development. Controversial issues such as home state responsibility, jurisdiction and extraterritoriality, home state regulation of corporate conduct, which have attracted wide attention in academic literature, have been explored in a particular local context. The research has revealed that the UK has taken number of initiatives with the aim of protecting human rights from business-related harm and has declared that business development and human rights protection should go hand in hand. However, certain challenges still exist, which need to be addressed in order to enhance the role of a home state in protecting human rights abroad...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} European {{integration}} has irreversibly altered {{the configuration of}} national welfare states. In spite of formidable institutional and political hurdles, incremental European social regulation {{led to the development}} of a genuine EU social policy. This PhD is mainly concerned with one particular ‘soft’ EU social policy instrument: the Open Method of Coordination on Social Protection and Social Inclusion (‘Social OMC’). The ambition is to understand whether and how the Social OMC has become a significant element in the shaping of national and EU policies, alongside and in interaction with other policy instruments. The main thesis put forward is that the Social OMC - in spite of skeptical academic accounts and repeated attempts to weaken the process - 15 years after its formal launch continues to appeal to EU and domestic actors because it is seen as a tool with an added value in at least two respects. First, the OMC’s ‘soft’ tools are being used by policymakers and stakeholders alike to shape key phases of the ‘hard’ policy development process. Second, under certain conditions, the OMC operates as a catalyst or selective amplifier for reform strategies, and as a consequence has both substantive and procedural effects on domestic and EU policymaking. This PhD thus shows that OMC in different policy areas is felt and perceived as being much ‘harder’ than could be expected. <b>Non-binding</b> <b>measures</b> are far from being perceived as irrelevant by the Member States and the decision-making process leading to their adoption involves hard politics of ‘soft’ governance...|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} trend of {{privatisation}} and commercialisation of space activities, states have deemed {{the adoption of}} national space legislation the most suitable way to regulate and control private space initiatives {{in order to ensure}} compliance with international space law principles. Several states have thus far enacted national space laws, which diverge in their substances. Considering these differences in national space laws, the idea of regulatory competition is discussed and is contrasted with harmonisation of national space legislation. While harmonisation is explicitly excluded in the European Union’s space competence, there seem to be other ways to provide a more centralised approach to space legislation in Europe. These include the use of different legal bases, <b>non-binding</b> <b>measures,</b> the ‘enhanced cooperation’ mechanism, the ‘approximation of laws’ basis, the flexibility clause ex article 352 TFEU, and the ‘open method of coordination’. Harmonisation in this context can be desirable when keeping objectives such as the prevention of ‘flags of convenience’ and ‘forum shopping’ phenomena, increased technical safety through the harmonisation of quality standards, mutual cross-border recognition of authorisations, and increased consistency in the interpretation of international space law, in mind. The harmonisation of the registration of space objects should be encouraged as to ensure that all necessary information about space activities is transparently available. On the other hand, aspects like the national political sensitivity of space activities and the diversity in market characteristics in the space sector, contradict harmonisation. Current discretionary powers of states with regard to licensing, export control, and other regulatory aspects could make these states more reluctant to opt for harmonisation in these areas. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper applies a constructivist {{approach}} to transnational mental health advocacy {{in the context}} of the European Union (EU). Interaction between advocacy networks and EU governmental bodies is increasingly governed by "soft" (i. e., legally <b>non-binding)</b> <b>measures</b> including benchmarking, good or best practices, within the framework of an "open method of co-ordination", in which advocates attempt to influence state delivery of mental health services. These governance tools illustrate the spread of quality assurance practices from industry and consumer services to the realm of mental health policy in Europe. The paper argues that this "managerial" form of governance puts mental-health advocates under increased surveillance, either by state actors or state agents (some of whom may be other advocates), while at the same time empowering them to contribute the scientific expertise as well as the principles under which their activities will be governed. One result is that feminist advocates will face pressures both to play two potentially incompatible roles of expert and "outsider. " Thus, regarding the question whether the EU is a feminist ally, this paper finds that EU governance of mental health issues conditions the terms on which feminist advocates can ally with the Commission around their mental health concerns, and that EU governance principles (especially as embodied in the Lisbon strategy) shape the mobilization strategies feminist advocates can employ, but also that professional feminist advocates, along with other advocates, rely on and bring to EU programs the diagnostic standards used to implement those programs. This creates a complex relation between state/EU actors and advocates. The paper raises the concern that in the managerial framework of EU policy, feminist advocates stand to adopt a "rationality of rule" in which advocacy is restricted to building expertise in diagnostic approaches to mental health patterns that have significant yet underexplored gender dimensions to them, and in the process, to "render societies governable" rather than producing the conditions for a healthy or empowered citizenry. To the extent that these dynamics entail from their interaction with EU practices, feminist mental-health advocates will have to view such interaction with caution...|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} Court of Justice of the European Union in {{the process}} of direct tax {{integration}} in the European Union (EU) has been widely discussed in the academic literature, while another important actor, the European Commission, has attracted much less attention. The Commission’s input is commonly perceived to be limited to the right of legislative initiative. This study questions such an oversimplified interpretation and draws a more nuanced picture of EU tax harmonisation by integrating an analysis of the complex regulatory approaches adopted by the Commission for the establishment and smooth functioning of the Internal Market. It is argued that the past decade brought a notable change in the Court-dominated pattern of direct tax integration. This change is apparent first in the evolution of enforcement strategies under Articles 258 and 260 TFEU; and second, in the increased reliance upon <b>non-binding</b> regulatory <b>measures.</b> Both developments have strengthened the role of the Commission, supplying it with more possibilities for influencing national direct tax systems, despite the reluctance of Member States to agree upon legislative harmonisation. Against this background, the procedural and substantive problems associated with these instruments require closer examination. The normative scope of this research covers the key procedural problems related to the infringement procedure and <b>non-binding</b> regulatory <b>measures.</b> The empirical component explores the Commission’s enforcement and coordination practices, drawing particular attention to two case studies: the tax treatment of losses in cross-border situations and exit taxation. Following the analysis of enforcement and coordination in the field of direct taxation, the study argues the need and proposes potential solutions for (i) the developing of a more comprehensive procedural framework for the infringement procedure and non-binding regulatory acts; (ii) the strengthening of accountability mechanisms; and (iii) the enhancing of the effectiveness of their application.

Resolutions made under Chapter VII are considered binding, but resolutions under Chapter VI have no enforcement mechanisms and are generally considered to have no binding force under international law. In 1971, however, a majority of the then International Court of Justice (ICJ) members asserted in the non-binding Namibia advisory opinion that all UN Security Council resolutions are legally binding. This assertion by the ICJ has been countered by Erika De Wet and others. De Wet argues that Chapter VI resolutions cannot be binding. Her reasoning, in part states:Allowing the Security Council to adopt binding measures under Chapter VI would undermine the structural division of competencies foreseen by Chapters VI and VII, respectively. The whole aim of separating these chapters is to distinguish between voluntary and binding measures. Whereas the pacific settlement of disputes provided by the former is underpinned by the consent of the parties, binding measures in terms of Chapter VII are characterised by the absence of such consent. A further indication of the <b>non-binding</b> nature of <b>measures</b> taken in terms of Chapter VI is the obligation on members of the Security Council who are parties to a dispute, to refrain from voting when resolutions under Chapter VI are adopted. No similar obligation exists with respect to binding resolutions adopted under Chapter VII...

40|$|Defence date: 18 June 2007 Examining board: Prof. Francesco Francioni, EUI, Supervisor; Prof. Marise Cremona, EUI; Prof. Enzo Cannizzaro, University of Macerata; Prof. Olivier De Schutter, Catholic University of LouvainThis thesis {{addresses}} {{the question as}} to how the European Union can ensure that EU based MNEs respect human rights when operating in third countries. Firstly, it identifies primary obligations on MNEs as developed by international law in order to tackle the above question. Secondly, {{on the basis of this}} theoretical framework it investigates how the European Union has acted to promote respect of human rights obligations by MNEs which are based on the territory of one of its Member States. Thirdly, the gap between the EU’s commitment to the respect and promotion of human rights, the potential to regulate the conduct of MNEs and the EU’s reluctance to impose human rights obligations on MNEs is explored. It is suggested that current human rights law should develop in the sense of considering companies as duty holders, together with States and other non-state actors, for the realisation of human rights. Moreover, a principle of graduation of responsibility is applied to MNEs, according to the specific human right involved, the proximity to the victim and the element of State authority exercised by the company in a particular situation. The above depicted graduation of responsibility (from the obligation to respect, to the obligation to promote human rights) should be matched by a graduation of corresponding implementing mechanisms. Applying this theoretical framework to the EU, three main recommendations have been formulated. Firstly, the EU should more firmly link the promotion of MNEs’ human rights obligations to international human rights law and support the constitution of an international law framework within the UN. Secondly, the EU should promote MNEs’ human rights obligations within the limits of its competence, both at the international and at an external level. It has been argued that a proactive attitude in this respect would not require the acquisition of new powers, but simply the recognition of a functional competence on the basis of Article 6 TEU in taking positive (and not merely negative) steps for the promotion of human rights in the areas of its competence occurring in international law and the international framework for MNEs’ responsibility. Finally, the EU should not abandon the option of exploring <b>non-binding</b> and incentive <b>measures,</b> both at the international and external levels, to be encouraged as a viable complement to binding measures...|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, a {{majority}} of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) members in the Namibia advisory opinion held that the resolution contained legal declarations that were made while the Council was acting on behalf of the members in accordance with Article 24. The Court also said that an interpretation of the charter that limits the domain of binding decision only to those taken under Chapter VII would render Article 25 [...] "superfluous, since this binding effect is secured by Articles 48 and 49 of the Charter", and that the [...] "language of a resolution of the Security Council should be carefully analyzed before a conclusion can be made as to its binding effect". The ICJ judgment has been criticized by Erika De Wet and others. De Wet argues that Chapter VI resolutions cannot be binding. Her reasoning, in part states:Allowing the Security Council to adopt binding measures under Chapter VI would undermine the structural division of competencies foreseen by Chapters VI and VII, respectively.

Professor Stephen Zunes asserts that [...] "this does not mean that resolutions under Chapter VI are merely advisory, however. These are still directives by the Security Council and differ only in {{that they do not have}} the same stringent enforcement options, such as the use of military force". Former President of the International Court of Justice Rosalyn Higgins argues that the location of Article 25, outside of Chapter VI and VII and with no reference to either, suggests its application is not limited to Chapter VII decisions. She asserts that the Travaux préparatoires to the UN Charter [...] "provide some evidence that Article 25 was not intended to be limited to Chapter VII, or inapplicable to Chapter VI." [...] She argues that early state practice into what resolutions UN members considered binding has been somewhat ambiguous, but seems to [...] "rely not upon whether they are to be regarded as [...] "Chapter VI or [...] "Chapter VII" [...] resolutions ... but upon whether the parties intended them to be [...] "decisions" [...] or [...] "recommendations" ... One is left with the view that in certain limited, and perhaps rare, cases a binding decision may be taken under Chapter VI". She supports the view of the ICJ that [...] "clearly regarded Chapters VI, VII, VIII and XII as lex specialis while Article 24 contained the lex generalis ... and that resolutions validly adopted under Article 24 were binding on the membership as a whole".|$|R
