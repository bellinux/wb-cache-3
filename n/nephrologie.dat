40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Although several {{risk factors}} {{associated}} with complications after renal biopsy (RB) have been identified, recommendations for RB procedures are still lacking. Our working group, appointed by the scientific commission of the Société de <b>néphrologie</b> in France, aimed to depict the main aspects {{of the practice of}} RB in adults in France, before establishing some guidelines. METHODS: Members of the Société de <b>néphrologie</b> in France were asked to participate to a questionnaire survey on RB procedures. RESULTS: Eighty-eight nephrologists from 74 units (27 in teaching hospitals, 35 in public general hospitals, and 12 in private centers) participated in our study. Native kidney and graft biopsies were performed in 73 and 35 units, respectively. RB activity was highly variable among units, ranging from several hundred to less than ten per year. Transjugular RB was judged to be smoothly accessible in 28 out of 73 units (38. 4 %). Significant variations in practices were observed regarding patient information before RB, assessment of hemorrhagic risk factors, care of patients with antiplatelet agents and hemorrhagic risk factors, and radiological guidance. Early discharge (< 12 hours) was the rule in three (4. 1 %) units for native kidney biopsies and in ten (28. 6 %) units for graft biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to provide a representative picture of "everyday" RB practices in a country. Consensual recommendations on all points mentioned are provided here...|$|E

However, in the pediatric population, eGFR is rarely determined by laboratories as Schwartz formula requires height information, which is normally {{not available in}} clinical laboratory databases. Pottel et al. [1] developed a height-independent equation eDFG= 107. 3 /(Pcr/Q) with Q = median of Pcr for each age class. The aim {{of the study was}} 1) to adapt this equation to our laboratory (Pottel-Lyon) and 2) to compare its performance to the original-Pottel equation and to the Schwartz equation. Methods: 1) All first Pcr determination performed in children (1 to 18 years old) in the pediatric hospital in 2010 and 2011 were collected. Median of Pcr was determined for sex and each one-year-age-interval and considered as the locally adapted coefficient (Q-Lyon). 2) Among the whole population, 438 true measurements of GFR (mGFR, inulin or iohexol clearance, 359 children) were performed and compared to eGFR calculated by a) the Pottel-Lyon, b) the original-Pottel equation and c) the Schwartz equation. Pcr was determined by an IDMS-standardized enzymatic assay. Results: The local coefficient Q-Lyon was determined with the first Pcr measurement of 12219 children (53 % males, mean Pcr= 43 ± 44 [12 - 2122] µmol/L). Children with a mGFR (58 % males) were aged of 10 ± 3 years (3 - 18) with a mean Pcr of 55 ± 28 (17 - 262) µmol/L and a mean of eGFR of 93 ± 33 (18 - 204) ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2. The Pottel-Lyon equation has a significant lower bias compared to the original-Pottel and to the Schwartz equation (0. 9 ± 21. 2, 8. 9 ± 23. 1 and 10. 0 ± 22. 5, respectively) and a better 30 % accuracy (87. 0 % vs 79. 6 % and 81. 0 %, respectively). The performance in identifying patients with renal dysfunction (GFR Discussion and conclusion: The GFR-predicting-equations (Schwartz, original Pottel and adapted Pottel-Lyon formulas) are reliable with a better performance of the adapted Pottel-Lyon equation.

In collaboration with the Société de <b>Néphrologie</b> Pédiatrique we undertook a retrospective review of all cases of HUS hospitalized from January 1993 to March 1995 and a 1 -year prospective study (April 1995 -March 1996) of epidemiological and microbiological features of cases of HUS. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure was used to detect stx, eae, e-hlyA genes directly from case stool samples. Serum samples from cases were examined for antibodies to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of 26 major STEC serogroups. Two hundred and eighty-six cases were reported. The average incidence per year was 0. 7 / 10 (5) children < 15 years and 1. 8 / 10 (5) children < 5 years.

40|$|Abstract. Amyloidosis of the P 2 -microglobulin (P 2 M) type is a {{recently}} recognised complication of dialysis. We studied plasma and ultrafiltrate P 2 M in 36 chronic haemodialysis patients. Long-term dialysis with stan-dard cuprophan membrane in non-oliguric patients {{and with the}} AN 69 polyacrylonitrile membrane in oliguric patients resulted in lower plasma P 2 M concentrations (means ±SD, 24. 4 ± 6. 6 and 33. 0 + 8. 2 ug/ml, respect-ively) than with cuprophan in oliguric patients (47. 0 ± 13. 2 ug/ml,/>< 0. 02). After 15 min ultrafiltration, P 2 M sieving coefficient in vivo was 0. 33 for AN 69 but near zero for cuprophan. Total mass transfer of P 2 M across the AN 69 membrane during a 4 -h dialysis was 142 ± 45. 8 mg (n = 7). AN 69, but not cuprophan, membrane fragments incubated in vitro with normal or uraemic plasma exhibited avid [125 - 1] P 2 M binding (respectively 12. 9 % vs 0. 47 % and 6. 09 % vs 0. 06 % of total P 2 M bound at 30 min, n = 6, P< 0. 001 for both). No in vitro generation of P 2 M from whole normal or uraemic blood could be demonstrated during incubation with either membrane.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the risk factors}} predictive of graft loss from chronic rejection in pediatric renal allograft recipients, we reviewed the collaborative study database of the Société de <b>Néphrologie</b> Pédiatrique which registered 314 grafts from January 1987 to December 1991. Of the 289 grafts analyzed, 71 failed during follow-up, chronic rejection being {{the most common cause}} of graft loss (35 %). The clinical features of the chronic rejection group (n = 25) were compared with those of the group without failure (n = 218). The variables tested by monovariate analysis were cyclosporine dose at 1 year, donor type, donor and recipient age, and acute rejection episodes. The incidence of graft loss due to chronic rejection was 4 % (4 / 109) in patients who had no acute rejection and 16 % (21 / 134) in those with at least one acute rejection episode (P = 0. 002). Donor age (< or = 5 years) was a risk factor for chronic rejection (P = 0. 024). Recipient age and donor type were not significantly different between the chronic rejection group and the control group. Using time-dependent covariates, the risk factors were an acute rejection episode (P = 0. 003) and low cyclosporine doses at 1 year (P = 0. 02). We conclude that acute rejection and low cyclosporine doses in these pediatric patients were risk factors for graft loss due to chronic rejection. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In a {{systematic}} {{study on the}} clinical picture and genetics of cystic kidneys in children, {{in association with the}} German working group on paediatric nephrology (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Pädiatrische <b>Nephrologie),</b> we have investigated 79 children with early manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). They belonged to 64 families (64 index patients and 15 affected sibs). Early manifestation was defined in this study as clinical symptoms (hypertension, proteinuria, impaired renal function, palpably enlarged kidneys) occurring before the age of 15 years. In order to estimate the recurrence risk to sibs of a previously diagnosed patient with early manifesting ADPKD, we found that 15 {{out of a total of}} 65 sibs of the 64 index patients (45 % of the theoretically expected 32. 5 gene carriers) showed comparable early manifestation. Another 10 symptom free children were diagnosed sonographically as having ADPKD before the age of 18 years, so that the total number of affected sibs was 25 / 65 in the study group, representing 76 % of the gene carriers. Although the gene in childhood manifesting ADPKD can be transmitted through both sexes, a statistically significant (p < 0. 05) maternal predominance was observed (M:F = 23 : 41). In affected sibs ages of onset, initial presentation, and the development of complications appeared to be similar in the majority of families. Our data indicate a high recurrence risk to sibs for early manifestation of ADPKD which has important implications for genetic counselling and clinical care of affected families and gives clues to the underlying genetic mechanism of childhood onset ADPKD...|$|E

In 2007, HX 575 (Binocrit®) became the first biosimilar epoetin alfa to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The decision to approve a biosimilar is based on the totality of evidence obtained in a comprehensive comparability exercise that involves extensive analytical characterization, nonclinical studies and clinical studies. The development process for HX 575 included extensive analytical characterization and comparison with the reference epoetin alfa. This was followed by a clinical development program, comprising Phase I pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies to show bioequivalence to the reference medicine and a confirmatory Phase III study to demonstrate therapeutic effectiveness in anemia related to CKD. In addition to the comparability exercises, extensive clinical experience over the last decade also confirms that HX 575 provides an effective treatment for CKD-related anemia, with a favorable safety profile.

40|$|International audienceAim. - To {{investigate}} {{risk factors}} of renal complications in glycogen storage disease type I, {{in order to identify}} practical implications for renal preservation. Methods. - A retrospective study of 38 patients with glycogen storage disease type I. Results. - The patients studied were 8. 6 years old in average (1. 5 to 22 years) and were followed during 7. 4 +/- 4. 5 years. Hypercalciuria was detected in 23 patients and was related to acidosis (P = 0. 028), higher lactate levels (5. 9 +/- 3. 5 versus 3. 7 +/- 1. 7 mmol/L; P = 0. 013) and smaller height (- 2. 1 +/- 1. 5 SD versus - 0. 8 +/- 1. 5 SD; P = 0. 026). Urolithiasis was diagnosed in 7 cases. Glomerular disease (19 / 38) was more frequent in cases with severe hypertriglyceridemia (P = 0. 042) and occurred at an older age (P = 0. 007). Microalbuminuria occurred in 15 / 31 cases; ACE inhibitors were prescribed in only 8 cases. The frequency of renal complications did not differ according to the diet group (continuous enteral feeding or uncooked starch). Logistic regression concluded as risk factors: lactic acidosis for tubular disease and age > 10 years for glomerular disease. Conclusions. - Renal involvement is common in glycogen storage disease type I patients. Tubular abnormalities are precocious, related to lactic acidosis and may be detected by monitoring of urinary calcium. Glomerular hyperfiltration is the first stage of a progressive glomerular disease and is related to age. Practical implications for renal preservation are discussed based on our results and literature. (C) 2015 Association Societe de <b>nephrologie.</b> Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|National audienceAngiogenesis {{inhibitor}} drugs (bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib [...] .) are {{now widely}} used {{for treatment of}} cancers, including colorectal, advanced renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas, breast cancer). Vascular and renal side-effects of these drugs are not well known. Hypertension {{is one of the}} most common side effects. Incidence of hypertension may be different among angiogenis inhibitors and seems dose-depend. Arterial pressure can usually be controlled with anti-hypertensive medications, and treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors can be continued in most cases; however, serious hypertension-induced side effects were reported included malignant hypertension, stroke and reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy. Renal damage is infrequently reported: usually reversible mild or moderate proteinuria and in some rare cases nephritic syndrome, acute renal dysfunction, proliferative or collapsing glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy. Prolongation of the QT interval, congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction have been reported in patients using tinibs. In the present guidelines, we recommend: (1) before the first administration of angiogenesis inhibitors: acute IV or oral antihypertensive medications should not be administered in a patient regardless of arterial pressure levels with postponing the administration because of hypertension is not recommended; (2) initial work-up should include ambulatory measurement of arterial pressure (by the general practitioner or by the patient using home blood pressure (three times in the morning and in the evening during three consecutive days) with a validated (cf: [URL] upper arm device: ideally, this device should be financed and provided by the pharmaceutical companies marketing the angiogenesis inhibitor drugs. Using 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement is optional; (3) urine dipstick (and quantification if positive) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (using abbreviated MDRD rather than Cockcroft-Gault formula) must be performed before treatment and regularly during follow-up; (4) therapeutic management must be done in accordance with national or international guidelines (in France: [URL] (5) optimal care is best achieved within a network of professionals including general practitioners, oncologists, cardiologists and nephrologists.

Methods: This multicenter, prospective, 24 -week, noninterventional study enrolled 5, 831 patients from primary care offices in Germany and Austria. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of essential hypertension and newly initiated treatment with the FDC. Results: The mean age of patients was 63. 5 years, almost 50 % of patients had a time since diagnosis of essential hypertension of over 5 years, and approximately 70 % of patients had at least one cardiovascular risk factor, including 29. 4 % of patients with diabetes mellitus. Following approximately 24 weeks of treatment, the mean reduction in systolic/diastolic BP was 29. 0 / 14. 0 mmHg, a BP response was observed by 94. 2 % of patients, and a target BP of < 140 / 90 mmHg was attained in 67. 5 % of patients. At least one adverse drug reaction (ADR) was experienced by 1. 2 % of patients, with the most common being peripheral edema. Subanalyses demonstrated that the following factors did not have a significant influence on the ADR rate: age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years), diabetes mellitus (no/yes), cardiovascular risk (low/high), and concomitant medication (no/yes).

Inflammatory parameters (CRP 16. 3 mg/dL) and {{white blood cells}} (15 g/L) were elevated. The patient reported a weight loss of 10 kg in 4 weeks. There was no fever or any other specific symptoms. Urine dipstick examination and computed tomography of the chest were unremarkable. Because of increasing symptoms, the patient was referred to our department. Magnetic resonance tomography showed diffuse inflammatory changes of the muscles of both thighs. Neurological examination and electrophysiology revealed axonal sensorimotor neuropathy and ground-glass opacities of both lungs had occurred. Serum creatinine increased to 229  µmol/L within a few days, with proteinuria of 3. 3  g/g creatinine. Kidney biopsy showed diffuse pauci-immune proliferative glomerulonephritis. Proteinase 3 -specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were markedly increased. Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score was 35. Within 2  days, serum creatinine further increased to 495 µmol/L. Plasma exchange, high-dose glucocorticosteroids, and hemodialysis were started. The patient received cyclophosphamide 1 g twice and rituximab 375  mg/m 2 four times according to the RITUXVAS protocol. Despite ongoing therapy, hemodialysis could not be withdrawn {{and had to be}} continued over 3 weeks until diuresis normalized. Glucocorticosteroids were tapered to 20  mg after 2 months, and serum creatinine was 133 µmol/L. However, nephritic urinary sediment reappeared. Another dose of 1 g cyclophosphamide was given, and glucocorticosteroids were raised for another 4 weeks. After 6 months, the daily prednisolone dose was able to be tapered to 5  mg.

Lately, FGF- 23 has been suggested as an independent risk factor of death in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Hyperparathyroidism is a com-mon feature of advanced kidney failure or end-stage renal disease. The independent effect of elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels on FGF- 23 secretion is still a matter of debate and has not yet been studied in an in vitro model of human bone marrow cells (BMC) during osteogenic differentiation. BMC from three different donors were cultivated for 4 weeks in cell cultures devoid of vitamin D either without 1 - 34 PTH or with PTH concentrations of 10 or 100 pmol/L, respectively. After 28 days, protein expression of the cells was determined by immunocytochemical staining, whereas real time-polymerase chain reaction served to ana-lyze gene expression of several osteoblastic (osteocalcin, RANKL, Runx- 2 and ostase) and osteoclastic markers (RANK, TRAP- 5 b). The concentrations of FGF- 23, ostase and TRAP- 5 b were determined by ELISA at weeks 2, 3 and 4. We found a basal expression of FGF- 23 with no increase in FGF- 23 secretion after stimulation with 10 pmol/L 1 - 34 PTH. Stimulation with 100 pmol/L PTH resulted in an increase in FGF- 23 expression (14. 1 ± 3. 6 pg/mL with no PTH, 13. 7 ± 4. 0 pg/mL with 10 pmol/L, P= 0. 84 and 17. 6 ± 3. 4 pg/mL with 100 pmol/L, P= 0. 047). These results suggest a vitamin D and PTH-independent FGF- 23 expression in human BMC after osteogenic stimulation. As only higher PTH levels stimulated FGF- 23 expres-sion, a threshold level might be hypothesized...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Insertion of {{percutaneous}} endoscopic gastrostomies (PEG) {{in patients}} on chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) {{has been reported}} to be contraindicated due to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. However, no systematic survey on this topic has yet been published. DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter study. SETTING: 23 pediatric dialysis units associated with the working group Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Pädiatrische <b>Nephrologie</b> (APN). DATA SOURCE: A structured questionnaire on clinical details of PD patients who had undergone PEG insertion or open gastrostomy (OG) since 1994 was distributed to all pediatric dialysis units of the APN. RESULTS: 27 PD patients (20 males) from 12 centers in whom PEG insertion was performed after Tenckhoff catheter introduction were evaluated. Age at intervention ranged from 0. 25 to 10. 9 years (median 1. 3 years). Most patients were malnourished, with standard deviation score (SDS) for body weight between - 4. 2 and - 0. 6 (median - 2. 2). Major complications were early peritonitis < 7 days after PEG in 10 / 27 (37 %) patients, episodes of fungal peritonitis in 7 / 27 (26 %) patients, 4 cessations of PD and change to hemodialysis, and 2 associated deaths. However, in 14 patients, no such problems were encountered and, in 4 patients, early peritonitis effectively treated with intraperitoneal antibiotics was the only major complication. Thus, in 18 / 27 (67 %) patients, PD was successfully reinitiated shortly after PEG insertion. Among all participating centers, only two OG procedures were reported during the study period, illustrating a clear preference for the PEG over the OG procedure among members of the APN. CONCLUSION: PEG insertion following PD initiation carries a high risk for fungal peritonitis and potential PD failure; however, complication rates in this largest reported series were lower than previously described. Antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis, withholding PD for 2 - 3 days, and gastrostomy placement by an experienced endoscopy team are suggested precautions for lowering the risk of associated complications. When gastrostomy placement does not occur prior to or at the time of initiating PD, the risks and benefits of percutaneous versus open placement must be carefully weighed...|$|E

The aims {{of the present study}} were to confirm these data in an unselected patient population in daily practice and to determine the impact of physical activity on blood pressure control. Methods: In a multicenter, noninterventional study, 3, 333 patients with either insufficient blood pressure control on olmesartan 40 mg alone or on a fixed/free combination of olmesartan 40 mg and HCTZ 12. 5 / 25 mg were primarily assessed for safety and tolerability of the fixed-dose combination of olmesartan 40 mg and HCTZ 12. 5 / 25 mg at 24 ± 2 weeks. Secondary objectives were blood pressure reduction, treatment compliance, and impact of physical activity as measured by the sum of weekly energy costs. Results: The mean patient age was 63. 2 ± 11. 46 years, mean baseline blood pressure was 159. 6 ± 15. 28 / 93. 5 ± 9. 52 mmHg, and 70. 9 % had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Adverse drug reactions were rare (n = 19), and no serious adverse drug reactions occurred. Compliance with drug therapy was at least sufficient in more than 99 % of patients {{at the end of the}} study. Blood pressure at the last available visit was reduced by 26. 1 ± 15. 5 / 13. 0 ± 10. 1 mmHg versus baseline (P < 0. 0001), but had reduced effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years with diabetes or impaired renal function. In 69 % of patients, blood pressure was normalized (< 140 / 90 mmHg). No noteworthy differences in baseline characteristics or baseline blood pressure were found between patients with an activity level (sum of weekly energy costs) above or below the median of 9, 460. 6. A higher versus lower physical activity score had no impact on blood pressure reduction. Conclusion: Our data confirm randomized trial data concerning safe and efficient blood pressure reduction using a fixed-dose combination of olmesartan 40 mg and HCTZ 12. 5 / 25 mg in a large, unselected patient population, independent of physical activity level.

Regulatory bodies and expert panels in the USA and Europe have recognized that both acute rejection and one-year graft function should be assessed when evaluating immunosuppressive regimens. TRANSFORM (Clinicaltrials. gov NCT 01950819) {{is one of the}} first trials to adopt this approach and the first that applies a novel combined clinically meaningful endpoint to take the first step towards changing the paradigm for immunosuppression in kidney transplant patients. Everolimus with reduced-exposure calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy is a strategy designed to reduce the risk of chronic nephrotoxicity and other dose-dependent complications associated with CNI therapy. In TRANSFORM, de novo kidney transplant patients are randomized to everolimus with reduced-exposure CNI, or mycophenolic acid with standard-exposure CNI, both with induction therapy and maintenance steroids. The primary endpoint is a composite of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection or estimated glomerular filtration rate, 50 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 at month 12 post-transplant, which is expected to be sensitive both to the effects of acute and chronic allograft rejection and nephrotoxic side effects of immunosuppressive therapies. The construct of this endpoint allows the integration of a continuous outcome (graft function) with a logistic outcome (rejection). The trial uses a randomized, multicenter, open-label, two-arm design. After completion of a 2 -year core study, patients enter a further 3 -year prospective observational study. By capturing follow-up to 5 years, TRANSFORM will provide substantial data on the incidence of graft loss, graft dysfunction, cancer, cardiovascular events, and other patient-relevant outcomes. TRANSFORM will determine whether de novo CNI reduction with an everolimus-based regimen achieves short-term outcomes compared with standard CNI. As the largest clinical trial undertaken to date in kidney transplantation, recruiting more than 2, 000 patients, and with extended follow-up to 5 years, TRANSFORM will provide critical data required to help maximize long-term outcomes.
