5|$|Cornelio Saavedra, who {{was aware}} of the conspiracy, {{considered}} it a plot by peninsulars to secure political power over the criollo peoples. He marched with the Regiment of Patricians swiftly to the Plaza, and thwarted the mutiny. There was <b>no</b> <b>violence</b> in the operation, as the criollos forced the rebels to give up just by the sheer force of numbers. Thus, Liniers stayed in office as viceroy. All the heads of the mutiny were sentenced to prison at Carmen de Patagones, and the militias that took part in it were dissolved. The only peninsular militias remaining were those of Andaluces and Montañeses, who did not join the mutiny; criollos obtained the military command, and the political power of Saavedra increased even more.|$|E

Soon they are stopped by the survivors, who were looking for food, but the griffins don't have any food {{so they have to}} {{distract}} them. They continue their journey only to find that the car has run out of gas. The griffins now have to walk to Natick just as they found new home, but Peter thinks that our main journey was Natick as Lois takes an apple and bites it while an old man plays the song. So they once again continue their journey after Lois throws the apple at him. They made to natick, but there is no factory. Stewie yells that they done of their life only to trip and get covered in nuclear waste. Upon the sun lights up and shows the factory is still standing and in perfect condition.

Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. One year later, New Quahog has become a fresh new community, complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills. However, when Brian points out how New Quahog is a peaceful place with <b>no</b> <b>violence,</b> Peter says that they are completely defenseless finds metal to make guns. Later stewie has transformed into an octopus, when lois tries put stewie on with the pajamas with a trap door on the back, he sprays with ink but misses it.

5000|$|The Calvinist {{tradition}} in Plaid Cymru has also influenced its non-violent approach. [...] "The ideal is <b>no</b> fist <b>violence,</b> <b>no</b> verbal <b>violence,</b> and <b>no</b> heart <b>violence....</b> Christians... {{point to the}} New Testament example of Jesus Christ clearing the temple. Here there is <b>no</b> suggestion of <b>violence</b> against people; rather the tables are turned as a symbolic act. The life and teaching of Jesus Christ were seen as the foundations of nonviolent direct action Plaid Cymru members... loving their enemies on the one hand, but not compromising on {{what they saw as}} an issue of moral rightness." [...] Plaid Cymru continues to see itself as very much part of the Christian pacifist tradition.|$|R

The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for {{the overthrow of the}} industrial system; here first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} two years Berry clung to office while the colony was gripped with class conflict, {{including}} huge torchlit processions through Melbourne sponsored by The Age (pro-Berry) and The Argus (anti-Berry) - although, remarkably, there was almost <b>no</b> <b>violence.</b> Almost no legislation was passed and the administration ground to a halt as funds ran out. Berry's next tactic was to pass a bill through the Assembly stating that finance bills {{did not need to be}} passed by the Council, but would become law when passed by the Assembly. Bowen thought this bill unconstitutional, but signed it on Berry's advice. When the Colonial Office learned of this, Bowen was recalled and the bill overturned.|$|E
25|$|The Whiskey Rebellion {{happened}} in 1794—when {{settlers in the}} Monongahela Valley of western Pennsylvania protested against the new federal tax on whiskey, which the settlers shipped across the mountains to earn money. It was the first serious test of the federal government. Washington ordered federal marshals to serve court orders requiring the tax protesters to appear in federal district court. By August 1794, the protests became dangerously close to outright rebellion, and on August 7, several thousand armed settlers gathered near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Washington then invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to summon the militias of several states. A force of 13,000 men was organized, and Washington personally led it to Western Pennsylvania. The revolt immediately collapsed, and there was <b>no</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E

25|$|Guru: The will {{to suffer}} and {{sacrifice}} should be there. But {{there is no}} need to get drenched or starved. Enter where entry is banned and face the consequences, Take blows without giving them. If a fence is raised in your path , don't turn back, jump over it. Don't stop with walking through the road, enter the temple, every temple, every day, everybody. If the offering of pudding is ready, take it. Go to the place where free food is served in the temple; and sit along with others. Let the Government be informed of what you intend to do. One should not fight shy of laying down one's life. Those who think another's touch pollutes him should not be left unmolested in their so called cleanliness. That is my view…. Give publicity to all these in the papers. Let people know that I subscribe to their views. But let there be <b>no</b> <b>violence</b> or show of force. Don't be perturbed by coercion.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 November, the {{reinforcements}} and the loyal members of the 26th and 62nd Regiments moved into position. They secretly surrounded the sepoy camp ground and a final message {{was sent to the}} mutineers, demanding that they lay down arms before any discussion on grievances but it is said that only ten minutes were offered to make up their minds. The sepoys either hesitated or rejected the ultimatum and Paget ordered two cannons to fire on the rebels, followed by an attack from the rear by the secretly placed horse artillery. Surprised by this sudden assault, the sepoys tried to flee {{but the rest of the}} British regiments attacked from all directions. Some of the sepoys jumped into the Hooghly River to escape and drowned, others entered local households for shelter but the loyalists chased them in and killed them with bayonets. Many bystanders, including women and children who happened to be in the neighbourhood, were killed during the operation. Afterwards, it was found that the muskets of the Indian sepoys were not loaded. Stevenson concludes that this implies <b>no</b> <b>violence</b> was intended by the rebels.|$|E
25|$|President Grant's Reconstruction policy {{worked through}} the U.S. Attorney General and the Justice Department, in {{addition}} to the Secretary of War and the War Department. During later Reconstruction white supremacists known as white liners in both the North and the South put pressure on the Grant Administration to limit the use of deployed troops in the South that protected African American citizens under the Reconstruction Act of 1867. Previously President Grant had destroyed the Ku Klux Klan under the Enforcement Acts in 1871. Resistance continued and resurged as white liners violently attacked Mississippi blacks in 1875. Republican Governor Adelbert Ames requested troops to protect black voters. In order to avoid violence, Attorney General Pierrepont sent George K. Chase to Mississippi who met with white liner leaders to hold them to their previous pledge not to use violence during the election. President Grant and Att. Gen. Pierrepont told Governor Ames to use federal troops only if the white liners used violence on election day. <b>No</b> <b>violence</b> took place on election day, however, the intimidation tactics of the white liners prior to the election kept blacks and Republican voters from the polls.|$|E
