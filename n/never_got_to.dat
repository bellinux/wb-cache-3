5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E

It was one of Lennon's projects that he <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> finish. Later that year, Ono and Lennon's final album, Milk and Honey, was released as an unfinished demo. It peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 11 in the U.S., going gold in both countries {{as well as in}} Canada.|$|E

25|$|Sabburg was {{considered}} one of the best fieldsman in Queensland even though he wasn't a full-time cricketer. He still managed to impress Brisbane Heat coach to earn a spot in the team for two seasons.

25|$|The 1989 {{game between}} UCLA and Arkansas was highly publicized in the Dallas area because Bruin quarterback Troy Aikman was {{expected}} to be the top pick in the 1989 NFL Draft; the first pick was held by the Dallas Cowboys. Much was made of Cowboys longtime head coach Tom Landry watching Aikman practice at Texas Stadium, UCLA's practice facility for game preparation. Landry <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> draft Aikman, because he was fired the next month, but his successor, Jimmy Johnson, did. UCLA and Aikman won, 17–3.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year The Times noted that horse-racing was losing popularity in France, with cricket, on Dorset's recommendation, taking its place. In 1789 Dorset planned {{what might have}} become the first international cricket tour. His touring side, which included William Yalden, William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens, {{got as far as}} congregating on 10 August at Dover. But the French Revolution meant that they <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> France, thereby making his tour the first international cricket tour to be cancelled for political reasons. Just as the American Civil War 80 or so years later destroyed the prospect of cricket becoming popular there, so the French Revolution destroyed any footholds the game had in France.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} storyline {{featuring}} Diane during her initial stint on the soap concerned the character {{running away from}} home in 1990. In the on-screen events, Diane was shown to be increasingly unhappy towards {{the latter part of}} 1989, exacerbated by the sudden departure of her boyfriend Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton). Diane decided to run away from home in January 1990 when it seemed her family had forgotten her 16th birthday—they were actually planning a surprise party for her that she <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> see. Diane's disappearance dominated the programme in the beginning of 1990. Focus was placed upon the effect her departure had on the Butcher family, in particular her father Frank who searched unsuccessfully for his missing daughter.|$|E
25|$|The {{syndicated}} series ran for 1,320 episodes {{over seven}} seasons. An attempt at an eighth season {{did not get}} off the ground as not enough stations were willing to pick up the series for an additional year. With this in mind, Goodson-Todman offered host Blyden the hosting position on Showoffs, a charades-based game show that the company was developing for ABC's daytime lineup. He accepted and shot a pilot shortly after What's My Line? ended production. However, Blyden <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> host the series as he was killed in an automobile accident while traveling in Morocco just before taping was to begin. At the time of Blyden's death, a handful new episodes of What's My Line? had yet to air in certain markets; by the fall of 1975, the last of these episodes had aired across the United States.|$|E

But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?" ...|$|E

[...] I {{had always wanted to}} play the record live and fully orchestrated—that is what this is all about. [...] I always like live recording and I like listening to live records too. [...] I'm not too fond of being in a studio—it's too contrived and too confining. I like the freedom of live, in-the-moment sound." ...|$|E

500|$|Marc Zablotny, {{a writer}} for the Official Nintendo Magazine, {{included}} it in his 2013 wishlist. He used Kirby's Return to Dream Land, a game originally announced in 2005 and released in 2011, to show the possibility that Metroid Dread could still be made. He also stated that he was more interested in what Dread [...] "stood for rather than the specific game itself." [...] Zablotny later included it in a list of the [...] "15 more Nintendo Games you <b>never</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> play" [...] and called {{it one of the most}} infamous examples of a cancelled Nintendo game.
