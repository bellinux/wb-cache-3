5|$|The house {{eventually}} {{passed to}} the Chetwynd family, who sold it to the Marchioness of Rockingham, widow of Prime Minister The Marquess of Rockingham, in 1786 for £9,000. The Marchioness lived there until her own death in 1804, upon which the estate passed to her stepsister Elizabeth, widow of William Weddell MP. Her husband had left her Newby Hall in Mayfair, therefore having <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> Hillingdon House, she sold it to Josias Du Pré Porcher in 1805. In 1810 the estate was sold to Richard Henry Cox, {{a member of the}} Cox banking family and the grandson of Richard Cox, founder of the travel company Cox & Kings.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no trace}} of reason in God because reason is desire and God lacks nothing. Adam was not created in reason. Had it been otherwise, his problem could have been healed by natural {{learning}} {{and there would be}} <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> Christ and <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> faith. The worldly case against reason is that its products do not last: a great remedy for some human problem is devised but soon lost patience with and a new novelty is again demanded. Thus thy wisdom is thy woe. Reason should not be discarded but placed as subservient to faith. Reason, like fire and water, is a bad master but a good servant. Above all, one cannot use reason to seek out the Lord.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{oxidation}} by air {{is still}} being used, oxygen (> 95% purity) is preferred for several reasons, such as higher molar yield of ethylene oxide (75–82% for oxygen vs. 63–75% for air), higher reaction rate (no gas dilution) and <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> separating nitrogen in the reaction products.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} small size, copepods have <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> any heart or circulatory system (the {{members of the}} order Calanoida have a heart, but no blood vessels), and most also lack gills. Instead, they absorb oxygen {{directly}} into their bodies. Their excretory system consists of maxillary glands.|$|E

25|$|The heat {{recovery}} boiler is item 5 in the COGAS figure shown above. No combustion of fuel {{means that there}} is <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> a fuel handling plant, and it is simply a heat exchanger. Exhaust enters in super heater and the evaporator and then in to economiser section as it flows out from the boiler.|$|E
25|$|If the {{existence}} of karma is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor {{of the universe is}} unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> a God.|$|E

It is not named in the first definition of qsort, which deals with the base case of an empty list and thus has <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> this function, let alone a name for it.|$|E

25|$|The {{last day}} of the Julian {{calendar}} was Thursday, 4 October 1582 and this was followed by {{the first day of the}} Gregorian calendar, Friday, 15 October. Thus, while the halachic vernal equinox occurred on March 25 until 1582, in 1583 it occurred on April 4 of the new Gregorian Calendar. However, the Jewish calendar was in <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> such a modification, and remained uninfluenced by it. As a result, the halachic vernal equinox has been shifting slightly forward in the Gregorian year ever since 1582.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 Almin {{was bought}} by Imperial Aluminium Company (Impalco), a company formed between the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) which {{incorporated}} the whole of ICI's aluminium facilities. Impalco's primary interest in buying Almin was to acquire the facilities of International Alloys, {{a member of the}} Almin group. Thus Fulmer was acquired incidentally and it did not fit easily into the Impalco group. Since Impalco had huge research facilities in-house, it had <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> Fulmer's services. Impalco's rival companies were also reluctant to place large contracts with Fulmer under this ownership.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Hudsons are a {{group of}} semi-streamlined 4-6-4 Hudson steam {{locomotives}} owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and built by Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW). The engine was built in 1938. In 1939, King George VI allowed the CPR {{to use the term}} after Royal Hudson number 2850 transported the royal train across Canada with <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> replacement. These locomotives were in service between 1937 and 1960. Four of them have been preserved. 2839 was used to power excursions for the Southern Railway Steam Program between 1979 and 1980, and 2860 was used for excursion service in British Columbia between 1974 and 1999, then again between 2006 and 2010.|$|E

25|$|Patent {{prints are}} chance {{friction}} ridge impressions which are obvious {{to the human}} eye and which {{have been caused by}} the transfer of foreign material from a finger onto a surface. Some obvious examples would be impressions from flour and wet clay. Because they are already visible and have <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> enhancement they are generally photographed rather than being lifted in the way that latent prints are. An attempt to preserve the actual print is always made for later presentation in court, and there are many techniques used to do this. Patent prints can be left on a surface by materials such as ink, dirt, or blood.|$|E
25|$|Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, {{so it can}} {{be taken}} orally with <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> {{protection}} from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.|$|E
25|$|Biodegradability (also {{known as}} biodegradation)--the {{ability to be}} {{disintegrated}} by biological approaches, including bacteria, fungi, and cells—is another significant property of biomaterials today. Biodegradable materials can minimize the pain of patients from surgeries, especially in tissue engineering, there is <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> surgery in order to remove the scaffold implanted. Wang et al. showed the in vivo degradation of silk via aqueous 3-D scaffolds implanted into Lewis rats. Enzymes are the means used to achieve degradation of silk in vitro. Protease XIV from Streptomyces griseus and α-chymotrypsin from bovine pancreases are the two popular enzymes for silk degradation. In addition, gamma-radiation, as well as cell metabolism, can also regulate the degradation of silk.|$|E

25|$|In Federalist No. 8, Alexander Hamilton {{worried that}} {{maintaining}} a large standing army {{would be a}} dangerous and expensive undertaking. In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall. Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented {{the idea of a}} strong nation protected by a navy with <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> a standing army. The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division. He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.|$|E
25|$|The Indians were poised with cavalry on both flanks, their center {{comprising}} infantry with War Elephants {{which were}} heavily armored and were strapped {{on with a}} castle-like howdah on their back carrying a trio of archers and javelin hurlers towering among or before them in equal intervals of fifty feet to defend the vulnerable flanks. All of the War-Elephants were equipped with fire-hardened leather and quilted armor for protection while their foreheads and trunks bore steel-plates to defend against enemy arrows. The Pauravan Army itself was dressed in flamboyantly hued outfits wearing steel helmets, bright scarves and baldrics wielding axes, lances and maces. King Porus, seated atop the tallest War Elephant selected from his elephant corps, himself was not mounted on Howdah, as he wore a remarkable chain mail armor and hence had <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> the additional protection of a tower.|$|E
25|$|Over time, Paige's {{condition}} worsens as {{she starts}} leaving around Husk replicas with her old skin (replicas that Toad, {{in love with}} her, keeps to himself and even uses in his tea parties). During the events of Avengers vs. X-Men, she starts a sentimental relationship with him. Her mental condition grows worse too, and she doesn't even acknowledge a riot {{in one of her}} classes. After that, Kitty Pryde states that Paige is in no condition to teach and suggests removing her from the active staff. In a burst of fury, Paige decides to quit the school, considering Kitty was about to fire her. Then, Paige decides to take some time for herself, leaving the school and telling Toad she will eventually come back. She even assures him she is in <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric help.|$|E
