5000|$|Bicycles {{usually have}} a system for {{selecting}} different gear ratios. There are two main types: derailleur gears and hub gears. The derailleur type is the most common, and the most visible, using sprocket gears. Typically there are several gears available on the rear sprocket assembly, attached to the rear wheel. A few more sprockets are usually added to the front assembly as well. Multiplying the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sprocket <b>gears</b> in front by the number to the rear gives the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios, often called [...] "speeds".|$|R

50|$|A {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) (also known as a single-speed transmission, stepless transmission, pulley transmission, or, in case of motorcycles, a twist-and-go) is an automatic transmission that can change seamlessly through a continuous range <b>of</b> effective <b>gear</b> ratios. This contrasts with other mechanical transmissions that offer a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios. The flexibility of a CVT allows the input shaft to maintain a constant angular velocity.|$|R

5000|$|Besides the {{traditional}} hydraulic automatic transmissions, {{there are also}} other types of automated transmissions, such as a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and semi-automatic transmissions, that free the driver from having to shift gears manually, by using the transmissions computer to change gear, if for example the driver were redlining the engine. Despite superficial similarity to other transmissions, traditional automatic transmissions differ significantly in internal operation and drivers feel from semi-automatics and CVTs. In contrast to conventional automatic transmissions, a CVT uses a belt or other torque transmission scheme to allow an [...] "infinite" [...] <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios instead <b>of</b> a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> ratios. A semi-automatic retains a clutch like a manual transmission, but controls the clutch through electrohydraulic means.
