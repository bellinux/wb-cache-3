25|$|The {{structure}} of plant-pollinator networks may have large {{consequences for the}} way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions. Mathematical models, examining the consequences of this <b>network</b> <b>structure</b> for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh. This means that pollinator species together can survive under harsh conditions. But it also means that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Uncovering complex <b>network</b> <b>structures</b> from a {{biological}} system {{is one of}} the main topic in system biology. The <b>network</b> <b>structures</b> can be inferred by the dynamical Bayesian network or Granger causality, but neither techniques have seriously taken into account the impact of environmental inputs. Results With considerations of natural rhythmic dynamics of biological data, we propose a system biology approach to reveal the impact of environmental inputs on <b>network</b> <b>structures.</b> We first represent the environmental inputs by a harmonic oscillator and combine them with Granger causality to identify environmental inputs and then uncover the causal <b>network</b> <b>structures.</b> We also generalize it to multiple harmonic oscillators to represent various exogenous influences. This system approach is extensively tested with toy models and successfully applied to a real biological network of microarray data of the flowering genes of the model plant Arabidopsis Thaliana. The aim is to identify those genes that are directly affected by the presence of the sunlight and uncover the interactive <b>network</b> <b>structures</b> associating with flowering metabolism. Conclusion We demonstrate that environmental inputs are crucial for correctly inferring <b>network</b> <b>structures.</b> Harmonic causal method is proved to be a powerful technique to detect environment inputs and uncover <b>network</b> <b>structures,</b> especially when the biological data exhibit periodic oscillations. </p...|$|R

25|$|The nodes of {{this network}} can {{represent}} genes, proteins, mRNAs, protein/protein complexes or cellular processes. Nodes that are depicted as lying along vertical lines {{are associated with}} the cell/environment interfaces, while the others are free-floating and can diffuse. Edges between nodes represent interactions between the nodes, that can correspond to individual molecular reactions between DNA, mRNA, miRNA, proteins or molecular processes through which the products of one gene affect those of another, though the lack of experimentally obtained information often implies that some reactions are not modeled at such a fine level of detail. These interactions can be inductive (usually represented by arrowheads or the + sign), with an increase in the concentration of one leading to an increase in the other, inhibitory (represented with filled circles, blunt arrows or the minus sign), with an increase in one leading to a decrease in the other, or dual, when depending of the circumstances the regulator can activate or inhibit the target node. The nodes can regulate themselves directly or indirectly, creating feedback loops, which form cyclic chains of dependencies in the topological network. The <b>network</b> <b>structure</b> is an abstraction of the system's molecular or chemical dynamics, describing the manifold ways in which one substance affects all the others to which it is connected. In practice, such GRNs are inferred from the biological literature on a given system and represent a distillation of the collective knowledge about a set of related biochemical reactions. To speed up the manual curation of GRNs, some recent efforts try to use text mining, curated databases, network inference from massive data, model checking and other information extraction technologies for this purpose.|$|E

Under stereomicroscopy, we noticed that chromium-hematoxylin-stained threadlike structures, which were barely observable in 1 -week-old rats, were networked in specific areas of the brain, for example, the lateral lobes and the cerebella, in 4 -week-old rats. In 7 -week-old rats, those structures were found to have become larger and better networked. With phase contrast microscopy, we found that in 1 -week-old rats, chromium-hematoxylin-stained granules were scattered in the same areas of the brain in which the <b>network</b> <b>structures</b> would later be observed in the 4 - and 7 -week-old rats.
