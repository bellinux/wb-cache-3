50|$|Nutrigenetics: {{studies the}} effect of genetic {{variations}} on the interaction between diet and health with implications to susceptible subgroups. More specifically, <b>nutrigenetics</b> studies how individual differences in genes influence the body's response to diet and nutrition. For example, people with an enzyme deficiency caused by mutations in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase cannot metabolize foods containing the amino acid phenylalanine and must modify their diets to minimize consumption. With modern genomic data, severe gene mutations with less severe effects are being explored to determine whether dietary practices can be more closely personalized to individual genetic profiles. However, {{there have been few}} validated studies for these kinds of classical gene mutation effects.|$|E
50|$|By {{determining}} {{the mechanism of}} the effects of nutrients or the effects of a nutritional regime, nutrigenomics tries to define the causality or relationship between these specific nutrients and specific nutrient regimes (diets) on human health. Nutrigenomics has been associated with the idea of personalized nutrition based on genotype. While there is hope that nutrigenomics will ultimately enable such personalised dietary advice, it is a science still in its infancy and its contribution to public health over the next decade is thought to be major. Whilst nutrigenomics is aimed at developing an understanding of how the whole body responds to a food via systems biology, research into the effect of a single gene/single food compound relationships is known as <b>nutrigenetics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{a similar}} manner, an {{individual}} can respond to other environmental stimuli, factors or challenges differently according to specific genetic differences or alleles. These other factors include the diet and specific nutrients within the diet, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco use, sleep (bed time, duration), and any {{of a number of}} exposures (or exposome), including toxins, pollutants, sunlight (latitude north/south of the equator), among any number of others. The diet, for example, is modifiable and has significant impact on a host of cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In the clinic, typically assessed risks of these conditions include blood lipids (triglyceride, and HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), glycemic traits (plasma glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, beta cell function as HOMA-BC), obesity anthropometrics (BMI/obesity, adiposity, body weight, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio), vascular measures (diastolic and systolic blood pressure), and biomarkers of inflammation. Gene-Environment interactions can modulate the adverse effects of an allele that confers increased risk of disease, or can exacerbate the genotype-phenotype relationship and increase risk, in a manner often referred to as <b>nutrigenetics.</b> A catalog of genetic variants that associate with these and related cardiometabolic phenotypes and modified by common environmental factors is available.|$|E

If findings in such research are valid for some individuals, groups, or communities, and not for others, then ethical questions of justice – and not only issues of methodology and external validity – arise. This paper aims to examine inclusion in <b>nutrigenetics</b> clinical research and its scientific and ethical challenges. Methods: 173 publications were identified through a systematic review of clinical studies in <b>nutrigenetics</b> published between 1998 and 2007 inclusively. Data such as participants' demographics as well as eligibility criteria were extracted. Results: There is no consistency in the way participants’ origins (ancestry, ethnicity or race) and ages are described in publications. A {{vast majority of the}} studies identified was conducted in North America and Europe and focused on “white” participants. Our results show that pregnant women (and fetuses), minors and the elderly (≥ 75 years old) remain underrepresented.

Lucie Krupková, 2010 Abstract The {{effect of}} nutrition {{to human health}} is undisputable. Certain dietary compounds can influence each of us in different ways. Although people have almost identical genome, there are imperceptible diffenrences that make us unique. This uniqueness is shown in different responses to specific nutrients. The matter of diet, genes and gen-diet interactions are solved by two developing scientific disciplines - nutrigenomics and <b>nutrigenetics.</b> Nutrigenomics aims to {{determine the influence of}} common dietary ingredients on the genome, and attempts to relate the resulting different phenotypes to differences in the cellular and genetic response of the biological system. <b>Nutrigenetics</b> identifies and characterizes gene variants associated with differential responses to nutrients, and relates these variants to disease states. Scientific research is focused primarily on chronic diseases including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus type 2 and cancer.

40|$|Interactions between {{genotype}} {{and dietary}} intake include genetic moderation {{of the effect}} of dietary intake on disease development (<b>nutrigenetics).</b> Research on <b>nutrigenetics</b> has focused mainly on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and supports the notion that interactions between genes, diet, other lifestyle factors, disease, and time (life cycle span), contribute to the risk of most polygenic nutritionrelated diseases. Typically, genotype-based personalised nutrition involves genotyping for a number of susceptibility SNPs associated with the prevention, or management, of a particular disease. Dietary advice is then personalised to the individual's genotype to ensure optimal prevention or treatment outcomes. To ensure evidence-based practice, research design and methodology, applied in the investigation of relevant associations, and confirmation of causality, should be appropriate and rigorous. The process of identifying SNPs associated with disease patterns is ongoing. Of note is that the combined effect on body mass index of the SNPs at the currently confirmed 32 loci is a modest 1. 45 %, bearing in mind that the estimated heritability of obesity is 40 - 70 %. Conclusions formulated by various researchers on the translation of <b>nutrigenetics</b> research into personalised nutrition, including obesity prevention and management, indicate that scientists hold the opinion that more research is necessary before evidence-based practice in this area can be guaranteed...|$|E
40|$|Colon {{cancer is}} the third {{most common type of}} cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the western world. Many {{epidemiological}} studies have shown that lifestyle and intake of various food components influence the colon carcinogenesis. Novel concepts such as nutrigenomics and <b>nutrigenetics</b> which study the interaction between diet and genes with common goal to optimize health through personalization of diet, provide approaches to elucidate the complex relationship between nutrients and genetic polymorphisms involved in various diseases like colon cancer. <b>Nutrigenetics</b> of colon cancer is based on correlation between folate metabolism and polymorphisms in the genes encoding crucial enzymes in folate metabolism pathway. The folate pathway influences abberant pyrimidine and purine synthesis as well as the global DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation of tumor supressor genes such as APC, hMLH 1, p 16 and E-cadherin in colon cancer. In addition, polymorphisms in the MTHFR, TYMS, MTR, MTRR, RFC, DHFR and other genes involved in the folate pathway have been shown to influence colon carcinogenesis.

40|$|AbstractNutrition has a {{predominant}} and recognizable role {{in health}} management. <b>Nutrigenetics</b> is the science that identifies and characterizes gene variants associated with differential response to nutrients and relating this variation to variable disease states especially cancer. This {{arises from the}} epidemiological fact that cancer accounts for {{a high proportion of}} total morbidity and mortality in adults throughout the world. There is much evidence to support that genetic factors {{play a key role in}} the development of cancer; these genetic factors such as DNA instability and gene alterations are affected by nutrition. Nutrition may also lead to aberrant DNA methylation, which in turn contributes to carcinogenesis. The aim of this work is to clarify the basic knowledge about the vital role of nutrition-related genes in various disease states, especially cancer, and to identify <b>nutrigenetics</b> as a new concept that could highlight the relation between nutrition and gene expression. This may help to understand the mechanism and pathogenesis of cancer. The cause of cancer is a complex interplay mechanism of genetic and environmental factors. Dietary nutrient intake is an essential environmental factor and there is a marked variation in cancer development with the same dietary intake between individuals.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{interactions}} between genetics and nutrition has gained new impetus {{with the development of}} high-throughput genomic approaches allowing for a comprehensive approach of the variability of gene sequences or activity. The object of <b>nutrigenetics</b> is to identify the genetic determinants (sequence polymorphisms) of the variability of individual responses to nutrition. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a chromosomal region involved in the control of quantitative phenotypic traits. Based on the knowledge of the chicken genome sequence, numerous positional candidate genes can be proposed within a QTL region, and further evaluation is needed to test the link between polymorphism of those genes, their activity and the expression of the phenotype. As a proof of principle that such an approach is relevant to <b>nutrigenetics,</b> we identified a polymorphism in the gene encoding the enzyme -carotene 15, 15 '-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO 1), which affected the response to dietary intake of -carotene in term of plasma, liver and duodenal concentrations of lutein. Another project aims to identify the genetic determinants of digestive ability through the development and characterization of two experimental lines of chickens divergently selected for this trait. Recently, chromosomal regions controlling this trait have been identified, and further studies of sequence polymorphisms and gene expression (functional genomics) data in extreme animals issued from a cross population are underway. Eventually, the tools of <b>nutrigenetics</b> will predict the potential for adaptation of genotypes to various feeds.

40|$|<b>Nutrigenetics</b> and personalised {{nutrition}} are {{components of}} the concept {{that in the future}} genotyping will be used as a means of defining dietary recommendations to suit the individual. Over the last two decades there has been an explosion of research in this area, with often conflicting findings reported in the literature. Reviews of the literature in the area of apoE genotype and cardiovascular health, apoA 5 genotype and postprandial lipaemia and perilipin and adiposity are used to demonstrate the complexities of genotype-phenotype associations and the aetiology of apparent between-study inconsistencies in the significance and size of effects. Furthermore, genetic research currently often takes a very reductionist approach, examining the interactions between individual genotypes and individual disease biomarkers and how they are modified by isolated dietary components or foods. Each individual possesses potentially hundreds of 'at-risk' gene variants and consumes a highly-complex diet.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} To {{summarize}} recent findings {{relating to the}} impact of dietary fat composition on whole body lipid metabolism, and common gene variants on the blood lipid response to dietary fat change. Recent findings In recent years a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) intake on the regulation of transcription factors involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid and lipoprotein metabolism has emerged. The evidence is suggestive of a greater potency of the long chain n- 3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and in particular their oxidative products, relative to n- 6 Pi In the area of <b>nutrigenetics</b> a number of common gene variants have been identified which may be important determinants of the blood lipid response to altered dietary fat composition.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{recognition}} that nutrients {{have the ability}} to interact and modulate molecular mechanisms underlying an organism’s physiological functions has prompted a revolution in the field of nutrition. Performing population-scaled epidemiological studies in the absence of genetic knowledge may result in erroneous scientific conclusions and misinformed nutritional recommendations. To circumvent such issues and more comprehensively probe the relationship between genes and diet, the field of nutrition has begun to capitalize on both the technologies and supporting analytical software brought forth in the post-genomic era. The creation of nutrigenomics and <b>nutrigenetics,</b> two fields with distinct approaches to elucidate the interaction between diet and genes but with a common ultimate goal to optimize health through the personalization of diet, provide powerful approaches to unravel the complex relationship between nutritional molecules, genetic polymorphisms, and the biological system as a whole.

Ethical issues fall into a number of categories: (1) why nutrigenomics? Will it have important public health benefits? (2) questions about research, e. g. concerning the acquisition of information about individual genetic variation; (3) questions about who has access to this information, and its possible misuse; (4) the applications of this information in terms of public health policy, and the negotiation of the potential tension between the interests of the individual in relation to, for example, prevention of conditions such as obesity and allergy; (5) the appropriate ethical approach to the issues, e. g. the moral difference, if any, between therapy and enhancement in relation to individualised diets; whether the ‘technological fix ’ is always appropriate, especially in the wider context of the purported lack of public confidence in science, which has special resonance in the sphere of nutrition.
