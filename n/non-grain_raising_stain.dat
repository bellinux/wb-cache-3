50|$|Paints that dry {{by solvent}} {{evaporation}} and contain the solid binder dissolved in a solvent {{are known as}} lacquers. A solid film forms when the solvent evaporates. Because no chemical crosslinking is involved, the film can re-dissolve in solvent; as such, lacquers are unsuitable for applications where chemical resistance is important. Classic nitrocellulose lacquers fall into this category, as do <b>non-grain</b> <b>raising</b> <b>stains</b> composed of dyes dissolved in solvent. Performance varies by formulation, but lacquers generally tend to have better UV resistance and lower corrosion resistance than comparable systems that cure by polymerization or coalescence.|$|R
40|$|In October 2000, a 10 -year-old Aboriginal {{boy from}} the Darwin region of the Northern Territory was {{referred}} to hospital with a 24 -hour history of abdominal pain, initially generalised, but then localising to the right iliac fossa. The pain was accompanied by occasional vomiting, but no fever or diarrhoea was noted. At laparotomy, a gangrenous, unruptured appendix was removed. Postoperatively, the patient made a good recovery. Neither he nor any family members had travelled outside the Northern Territory. Histological sections of the surgical specimen showed changes typical of acute suppurative appendicitis. Closer examination, however, revealed numerous round-to-oval structures resembling trophozoites (see Box). When the possibility of invasive amoebiasis was <b>raised,</b> <b>staining</b> of the section with Entamoeba histolytica-specific sera confirmed the diagnosis. E. histolytica serology was negative...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{one possibility}} {{for the elimination}} of poverty in North Korea. Despite its efforts to increase food production, North Korea has been suffering a serious food shortage problem. Under the current political and economic system, it is very unlikely that North Korea by itself can supply adequate food to its people. A viable way to solve the chronic food shortage is to change government policies regarding the kind of crops farmers raise. Instead of pushing for increased grain production, the government needs to encourage farmers to <b>raise</b> <b>non-grain</b> crops, which can be exported to South Korea or Japan. Since prices in the South are much higher than those in North Korea, exporting non-grain crops and importing grains would be more profitable to the North Korean government than producing more grains in the current system. In order for such a change to be successful, the North Korean government must try to reduce transportation costs and facilitate construction and utilization of railroads and roads between North and South...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{pathologic}} {{manifestations of}} renal diseases related to monoclonal {{plasma cell dyscrasia}} include light chain deposition disease, the AL type of amyloidosis, and myeloma cast nephropathy. Light chain deposit disease (LCDD) is an uncommon condition in which monoclonal light chains are deposited in the glomeruli, tubules, and vessels causing varying degree of damage. We report a case of LCDD coincident with fibrillary glomerulonephropathy (FGN) in a 73 -yr-old man with a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance who presented with progressive renal insufficiency and mild proteinuria. The serum kappa light chain level was markedly <b>raised.</b> Immunofluorescent <b>stains</b> showed IgG along with C 3 and kappa staining in glomeruli, but lambda staining was negative. Electron microscopic studies revealed diffuse punctuate-type deposits along the subendothelial areas. There were also scattered randomly oriented fibrils with a mean fibril thickness of 15 - 25 nm seen mainly in the glomerular mesangium, consistent with FGN. The congo red stain was negative on the histologic section. The present case illustrates that LCDD can progress to develop FGN in a patient with monoclonal gammopathy...|$|R

40|$|Heat-shock {{proteins}} {{have been}} shown to be critical antigens in a number of autoimmune diseases. In human arthritis and in experimentally induced arthritis in animals, disease development was seen to coincide with development of immune reactivity directed against not only bacterial hsp 60, but also against its mammalian homologue. We have developed murine monoclonal antibodies after immunization with recombinant human hsp 60. Antibodies with unique specificity for mammalian hsp 60, not crossreactive with the bacterial counterpart (LK 1), and antibodies recognizing both human and bacterial hsp 60 (LK 2) were selected. Both antibodies recognize epitopes located between amino acid positions 383 and 447 of human hsp 60. In immunogold electron microscopy, the mitochondrial localization of hsp 60 in HepG 2 cells was shown. Furthermore, both LK 1 and LK 2 showed a <b>raised</b> level of <b>staining</b> in light microscopy immunohistochemistry of synovial membranes in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis. The increased staining for LK 1, with a unique specificity for mammalian hsp 60, thus unequivocally demonstrates that this is due to a raised level of expression of endogenously produced host hsp 60 and not to deposition of bacterial antigens...|$|R
40|$|Pemphigus vulgaris is an {{autoimmune}} disease {{associated with an}} autoantibody directed against a keratinocyte membrane antigen. The {{purpose of this study}} was to purify the human pemphigus vulgaris antigen, to produce an antibody to this antigen, and to use the antibody to induce pemphigus in newborn mice. Various techniques to extract the membrane-rich pellet from human epidermal homogenate were compared; 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 1 % dimethylsulfoxide proved to be superior to extract the pemphigus vulgaris antigen. This antigen was identified by transfer blotting to nitrocellulose paper, incubated with pemphigus vulgaris serum, or 20 control sera, and detected with fluorescein labeled antisera to human IgG. Since concanavalin A inhibits the binding of pemphigus vulgaris antibody to tissue sections, we studied the binding of the extracted proteins to concanavalin A covalently coupled to Sepharose. Pemphigus vulgaris antigen bound to the concanavalin A column and was released by 0. 02 M methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside. The proteins thus recovered were subjected to AcA 54 gel permeation chromatography, and the pemphigus antigen was detected by the transfer blot assay. The antigen corresponded to a discrete peak at 66, 000 D by gel permeation and gave one homogeneous band at 33, 000 D in urea-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Monospecific antibody to the antigen <b>raised</b> in rabbits <b>stained</b> human epidermis in the same manner as the pemphigus vulgaris autoantibody and induced pemphigus vulgaris in newborn mice when injected intraperitoneally. A pemphigus vulgaris antigen has been purified from adult human epidermis. It is a 66, 000 -D membrane glycoprotein that is composed of two apparently identical subunits of 33, 000 D each...|$|R
40|$|Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} common {{malignancy}} in men worldwide. The disease shows a wide range of patient outcome between indolent and highly aggressive tumor behavior. Prognostic factors are needed to stratify PCa patients in different prognostic groups for treatment decision and to predict outcome. Today serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), TNM staging and histomorphological prognostic factors such as the Gleason score (GS) are used in clinical practice for prediction of prognosis. Despite its powerful prognostic power, the utility of GS has decreased in the last decades due to a grade and stage shift. Efforts have been made to develop the GS and modified systems such as percent Gleason grade 4 / 5 (%GG 4 / 5) and modified Gleason score (mGS) have been suggested. Almost monthly new potential biomarkers for PCa are reported but most of them will have only very limited clinical impact. To be useful, a marker must provide prognostic information, which is independent from that of established prognostic factors, its reproducibility must be satisfactory and the information obtained clinically relevant. The interobserver reproducibility of the conventional GS, %GG 4 / 5 and mGS was analyzed among four uropathologists. The overall reproducibility of %GG 4 / 5 and mGS was at least as good as that of the GS. However, clustering of mGS in odd scores was found and severe disagreement was more common than with GS. The ability of prostate needle biopsies to correctly predict %GG 4 / 5 in prostatectomy specimens was found to be almost as good as for GS. We investigated the expression of pancreatic duodenal homeobox- 1 (PDX- 1) and heat shock proteins (HSP) 27, 60 and 70 in prostate tissue. Tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed for analysis of prognostic value (289 PCas, median follow-up 48. 9 months),expression in benign tissues, high-grade PIN, primary PCa and lymph node metastases. Two independent observers evaluated intensity and extent of immunohistochemical staining. HSP 27 and 60, but not PDX- 1 and HSP 70, correlated with biochemical recurrence. In a multivariate analysis including histological prognostic factors HSP 60 was an independent predictor of recurrence. PDX- 1 was overexpressed in cancer vs. benign tissue, but also in atrophy and high-grade PIN. PDX- 1 decreased with higher Gleason pattern and in metastases. There was only slight interobserver agreement for extent of immunoreactivity of PDX- 1 and HSPs but moderate to substantial agreement for intensity of the staining. Thus, the question was <b>raised</b> whether <b>staining</b> extent shouldbe estimated on TMA. Presence of PDX- 1 protein in benign and malignant prostatic tissue was confirmed by Western blot. In conclusion we suggest that HSP 27 and HSP 60 are predictors of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and PDX- 1 is of potential interest in the pathogenesis of PCa...|$|R
40|$|Proteoheparan sulfate {{biosynthesis}} was {{studied in}} cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells {{by means of}} pulse and pulse-chase experiments and subcellular fractionations. Three proteoheparan sulfate species {{were found in the}} medium. The major species, which the authors have called HS I, appeared in the medium only after an initial lag period and was also found associated with the plasma membrane. The other two (HS II and HS III) appeared in small amounts in the medium at early time points. At later times these were not readily observed because the large amounts of HS I present in the medium. The major medium species, HS I, appeared to be composed of approximately four heparan sulfate chains of approximately 35, 000 daltons and a core protein of approximately 55, 000 daltons apparent molecular weight. HS I appeared to be homogeneous by gel filtration on Sepharose CL 2 B and 6 B and elution from DEAE Sephacel, electrophoresis on Nu-Sieve agarose, and CsCl density centrifugation. After digestion with heparinase the core protein appeared to be homogeneous by S- 200 Sephacel chromatography. HS I was also found associated with plasma membrane fractions of the cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells, and antisera <b>raised</b> against it <b>stained</b> epithelial and endothelial cells in patterns consistent with a cell surface localization. Of the other two species found in the medium, one (HS II) also appeared to be a component of the cell layer. This species appeared to contain approximately four heparan sulfate chains of approximately 20, 000 daltons apparent molecular weight. Antisera raised against a similar molecule produced by HR 9 cell cultures stained basement membranes intensely, supporting the subcellular matrix localization of this molecule. The third species (HS III) was detected in culture medium only and apparently contained two heparan sulfate chains of approximately 20, 000 daltons apparent molecular weight. These results support the concept of multiple endothelial cell proteoheparan sulfate species which exhibit differences in structure and localization and possibly diverse specialized functions...|$|R
