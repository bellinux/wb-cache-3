5000|$|Several sub-national {{authorities}} worldwide {{have declared}} themselves [...] "nuclear-free". However, the label is often symbolic, as nuclear policy is usually determined and regulated {{at higher levels}} of government: nuclear weapons and components may traverse <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zones</b> via military transport without the knowledge or consent of local authorities which had declared <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R

25|$|On November 14, 1984, the Davis City Council {{declared}} {{the city to}} be a <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone.</b> In 1998, the City passed a 'Dark Skies' ordinance {{in an effort to}} reduce light pollution in the night sky.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Prime Minister David Lange barred nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed {{ships from}} using New Zealand ports or {{entering}} New Zealand waters. [...] Under the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987, territorial sea, land and airspace of New Zealand became <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zones.</b> This has since remained {{a part of}} New Zealand's foreign policy.|$|R
25|$|Under the {{previous}} Labour government, its Prime Minister Helen Clark maintained New Zealand's <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone</b> status, a bipartisan position {{supported by the}} opposition New Zealand National Party. In a 2008 survey, 19% of New Zealanders favouring nuclear as a power source, more than both gas and coal power, but well behind wind, solar, geothermal and hydroelectricity.|$|E
25|$|Muldoon {{unexpectedly}} {{called a}} snap election in 1984, {{as a result}} of Marilyn Waring voting for a members Bill introduced by Richard Prebble to introduce a <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone.</b> The timing of the election prevented Labour from creating a proper election platform, instead using the Palmer draft. Lange commented that the party went into the election with an unfinished argument for an economic policy.|$|E
25|$|The Anzac class (also {{identified}} as the ANZAC class and the MEKO 200 ANZ type) is a ship class of ten frigates; eight operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and two operated by the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). During the 1980s, the RAN began plans to replace the River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate, and settled {{on the idea of}} modifying a proven foreign design for Australian conditions. Around the same time, the RNZN was seeking to replace their Leander-class frigates while maintaining blue-water capabilities. A souring of relations between New Zealand and the United States of America in relation to New Zealand's <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone</b> and the ANZUS security treaty prompted New Zealand to seek improved ties with other nations, particularly Australia. As both nations were seeking warships of similar capabilities, the decision was made in 1987 to collaborate on their acquisition. The project name (and later, the class name) is taken from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps of the First World War.|$|E
50|$|California is {{also home}} to two major nuclear power plants: Diablo Canyon and San Onofre, the latter having been shut down in 2013. Also voters banned the {{approval}} of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over radioactive waste disposal. In addition, several cities such as Oakland, Berkeley and Davis have declared themselves as <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Soviets forged an NSC Policy Paper which {{outlines}} global U.S. {{political and}} military foreign policy between 1985 and 1988. A central theme in the paper was the purported U.S. goal of [...] "strategic dominion" [...] over the Soviet Union. The forgery included underlying goals such as the integration of Swiss, Austrian, and Swedish national resources into NATO and the [...] "neutralization" [...] of discussions concerning <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R

Morphological changes {{in the middle of the}} shell of the aorta in patients with MFS were characterized by severe restructuring with profound irreversible alterative changes in all of its components. The pathological process captured media of the aorta throughout its entire length, not just in the areas of rupture and separation. The main pathomorphological signs of MFS were the focal accumulation of mucoid substances, ribbon-like <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zones,</b> degenerative changes in smooth muscle cells, the formation of cystic media degeneration cavities, changes in elastic fibers - fragmentation, hyperelastosis, multiplication, thinning and straightening, areas of significant elastolysis. Multiple CMD was detected in all patients with MFS, the changes revealed the same type, but at different stages of the process. ...|$|R
500|$|Denmark's <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone</b> policy {{originated}} in 1957, when the coalition government {{decided in the}} lead-up to the Paris NATO summit not to stockpile nuclear weapons on its soil in peacetime. The presence of the bomber in Greenland airspace in 1968 therefore triggered public suspicions and accusations that the policy was being violated. The nature of the [...] "Hard Head" [...] missions was suppressed {{at the time of}} the accident; the Danish and American governments instead claimed the bomber was not on a routine mission over Greenland and that it diverted there because of a one-off emergency. United States documents declassified in the 1990s contradicted the Danish government's position, and therefore resulted in a 1995 political scandal that the press dubbed [...] "Thulegate".|$|E
2500|$|The Act prohibits [...] "entry {{into the}} {{internal}} waters of New Zealand 12 nautical miles (22.2 km, [...] statute miles) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power" [...] and bans the dumping of radioactive waste {{into the sea}} within the <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone,</b> as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident [...] "to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device." [...] The <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone</b> Act does not prohibit nuclear power plants, nuclear research facilities, the use of radioactive isotopes, or other land-based nuclear activities.|$|E
2500|$|New Zealand {{has long}} {{maintained}} an independent foreign policy initiative, with various Governments ignoring American and other countries' policy demands. [...] While New Zealand meets its international responsibilities towards maintaining global peace, its pacifist based anti-nuclear stance reflects the mainstream ideology {{held by the}} majority of its residents. New Zealand's opposition to nuclear weapons is rooted in the belief that the proliferation of such weapons of mass destruction does not reflect an attempt to preserve peace {{in the form of a}} nuclear deterrent. New Zealand's <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone</b> option looks to remove the nation from under the nuclear umbrella.|$|E
5000|$|This was {{compounded}} by the general election defeats for Labour, leaving the party with little ability to push its agenda at a national level in Westminster. As a result, local authorities became hotbeds of progressive and radical ideas, and a conflict between local Labour local authorities and the Conservative central government on many issues ensued. Like municipal socialism before it, Labour leaderships at local level saw themselves as stronger than their Westminster party colleagues, and capable of pushing socialist political agendas where {{they could not be}} pushed at national level. This resulted in an era of [...] "grand gesture politics", with local authorities taking highly visible stances on national political issues such as declaring themselves <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zones,</b> and [...] "rainbow coalitions" [...] between local Labour party politicians and pressure groups for causes outside of Labour's traditional working class roots, such as anti-racism, gay rights, disabled rights, and feminist groups.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} towns, cities and {{counties}} in the United States established themselves as <b>Nuclear-Free</b> <b>Zones</b> in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The first was Missoula, Montana. In the November 1978 general election, Missoula voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative {{in the form of}} a land-use ordinance establishing the entirety of Missoula County as a [...] "'nuclear free' zoning district" [...] banning all nuclear facilities except those for medical purposes. (In the same election, Montana voters approved a statewide initiative by a 2-1 margin barring nuclear facilities or reactors without strict state-enforced regulatory standards and ratification by popular referendum, and in a follow-up 1980 initiative, Montanans narrowly voted to ban the disposal of nuclear waste.) That Missoula's measure was originally drafted as a zoning ordinance legally enforceable by the county planning department apparently created the popular term [...] "Nuclear Free Zone" [...] adopted as the name of the local political action group sponsoring the initiative and later used by other jurisdictions worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|Israel is seen {{to possess}} a nuclear arsenal of about 150 weapons, and Israel has been criticised for {{maintaining}} nuclear weapons and for not agreeing to a <b>nuclear-free</b> Middle East <b>zone.</b> In September 2009, the IAEA passed a resolution that [...] "expresses concern about the Israeli nuclear capabilities, and calls upon Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA safeguards..." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1960s Kekkonen was {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} foreign-policy initiatives, including the Nordic <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone</b> proposal, a border agreement with Norway, and a 1969 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The purpose of these initiatives was to avoid the enforcement of the military articles in the Finno-Soviet Treaty [...] which called for military co-operation with Soviet Union. Kekkonen thereby hoped to strengthen Finland's moves toward a policy of neutrality. Following the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, pressure for neutrality increased. Kekkonen informed the Soviet Union in 1970 that if it was no longer prepared to recognise Finland's neutrality, he would not continue as president, nor would the Finno-Soviet Treaty be extended.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, National Party Prime Minister Rob Muldoon {{had lost the}} support {{of some of the}} MPs from his own party over several {{environmental}} issues. In particular, maverick National Party Members of Parliament Marilyn Waring and Mike Minogue threatened the slight government majority. In 1984, the opposition New Zealand Labour Party proposed the <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone</b> legislation. Muldoon strongly opposed the proposal, fearing it might compromise New Zealand's national security. However, as he failed to secure Marilyn Waring's support on the issue, and as the National Party had a majority of only one, Muldoon decided to call a snap election, the New Zealand general election, 1984, stating that Waring's [...] "feminist anti-nuclear stance" [...] threatened his ability to govern. Muldoon was famously drunk when he announced the election, and ignored warnings from party president Sue Wood that the party organisation was unprepared for a campaign. The National Party lost the election, and the Labour Party formed a new government.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{the need to}} replace the RNZN's Leander-class frigate force with new {{warships}} was under consideration. The government saw maintaining a blue-water capable force built around three or four frigates as important, {{but the cost of}} acquiring and maintaining such a force was prohibitive. Alternate suggestions, such as reducing the RNZN to a coast guard-type force responsible for coastal and fisheries protection, replacing the frigates with smaller offshore patrol vessels, or reorienting the navy to primarily operate submarines, were made in several venues, but were seen as unacceptable loss in capability. Around the same time, the 1984-elected Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand implemented a <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone,</b> which incensed the United States of America and led to a deterioration of relations between the two nations, including the American withdrawal of support for New Zealand under the ANZUS security treaty. In response, the New Zealand government sought to improve ties with Australia; one such avenue was to promote military interoperability between the countries by standardising equipment and procedures where possible. The Australian NSC project was seen to have [...] "virtually identical" [...] requirements to the RNZN's proposed Replacement Combat Ship concept, and the need to replace the warships dovetailed with the need to improve relations with Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Under the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987 {{territorial}} sea and land of New Zealand became nuclear free zones. [...] The Act prohibits [...] "entry into the internal waters of New Zealand 12 n. mi. (22.2 km/13-13/16 st. mi.) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power" [...] and bans the dumping of radioactive waste {{into the sea}} within the <b>nuclear-free</b> <b>zone,</b> as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident [...] "to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device." [...] Similar provisions were made for biological weapons. After this Act {{was passed by the}} Labour government of David Lange, the United States government suspended its ANZUS obligations to New Zealand. Following consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States reiterated that it was suspending its treaty obligations until United States Navy ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was [...] "a friend, but not an ally". The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers, while many leading American senators were quoted as expressing a deep sense of betrayal. However, David Lange did not withdraw New Zealand from ANZUS, although his government's policy led to the US's decision to suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand. The legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity. Further, many were driven by a sense of responsibility to support peace and the rights of all humans, not just in New Zealand, but worldwide.|$|E
