A parliamentary committee in 1841 had reported in favour of entire freedom. The machine makers, of course, were active, and the general manufacturers of the country, excepting the <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> makers and the flax-spinners of the north of Ireland, had become neutral. Only a very limited portion of the trade was any longer subject to restriction, and Mr. Gladstone, after due consultation with superior ministers, proposed a bill for removing the prohibition altogether.[165] He also brought in a bill (April 1844) for the regulation of companies. It {{was when he was}} president of the board of trade that the first Telegraph Act was passed. 'I was well aware,' he wrote, 'of the advantage of taking them {{into the hands of the}} government, but I was engaged in a plan which contemplated the ultimate acquisition of the railways by the public, and which was much opposed by the railway companies, so that to have attempted taking the telegraphs would have been hopeless. The bill was passed, but the executive machinery two years afterwards broke down.' ...|$|E
6000|$|These expressions, though figurative, {{sufficiently}} {{indicated the}} bent of Mrs. Poyser's mind {{with regard to}} Adam; and though {{she and her husband}} might have viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a daughter of their own, it was clear that they would have welcomed the match with Adam for a penniless niece. For what could Hetty have been but a servant elsewhere, if her uncle had not taken her in and brought her up as a domestic help to her aunt, whose health since the birth of Totty had not been equal to more positive labour than the superintendence of servants and children? But Hetty had never given Adam any steady encouragement. Even in the moments when she was most thoroughly conscious of his superiority to her other admirers, she had never brought herself to think of accepting him. She liked to feel that this strong, skilful, keen-eyed man was in her power, and would have been indignant if he had shown the least sign of slipping from under the yoke of her coquettish tyranny and attaching himself to the gentle Mary Burge, who would have been grateful enough for the most trifling notice from him. [...] "Mary Burge, indeed! Such a sallow-faced girl: if she put on a bit of pink ribbon, she looked as yellow as a crow-flower and her hair was as straight as a hank of cotton." [...] And always when Adam stayed away for several weeks from the Hall Farm, and otherwise made some show of resistance to his passion as a foolish one, Hetty took care to entice him back into the net by little airs of meekness and timidity, as if she were in trouble at his neglect. But as to marrying Adam, that was a very different affair! There was nothing in the world to tempt her to do that. Her cheeks never grew a shade deeper when his name was mentioned; she felt no thrill when she saw him passing along the causeway by the window, or advancing towards her unexpectedly in the footpath across the meadow; she felt nothing, when his eyes rested on her, but the cold triumph of knowing that he loved her and would not care to look at Mary Burge. He could no more stir in her the emotions that make the sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of a sun can stir the spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant. She saw him as he was--a poor man with old parents to keep, who would not be able, for a long while to come, to give her even such luxuries as she shared in her uncle's house. And Hetty's dreams were all of luxuries: to sit in a carpeted parlour, and always wear white stockings; to have some large beautiful ear-rings, such as were all the fashion; to have <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> round the top of her gown, and something to make her handkerchief smell nice, like Miss Lydia Donnithorne's when she drew it out at church; and not to be obliged to get up early or be scolded by anybody. She thought, if Adam had been rich and could have given her these things, she loved him well enough to marry him.|$|E

40|$|The Dreaming House {{exhibition}} pays {{homage to}} Newstead Abbey’s history as the ancestral home of Lord Byron, {{where many of the}} personal items that belonged to the great Romantic poet are displayed. However, rather than making direct reference to Byron and his work, the artists in The Dreaming House are interested in themes that are also present in Bryon's writing: childhood, memory, the supernatural, romanticism, ruin and decay. The works of art infiltrate the evocative rooms and spaces of Newstead Abbey, tapping in to the theatrically and radical spirit for which Byron was known. Nottingham City Museums and Galleries have one of the best collections of contemporary art textiles in the UK. For the Dreaming House exhibition, highlights from this collection are shown alongside works on loan from Nottingham-based artists Kashif Nadim Chaudry and Judy Liebert. The project worked with Radford Care Group, a day care facility for older people, many of whom had once worked in <b>Nottingham's</b> <b>lace</b> industry.

This fourth outing of the Pam Flett Press emerges from a long time fascination {{with the sort of}} ambiguous derelict site to which architects and planners often given the name ‘terrain vague’. It draws upon my encounters with such spaces as abandoned quarries and lead-mines across the North Pennines, Sheffield’s post-industrial topography and the hinterlands of the Staffordshire Potteries. It began as a piece of writing developed for a journal article, which then lay fallow in my computer for several years, an intellectual ruin awaiting redevelopment; it was ultimately colonized by creative and critical flora thanks to a research residency occasioning repeated visits to the former Spode ceramics factory in Stoke. Mirroring the scatter of heterogenous materials dumped or blown in to such places and the shifting process of use, reuse and abandonment, this publication involves a conceptual conglomeration of different aspects - a series of printed booklets, a collection of photographs - and a process of re-presentation in diverse forms and locations: each exhibition iteration will differ from the last as new ideas take root. </p...|$|R

40|$|The unique {{ecology of}} Nottingham’s {{creative}} industry sector was {{the inspiration for}} CINET, the creative industries network funded by the EU’s Leonardo programme. CINET is a Leonardo da Vinci Transfer of Innovation Project funded by the European Union which brings together creative industry clusters in Nottingham, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Its aim is to facilitate shared learning amongst entrepreneurs and to promote entrepreneurship in the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) by developing the conditions for learning and collaborative advantage within small firm clusters. CINET started with an analysis of Nottingham’s creative ecology, not to provide a blueprint for other countries but as a generative resource to stimulate new thinking and innovative ways of supporting entrepreneurs in one of Europe’s increasingly important sectors. Geographical clusters of creative enterprises such as that found in <b>Nottingham’s</b> <b>Lace</b> Market can become learning networks where entrepreneurs share knowledge and experience {{with each other and}} build “collaborative advantage” by working together. Nottingham’s experience also demonstrates the important role that institutional actors such as local authorities, universities and colleges, social entrepreneurs and places of cultural consumption can play in sustaining and growing a dynamic creative economy. In addition to its account of Nottingham’s creative ecology, this eBook includes analyses of the sector in Greece, Portugal and Spain as well as reflections from experiences gained during the CINET project. These provide valuable insights into the emergence of the creative sector in Southern Europe and the types of learning interventions that will both enhance the success of individual entrepreneurs and maximise their contribution to the wider economy.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} lace as {{a metaphor}} in contemporary art, comprising a practice-led inquiry based on the <b>lace</b> archive of <b>Nottingham</b> Trent University. <b>Lace</b> {{is placed in the}} context of creative art practice to establish an overview and understanding of the multifarious associations used to articulate ideas and concepts. This study explores the integration of lace themes into my current art practice while adopting methods of research that reflect on and challenge the tacit knowledge already present in my creative process. An action research methodology is implemented, introducing reflective activities to question my concept development and instigate change. Case studies are used to gain a deeper understanding of how and why the application of lace themes and metaphors are present in contemporary art. The research process has a cyclical form in that my art practice is a case study that informs and enriches my creative process. A theoretical inquiry is established, contributing to a philosophical framework built around ideas that encompass lace and the body, addressing the reappropriation from a fabric that once signified only wealth and status to a material that now adds a sexual charge to garments through the relationship it has with skin...|$|R

In 1835 he gave up the lace trade and set up as an artist, his earliest patron being a hairdresser in Nottingham, who possessed a taste for art. In 1844 he removed to Liverpool, where after a time he got into greater repute, and received higher prices for his works. In 1849 he came with his family to London, and settled at Croydon, where some of his best pictures were painted.

5000|$|Kettle {{entered the}} Middle Temple on 2 June 1842, {{was called to}} the bar on 6 June 1845, and {{obtained}} a practice on the Oxford circuit. In 1859, he was appointed judge of the Worcestershire county courts, and subsequently he acted {{as chairman of the}} standing committee for framing the rules for county courts. Kettle took an interest in industrial matters, and was called upon to arbitrate in disputes in the iron and coal trades. He was the first president of the Midland iron trade wages board, and used the influence which this office gave him to persuade masters and men to accept arbitration in their disputes. In 1864, after a strike in the building trade at Wolverhampton had lasted seventeen weeks, Kettle, on invitation from both sides, succeeded in arranging a settlement and ultimately in establishing at Wolverhampton a legally organised system of arbitration. If the delegates of the contending parties could not agree, an independent umpire should have power to make a final and legally binding award between them. The scheme spread to include {{a large part of the}} English building trade. Kettle formed similar boards for the coal trade, the potteries, the <b>Nottingham</b> <b>lace</b> trade, the handmade paper trade, the ironstone trade, and other staples. He was styled the [...] "Prince of Arbitrators", and on 1 December 1880 he was knighted [...] "for his public services in establishing a system of arbitration between employers and employed." [...] In 1890, the postmaster-general, Henry Cecil Raikes, consulted Kettle during the strike of the post-office employees. On 24 November 1882, Kettle was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple. He was one of the senior magistrates and a deputy-lieutenant of Staffordshire, and he was assistant chairman of quarter sessions from 1866 to 1891. He was an artist of some ability, and several of his pictures were publicly exhibited. In 1892 he resigned his office of county court judge, finding that his labours in connection with arbitration occupied the greater part of his time. He died at his residence, Merridale, Wolverhampton, on 6 October 1894, and was buried on 9 October in the Wolverhampton cemetery.|$|E
