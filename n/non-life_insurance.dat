The country utilized 30,000soldiers {{to assist in}} cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies {{were sent to the}} affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49million in donations (₩58billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680meals to 16,919families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60million (₩72.1billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September13, the South Korean government declared 203cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300million deficit for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes. However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's Habitat for Humanity built 69houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for {{a small portion of the}} overall number of people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74billion in damage and 117deaths. The damage total was less than from Rusa but was more significant to industrial areas.|$|E

40|$|Globally {{as well as}} in the Asia-Pacific region, {{disasters}} and related insured and uninsured losses are on the rise. Risk insurance has been argued to provide effective means of catastrophic risk reduction and climate change adaptation in the developing countries. Both life and other types of insurances play an important role in disaster risk reduction. However, in terms of the volume of insurance premiums life insurances are more prevailing than the <b>non-life</b> <b>insurances</b> and hence, there is a need to bridge the gap between both to achieve the maximum possible coverage. Though there are several policy and institutional initiatives to promote risk insurance in the Asia-Pacific region, the region has not been able to utilize the full potential of risk insurance. In order to promote risk insurance, this chapter encourages that the proposals by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) need to address some obvious but most relevan...|$|R

We find that non-executive directors and separating the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman functions do not improve cost efficiency. However, board size, firm size and product specialisation have positive effects on the cost efficiency of Takaful insurers. In contrast, the regulatory environment is found not to be statistically significant in terms of improving cost efficiency. We conclude that our results could have important commercial and policy implications. ...|$|R

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} {{need to hold}} capital aside to meet future liabilities associated with events that are covered by existing contracts. The process of estimating the reserves is called claims reserving. Macro-level reserving models are already used for decades by insurance companies. This {{is because they are}} widely applicable and easy to use. With the introduction of Solvency II, a regulatory framework for insurances, insurance undertakings are encouraged to explore more advanced reserving models. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate whether the claims reserving process for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurances</b> can be improved. In the macro-level models, a lot of useful information that is often available remains unused. This leads to introducing a micro-level reserving model, which can take into account much more detailed information than the macro-level models. For this thesis, a macro-level model and a basic micro-level model are implemented. Where the macro-level model only gives projections of the aggregated payment amounts, the micro-level model allows for examining the projections for every single claim. Because of this, every component of the micro-level model can be tested and adjusted individually (reporting delay, claim development, payment distributions). Based on the results of the out-of-sample tests, it can not be concluded that one model performs better than the other. For this, the models should also be tested on other data sets. With further research, adjustments can be made such that the micro-level model is suitable for application in practice. Based on the findings in this thesis, insurance companies could improve the possibilities for applications of micro-level reserving models by preparing their data and the registration of it. Therefore, more awareness should be created at insurance and reinsurance companies about the micro-level model and the required data quality...|$|R

The essay breaks new ground in providing the first overall historical snapshot of MNEs in insurance. Long before the First World War, MNE insurers had substantial global interests. MNEs from the UK, the European continent, the United States and Canada in <b>non-life</b> and life <b>insurance</b> as well as in reinsurance established business around the world, obtaining substantial revenues from the operations in foreign locales. In many countries they were the innovators in the provision of this service.

Home and host country regulations and other government actions during war and peace always affected the historical developments and thus are not neglected in this survey. The article provides sample statistics to demonstrate the significance of MNEs in insurance.
