5|$|Zimbabwe has {{relatively}} well-developed <b>national</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and {{a long-standing}} tradition of promoting {{research and development}} (R), {{as evidenced by the}} levy imposed on tobacco-growers since the 1930s to promote market research.|$|E
5|$|In the North, {{urbanization}} and {{an unprecedented}} influx {{of immigrants from}} Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture. <b>National</b> <b>infrastructure</b> including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement {{and development of the}} American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1990s {{there was}} high demand for these new, and basic, investigative resources. The strain on central units {{lead to the}} {{creation}} of regional, and even local, level groups to help handle the load. For example, the British National Hi-Tech Crime Unit was set up in 2001 to provide a <b>national</b> <b>infrastructure</b> for computer crime; with personnel located both centrally in London and with the various regional police forces (the unit was folded into the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) in 2006).|$|E

5|$|A {{longtime}} {{supporter of}} <b>national</b> <b>infrastructure</b> development, Fillmore signed bills {{to subsidize the}} Illinois Central railroad from Chicago to Mobile, and for a canal at Sault Ste. Marie. The 1851 completion of the Erie Railroad in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet to ride the first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along {{the way from the}} train's rear platform, urging acceptance of the Compromise, and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it did not do so until a decade later.|$|E
5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned. Many Iraqi Christians (Assyrians/Chaldeans) however settled temporarily or permanently in Jordan. Immigrants also include 15,000 Lebanese who arrived {{following the}} 2006 Lebanon War. Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. The effects are largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees do not live in camps. The refugee crisis effects include competition for job opportunities, water resources and other state provided services, along with the strain on the <b>national</b> <b>infrastructure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the <b>national</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

40|$|The {{mainline}} of {{the workshop}} was the transmission tariffs on gas network from a European perspective. Transmission is a key issue for the European gas system for two reasons. First, transmission tariff should incentivize the efficient use of infrastructure and so facilitate the development of competition. Second, transmission tariff should also give enough return to network investors so that they upgrade the network efficently compared to their current and future uses not only for <b>national</b> <b>infrastructures</b> but also for cross-border pipelines. Three issues were especially treated in the different sessions during the workshop namely: 1 ° competition and efficient use of the network, 2 ° investment in <b>national</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> and 3 ° investment in cross-border infrastructures. Key conclusions and open questions from the debate among regulators, TSOs, stakeholders and academic delegates are reported here. ...|$|R
