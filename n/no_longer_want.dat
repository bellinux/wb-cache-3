5|$|It is {{revealed}} in the third episode that Suzanne Warren (played by Uzo Aduba) is also involved in the fight {{at the end of}} season one. She punches Chapman in the face twice and knocks her unconscious (Doggett is already unconscious at this stage). This gives the impression that Doggett and Chapman were evenly matched and therefore equally responsible. Following Doggett's return to full health, she finds that her previous best friends, Leanne Taylor (played by Emma Myles) and Angie Rice (played by Julie Lake), <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>want</b> to be associated with her. This leaves Doggett seeking prison counsellor Sam Healy (played by Michael J. Harney) for comfort.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the newer}} {{programs}} initiated by the University of Ottawa is the Free Store. The Free Store is a location in which students can drop off items they <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>want</b> and pick up items they do want for free. The reason this was created was to reduce consumption by offering free items to students who <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>want</b> items {{that may be used}} by someone else. Items that are dropped off include clothing, textbooks, electronics, and office supplies. The Free Store is located at 647 King Edward. In 2007, the Office of Campus Sustainability coined the term “Gratuiterie” as the French translation to their Free Store. Since then, the concept of la Gratuiterie has gained widespread popularity in France, namely in Grenoble where the first Gratuiterie appeared. Since then France has seen a boom of “Gratuiteries” around the country.|$|E

25|$|When Höckert {{returned}} from his trip, the count of Trolleholm Castle did <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>want</b> the Slottsbranden i Stockholm den 7 maj 1697 painting. As a result, Höckert made a quick effort to get it finished for the 1866 Scandinavian art fair in Stockholm instead. The painting was displayed and, despite its uncompleted state, made a large impression. The judges at the fair awarded Höckert {{with one of the}} six gold medals. Slottsbranden i Stockholm den 7 maj 1697 is today regarded as one of Sweden's foremost paintings. The painting was later displayed in Paris and Philadelphia in 1867, before being bought by Höckert's heirs in 1883 and given to its current home at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Luca {{decides to}} walk The Path of the Dragon alone, believing he will meet Dracula at the end, who {{he plans to}} kill. Moriani writes his report refuting vampires, but the next morning, Luca is found shot dead, and Moriani decides take up Luca's plan. Amongst Calugarul's {{correspondence}} he finds evidence The Path begins where Tepes was held prisoner in Turkey, and so travels to the jail in the mountains, where he discovers prisoners were left as food for a creature living in the forest so she would spare the nearby villagers. Tepes, however, apparently escaped. Upon returning to Vladoviste, Moriani learns Ozana has been told by the Iron Guard {{to get him out}} of the inn, and the villagers <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>want</b> to speak to him. He calls Boczow to tell her he plans to walk The Path to kill whatever he finds at the end of it, and she advises he come see her.|$|E
25|$|The {{dispute over}} Fadak was narrated in various sources, {{some of which}} became almost legendary. Among these is {{the tale of the}} famed caliph of the Arabian Nights tales, Harun al Rashid, narrated in the 16th-century work Laṭā’if al-Tawā’if The Subtleties of People, in which Harun is {{described}} as feeling regret over the denial of Fadak to Muhammad's family. Harun inquired about the boundaries of the oasis from a descendant of Fatima in order to return it to its rightful possessors. The descendent cautioned that after drawing the borders of the garden of Fadak, Harun would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>want</b> to relinquish it. Nevertheless, Harun pressed on. The descendant replied that the first boundary of Fadak was Aden, the second Samarqand, the third the Maghrib, and the fourth the Armenian Sea. These borders outlined virtually the entire empire of Harun. That Harun himself initiated the process of returning Fadak and was not pressed by Muhammad’s descendants reveals that in the Shi’i conception, worldly possessions are of little to no importance to Muhammad's family or to the authority of the Imams.|$|E

2500|$|However, in May 1833 {{while he}} was in London, a {{significant}} change in Bellini's relationship with Giuditta followed from the discovery by her husband of a compromising letter from Bellini. The result was that he decided to seek a legal separation and have her removed from his house. For Bellini, it meant the possibility of taking on responsibility for her, and he had no interest in doing that, having cooled in his feelings for her. [...] When he wrote to Florimo from Paris the following year, he clearly stated that [...] "I constantly am being threatened from Milan with Giuditta's coming to Paris", at which point he says he'll leave that city if that were to happen. Then he continues: [...] "I <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>want</b> to be put in the position of renewing a relationship that made me suffer great troubles".

[...] Assange accused Domscheit-Berg of leaking information to Newsweek, claiming the WikiLeaks team was unhappy with Assange's management and handling of the Afghan war document releases. Daniel Domscheit-Berg wanted greater transparency in the articles released to the public. Another vision of his was to focus on providing technology that allowed whistle-blowers to protect their identity as well as a more transparent way of communicating with the media, forming new partnerships and involving new people. Domscheit-Berg left with a small group to start OpenLeaks, a new leak organisation and website with a different management and distribution philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit {{upheld the}} Witnesses' right to shun those {{who fail to}} live by the group's {{standards}} and doctrines, upholding the ruling of a lower court. The court concluded that, [...] "Shunning is a practice engaged in by Jehovah's Witnesses pursuant to their interpretation of canonical text, {{and we are not}} free to reinterpret that text. ... We find the practice of shunning not to constitute a sufficient threat to the peace, safety, or morality of the community as to warrant state intervention. ... the defendants are entitled to the free exercise of their religious beliefs. ... Courts generally do not scrutinize closely the relationship among members (or former members) of a church. Churches are afforded great latitude when they impose discipline on members or former members. ... The members of the Church Paul decided to abandon have concluded that they <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>want</b> to associate with her. We hold that they are free to make that choice. ... Although we recognize that the harms suffered by Janice Paul are real and not insubstantial, permitting her to recover for intangible or emotional injuries would unconstitutionally restrict the Jehovah's Witnesses free exercise of religion. ... The constitutional guarantee of the free exercise of religion requires that society tolerate the type of harms suffered by Paul as a price well worth paying to safeguard the right of religious difference that all citizens enjoy." ...|$|E
