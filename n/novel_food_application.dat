40|$|Long-chain omega- 3 {{fatty acids}} from fish oil (DHA and EPA) {{are said to}} have health-promoting properties. Among other things they are claimed to prevent {{cardiovascular}} dis-eases and angiopathy disorders. Fish oil is, therefore, used in food supplements and to fortify foods. Two DHA-rich oils from marine microalgae are also authorised within the EU for the fortification of dairy products (except beverages), breakfast cereals and margarine spreads as well as for food supplements and dietetic foods. Of course, long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids are also found in fatty saltwater fish and other sea-food. The European Commission is currently examining whether the range of foods which may be fortified with novel algae oils can be extended. Against this backdrop the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has assessed the health risk from the elevated intake of the omega- 3 fatty acids DHA and EPA. Against the backdrop of a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> <b>application</b> for DHA-rich oil from marine microalgae, BfR has estimated that fortification of foods from 14 food groups with algae oil could increase previous intake of long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids roughly fourfold. In various studies, however, high intake levels of this scale have been associated with an elevated cholesterol level, impairment of natural immune de-fence, in particular in older people and a heightened tendency to bleed. Nor has there been any definitive clarification up to now of the long-term effects of an elevated intake of the omega- 3 fatty acids DHA and EPA. BfR, therefore, recommends the setting of maximum levels for the fortification of foods with DHA and EPA irrespective of whether they are contained in fish oil, algae oil or fatty acid ethyl ester. Furthermore, foods which do not normally contain any fats like, for instance soft drinks, should not be fortified with omega- 3 fatty acids either...|$|E

Patatin is a protein that unfolds partly due to either heat or acid treatments.

At low pH, when the starting conformation is already irreversibly unfolded to a certain extent, only minor changes occur upon heating. The residual structures could be part of one or more relatively stable domains. The acidic and the thermal unfolding appear to be similar, but are not identical.

The activities assayed, related to technological and nutritional improvement of fermented faba bean, included peptidases, beta-glucosidase, phytase, as well as exopolysaccharides synthesis and antimicrobial properties. In addition, the bacteria performance as starter cultures during faba bean fermentation on proteolysis, antioxidant potential, and degradation of condensed tannins were assessed. Fermentative profiling showed that only 7 out of 27 strains were able to metabolize D-raffinose, particularly Leuc. mesenteroides I 01 and I 57. All strains of Pediococcus pentosaceus exerted high PepN activity and exhibited beta-glucosidase activity higher than the median value of 0. 015 U, while phytase activity was largely distributed among the different strains. All the weissellas, and in lower amount leuconostocs, showed ability to produce EPS from sucrose. None of the strains showed antimicrobial activity toward Staphylococcus aureus, while eight strains of P. pentosaceus exhibited a strong inhibitory activity toward Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Generally, the doughs fermented with pediococci exhibited high amount of total free amino acids, antioxidant activity, and condensed tannins degradation.

40|$|Besides having {{excellent}} nutritional value, oat has versatile enzyme machinery. However, the oat enzymes have seldom been {{utilized to}} carry out desired reactions in oat or in oat containing materials. Recently, the potential of oat enzymes has been apparent in enhancement {{of the quality of}} oat and in upgrading oat for <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> <b>applications.</b> Lipase activity in oat grain is high even without germination and the inactivation of this enzyme is a common practice for obtaining products with adequate shelf life. However, the existence of the lipase may also be seen as a positive feature and used as an aid in the manufacture of value added oat products. For example, the lipase reaction in crushed oat materials can be adjusted so that almost all fatty acids from storage lipids are hydrolysed to yield a mixture of free fatty acids rich in linoleic acid. This free linoleic acid, unlike its esterified form, is the favoured substrate for the microbial isomerization into the specific health-promoting conjugated linoleic acid isomer (Vahvaselkä et al., 2004). Native oat grain has also been found to contain an enzyme activity converting the secondary lipid oxidation products into non-volatile form, thus reducing perceived rancidity (Lehto et al., 2003). This heat-labile aldehyde dehydrogenase type activity has been shown to decrease the content of hexanal and other volatile short-chain aldehydes by oxidizing them into corresponding less-volatile carboxylic acids. Native oat flour can thus be used as a supplement in various food formulations to reduce rancid flavour. Consequently, possibilities for utilization of oat in the food industry may be much more abundant than previously thought. Lehto, S. et al. 2003.

40|$|Well-defined {{shear flow}} {{can be applied}} to create fibrous, {{anisotropic}} samples from biopolymers when present at sufficiently high dry matter contents. Anisotropic biopolymer structures are of high interest especially when made from plant-based polymer blends due to <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> <b>applications,</b> like meat replacers. We investigate shear-induced structuring of a pectin/soy protein isolate (SPI) blend under heating. Scanning Electron Microscope analysis revealed that shear-induced structuring resulted in elongated pectin filaments, oriented {{in the direction of the}} shear flow, being entrapped in a continuous protein phase, inducing anisotropy in the blend. The length of the pectin filaments increased upon higher pectin concentrations and shearing temperatures, leading both to higher anisotropy, as measured with the tensile strength analysis. The fibrous appearance of samples became more evident when deforming the product by tearing, which effect was thought to be caused by detachment through or along the long side of the pectin filament. Industrial relevance The efficient preparation of fibrous products based on plant materials is of interest, because these products can be a starting point for the development of meat replacers. Meat replacers made from plant material are a promising, innovative, and sustainable source of protein for human consumption. With an increasing world population, creation of innovative sources of protein are needed to be able to feed everyone (United Nations - Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015). Proteins from plant sources, such as soy, are preferred over proteins from animal origin because plant based materials, for example, have lower environmental impact (Day, 2013; Mogensen, Hermansen, Halberg, Dalgaard, R., Vis, & Smith, 2009). In order to replace meat by a plant-based meat replacer, it is important that a similar product in terms of structural properties is developed to improve consumer acceptance (Hoek et al., 2011). Meat replacers are often produced with extrusion cooking, which is a process that has been applied for texturization of plant materials in the application of meat replacers for decades (Campbell, 1981; Harper & Clark, 1978). Previous research showed that a novel technique based on well-defined shear flow can also be used to create fibrous, anisotropic structures from plant-based biopolymers at sufficiently high dry matter contents, with a cone–cone device (Shear Cell) or a concentric cylinder device (Couette Cell) (Grabowska, Tekidou, Boom, & van der Goot, 2014; G. A. Krintiras, Göbel, Bouwman, van der Goot, & Stefanidis, 2014; Manski, van der Goot, & Boom, 2007). This novel technique uses milder conditions for structure formation, due to lower applied shear forces, and has therefore a lower specific mechanical energy input (Grabowska et al., 2016; G. A. Krintiras, Gadea Diaz, van der Goot, Stankiewicz, & Stefanidis, 2015). </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{conceptual}} understanding of consumer acceptance of <b>novel</b> <b>foods,</b> grounded in the attitudes, perceptions and behaviours of individuals to foods that were "novel" by virtue of an innovative method of production or newness within the diet. <b>Novel</b> <b>food</b> acceptance is dominated by psycho-sensory research and thus this thesis' behavioural approach provides an alternative perspective that contributes to the food choice and acceptance literature. The grounded theory method (GTM) was selected as the guiding methodology because of its theory building mandate. The GTM procedures were applied to a secondary data set of 45 transcripts drawn from 6 separate research projects. These projects were linked by the common use of the focus group technique to gene rate data together with a complementary subject matter, namely data relating to the attitudes perceptions and experiences of i 11 dividuals to cOnve 11 lional <b>foods,</b> <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> and <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> technologies. The analysis showed <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> acceptance is a cyclical process of acceptance or rejection containing five 'acceptance states', rather than a single decision point. The five acceptance states derived from the analysis 'and related to the consideration, trial and sustained incorporation of a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> into dietary practices that arc shaped by personal, product and situational factors are: i) conceptual acceptance, or the degree of engagement with and approval of a novel food; ii) connective acceptance,,or the personal connections that an individual makes with a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> by visualising its potential benefits and its role in satisfying a perceived personal need; iii) evaluative acceptance, or the trade-offs made when evaluating <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> with available alternatives; iv) tri al acceptance, or the practices associated with the preparation of the <b>novel</b> <b>food,</b> the taste: of the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> and its perceived impact on well-being; and v) dietary acceptance, or the complementarity of a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> with the structure of existing meal patterns and the substitutability of the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> with existing foods within the diet.

Food allergies may also result in substantial costs for society overall in terms of health care costs and absenteeism. <b>Novel</b> <b>foods</b> are continuously being developed and introduced onto the European market. The novelty of a food can be the result of: (1) genetic modification (GM) of the food itself, or its production using genetically modified organisms, (2) the application of novel processing techniques, or (3) the food in question having no prior history of consumption in general, or in a specific region or country. One potential benefit of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> is that of hypoallergenicity, although there is the potential risk that new proteins are introduced into the human food chain together with the <b>novel</b> <b>foods.</b> The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to investigate whether <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> can be used as part of an allergy management strategy. The issues associated with <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> and food allergy are identified and insight is gained in stakeholder and consumer attitudes towards the <b>application</b> of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> as allergy management strategy.

To this end, we propose criteria with clear boundaries as part of an assessment tool to reduce the uncertainties in interpretation with respect to consumption to a significant degree in the European Union, which take into account the commercial availability, length, extent and frequency of use of the particular food/ingredient. In addition, biological relevant boundaries for the criteria regarding changes in the nutritional value, metabolism (better all aspects of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), and levels of undesirable substances are proposed for significant changes in the composition of foods due to changes in the production process.

Finally, a criterion that takes into account the total ingredient intake rather than single product intake is added to deal with the risk of overexposure to substances. Taken together, the proposed boundaries and criteria may contribute to diminishing the interpretation issues regarding the <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation and thus to reducing the extent of the grey area of <b>novel</b> <b>foods.</b> - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on synthetic l-ergothioneine, marketed as Ergoneine®, as a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> submitted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 258 / 97 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The <b>novel</b> <b>food,</b> synthetic l-ergothioneine, is produced by a one-pot patented manufacturing process. Chemically, l-ergothioneine is a derivative of thiolhistidine, and it is naturally present {{in a number of}} foodstuffs such as mushrooms, some varieties of black and red beans, offal and cereals. The production process for the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> is sufficiently described and does not raise concerns about the safety of the <b>novel</b> <b>food.</b> The information on the composition, specifications, batch-to-batch variability and stability of the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> is sufficient and does not raise safety concerns. The applicant intends to use the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> in quantities of up to 5 mg per serving in alcohol-free beverages, cereal bars, milk, fresh dairy products and chocolate. The applicant also proposes to provide the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> as a food supplement, with a daily dose of up to 30 mg/day for adults and 20 mg/day for children. The target population is children above 3 years of age and the general adult population, except pregnant and breastfeeding women. Considering the NOAEL of 800 mg/kg bw per day, which was based on two subchronic toxicity studies in rats, and the maximum estimated intake levels for l-ergothioneine from all sources, the Panel concludes that the margins of safety of 470 for adults (except pregnant and breastfeeding women) and of 216 for children above 3 years of age are sufficient. The Panel concludes that the <b>novel</b> <b>food,</b> synthetic l-ergothioneine (marketed as Ergoneine®), is safe under the intended conditions of use as specified by the applicant...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} on tourist food consumption acknowledges that food-related personality traits, including neophilic and neophobic tendencies, can impede or encourage tourists to try <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> at a destination. However, the travel motivation literature advocates that tourists {{tend to be}} in a general condition of seeking novel experiences, including sampling a destination’s <b>novel</b> <b>food.</b> How food-related personality traits interact with novelty pursuits to influence tourists’ food consumption and subsequent satisfaction and travel outcomes remains unknown. The study proposes a framework of tourist food experience that leads from food-related personality traits, <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> consumption, and satisfaction to travel outcomes. While the results support the baseline model, the moderating effect of novelty seeking demonstrates that novelty seeking does not moderate the relationship between personality traits and consumption of <b>novel</b> <b>food.</b> It does, however, moderate satisfaction with food...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper was to examine the scope of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> in {{improving}} and/or preventing the nutritional disorders in different stages of lifespan. First, attempts were made to review the current trend and magnitude of the nutritional problems in each of the stages starting from fetal development to old age. The paper then describes the possible potential role of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> in alleviating and/or preventing these nutritional/health problems. The conclusion made is that the <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> have a great potential for improving the overall nutritional status throughout the lifespan, thereby reducing the risk of early death or disability due to chronic diseases. However, to achieve a noticeable impact of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> on public health, efforts are needed to ensure that these foods are available and affordable to the population most at risk...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000172189400008 International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the importance of}} spatial knowledge of food positions and of feeding experience on foraging choices in German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.). We trained cockroaches in an arena to feed on a particular food close to a landmark. To test whether the landmark helped guide cockroaches to the site, we removed the food and put the landmark in a different position. Cockroaches {{then went to the}} site indicated by the landmark. Given a choice between <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> in a new site and the known food in the known site, cockroaches preferred the <b>novel</b> <b>food.</b> But when the <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> was placed in the known site and the known food elsewhere, cockroaches were attracted to the latter. Thus, they differentiated <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> placed in a site that was previously occupied by the known <b>food</b> from <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> in a <b>novel</b> site. It seems that cockroaches learn the locations of specific resources in their home range and associate particular locations with particular resources.
