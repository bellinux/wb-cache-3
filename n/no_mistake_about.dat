25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> {{the fact that the}} slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{considered}} Born Villain to be {{a comeback}} for the band. Matthew Horton of Virgin Media {{described it as}} [...] "a new step forward, bristling with a vitality that Manson {{has no right to}} still have in his locker this far down the line." [...] Similarly, Kill Hipsters called it [...] "one hell of a comeback for a guy everyone–including myself–thought was well and truly dead and gone." [...] Loudwire's Graham Hartmann praised the album as a whole, as did Rick Florino of Artistdirect, who said: [...] "From top to bottom, it's Manson's most vicious and vibrant effort since Antichrist Superstar. Make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> it: this is Manson at his best." [...] Bloody Disgusting ranked it among the band's best work.|$|E

500|$|Western analysts {{generally}} see the Eurasian Economic Union {{as a way}} {{to reunite}} many of the former Soviet republics. For example, Washington Post author Abigail Hauslohner wrote the treaty was intended [...] "to further bolster 's ties to former Soviet republics." [...] The United States expressed its opposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is [...] "an attempt" [...] to re-establish a USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> it.

500|$|The league {{title in}} the 1970–71 season was decided in mid-April {{in front of the}} Match of the Day cameras at Elland Road, when Leeds lost their lead at the top with defeat by West Bromwich Albion. The Leeds players blamed the referee for costing them the title as offside was not given for Colin Suggett for Jeff Astle's winner, and despite Bremner saying [...] "But we fight on. Make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> that, it is not over yet" [...] Leeds could not {{overtake}} Arsenal, who {{went on to win the}} Double. Success instead came in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, as Leeds knocked out Sarpsborg (Norway), Dynamo Dresden (East Germany), Sparta Prague (Czechoslovakia), Vitória (Portugal) and Liverpool to reach the final with Juventus (Italy). Bremner recovered from an ankle injury just in time to face Liverpool in the semi-finals, and scored the only goal of the two-legged tie with a header at Anfield. Leeds won the final on the away goals rule after recording a 2–2 draw at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino and then a 1–1 draw at Elland Road.|$|E
500|$|In the 2001 case of Kyllo v. United States, Scalia {{wrote the}} Court's opinion in a 5–4 {{decision}} that cut across ideological lines. That decision found thermal imaging {{of a home}} to be an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment. The Court struck down a conviction for marijuana manufacture based on a search warrant issued after such scans were conducted, which showed that the garage was considerably hotter {{than the rest of}} the house because of indoor growing lights. Applying that Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure to arrest, Scalia dissented from the Court's 1991 decision in County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, allowing a 48-hour delay before a person arrested without a warrant is taken before a magistrate, on the ground that at the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment, an arrested person was to be taken before a magistrate as quickly as practicable. In a 1990 First Amendment case, R.A.V. v. St. Paul, Scalia wrote the Court's opinion striking down a St. Paul, Minnesota, hate speech ordinance in a prosecution for burning a cross. Scalia noted, [...] "Let there be <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> our belief that burning a cross in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding the First Amendment to the fire".|$|E

There he was, with the sun flaming on his golden helmet, and flashing from his polished breastplate; he had a sword by his side, and a lion's skin over his back, and on his right shoulder he carried a club, which looked bulkier and heavier than the pine-tree walking-stick of Antæus.|$|R

2500|$|Following promotional {{work for}} the second Kid Creole and the Coconuts album Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places, Darnell gave an {{interview}} to the UK music magazine Melody Maker in December 1981 in which he spoke enthusiastically of the forthcoming solo album he was planning called Wise Guy, and told the magazine about three songs he already had written for the record titled [...] "I'm a Wonderful Thing", [...] "Stool Pigeon" [...] (originally titled [...] "Jive Talking") and [...] "Imitation". When it became apparent a few months later, however, that the record {{would no longer be}} a solo album {{and that it would be}} significantly different in style musically from the previous records, Darnell told interviewers at the time that it was [...] "a chance to do some other things", but in reality he felt he was being forced to do [...] "a cop-out album, an R album" [...] in order to ease ZE's considerable financial difficulties with their parent label in the US, Sire Records. By the time of the album's release in May 1982, Darnell acknowledged that his record company had put pressure on him and that the record had not turned out how he had wanted: [...] "Make <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>about</b> it, this album is a compromise. It's much more steeped in R than Kid Creole should be. That's why it originally was supposed to be an August Darnell solo album. But because of the problems we ran into in the [...] company, and the company not believing in Kid Creole enough, this had to be turned into a Kid Creole album." ...|$|E
