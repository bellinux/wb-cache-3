40|$|Vertebrate {{brains are}} {{organized}} in modules which process information from sensory inputs selectively. Therefore {{they are probably}} under different evolutionary pressures. We investigated the impact of environmental influences on specific brain centres in bats. We showed in a phylogenetically independent contrast analysis that the <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> of a species corrected for body size correlated with estimates of habitat complexity. We subsequently compared <b>wing</b> <b>area,</b> as an indirect measure of habitat complexity, {{with the size of}} regions associated with hearing, olfaction and spatial memory, while controlling for phylogeny and body mass. The inferior colliculi, the largest sub-cortical auditory centre, showed a strong positive correlation with <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> in echolocating bats. The size of the main olfactory bulb did not increase with <b>wing</b> <b>area,</b> suggesting that the need for olfaction may not increase during the localization of food and orientation in denser habitat. As expected, a larger <b>wing</b> <b>area</b> was linked to a larger hippocampus in all bats. Our results suggest that morphological adaptations related to flight and neuronal capabilities as reflected by the sizes of brain regions coevolved under similar ecological pressures. Thus, habitat complexity presumably influenced and shaped sensory abilities in this mammalian order independently of each other...|$|R

50|$|After {{the failure}} of the HP-15 to perform well in the 1969 US Nationals Schreder started the HP-16 with a new design philosophy.
