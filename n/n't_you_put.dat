Are <b>you</b> <b>not</b> making, at best, a futile gesture, at worst, flinging {{yourself}} against something which does not exist? Is freedom more important than justice? Of what does freedom of the human spirit consist, that quality on which I place so much stress?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I'm <b>not</b> sorry <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it {{into his}} head," [...] cried Miss Milray. [...] "Clementina, may I say what I think of Mr. Gregory's performance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I didn't {{come here}} to spout philosophy," [...] Kreis went on. [...] "What I {{want to know is}} whether or <b>not</b> <b>you</b> will <b>put</b> a {{thousand}} dollars in on this deal?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would," [...] he said, [...] "as soon turn gambler. Still, {{while it}} has always been a {{tradition}} at Silverdale that the head of the settlement's lead is to be followed, that need <b>not</b> prevent <b>you</b> <b>putting</b> on the gloves with the wheat-ring blacklegs in Winnipeg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely and positively. So {{please do}} <b>not</b> any of <b>you</b> <b>put</b> my name down, {{two or three}} votes thrown away like that might alter the decision." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{give you}} {{ten minutes to}} write your letter; it can't {{possibly}} take <b>you</b> more, <b>not</b> even if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> into it my love to my aunt and cousins." ...|$|R
60|$|VENABLES [good-naturedly]. I could <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> to that trouble, Mrs. Shand. I {{will take}} good care of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{if you do}} {{something}} for old Plato, same 's you expect her to {{do something}} for you." [...] Ray was quite sincere. [...] "But <b>not</b> if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the team discipline on the bum and disgrace Omega Chi. Of course I can't speak as an actual member of the team, but still, as a senior, I hear things----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly <b>not,</b> if <b>you</b> can <b>put</b> {{up with my}} company; {{but where}} is your husband?" [...] Geoffrey responded. Millicent {{looked up at him}} with a chastened expression.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Excellently. Can <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> me on {{some work}} {{if it is}} only to copy telegraphic despatches? But, by the way, how is Blake?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Nothing will deter us from Palestine. Which jail {{we go to}} {{is up to you}} British. We did <b>not</b> ask <b>you</b> {{to reduce}} our rations; we did <b>not</b> ask <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> us in Poppendorf and Am Stau.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{far from}} being out of this," [...] I said. [...] "If the Baron de Carondelet does <b>not</b> hang <b>you</b> or <b>put</b> <b>you</b> in the Morro, <b>you</b> will <b>not</b> have me to thank. It will be Madame la Vicomtesse d'Ivry-le-Tour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O!" [...] she cried, with {{a gesture}} of {{wringing}} her hands, [...] "this man will drive me mad! Can <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> me out of your thoughts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The next morning, accordingly, when it {{was hardly}} light, he rose and dragged his stiff limbs about the precincts, {{preparing}} for her everything she could require for getting breakfast within. On the bench outside the window-sill he placed water, wood, and other necessaries, writing {{with a piece of}} chalk beside them, [...] "It is best that I should <b>not</b> see <b>you.</b> <b>Put</b> my breakfast on the bench." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Put {{down the}} {{etchings}} and go away," [...] he said. [...] "Don't upset me by losing my place. Have you, or have <b>you</b> <b>not,</b> lost my place? Are you sure <b>you</b> have <b>not?</b> And have <b>you</b> <b>put</b> my hand-bell quite within my reach? Yes? Then why the devil don't you go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> off the delivery?" [...] {{said the}} bravo, his huge hand still fumbling {{with one of}} the bags, as if his fingers longed to close on it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> them here?" [...] He touched gently {{the spot}} of honor. [...] "I {{should like to}} have them with my own, for I too have chosen lilies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The path {{measures}} {{four hundred}} and forty yards round," [...] he said, when the surgeon had repeated Sir Patrick's question to him. [...] "In plainer words, and <b>not</b> to <b>put</b> <b>you</b> to your arithmetic once round it is {{a quarter of a}} mile. Each round is called a 'Lap.' The men must run sixteen Laps to finish the race. <b>Not</b> to <b>put</b> <b>you</b> to your arithmetic again, they must run four miles--the longest race of this kind which it is customary to attempt at Sports like these." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bri. I am listening, my love, I am listening!--But what signifies my silence, {{what good}} is my not {{speaking}} a word, if this girl will interrupt and let nobody speak but herself?--Ay, I don't wonder, my life, at your impatience; your poor dear lips quiver to speak; but I suppose she'll run on, and <b>not</b> let <b>you</b> <b>put</b> in a word.-- You {{may very well be}} angry; there is nothing, sure, so provoking as a chattering, talking-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{have you}} nothing more definite?" [...] she asked, groping for better {{comprehension}} of his attitude. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> {{into some sort}} of coherence some one certain thing of the things you feel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it is not, doctor dear," [...] said Susan defiantly, as {{she picked}} up Jims, who was opening his big dark eyes and {{stretching}} up his dimpled paws. [...] "Do <b>not</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> words in my mouth that I would never dream of uttering. I am a plain woman and cannot argue with you, but I do not thank God that anybody has to go. I only know that it seems they do have to go, unless {{we all want to}} be Kaiserised--for I can assure you that the Monroe doctrine, whatever it is, is nothing to tie to, with Woodrow Wilson behind it. The Huns, Dr. dear, will never be brought to brook by notes. And now," [...] concluded Susan, tucking Jims in the crook of her gaunt arms and marching downstairs, [...] "having cried my cry and said my say I shall take a brace, and if I cannot look pleasant I will look as pleasant as I can." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I do {{not feel}} that the vote is any sort of advance for women. If you give {{suffrage}} to men and <b>not</b> women <b>you</b> are <b>putting</b> women on a relatively lower plane. Society will go backward if women don't get to vote." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All that I {{know right}} well, lad, an' I'd be a brute if I didn't give the fact due weight; but I'm <b>not</b> willin' <b>you</b> should <b>put</b> your own lives in peril for me. You've got {{people who love}} you, while I----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{if it had}} {{not been}} there, I would <b>not</b> order <b>thee</b> to <b>put</b> them there. Dunce! I would have the world know that I disown and scorn him! Do my bidding!--Stay. Let the room stand; but take him what he asks for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (In alarm, rising, as Knox purses {{his lips}} to bid them enter.) Don't let anybody in. I don't {{want to be seen}} here--with you. Besides, my {{presence}} will <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> in a good light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah ha!" [...] said Dalgetty; [...] "I have faint {{remembrance of}} having {{heard of that}} matter. Did <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> bread and cheese into a man's mouth, when he had never a stomach whereunto to {{transmit}} the same?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And will <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> any {{check on}} thoughtless expenditure? If you live ten or twenty years, as {{we hope you}} may, it will become unnecessary; but in making a will, a man should always {{remember}} he may go off suddenly." ...|$|R
60|$|Rose. Sir Martin, {{you have}} done your {{business}} with my lady, she'll never look upon you more; she says, she's so well satisfied of your wit and courage, that she will <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> to any further trial.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Nina, I will <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> to {{the trouble}} of protestation. Look at that star. I should as soon suspect the light which God has placed in the heaven of {{misleading}} me, as I should suspect you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, now," [...] I cried. [...] "You analyse too far. I will <b>not</b> let even <b>YOU</b> <b>put</b> {{me out of}} conceit with Sebastian." [...] (Her {{face flushed}} at that [...] "even you"; I almost fancied she began to like me.) [...] "He is the enthusiasm of my life; just {{consider}} how much he has done for humanity!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] {{the gentleman}} said, scrutinizing him closely. [...] "I see you look sunburned and weather-beaten now that I look at you; but somehow I should <b>not</b> have <b>put</b> <b>you</b> {{down as a}} sailor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{stop his}} Daily Mail," [...] said Raeburn. [...] "I'd leave The Times, but I'd stop the Daily Mail on the score of its {{placards}} alone. It overdoes Northcliffe. It translates {{him into the}} shrieks and yells of underlings. The plain fact is that Northcliffe is scared out of his wits by German efficiency--and in war time when a man is scared out of his wits, whether he is honest or <b>not,</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> {{his head in a}} bag or hold a pistol to it to calm him.... What is the good of all this clamouring for a change of government? We haven't a change of government. It's like telling a tramp to get a change of linen. Our men, all our public men, are second-rate men, with the habits of advocates. There is nothing masterful in their minds. How can you expect the system to produce anything else? But they are doing as well as they can, {{and there is no way}} of putting in any one else now, and there you are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you come}} another time among the Crows," [...] said he, [...] "don't hide your goods: trust {{to them and}} they will <b>not</b> wrong <b>you.</b> <b>Put</b> your goods in the lodge of a chief, and they are sacred; hide them in a cache, and any one who finds will steal them. My people have now given up your goods for my sake; but there are some foolish young men in the village, who may be {{disposed}} to be troublesome. Don't linger, therefore, but pack your horses and be off." ...|$|R
6000|$|The sister flushed, {{then turned}} pale. Nun that she was, {{she had heard}} gossip. [...] "The bishop has <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> aside?" [...] she faltered. She raised her crucifix. [...] "He hasn't {{interfered}} with your work--with {{the building of the}} cathedral?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Van Helsing said solemnly, [...] "You {{are always}} right. But this is life and death. All {{chambers}} are alike to the doctor. And even were they {{not they are}} all as one to me tonight. Friend John, when I turn the handle, if the door does <b>not</b> open, do <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your shoulder down and shove; and you too, my friends. Now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep it! Not I. What wouldst say to thy dainty dame? Nor should I get {{half its}} value from the Jews. No, no, take back thy jewel, Sir Page; I'll <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>thee</b> {{in need of}} telling more lies than becomes thine office." ...|$|R
