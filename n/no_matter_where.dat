Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border of being called a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will qualify as a planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E

On 11 January 2007, the northern state of Coahuila, which borders Texas, passed a similar bill (20–13), under the name Pacto Civil de Solidaridad (Civil Pact of Solidarity).

25|$|In 2006, Anderson {{appeared}} in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL.

In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> he goes).

25|$|The other {{surprise}} was that ground returns caused a false signal that always {{appeared at the}} same range as the aircraft's current altitude, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> the dish was pointed. This was {{in much the same}} fashion as the Mk. IV, but in this case, the signal was much smaller whenever the dish was not pointed down. Instead of a wall of noise at the range of the aircraft's altitude, the signal caused a faint ring, leaving targets on either side visible. The ring was initially very wide, caused by returns not only directly under the aircraft but further away as well. After several months of work, Hodgkin and Edwards managed to provide a tuning control that muted down the weaker signals, leaving a sharp ring indicating the aircraft altitude. This too was a useful indicator for the operators, as they could see they were at the same altitude as their target when the ring overlapped the target blip.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s under Earl Weaver, {{then the}} {{manager for the}} Orioles' double-A {{affiliate}} in Elmira, New York, Dalkowski's game began to show improvement. Weaver had given all of the players an IQ test and discovered that Dalkowski had a lower than normal IQ. Weaver believed that Dalkowski had had such difficulty keeping his game under control {{because he did not}} have the mental capacity. Weaver kept things simple for Dalkowski, telling him to only throw the fastball and a slider, and to just aim the fastball down the middle of the plate. This allowed Dalkowski to concentrate on just throwing the ball for strikes. Weaver knew that Dalkowski's fastball was practically unhittable <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> it was in the strike zone, and if Dalkowski missed his target, he might end up throwing it on the corners for a strike anyway. Under Weaver's stewardship, Dalkowski had his best season in 1962, posting personal bests in complete games and ERA, and walking less than a batter an inning for the first time in his career. In an extra-inning game, Dalkowski recorded 27 strikeouts (while walking 16 and throwing 283 pitches).|$|E
25|$|The {{radar beam}} has a width of about 10 degrees, and pulses 2.5 degrees, so a target will {{not produce a}} single blip, {{but a number of}} them. For targets located far from the centreline, the radar would produce 4 or 5 {{individual}} blips as the scanner rotated, causing a short arc about 10 degrees wide to show on the display. A somewhat more complex interaction occurs as the target aircraft approaches the centre of the radar scan. Any target within ten degrees of the centreline will always have some radar energy falling on it <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> the dish is pointed; a target five degrees {{to the right of the}} aircraft would still be reflecting the outer edge of the broadcast even when the scanner is pointed five degrees to the left. In this case the target will create blips throughout the entire rotation, drawing a complete ring on the display instead of a short arc. Because the antenna is more sensitive in the middle than the edges, the ring on the display will vary in brightness as the dish scans, reaching its maximum when the dish is aimed at the target, and a minimum, or disappearing entirely, when it is pointed the other direction. A target that is dead ahead will produce a complete uninterrupted circle on the display.|$|E
