40|$|This {{research}} {{details the}} characterisation of four Irish-grown lignocellulosic biomasses for pyrolysis by biomass composition analysis, TGA, and Py-GC/MS-FID. Ash content (mf) {{increased in the}} order spruce (0. 26 wt. %) < salix (1. 16 wt. %) < miscanthus (3. 43 wt. %) < wheat straw (3. 76 wt. %). Analysis of hydrolysis-derived sugar monomers showed that xylose concentrations (4. 69 – 26. 76 wt. %) ranged significantly compared to glucose concentrations (40. 98 – 49. 82 wt. %). Higher hemicellulose and ash contents probably increased <b>non-volatile</b> <b>matter,</b> and decreased the temperature of maximum degradation by TGA as well as yields of GC-detectable compounds by Py-GC/MS-FID. Differences in composition and degradation were reflected in the pyrolysate composition by lower quantities of sugars (principally levoglucosan), pyrans, and furans for salix, miscanthus, and wheat straw compared to spruce, and increased concentrations of cyclopentenones and acids...|$|E
30|$|Fixed carbon {{indicates}} {{the fraction of}} <b>non-volatile</b> organic <b>matter,</b> but may contain oxygen and hydrogen (Parikh et al. 2007). Thus, the higher the fixed carbon content, the slower the biomass combustion within the apparatus for energy conversion, such as stoves or boilers, and more thermally resistant will be the biomass (Protásio et al. 2013 c). Protásio et al. 2013 a found fixed carbon contents of 14 %, 13 % and 13.1 % in Brazilian lignocellulosic residues from Eucalyptus wood, pine wood and sugar cane bagasse, respectively, which are lower than the one observed for babassu nut biomass. This result {{can be attributed to}} the quality and quantity of lignin in babassu residues, since this macromolecule is correlated with the fixed carbon content of biomass (Demirbas 2003).|$|R

40|$|The {{volatility}} of sub-micrometer atmospheric aerosol particles was studied {{in a rural}} background environment in Finland {{using a combination of}} a heating tube and a scanning mobility particle sizer. The analysis focused on nanoparticles formed through nucleation which were subsequently observed during their growth in the diameter range between 5 and 60 nm. During the 6 days of new particle formation shown in detail, the concentrations of newly formed particles increased up to 10 000 cm − 3. The number of nucleation mode particles measured after volatilization in the heating tube at 280 °C was up to 90 % of the total number under ambient conditions. Taking into account the absolute accuracy of the size distribution measurements, all ambient particles found in the rural atmosphere could have a non-volatile core after volatilization at 280 °C. As the regional new particle formation events developed over time as a result of further vapor condensation, the newly formed particles grew at an average growth rate of 2. 4 ± 0. 3 nm h − 1. Importantly, the non-volatile cores of nucleation mode particles were also observed to grow over time, however, at a lower average growth rate of 0. 6 ± 0. 3 nm h − 1. One implication of the volatility analysis is that the newly formed particles, which have reached ambient diameters of 15 nm, are unlikely to consist of sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate, and water alone. A relatively constant ratio between the growth rate of the ambient particles as well as their non-volatile cores indicates that <b>non-volatile</b> <b>matter</b> is formed only gradually in the growing particles. The non-volatile fraction of the particles showed some correlation with the ambient temperature. The composition and formation mechanism of this non-volatile material in nucleation mode particles are, to date, not known...|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric aerosol {{particle}} size distributions at a continental background site in Eastern Germany were examined for a one-year period. Particles were classified using a twin differential mobility particle sizer in a size range between 3 and 800 nm. As a novelty, every second measurement of this experiment involved {{the removal of}} volatile chemical compounds in a thermodenuder at 300 °C. This concept allowed to quantify the number size distribution of non-volatile particle cores – primarily associated with elemental carbon, and to compare this to the original ambient size distribution. A general result was that practically every ambient particle in continental background air contained a non-volatile core. The volume fraction of <b>non-volatile</b> particulate <b>matter</b> (ambient D p 200 nm) contained more non-volatile compounds than smaller particles (< 50 nm), thus indicating a significantly different chemical composition. Two alternative air mass classification schemes based on either, synoptic chart analysis (Berliner Wetterkarte) or back trajectories showed, that the volume and number fractions of non-volatile cores were less dependent on air mass than the absolute concentrations in the particle size distributions. In all air masses, the non-volatile size distributions showed a more and a less volatile ("soot") mode, which {{is located in the}} size range of about 50 nm. During unstable conditions and in maritime air masses, smaller values were observed compared to continental or stable conditions. This reflects the significant emissions of non-volatile material over the continent and, depending on atmospheric stratification, increased concentrations at ground level...|$|R
40|$|From May 2008 to March 2009 aerosol {{emissions}} {{were measured}} using the eddy covariance method covering {{the size range}} 0. 25 to 2. 5 &mu;m diameter (Dp) from a 105 m tower, in central Stockholm, Sweden. Supporting chemical aerosol data were collected at roof and street level. Results show that the inorganic fraction of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and sea salt accounts for approximately 15 % of the total aerosol mass Dp (PM 1 ) with water soluble soil contributing 11 % and water insoluble soil 47 %. Carbonaceous compounds were at the most 27 % of PM 1 mass. It was found that heating the air from the tower to 200 &deg;C resulted {{in the loss of}} approximately 60 % of the aerosol volume at 0. 25 μm Dp whereas only 40 % of the aerosol volume was removed at 0. 6 μm Dp. Further heating to 300 &deg;C caused very little additional losses Dp. The chemical analysis did not include carbonaceous compounds, but based on the difference between the total mass concentration and the sum of the analyzed non-carbonaceous materials, it can be assumed that the non-volatile particulate material (heated to 300 &deg;C) consists mainly of carbonaceous compounds, including elemental carbon. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} non-volatile particle fraction Dp correlated (r 2 = 0. 4) with the BC concentration at roof level in the city, supporting the assumption that the non-volatile material consists of carbonaceous compounds. The average diurnal cycles of the BC emissions from road traffic (as inferred from the ratio of the incremental concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and BC measured on a densely trafficked street) and the fluxes of non-volatile material at tower level are in close agreement, suggesting a traffic source of BC. We have estimated the emission factors (EFs) for non-volatile particles Dp to be 2. 4 &plusmn; 1. 4 mg veh− 1 km− 1 based on either CO 2 fluxes or traffic activity data. Light (LDV) and heavy duty vehicle (HDV) EFs were estimated using multiple linear regression and reveal that for <b>non-volatile</b> particulate <b>matter</b> in the 0. 25 to 0. 6 μm Dp range, the EFHDV is approximately twice as high as the EFLDV, the difference not being statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|Aviation {{demand is}} {{expected}} to double in the coming decades, and there are growing concerns about its impacts on the environment. Governments seek to mitigate the impacts of aviation on climate, air quality, and noise by setting various emissions and noise regulations. However, there are complex interactions among these three impact pathways which must be carefully considered. The FAA is developing an integrated suite of software tools to allow policy makers to explore the tradeoffs among these environmental impacts for various regulatory options, and to weigh them against the costs to the aviation industry of those regulations. One component of this tools suite is the Aviation Environmental Portfolio Management Tool (APMT) {{which is designed to}} analyze industry economics and environmental impacts. Within APMT, there is a desire for faster models that can analyze multiple policy scenarios for decades into the future in order to inform policy decisions on a reasonable time scale. One particular need is that for a fast surrogate air quality model that relates changes in aviation activity to changes in ambient pollutant concentrations. In this thesis, a response surface model (RSM) is developed for the high-fidelity, but time-consuming, Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) simulation system. The RSM relates changes in aviation emissions in the United States to changes in ambient concentrations of particulate matter, the main driver of the air quality impacts on public health. Specifically, the surrogate model takes in yearly inventories of landing-taxi-take-off cycle fuel burn, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and <b>non-volatile</b> primary particulate <b>matter,</b> and returns the resulting changes in ground level annual average ambient particulate matter concentrations. The RSM design space is set to capture likely emissions scenarios over the next 20 years. A low discrepancy sequence is used to generate the 27 CMAQ sample points in order to allow the flexibility of adding more CMAQ simulations as necessary without disrupting the coverage of the design space. Three formulations are then explored for the particulate matter RSM, two kriging models and one regression model. A leave-k-out cross-validation is performed to select the final RSM formulation and analyze its error behavior with the addition of successive CMAQ training points. Finally, the RSM is compared to a previous surrogate model based on the intake fraction method. The ordinary least-squares regression model is found to perform better than the two kriging formulations, yielding a root-mean-square prediction error of around 1 %. The error decays at a rate of just over 0. 01 % with the addition of each of the last 5 CMAQ runs. Running the RSM with a baseline emissions inventory then yields an estimate of the air quality and subsequent public health impacts of current aviation emissions. A Monte Carlo simulation provides uncertainty distributions on the RSM outputs. The net increase in risk of adult premature mortality due to aviation-reported as the number of new incidences across the modeling domain-is estimated at 210, with a 95 % confidence interval between 140 and 290. The total cost of the increased risk of adult premature mortality, as well as of several other health endpoints, is estimated at $ 1. 21 billion with a 95 % confidence interval between about $ 370 million and $ 2. 15 billion (year 2000 US dollars). These estimates are roughly half of those given by the prior intake fraction model. Of these total impacts, 30 % are found to stem from emissions of volatile organic compounds and volatile particulate matter from organics, another 30 % from emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile particulate matter from sulfur, 28 % from nitrogen oxide emissions, and about 11 % from <b>non-volatile</b> particulate <b>matter</b> emissions. by Tudor Maşek.

40|$|Assessing {{candidate}} policies {{designed to}} address the impact of aviation on the environment requires a simplified method to estimate pollutant emissions for current and future aircraft gas turbine engines under different design and operating assumptions. A method for NOx and CO emissions was developed in a previous research effort. This thesis focuses on {{the addition of a}} soot mechanism to the existing model. The goal is to estimate soot emissions of existing gas turbine engines within soot measurement uncertainties, and then to use the method to estimate the performance of potential future engines. Soot is <b>non-volatile</b> primary particulate <b>matter.</b> In gas turbine engines the size rarely exceeds l [mu]m. The soot is composed almost exclusively of black carbon, is an aggregate of nearly spherical carbon primary particles, and exhibits fractal behavior. Results of other studies regarding soot nucleation, growth, oxidation, and coagulation rates are integrated within a network of perfectly-stirred reactors and shown to capture the typical evolution of soot inside a gas turbine combustor, with soot formed in the early parts of the combustor and then oxidized. The soot model shows promising results as its emissions estimates are within the measurement uncertainties. Nevertheless, model uncertainties are high. They are the consequence of the large sensitivity to input variables. Therefore, the validity of the model is limited to cases with available engine data. More engine data are needed to develop and assess the soot model. by Bastien Martini. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2008.

40|$|The gas-particle {{partitioning}} {{and chemical}} aging of semi-volatile organic aerosol {{are presented in}} a newly developed box model scheme, where {{its effect on the}} growth, composition, and mixing state of particles is examined. The volatility-basis set (VBS) framework is implemented into the aerosol microphysical scheme MATRIX (Multiconfiguration Aerosol TRacker of mIXing state), which resolves mass and number aerosol concentrations and in multiple mixing-state classes. The new scheme, MATRIX-VBS, has the potential to significantly advance the representation of organic aerosols in Earth system models by improving upon the conventional representation as <b>non-volatile</b> particulate organic <b>matter,</b> often also with an assumed fixed size distribution. We present results from idealized cases representing Beijing, Mexico City, a Finnish forest, and a southeastern US forest, and investigate the evolution of mass concentrations and volatility distributions for organic species across the gas and particle phases, as well as assessing their mixing state among aerosol populations. Emitted semi-volatile primary organic aerosols evaporate almost completely in the intermediate-volatility range, while they remain in the particle phase in the low-volatility range. Their volatility distribution at any point in time depends on the applied emission factors, oxidation by OH radicals, and temperature. We also compare against parallel simulations with the original scheme, which represented only the particulate and non-volatile component of the organic aerosol, examining how differently the condensed-phase organic matter is distributed across the mixing states in the model. The results demonstrate the importance of representing organic aerosol as a semi-volatile aerosol, and explicitly calculating the partitioning of organic species between the gas and particulate phases...|$|R
40|$|World-wide {{demand for}} air {{transportation}} is rising steadily. The air transportation network {{may be limited}} by aviation's growing environmental impacts. These impacts {{take the form of}} climate impacts, noise impacts, and health impacts, the latter of which are addressed in this thesis. Aircraft emissions released into the atmosphere have an impact on human health. In the context of assessing the environmental impacts of aviation-related policies, costs and benefits on human health must be considered. Two different models were developed as tools to assess the impacts of aircraft emissions on human health. The first model estimates the changes in skin cancer incidences and mortalities due to changes in ozone column caused by aircraft NO, emissions. The second model estimates changes in health endpoits related to changes in ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM 25) by estimating changes in elemental carbon, primary and secondary organic PM, secondary sulfates, and secondary nitrates. The air quality model discussed herein is the second iteration {{in the development of a}} response surface model (RSM) based on a set of 25 simulations done with the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ), a more complex atmospheric chemistry model. The increase in adult premature mortalities in the U. S. caused by air quality impacts of aviation emissions in year 2005 is estimated at 210 deaths per year (90 % confidence interval: 130 - 340). This considers only those emissions that occur below 3000 feet above ground level as is consistent with current regulatory practice for aviation. (cont.) The monetized value of the mortality and morbidity effects using RSM v 2 outputs is estimated at $ 1. 4 billion in year 2000 US dollars (90 % confidence interval: $ 550 million - $ 2. 8 billion). Of these total impacts, 4 % are found to stem from emissions of volatile organic compounds and volatile particulate matter from organics, another 12 % from emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile particulate matter from sulfur, 70 % from nitrogen oxide emissions, and 14 % from <b>non-volatile</b> particulate <b>matter</b> emissions The net benefit from subsonic aircraft NOx in year 2002 on nonmelanoma skin cancer incidence and associated mortality in the U. S. is estimated at $ 130 M (90 % confidence interval : $ 68 - $ 220 M) in 2000 dollars. This corresponds to the prevention of approximately 6, 200 new basal cell carcinoma cases (BCC) (90 % confidence interval: 3, 800 - 9, 100), 2, 900 new squamous cell carcinoma cases (SCC) (90 % confidence interval: 1, 700 - 4, 200), and 20 nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) premature mortalities (90 % CI : 13 - 28).

40|$|International audienceOn 24 March 2007, the {{atmosphere}} over Central Europe {{was affected by}} an episode of exceptionally high mass concentrations of aerosol particles, most likely caused by a dust storm in the Southern Ukraine on the preceding day. At ground-based measurement stations in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany PM 10 mass concentrations rose to values between 200 and 1400 ?g m ? 3. An evaluation of PM 10 measurements from 360 monitoring stations showed that the dust cloud advanced along a narrow corridor at speeds of up to 70 km h ? 1. According to lidar observations over Leipzig, Germany, the high aerosol concentrations were confined to a homogeneous boundary layer of 1800 m height. The wavelength dependence of light extinction using both lidar and sun photometer measurements suggested the dominance of coarse particles during the main event. At a wavelength of 532 nm, relatively high volume extinction coefficients (300 ? 400 Mm ? 1) and a particle optical depth of 0. 65 was observed. In-situ measurements with an aerodynamic particle sizer at Melpitz, Germany, confirmed {{the presence of a}} coarse particle mode with a mode diameter > 2 ?m, whose maximum concentration coincided with that of PM 10. A chemical particle analysis confirmed the dominance of <b>non-volatile</b> and insoluble <b>matter</b> in the coarse mode as well as high enrichments of Ti and Fe, which are characteristic of soil dust. A combination of back trajectory calculations and satellite images allowed to identify the dust source with confidence: On 23 March 2007, large amounts of dust were emitted from dried-out farmlands in the southern Ukraine, facilitated by wind gusts up to 100 km h ? 1. The unusual vertical stability and confined height of this dust layer as well as the rapid transport under dry conditions led to the conservation of high aerosol mass concentrations along the transect and thus to the extraordinary high aerosol concentrations over Central Europe. Our observations demonstrate the capacity of a combined apparatus of in situ and remote sensing measurements to characterise such a dust with a variety of aerosol parameters. As a conclusion, the description of dust emission, transport and transformation processes needs to be improved, especially when facing the possible effects of further anthropogenic desertification and climate change...|$|R
