The gamma rays representing the neutron flux are observed against interference consisting of cosmic gamma rays, planetary continuum and line emission, and gamma rays arising from the interaction of cosmic rays with the GRS and the spacecraft. The uncertainty and minimum detection limits in <b>neutron</b> <b>albedo</b> fluxes are calculated for two missions, a lunar orbiter and a comet nucleus rendezvous. A GRS on a lunar orbiter at 100 km altitude detects a thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>albedo</b> flux as low as 0. 002 /sq cm/s and an expected flux of about 0. 6 /sq cm/s is measured with an uncertainty of 0. 001 /sq cm/s, for a 100 h observation period. For the comet nucleus, again in a 100 h observing period, a thermal <b>neutron</b> <b>albedo</b> flux is detected at a level of 0. 006 /sq cm/s and an expected flux of about 0. 4 /sq cm/s is measured with an uncertainty of 0. 004 /sq cm/s.

40|$|<b>Albedo</b> <b>neutron</b> {{dosimeters}} {{have proven}} to be effective as a method of measuring the dose from low-energy neutrons that other types of personnel neutron dosimeters do not detect. Many <b>albedo</b> <b>neutron</b> dosimeters have been designed, and some are being used extensively. All <b>albedo</b> <b>neutron</b> dosimeters are energy- dependent, becoming less sensitive as the energy of the neutrons is increased. In this paper the energy dependence and the effect it has on the evaluation of the dose are discussed. Numerous measurements are shown which were made under field conditions at five reactors, two accelerators, a radiochemistry facility, two plutonium facilities, a low-scatter neutron irradiation facility, three storage vaults, and at the N.

In most cases evaluation of an individual's dose occurring in a single facility can be reasonably accurate, but it must be known in which facility the person was exposed.

However, so far only a few methods {{are on the way}} to close this gap between point measurements and remote sensing. One new measurement methodology that could determine integral soil moisture at this scale is the aboveground sensing of cosmic-ray neutrons, more precisely of ground <b>albedo</b> <b>neutrons.</b> The present study performed ground <b>albedo</b> <b>neutron</b> sensing (GANS) at an agricultural field in northern Germany. To test the method it was accompanied by other soil moisture measurements for a summer period with corn crops growing on the field and a later autumn-winter period without crops and a longer period of snow cover. Additionally, meteorological data and aboveground crop biomass were included in the evaluation. Hourly values of ground <b>albedo</b> <b>neutron</b> sensing showed a high statistical variability. Six-hourly values corresponded well with classical soil moisture measurements, after calibration based on one reference dry period and three wet periods of a few days each. Crop biomass seemed to influence the measurements only to minor degree, opposed to snow cover which has a more substantial impact on the measurements. The latter could be quantitatively related to a newly introduced field neutron ratio estimated from neutron counting rates of two energy ranges. Overall, our study outlines a procedure to apply the ground <b>albedo</b> <b>neutron</b> sensing method based on devices now commercially available, without the need for accompanying numerical simulations and suited for longer monitoring periods after initial calibration...|$|R

40|$|The {{fast neutron}} flux in near-Earth orbit has been {{measured}} with the COMPTEL instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO). For this measurement one of COMPTEL's seven liquid scintillator modules {{was used as}} an uncollimated neutron detector with threshold of 12. 8 MeV. The measurements cover a range of 4. 8 to 15. 5 GV in vertical cutoff rigidity and 3 deg to 177 deg in spacecraft geocenter zenith angle. One of the measurements occurred near the minimum of the deepest Forbush decrease ever observed by ground-level neutron monitors. After correction for solar modulation, the total flux is well fitted by separable functions in rigidity and zenith angle. With the spacecraft pointed near the nadir the flux is consistent with balloon measurements of the atmospheric <b>neutron</b> <b>albedo.</b> The flux varies by about a factor of 4 between the extremes of rigidity and a factor of 2 between the extremes of zenith angle. The effect of the spacecraft mass in shielding the detector from the atmospheric <b>neutron</b> <b>albedo</b> is much more important than its role as a source of additional secondary neutrons.

40|$|We {{know that}} {{volatiles}} are sequestered at the poles of the Moon. While {{we have evidence}} of water ice {{and a number of}} other compounds based on remote sensing, the detailed distribution, and physical and chemical form are largely unknown. Additional orbital studies of lunar polar volatiles may yield further insights, but the most important next step is to use landed assets to fully characterize the volatile composition and distribution at scales of tens to hundreds of meters. To achieve this range of scales, mobility is needed. Because of the proximity of the Moon, near real-time operation of the surface assets is possible, with an associated reduction in risk and cost. This concept of operations is very different from that of rovers on Mars, and new operational approaches are required to carry out such real-time robotic exploration. The Mojave Volatiles Project (MVP) was a Moon-Mars Analog Mission Activities (MMAMA) program project aimed at (1) determining effective approaches to operating a real-time but short-duration lunar surface robotic mission, and (2) performing prospecting science in a natural setting, as a test of these approaches. Here we describe some results from the first such test, carried out in the Mojave Desert between 16 and 24 October, 2014. The test site was an alluvial fan just E of the Soda Mountains, SW of Baker, California. This site contains desert pavements, ranging from the late Pleistocene to early-Holocene in age. These pavements are undergoing dissection by the ongoing development of washes. A principal objective was to determine the hydration state of different types of desert pavement and bare ground features. The mobility element of the test was provided by the KREX- 2 rover, designed and operated by the Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames Research Center. The rover-borne neutron spectrometer measured the <b>neutron</b> <b>albedo</b> at both thermal and epithermal energies. Assuming uniform geochemistry and material bulk density, hydrogen as either hydroxyl/water in mineral assemblages or as moisture will significantly enhance the return of thermalized neutrons. However, in the Mojave test setting there is little uniformity, especially in bulk material density. We find that lighter toned materials (immature pavements, bar and swale, and wash materials) have lower thermal neutron flux, while mature, darker pavements with the greatest desert varnish development have higher neutron fluxes. Preliminary analysis of samples from the various terrain types in the test area indicates a prevailing moisture content of 2 - 3 wt% H 2 O. However, soil mineralogy suggests that the welldeveloped Av 1 soil horizon beneath the topmost dark pavement clast layer contains the highest clay content. Structural water (including hydroxyl) in these clays may explain the enhanced <b>neutron</b> <b>albedo</b> over dark pavements. On the other hand, surface and subsurface bulk density can also play a role in <b>neutron</b> <b>albedo</b> - lower density of materials found in washes, for example, can result in a reduction in neutron flux.

These results are based on detailed Geant 4 geometry models of Columbus and ISS, comprising a total of about 750 and 350 geometry volumes, respectively. Additionally, the physics models of Geant 4 have been validated with respect to space radiation shielding applications. Geant 4 physics configurations based on the “Binary Cascade” and “Bertini Cascade” models of hadronic reactions were found to adequately model the particle interactions of the relevant space radiation fields. Other studied Geant 4 models of hadronic reactions were found to be unsatisfactory for this application. Calculated trapped proton dose rates are found to be strongly dependent on ISS altitude. Dose rates for different locations inside the Columbus cabin are presented, as well as for different models of the incident space radiation flux. Dose rates resulting from incident anisotropic trapped protons are found to be lower, or equal to, those of omnidirectional models. The anisotropy induced by the asymmetric shielding distribution of Columbus/ISS is also studied.
