5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise is {{approaching}} the planet. Picard enters his ready room and finds his belongings {{scattered on the}} floor. He calls in Worf, who cannot explain their displacement. D'Sora arrives at Data's cabin where he is painting. She tells him to continue, but is then annoyed when he does so, causing him some confusion. The ship arrives at the coordinates for the planet but finds <b>nothing</b> <b>there.</b> Then it suddenly appears as the ship's computer warns of a depressurization in the observation lounge. The crew investigate and find all the furniture piled {{in one corner of}} the room.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft {{in the corner of}} the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does not remember how long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as perfect for the recording, as there was <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> to distract him.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara find a {{location}} in the mansion which is noticeably colder {{than the rest of}} the house, and they feel as if they are being watched. Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's <b>nothing</b> <b>there.</b> The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in front of them and Emma senses something crying out for help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E

5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to <b>nothing.</b> <b>There</b> were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery {{was not an easy}} one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E
5|$|One month later, Jupiter {{visits the}} narrator and asks him to come immediately, fearing that Legrand has been bitten by the bug and gone insane. Once they arrive on the island, Legrand insists that the bug will {{be the key to}} {{restoring}} his lost fortune. He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed {{at the end of one}} branch. At Legrand's direction, Jupiter drops the bug through one eye socket and Legrand paces out to a spot where the group begins to dig. Finding <b>nothing</b> <b>there,</b> Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop the bug through the skull's other eye; they choose a different spot to dig, this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry. They estimate the total value at $1.5 million, but even that figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items.|$|E
25|$|Before {{construction}} {{began in}} Blizna, there was <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> but uncleared forest. The Nazis used slave labour {{from the nearby}} SS Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager concentration camp in Pustków to build new infrastructure, starting with concrete roads, then a narrow-gauge railway line linking to the station at Kochanówka village. They built barracks, bunkers, buildings and all the specialised equipment needed for the operation and firing of rockets. In addition, {{efforts were made to}} disguise the site as much as possible. They did this by building an artificial village; cottages and barns were made of plywood, lines were hung with clothes and bed-sheets, and imitation people and animals were created using gypsum plaster.|$|E

25|$|I {{returned}} to a Salonika destroyed. I was hoping to find my adopted brother, but rumor told that he had died of malaria in Lublin. I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had <b>nothing,</b> <b>there</b> {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E

500|$|On April 12, 2016, {{the first}} teaser trailer {{for the film}} debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly {{compared}} the [...] "series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes" [...] featured in the trailer to the film Inception, as did Scott Mendelson of Forbes. Forbes added that {{the structure of the}} trailer resembled early marketing for the film Batman Begins. The Hollywood Reporters Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to The Matrix and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of Hugh Laurie's Gregory House from House, calling them not [...] "necessarily a real problem, of course... there's <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> outside the derivative aspects: {{due to the nature of}} the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material." [...] McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of [...] "Tilda Swinton literally knock Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body," [...] but concluded, [...] "as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured" [...] than the first trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy.|$|E

2500|$|Judge Richard Goldstone, {{writing in}} The New York Times in October 2011, {{said of the}} Russell Tribunal on Palestine that [...] "It is not a 'tribunal.'

5000|$|Kanefsky has {{directed}} 15 {{of his own}} films and been the writer on several others. Kanefsky's first film was the comedy/horror feature <b>There's</b> <b>Nothing</b> Out <b>There</b> (1989), a parody of the horror film genre. In the film, a character named Mike has seen every horror film made, and [...] "knows the rules". Mike uses his knowledge of horror movies to survive the movie and terrorize the other characters. This resembles the character Randy in the Scream series of films. Since <b>There's</b> <b>Nothing</b> Out <b>There</b> predates Scream, {{much has been made}} of the common elements.|$|R

2500|$|From 1960 to 1980, {{trade in}} the docks {{declined}} to almost [...] <b>nothing.</b> <b>There</b> were two main reasons. First, {{the development of the}} shipping container made this type of relatively small dock inefficient, and the dock-owners were slow to embrace change. Second, the manufacturing exports which had maintained the trade through the docks dwindled and moved away from the local area. In 1980 the docks were closed and the Government took control of the land.|$|E
2500|$|Gaubatz {{said that}} [...] "They even worked {{out how it}} would go. If there was <b>nothing</b> <b>there,</b> nothing would be said. If the site had been , nothing would be said. But, if it was still there, they would bring the press corps out." [...] After a May 4, 2006 meeting, {{according}} to Gaubatz, he called a reporter at the Washington Times, who called Weldon's office to get confirmation. That inquiry, Gaubatz said, scuttled the project.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{according}} to Ivinskaya, [...] "'The {{way they could}} write!' he once exclaimed – by 'they' he meant the Russian classics. And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the Literary Gazette: 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme!

2500|$|On October 15, 1965, Brian went to {{the studio}} with a 43-piece {{orchestra}} to record an instrumental piece entitled [...] "Three Blind Mice", which bore no musical connection to the nursery rhyme of the same name. Another instrumental, called [...] "Trombone Dixie", was recorded. According to Brian, [...] "I was just foolin' around one day, fuckin' around with the musicians, and I took that arrangement out of my briefcase {{and we did it}} in 20 minutes.

2500|$|The atomistic void {{hypothesis}} {{was a response}} to the paradoxes of Parmenides and Zeno, the founders of metaphysical logic, who put forth difficult to answer arguments in favor of the idea {{that there can be no}} movement. They held that any movement would require a void—which is nothing—but a nothing cannot exist. The Parmenidean position was [...] "You say there is a void; therefore the void is not nothing; therefore there is not the void". The position of Parmenides appeared validated by the observation that where there seems to be <b>nothing</b> <b>there</b> is air, and indeed even where there is not matter there is something, for instance light waves.|$|E
2500|$|At 12:54, the {{co-pilot}} visually {{picked up}} the runway to his right. The co-pilot prompted the PIC to go towards the runway on the right at 12:54:15 saying [...] "runway in sight, <b>nothing</b> <b>there,</b> only radar shows...‟ He repeated [...] "Go to the right, I would say, there is nothing there‟. At 12:54:35, he again said [...] "that is, that is, that is, runway in sight, there is nothing there‟ the co-pilot reiterated [...] "Well, that is, don't you see…‟ It was at this stage that the Captain also saw the runway because immediately thereafter, he disengaged the autopilot to start a turn towards the runway and acknowledged to the co-pilot {{that he had the}} runway in sight.|$|E
