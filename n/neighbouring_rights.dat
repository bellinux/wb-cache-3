This contribution discusses: (1) the compatibility with EU law of national legislative initiatives that {{have resulted in the}} creation of sui generis rights for press publishers; and (2) whether a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>right</b> for publishers may be adopted at the EU level and, if so, what changes of the copyright acquis are required.

This response by the European Copyright Society (1) analyses why an intervention creating a new <b>neighbouring</b> <b>right</b> for publishers is being considered in the wake of recent decisions by the CJEU in Reprobel (2015), and the German BGH (2016) in Verlegeranteil; (2) examines the rationale for neighbouring rights; (3) advises against double layering of rights; (4) assesses the implications of a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>right</b> for publishers for “open access” policies; and (5) identifies regulatory design flaws in the introduction of an ancillary right for press publishers in Germany (2013) and Spain (2014). In conclusion it is argued that value generation in itself is not a good case for intellectual property protection, and that the onus of proof needs to lie with the proponents of a new right. They need to show what the costs are, who will carry them, that the costs are necessary and proportionate, and provide verifiable evidence.

40|$|Article 11 of {{the draft}} Directive on {{copyright}} in the Digital Single Market contains a provision that, if adopted in the form proposed by the European Commission, would introduce a new <b>neighbouring</b> <b>right</b> at the EU level in favour of press publishers for the digital use of their press publications. The proposal has attracted significant commentary. This brief note discusses whether – from a copyright perspective – {{the idea of an}} EU-wide press publishers’ right: is supported by an internal market rationale which justifies an intervention at the EU level; will grant press publishers broader and more certain protection than the one already enjoyed under the EU copyright acquis; will improve press publishers’ ‘bargaining position’ as per the Commission’s stated intention. Overall, the answer appears to be in the negative. This contribution holds the view that – at best – a press publishers’ right will not change the situation of its beneficiaries and – at worst – will increase the complexity of the legal system and distract the attention from other options that could be potentially more effective in supporting the European press publishing sector...|$|R
40|$|URL] {{some time}} now, the orphan works problem {{has had its}} place {{on the agenda of}} the European Commission. Orphan works are {{copyright}} protected works whose copyright holder(s) cannot be identified or located. Problems with regard to this category of works arise when ‘users’ wish to exploit these orphan works beyond the scope of existing copyright exceptions. For those forms of exploitation the general rule of a prior consent of (all) the copyright (and <b>neighbouring</b> <b>right)</b> holders prevails. This article will describe and critically assess the recently released draft proposal for a so-called ‘European orphan works Directive’ and the impact assessment study preceding this draft.

Subsequently, a discussion amongst copyright specialists erupted about whether this made the law applied retroactively, restoring copyrights on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. The question was resolved definitively only in 2006, when the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the retroactivity of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their old, Soviet 25-year term had already expired. For the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>rights,</b> which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively. The 1993 copyright law thus rendered the old Soviet legislation largely obsolete in Russia; it remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.|$|E
25|$|The <b>neighbouring</b> <b>rights,</b> {{introduced}} for {{the first}} time in the 1991 Fundamentals, were much expanded and clarified in the 1993 copyright law. The law covered performances, phonograms, and broadcasts (including cable broadcasts). Visual fixations (videograms) were not covered. <b>Neighbouring</b> <b>rights</b> were, like the copyrights, automatic and not subject to formalities except the observance of any rights of the authors (or performers) of the works performed, recorded, or broadcast. Performers were granted the moral rights to attribution and to the integrity of the work. The exclusive economic rights comprised the rights to (re-)perform a performance, including a right to be remunerated for any reuses of a performance, and the rights to reproduction, recording, distribution, broadcasts, and rebroadcasts of a performance, a phonogram, or a broadcast. Phonogram producers were even granted an exclusive right to adaptations of their recordings, a provision that goes even beyond the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. The 1993 law covered phonograms first published in Russia or created by a Russian person or company, broadcasts of broadcasting organizations having their legal residence in Russia, and performances of Russian artists, as wells as performances first performed in Russia, and also performances recorded or broadcast in Russia, if the record or broadcast was covered by the law.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{intellectual}} property in the legal systems of individual states is constantly expanded, also because of accession to international conventions, treaties and agreements. Primarily however, the subject scope increases steadily as {{a growing number of}} so-called intellectual subjects achieve the status of non-material property, to which exclusive rights apply. The exclusive right to a plant variety, regulated by the Law of June 26, 2003 on the legal protection of plant varieties, on grounds of a model laid down in the International UPOV Convention, is regarded an industrial property law. The breeder’s right should thus be considered a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>right</b> or one related to the rights gathered under the collective title of industrial property. The WTO/TRIPS Agreement creates an international standard of protection for plant varieties, obligating states to protect plant varieties by patents, sui generis rights or a combination of the two. The prohibition of patenting plant and animal varieties within the European Patent Convention, directive 98 / 44 /EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions and domestic legislation on protection of industrial property – do not mean that the exclusion refers to plants and animals per se. Exclusion from patenting does not concern microbiological cultivation nor the effects of this which allows patent protection of inventions from the sphere of biotechnology (biotechnological inventions). It appears that the decisive factor, significant for the further development of exclusive rights to variety, is the extent of protection awarded to its cultivator, which at the same time will condition the legal situation of the variety’s user (land possessor) ...|$|R

2500|$|That new Russian law had {{a general}} {{copyright}} term of 50 years p.m.a. and was retroactive, restoring copyright on works {{on which the}} shorter Soviet copyright terms had already expired and even copyrighting works that had until then not been considered copyrightable works at all (such as performances, which under the 1993 law were subject to a <b>neighbouring</b> <b>right</b> that had not existed under Soviet legislation). The new Russian copyright terms from the 1993 law became applicable to all works of authors who had died 1943 or later, or to works published in 1943 or later. For authors who had lived and worked during the Great Patriotic War, the copyright term was extended by four years; the corresponding year for such authors and their works was thus 1939. For work first published {{after the death of}} the author, the term started at the posthumous publication of the work, and for posthumously rehabilitated authors, the copyright term of the 1993 law began to run with their rehabilitation, making it possible that even older works were placed under copyright again in these casesexamples include the works of Boris Pilniak (executed in 1938, rehabilitated in 1957), Isaac Babel (executed 1940, rehabilitated 1954), or also Osip Mandelstam (died 1938, rehabilitated 1956/1987). Other authors on whose works copyright was restored were Anna Akhmatova (died 1966), Vera Mukhina (died 1953, sculptor of the statue [...] "Worker and Kolkhoz Woman"), Aleksey Shchusev (died 1949, architect of the Lenin Mausoleum), Aleksey Tolstoy (died 1945), and many others. An extreme example is Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita: the work was first published posthumously in 1966. At that time, the Soviet copyright term of then 15 years p.m.a. had already expired as Bulgakov had died in 1940. The new Russian copyright law from 1993 placed this work under copyright again, because the 50-year term was calculated from 1966 on.|$|R

Because of the term extension of four years for authors who had lived during the Great Patriotic War, even some earlier works became subject to copyright. In the case of works formerly copyrighted under Soviet law, this amounted to a restoration of copyright; for the <b>neighbouring</b> <b>rights,</b> which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively.

The USSR agreed in the treaty to take substantive steps to amend its legislation in that sense by 1991. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. on December 23, 1991.

The USSR timed its accession to the UCC to occur before the 1971 Paris version of the UCC entered in force. Once the Paris version had become effective, accessions to the earlier Geneva version were no longer possible.

25|$|Many Russian {{scholars}} {{agreed that}} this provision from the implementation act made the law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights on Soviet works {{on which the}} much shorter copyright terms from Soviet times had already expired.

Gavrilov presented a dissenting opinion, stating that while {{this might have been}} the intention, the wording did not actually have that effect. Elst argued that the 1993 law would have been inconsistent and contain several meaningless provisions if it were not retroactive. In the United States, the general consensus was that the Russian 1993 law was retroactive. In a ruling in 2006, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the retroactivity of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their old, Soviet 25-year term had already expired.|$|E

40|$|Award date: 24 March 2014 Supervisor: Professor Giovanni Sartor, European University InstituteAt the moment, no {{copyright}} statute {{refers to}} news aggregation. It {{is not surprising}} then that news aggregators present a challenge for any court {{having to deal with}} any aspect of their activity. Indeed, with any particular form of aggregation {{there are a number of}} competing interests at play: the copyright holder, the aggregator, the reader and the public at large. So far, there were only two suits against Google Inc. based on copyright infringement concerns from Google News, one in the US and one in Europe, but they revealed a lot of problems that existing copyright law may have with news aggregators. The first claim (brought in 2005 in the United States) where the claimant Agence France Press claimed that Google Inc. was reproducing and publicly displaying AFP’s photographs, headlines, and story leads on Google’s news aggregation website without AFP’s permission, resulted in a settlement (after 2 years in court). But the case brought against Google in Europe in 2006 by Copiepresse (the collective management organization for Belgian newspaper publishers in French and German languages) found that Google had infringed copyright law. Interestingly, after the court door was broken down, a new practice regarding Google News appeared: in Germany, France and Belgium leading newspaper publishers had called on their governments to adopt a law to force internet search engines like Google to pay for displaying their content on services such as Google News. Consequently, agreements with Belgian and French governments were concluded by Google. In Germany, a new law passed granting news publishers a new <b>neighbouring</b> <b>right</b> pushing Google to pay a licensing fee even for the snippets of content used to display search results (in force as of 1 st of August 2013). The main issue both courts and legislators have to address when dealing with Google News is the question whether short fragments of news works along with their headlines and titles (so-called snippets) are protected by copyright or not. This touches one of the basic concepts of copyright law, i. e. copyright originality, not understood identically within copyright jurisdictions over the world, and challenged additionally, at least in the EU, with recent decision of the ECJ in Infopaq where the court found that a fragment of news article consisting of 11 words may be protected as an independent work. The impact of the Infopaq ruling should not be underestimated: even in the UK, where short forms of creative activity like titles or headlines, have not been traditionally protected under copyright, a recent ruling in NLA v. Meltwater concluded that news headlines may be copyrighted. Assuming that Google News is involved in acts of exploitation of copyrighted works, the other important question arises that is whether any limitation / exception provided by copyright law is applicable to this service. What can come into play in this regard are (1) the exception of quotation, (2) the exception for report on news events, and (3) the fair use defences...|$|R
