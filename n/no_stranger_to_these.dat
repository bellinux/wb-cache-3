40|$|Once upon a {{time there}} were three women: they were known as ‘the woman in black’, ‘the grey-haired woman with the {{well-developed}} sense of humor’ and ‘the rather quiet woman with the capacity <b>to</b> shock’. <b>These</b> women, who {{had known each other}} for quite some time, were all physicists. They were also friends. As physicists, the woman in black, the grey-haired woman with the well-developed sense of humour and the rather quiet woman with the capacity to shock had learned, and now shared, ‘a specific vocabulary, grammar and rhetoric’. They knew what could count as a scientific observation, ‘what standards of accuracy in determining observations [were] possible, how the words of common language [were] restricted and refined for use in [their particular] scientific discipline’. They knew how to tell the ‘truth’. Rational knowledge and empirical evidence were <b>no</b> <b>strangers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> women who were well versed in what could count as an argument. Consequently, it was said by some that these women constituted a microcosmic rational community...|$|R

'None, sir,' she answered, in a low, sweet voice, 'but that I {{have escaped}} {{is due to}} the ready valour of your friend, and the guiding wisdom of Him who confutes the plots of the wicked.

40|$|Mining keeps {{making the}} news {{around the world}} due to its social and {{environmental}} impacts on local communities. Peru is <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> types of social conflicts. In order to address my research question: ' Is mining a curse or bonanza for local communities in Peru?', I reviewed secondary literature where scholars such as Bebbington, Arellano, Veltmeyer, and De Echave question the perceptions of mining as bonanza for local communities, and suggest mining may instead be a curse for local communities. I also conducted primary research and explored this dichotomy {{from the perspective of}} a local indigenous community. In 2012, I conducted fieldwork for a case study on the mining town of Quiruvilca in the central Andes of Peru, surrounded by two large mines owned, until recently, by Canadian mining companies. I used an exploratory mixed research method to conduct and analyse 100 semi-structured interviews with local indigenous residents, in the urban area of Quiruvilca. In spite of scarce evidence of socio-economic development and limited employment opportunities, the majority of residents support mining in their community, mainly because of employment opportunities where few other options exist.

40|$|The {{history of}} superheroines {{is one of}} tensions, contradictions and difficulties. Squirrel Girl is <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> <b>these,</b> and her journey through {{the last twenty years}} of Marvel comic books has not been easy. In her debut in Marvel Super-Heroes # 8 (S. Ditko and W. Murray, 1992), Squirrel Girl failed to become Iron Man’s sidekick even though she saved him from Doctor Doom. Despite initial success, {{at least in terms of}} the narrative, Squirrel Girl {{disappeared}} for over ten years. When she reappeared in 2005, Squirrel Girl was in rather less illustrious surroundings – outside continuity. This article tracks the career of Squirrel Girl, focusing on strategies of narrative and visual representation and the relationship of the character to the structuring principle of continuity. Squirrel Girl demonstrates the ability to wield considerable power outside continuity but even here, where the victories of a woman can be easily disavowed thanks to their structural position within the Marvel universe, Squirrel Girl is still problematic. Various strategies of containment are implemented and this article will engage with these, demonstrating continuity and discontinuity in these policies as Squirrel Girl is ultimately drawn into continuity. Through a close critical reading of Squirrel Girl’s appearances, then, this article will provide initial insights into how powerful women are simultaneously promoted and contained by superhero narratives...|$|E
