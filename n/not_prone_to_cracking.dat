40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} devoted to the effect of a multiaxial stress state and of pre-straining on the creep {{properties}} of an austenitic stainless steel. Creep tests on both smooth and notched specimens have been carried out on type 316 L(N) steel at 600 °C. In comparison to the annealed state, pre-straining caused a substantial increase in creep lifetime but also a dramatic drop in intergranular damage resistance. The effect of a pre-strain on creep ductility was so strong that compact tension specimens in pre-strained state tested under relaxation conditions cracked, whereas specimens in annealed state were <b>not</b> <b>prone</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking.</b> A model taking into account both pre-strain and multiaxial effects was developed and identified on the basis of local intergranular micro-cracks measurements on notched specimens. It satisfactorily predicts the results of relaxation crack propagation tests. This model may also provide a useful estimation of the relaxation cracking risk of 316 L(N) as a function of pre-strain level and stress triaxiality ratio...|$|E
