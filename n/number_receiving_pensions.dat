40|$|Participation rate on the Greenland labour market: {{situation}} of year 2000 A goal {{is that a}} large part of the population of normal working age is employed. The participation rate is one of the statistics used to describe the performance of the economy in this respect. Two sources are used to arrive at an estimate of the rate both for Greenland in general and for four regions defined by four so called growth towns: Nuuk, Sisimiut, Ilulissat and Qaqortoq. They are Statistic Greenland’s publications on employment and on unemployment. There are some difficulties using the available data: the employment and unemployment surveys refer to periods whereas the potential workforce is counted at a date. Furthermore persons with yearly income below an arbitrary limit of 40. 000 DKK are sorted out even though they should contribute to the number of full year employed. The participation rate is found to be much higher in Nuuk than in the other regions. For Greenland as such the number is in line with figures for Western Europe and North America. Characteristics of people not in the work force are looked for. To some extent a connection exists to the <b>number</b> people <b>receiving</b> <b>pension</b> as disabled, people in education, and those on leave because of childbirth, but the relation is imperfect and great differences are seen between regions...|$|R
40|$|Pensions may {{contribute}} to male/female or black/white inequality {{to the extent that}} white males are more likely to <b>receive</b> <b>pensions</b> than are other groups. Conditional on <b>receiving</b> <b>pensions,</b> the value of pension benefits varies because white males have the highest level of expected tenure at retirement. By using a combination of the Current Population Survey and the l 9 SOBnker's Trust Corpprate Pension Plan Study, we find that the existence of pension plans contributes to black/white inequality but leaves male/female inequality unchanged among whites, Even though females are less likely to <b>receive</b> <b>pensions</b> than males, those females who do <b>receive</b> <b>pensions</b> enjoy generous ones, Among blacks, pensions exacerbate sex differences because black women are only about 75 % as likely to <b>receive</b> <b>pensions</b> as black males...|$|R

Men self-employed at age 54, however, neither retire nor reduce their working hours even after beginning to <b>receive</b> <b>pension</b> benefits; these men {{are more likely to}} be overemployed. In contrast, U.

Therefore, unlike U. S. men, Japanese men are not choosing the optimal pensionable age and labor hours to maximize their intertemporal utility...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study includes all those <b>receiving</b> disability <b>pension</b> {{for the first}} time in 1992 in Iceland. Their status in the disability register at the State Social Security Institute of Iceland November 30 th 2004 was examined as to whether they were still <b>receiving</b> disability <b>pension,</b> had died, had reached the age of retirement or were not <b>receiving</b> disability <b>pension</b> any more for some other reasons. RESULTS: In 1992 there were 725 new recipients of disability pension in Iceland, 428 females and 297 males. Twelve years later 434 from this group were no longer <b>receiving</b> disability <b>pension,</b> 240 females and 194 males. In most cases this was because they had reached the age of retirement or died (on average 88 % of the females and 91 % of the males each year).
