5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing <b>nimbostratus</b> clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (<b>nimbostratus)</b> depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E
25|$|One {{group of}} {{supplementary}} features are not actual cloud formations, but precipitation that falls when water droplets or ice crystals {{that make up}} visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft. Virga is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, <b>nimbostratus,</b> stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.|$|E
25|$|When the {{precipitation}} {{reaches the}} ground without completely evaporating, it is {{designated as the}} feature praecipitatio. This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, upward-growing cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while downward growing <b>nimbostratus</b> is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus congestus clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, {{has the capacity to}} produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.|$|E
500|$|In the {{intermediate}} range, from [...] to [...] in temperate regions, are the mid-étage clouds. They comprise {{two or three}} genera depending on the system of height classification being used: altostratus, altocumulus, and, according to WMO classification, <b>nimbostratus.</b> These clouds are formed from ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, or liquid water droplets.|$|E
500|$|Low-étage clouds form at {{less than}} [...] The two genera that are {{strictly}} low-étage are stratus, and stratocumulus. These clouds are composed of water droplets, except during winter when they are formed of supercooled waterdroplets or ice crystals if the temperature at cloud level is below freezing. Two additional genera usually form in the low altitude range, but may be based at higher levels under conditions of very low humidity. They comprise the genera cumulus, and cumulonimbus, which along with <b>nimbostratus,</b> are often classified separately as clouds of vertical development, especially when their tops are high enough to be composed of super-cooled water droplets or ice crystals.|$|E
500|$|Above {{or below}} the circle for manned {{stations}} (automatic stations do not report cloud types) that indicates sky cover can lie one or more symbols indicating cloud types {{in any of the}} low, middle, and high-étages for tropospheric clouds. One predominant cloud type may be depicted for each of three étages, if known. The middle and high-étage types are depicted above the sky cover circle of the station model, while the main low-étage cloud type is indicated below the circle. Since the station model has limited room, it makes no special provision for vertical or multi-level clouds that can occupy more than one étage at a particular time. [...] Consequently, cloud genera with significant vertical development may be coded and plotted as low or middle depending on the altitude at which they normally form. Cumulus and cumulonimbus usually form in the low étage of the troposphere and achieve vertical extent by growing upward into the middle or high étage. Conversely, <b>nimbostratus</b> usually forms in the middle étage of the troposphere and becomes vertically developed by growing downward into the low étage. [...] Although the SYNOP code has no separate formal group classification for vertical or multi-level clouds, the observer procedure for selecting numerical codes is designed to give high reporting priority to those genera or species that show significant vertical development.|$|E
2500|$|This is a diffuse dark-grey non-convective {{stratiform}} layer {{with great}} horizontal extent and moderate to deep vertical development. [...] It lacks towering structure and looks feebly illuminated from the inside. <b>Nimbostratus</b> normally forms from mid-level altostratus, and develops at least moderate vertical extent when the base subsides into {{the low level}} during precipitation that can reach moderate to heavy intensity. [...] It commonly achieves deep vertical development when it simultaneously grows upward into the high level due to large scale frontal or cyclonic lift. [...] The nimbo- prefix refers to its ability to produce continuous rain or snow over a wide area, especially ahead of a warm front. This thick cloud layer may be accompanied by embedded towering cumuliform or cumulonimbiform types. [...] Meteorologists affiliated with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) officially classify <b>nimbostratus</b> as mid-level for synoptic purposes while informally characterizing it as multi-level. [...] Independent meteorologists and educators appear split between those who largely follow the WMO model and those who classify <b>nimbostratus</b> as low-level, despite its considerable vertical extent and its usual initial formation in the middle altitude range.|$|E
2500|$|Supplementary cloud {{formations}} {{detached from}} the main cloud are known as accessory clouds. [...] The heavier precipitating clouds, <b>nimbostratus,</b> towering cumulus (cumulus congestus), and cumulonimbus typically see the formation in precipitation of the pannus feature, low ragged clouds of the genera and species cumulus fractus or stratus fractus.|$|E
2500|$|Altostratus is a mid-level opaque or {{translucent}} non-convective veil of grey/blue-grey {{cloud that}} often forms along warm fronts and around low-pressure areas. [...] Altostratus is usually composed of water droplets {{but may be}} mixed with ice crystals at higher altitudes. Widespread opaque altostratus can produce light continuous or intermittent precipitation. Precipitation commonly becomes heavier and more widespread if it thickens into <b>nimbostratus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Non-convective {{stratiform}} clouds {{appear in}} stable airmass conditions and, in general, have flat sheet-like structures that can form at any altitude in the troposphere. [...] Very low stratiform cloud results when advection fog is lifted above surface level during breezy conditions. [...] The stratiform group is divided by altitude range into the genera cirrostratus (high-level), altostratus (mid-level), stratus (low-level), and <b>nimbostratus</b> (multi-level).|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{stratiform}} group, high-level cirrostratus comprises two species. [...] Cirrostratus nebulosus has {{a rather}} diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. [...] Cirrostratus fibratus is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional {{to or from}} cirrus. Mid-level altostratus and multi-level <b>nimbostratus</b> always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus (see below).|$|E
2500|$|This genus type is a stratocumuliform {{cloud layer}} of limited convection, {{usually in the}} form of {{irregular}} patches or more extensive sheets similar to altocumulus but having larger elements with deeper-gray shading. [...] Opaque stratocumulus can produce very light intermittent precipitation. This cloud often forms under a precipitating deck of altostratus or high-based <b>nimbostratus</b> associated with a well-developed warm front, slow-moving cold front, or low-pressure area. This can create the illusion of continuous precipitation of more than very light intensity falling from stratocumulus.|$|E
2500|$|Low and {{vertical}} heaps of cumulus, towering cumulus, and cumulonimbus {{are made of}} larger water droplets ranging in radius from 5 to about 15µm. <b>Nimbostratus</b> cloud droplets can also be quite large, up to 15µm radius. [...] These larger droplets associated with vertically developed clouds {{are better able to}} trap the long-wave radiation thus mitigating the cooling effect to some degree. [...] However, these large often precipitating clouds are variable or unpredictable in their overall effect because of variations in their concentration, distribution, {{and vertical}} extent.|$|E
2500|$|These clouds {{have low}} to middle level bases that form {{anywhere}} from near surface to about [...] and tops that can extend {{into the high}} altitude range. [...] <b>Nimbostratus</b> and some cumulus in this group usually achieve moderate or deep vertical extent, but without towering structure. [...] However, with sufficient airmass instability, upward-growing cumuliform clouds can grow to high towering proportions. [...] Although genus types with vertical extent are often informally considered a single group, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) distinguishes towering vertical clouds more formally as a separate group or sub-group. [...] It is specified that these very large cumuliform and cumulonimbiform types must be identified by their standard names or abbreviations in all aviation observations (METARS) and forecasts (TAFS) to warn pilots of possible severe weather and turbulence. [...] Multi-level clouds are of even larger structure than low clouds, and are therefore identifiable by their forms and genera, (and even species {{in the case of}} cumulus congestus) using satellite photography.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nimbostratus</b> virga {{is a form}} of <b>Nimbostratus</b> {{cloud in}} which the {{precipitation}} never reaches the ground. It retains the same features as a normal <b>nimbostratus</b> cloud; dark in appearance, low to medium level cloud of moderate vertical development and made up of sheets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nimbostratus</b> pannus is an {{accessory}} cloud of <b>nimbostratus</b> that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nimbostratus</b> occurs along a {{warm front}} or {{occluded}} front where the slowly rising warm air mass creates <b>nimbostratus</b> along with shallower stratus clouds producing less rain, these clouds being preceded by higher-level clouds such as cirrostratus and altostratus. Often, when an altostratus cloud thickens and descends into lower altitudes, {{it will become}} <b>nimbostratus.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Nimbostratus,</b> unlike cumulonimbus, is not {{associated}} with thunderstorms, however at an unusually unstable warm front caused {{as a result of}} the advancing warm air being hot, humid and unstable, cumulonimbus clouds may be embedded within the usual <b>nimbostratus.</b> Lightning from an embedded cumulonimbus cloud may interact with the <b>nimbostratus</b> but only in the immediate area around it. In this situation with lightning and rain occurring it would be hard to tell which type of cloud was producing the rain from the ground, however cumulonimbus tend to produce larger droplets and more intense downpours. The occurrence of cumulonimbus and <b>nimbostratus</b> together is uncommon, and usually only <b>nimbostratus</b> is found at a warm front.|$|E
5000|$|Downward-growing <b>nimbostratus</b> {{can have}} the same {{vertical}} extent as most large upward-growing cumulus, but its horizontal extent tends to be even greater. This sometimes leads {{to the exclusion of}} <b>nimbostratus</b> from the group of vertical clouds by some independent meteorologists and educators. Classifications that follow this approach usually show <b>nimbostratus</b> as low-level [...] based on its normal base height range.|$|E
50|$|Fractonimbus are {{a form of}} stratus fractus, {{developing}} under precipitation clouds due to {{turbulent air}} movement. They are dark-gray and ragged in appearance. Fractonimbus exist only under precipitation clouds (such as <b>nimbostratus,</b> altostratus or cumulonimbus), and don't produce precipitation themselves. Fractonimbus may eventually merge completely with overlying <b>nimbostratus</b> clouds.|$|E
50|$|Usually, <b>nimbostratus</b> {{is a sign}} of easily steady to {{powerful}} precipitation, {{as opposed}} to the shorter period of typically heavier precipitation released by a cumulonimbus cloud. However, precipitation does not occur at ground level in case of virga and accompanies other cloud types. Precipitation may last for several days, depending on the speed of the warm or occluded front it accompanies. A <b>nimbostratus</b> virga cloud is the same as a normal <b>nimbostratus</b> cloud, but the precipitation is virga and it never reaches the ground. Stratus or stratocumulus (comprising the warm sector of a frontal system) usually forms when it clears.|$|E
50|$|Mutatus mother clouds: <b>Nimbostratus</b> {{can form}} {{due to the}} {{complete}} transformation of altocumulus, altostratus and stratocumulus.|$|E
50|$|Mutatus mother clouds: Altocumulus {{can form}} {{due to the}} {{complete}} transformation of cirrocumulus, altostratus, <b>nimbostratus,</b> or stratocumulus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nimbostratus</b> is a {{stratiform}} genus formerly {{classified as}} [...] "Family C" [...] low-level, but now {{considered by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to be a middle- or multi-level stratus type.. Although it is usually a low-based cloud, it actually forms most commonly in the middle level of the troposphere and then spreads vertically into the low and high levels. This change in classification would once have made it a [...] "Family D" [...] cloud, but this style of nomenclature was discontinued by the WMO in 1956. <b>Nimbostratus</b> usually produces precipitation over a wide area. Nimbo- is from the Latin word nimbus, which denotes precipitation. It has a diffuse cloud base generally found anywhere from near surface in the low levels to about 3000 m in the middle level of the troposphere. Although usually dark at its base, it often appears illuminated from within to a surface observer. [...] <b>Nimbostratus</b> usually has a thickness of about 2000 m. Though found worldwide, <b>nimbostratus</b> occurs more commonly in the middle latitudes. [...] It is coded CM2 on the SYNOP report.|$|E
50|$|Species and varieties: <b>Nimbostratus</b> is very thick, opaque, and featureless, so this genus type is not {{subdivided}} into species or varieties.|$|E

50|$|Curtis Roads {{suggests}} a taxonomy of cloud morphology based on atmospheric clouds: cumulus, stratocumulus, stratus, <b>nimbostratus,</b> and cirrus; {{as well as}} nebulae: dark or glowing, amorphus or ring-shaped, and constantly evolving.|$|E
