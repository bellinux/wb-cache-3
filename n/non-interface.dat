40|$|When {{a protein}} binds to DNA, a {{conformational}} change is often induced {{so that the}} protein will fit into the DNA structure. Therefore, quantitative {{analyses were conducted to}} understand the conformational changes in proteins. The results showed that conformational changes in DNA interfaces are more frequent than in <b>non-interfaces,</b> and DNA interfaces have more conformational variations in the DNA-free form. As expected, the former indicates that interaction with DNA has some influence on protein structure. The latter suggests that the intrinsic conformational flexibility of DNA interfaces is important for adjusting their conformation for DNA. The amino acid propensities of the conformationally changed regions in DNA interfaces indicate that hydrophilic residues are preferred over the amino acids that appear in the conformationally unchanged regions. This trend is true for disordered regions, suggesting again that intrinsic flexibility is of importance not only for DNA binding but also for interactions with other molecules. These results demonstrate that fragments destined to be DNA interfaces have an intrinsic flexibility and are composed of amino acids with the capability of binding to DNA.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{interactions}} play a {{key role}} in life processes. Characterization of conformational properties of protein-protein interactions is important for understanding the mechanisms of protein association. The rapidly increasing amount of experimentally determined structures of proteins and protein-protein complexes provides foundation for research on protein interactions and complex formation. The knowledge of the conformations of the surface side chains is essential for modeling of protein complexes. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare dihedral angle distribution functions of the side chains at the interface and <b>non-interface</b> areas in bound and unbound proteins. Results To calculate the dihedral angle distribution functions, the configuration space was divided into grid cells. Statistical analysis showed that the similarity between bound and unbound interface and <b>non-interface</b> surface depends on the amino acid type and the grid resolution. The correlation coefficients between the distribution functions increased with the grid spacing increase for all amino acid types. The Manhattan distance showing the degree of dissimilarity between the distribution functions decreased accordingly. Short residues with one or two dihedral angles had higher correlations and smaller Manhattan distances than the longer residues. Met and Arg had the slowest growth of the correlation coefficient with the grid spacing increase. The correlations between the interface and <b>non-interface</b> distribution functions had a similar dependence on the grid resolution in both bound and unbound states. The interface and <b>non-interface</b> differences between bound and unbound distribution functions, caused by biological protein-protein interactions or crystal contacts, disappeared at the 70 ° grid spacing for interfaces and 30 ° for <b>non-interface</b> surface, which agrees with an average span of the side-chain rotamers. Conclusions The two-fold difference in the critical grid spacing indicates larger conformational changes upon binding at the interface than at the rest of the surface. At the same time, transitions between rotamers induced by interactions across the interface or the crystal packing are rare, with most side chains having local readjustments that do not change the rotameric state. The analysis is important for better understanding of protein interactions and development of flexible docking approaches. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate seroprevalence and risk factors for Brucella species infection in cattle and some wildlife species in communities living at the periphery of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area in south eastern Zimbabwe. Three study sites were selected based on the type of livestock–wildlife interface: porous livestock–wildlife interface (unrestricted); non-porous livestock–wildlife interface (restricted by fencing); and livestock–wildlife <b>non-interface</b> (totally absent or control). Sera were collected from cattle aged ≥ 2 years representing both female and intact male animals. Sera were also collected from selected wild ungulates from Mabalauta (porous interface) and Chipinda (<b>non-interface)</b> areas of the Gonarezhou National Park. Samples were screened for Brucellaantibodies using the Rose Bengal plate test and confirmed by the complement fixation test. Data were analysed by descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression modelling. In cattle, brucellosis seroprevalence from all areas was 16. 7 % (169 / 1011; 95 % CI: 14. 5 – 19. 2 %). The porous interface recorded a significantly (p = 0. 03) higher seroprevalence (19. 5 %; 95 % CI: 16. 1 – 23. 4 %) compared to the <b>non-interface</b> area (13. 0 %; 95 % CI: 9. 2 – 19. 9 %). The odds of Brucellaseropositivity increased progressively with parity of animals and were also three times higher (OR = 3. 0, 2. 0 < OR < 4. 6, p < 0. 0001) in cows with history of abortion compared to those without. Brucella antibodies were detected in buffaloes; 20. 7 % (95 % CI: 13. 9 – 29. 7 %) form both study sites, but no antibodies were detected from impalas and kudus. These results highlight the importance of porous interface in the interspecies transmission of Brucella species and that independent infections may be maintained in buffalo populations. Thus, brucellosis control aimed at limiting animal inter-species mixing may help reduce the risk of human brucellosis in interface areas. Further studies should aim at establishing subspecies identity and direction of possible transmission of brucellosis between wildlife and livestock. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

We start with a comparison of interfaces with protein cores and noninterface surfaces. The results show that interfaces differ from protein cores and <b>non-interface</b> surfaces in residue composition, sequence entropy, and secondary structure. Since interfaces, protein cores, and <b>non-interface</b> surfaces have different solvent accessibilities, {{it is important to}} investigate whether the observed differences are due to the differences in solvent accessibility or differences in functionality. We separate out the effect of solvent accessibility by comparing interfaces with a set of residues having the same solvent accessibility as the interfaces. This strategy reveals residue distribution propensities that are not observable by comparing interfaces with protein cores and noninterface surfaces. Our conclusions are that there are larger numbers of hydrophobic residues, particularly aromatic residues, in interfaces, and the interactions apparently favored in interfaces include the opposite charge pairs and hydrophobic pairs. Surprisingly, Pro-Trp pairs are over represented in interfaces, presumably because of favorable geometries.

Respondents randomly selected from a list of potential cattle farmers (N = 379) distributed at porous (40 · 1 %), <b>non-interface</b> (35 · 5 %) and non-porous (26 · 4 %), were interviewed using a combined close- and open-ended questionnaire. Focus group discussions were conducted with 10 – 12 members of each community. More abortions in the last 5 years were reported from the porous interface (52 %) and a significantly higher per cent of respondents from the porous interface (P < 0 · 05) perceived wildlife as playing a role in livestock abortions compared with the other interface types. The odds of reporting abortions in cattle were higher in large herd sizes (odds ratio (OR) = 2 · 6; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1 · 5 – 4 · 3), porous (OR = 1 · 9; 95 % CI 1 · 0 – 3 · 5) and non-porous interface (OR = 2 · 2; 95 % CI 1 · 1 – 4 · 3) compared with livestock–wildlife <b>non-interface</b> areas. About 21 · 6 % of the respondents knew brucellosis as a cause of abortion, compared with RVF (9 · 8 %) and leptospirosis (3 · 7 %). These results explain to some extent, the existence of human/wildlife conflict in the studied livestock–wildlife interface areas of Zimbabwe, which militates against biodiversity conservation efforts. The low awareness of zoonoses means the public is at risk of contracting some of these infections. Thus, further studies should focus on livestock–wildlife interface areas to assess if the increased rates of abortions reported in cattle may be due to exposure to wildlife or other factors. The government of Zimbabwe needs to launch educational programmes on public health awareness in these remote areas at the periphery of transfrontier conservation areas where livestock–wildlife interface exists to help mitigate the morbidity and mortality.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 One very {{challenging}} aspect of developing HIV vaccines and therapies is {{to overcome the}} high evolutionary rate and consequent sequence diversity of the virus. HIV is notorious for rapidly acquiring drug resistant and immune escape mutations, which allow the virus to survive and persist against antiviral drug suppression and host immune responses. I hypothesized that functionally and structurally conserved elements of the viral proteome with little-to-no tolerance to mutations would be good candidates for targets of vaccine-induced responses and antiretroviral drugs. To identify such regions in the HIV- 1 capsid protein, I analyzed data from 5000 HIV capsid sequences from Genbank and the Los Alamos HIV sequence database to estimate sequence conservation and mutation frequencies. The structural location for each amino acid residue was determined based on the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the hexameric form of the capsid protein (the major morphological subunit of the mature HIV- 1 capsid). In vitro pairwise growth competition assays were then carried out to determine the relative fitness cost {{of the most frequently}} observed mutations at capsid hexamerization interface sites and <b>non-interface</b> sites. Only a weak relationship between sequence conservation and the relative fitness was detected. On the other hand, the most frequently observed mutations at interface sites had larger fitness costs than the mutations at the <b>non-interface</b> sites, suggesting that interface sites are could be suitable targets for HIV vaccines and therapies. In addition to protein interface sites, I used homology protein modeling and two protein stability prediction methods to investigate links between changes in protein stability and the impact of mutations in the capsid protein on viral replication. I found that mutations predicted to induce large alterations in the dimerization of or the structural stability of the CA hexamer were far less likely {{to be found in the}} HIV sequence database than those not predicted to alter stability. Destabilizing mutations were also associated with deleterious phenotypes. Compared to mutation frequency, predicted protein stability was a better classifier of deleterious and non-deleterious mutations. However, a newly derived simple composite score, which takes into account both mutation frequency and the proteins stability score, performed better than both protein staibilty and mutation frequency alone. These results suggest that both sequence conservation and in silico structural stability should be used to identify potentially inactivating mutations. Utilizing optimized in vitro pairwise growth competition assays and in silico mutation and protein stability predictions, along with sequence conservation, I identified potentially important sites in the HIV- 1 capsid protein that warrant further investigation as candidates for drug and CTL vaccine targets...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{coupling}} of boundary element and finite element methods and {{its application to}} analyze bridges are studied for the first time. The coupling technique is implemented to analyze slab on girders and box girder bridges. The boundary element method is employed to model the bridge deck while the finite element method is used to model the girders. The finite elements and boundary elements are connected {{at a number of}} interface nodes in the longitudinal direction. For the finite element region, a static condensation technique is applied to condense the <b>non-interface</b> degrees of freedom. Then the finite element equations are transformed into boundary element equations and the compatibility interface mechanism required to combine the two methods is developed. A computer program which combines boundary element and finite element methods in one solution is developed in this thesis. Different types of bridges with different load cases are considered in the study in order to test the performance of the combined method. It has been shown that the results obtained by the combined method (BEM-FEM) are in good agreement with the finite strip solution. The numerical examples, considered in this thesis, demonstrated the accuracy of the results and the simplicity and reduction of the input data...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} research {{deals with}} the development of a dynamic analysis method for structural systems. The modeling approach is essentially a finite element method {{in the sense that the}} structure is divided into n elements. An element is defined as any structural unit whose degree of freedom (dofs) can be categorized as either interface or <b>non-interface</b> dofs. An element could be a fundamental unit such as a rod, a beam, a plate etc., or it could be an entire structural component. Furthermore, the parameters for the element could be distributed or lumped. The choice of elements is totally arbitrary and is a matter of user convenience. In particular, issues of accuracy and convergence do not enter on the level of example that bookkeeping is reduced to a minimum. Each element is modeled using a set of interface constraint modes (ICM) combined with a set of interface restrained normal models (IRNM). The next step is the solution of the system eigenvalue problem. The procedure calls for the sequential solution of a number of small eigenvalue problems based on a truncation principle for IRNM. In addition, the form of these eigenvalue problems is very simple such that an escalator type of eigenvalue problem solver can be used which is extremely cost-effective and fast...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown L 1 attrition to be selective (Gürel 2004) and often restricted to structures at the interfaces between syntax and context/pragmatics, but not to occur with syntactic properties that do not involve such interfaces (Interface Hypothesis, Sorace & Filiaci 2006). This is supported by many studies exploring cross-linguistic influence effects in interface structures, such as the production and/or interpretation of null versus overt pronominal subjects, not only in L 1 attriters (Tsimpli et al. 2004, Montrul 2004) but also in other bilingual groups with different language combinations, such as early bilinguals (Paradis & Navarro 2003, Sorace et al. 2009), and advanced late bilinguals (Belletti et al. 2007, Rothman 2009). The current hypothesis is that individual L 1 attrition affects only the ability to process interface structures but not knowledge representations themselves (Sorace 2011). In this thesis, we first compared a well-studied syntax-pragmatics interface phenomenon (pronominal subjects in Spanish) with a <b>non-interface</b> structure (the Spanish personal preposition a, also known as Differential Object Marking, DOM). In Spanish, the distribution of null and overt subject pronouns is pragmatically constrained, whereas {{the presence of the}} preposition just depends on the animacy and specificity of the direct object. Participants included a group of attrited speakers of L 1 Spanish who had been living in the UK for a minimum of 5 years, and a group of Spanish monolinguals. Using a naturalness judgment task and eye tracking while reading, participants were presented with anaphoric sentences in which number cues matched or mismatched predicted antecedent preferences (i. e. null pronoun: subject preference; overt pronoun: object preference). The DOM study also used a mismatch paradigm, crossing preposition presence (al vs. el) with animacy, where an animate object requires the prepositional form al and an inanimate object requires the article el. Offline ratings revealed equal mismatch sensitivity for both groups of participants with both structures. However, eye-tracking measures showed that monolinguals were reliably more sensitive than attriters to the pronoun mismatch, while both groups showed equal on-line sensitivity to the DOM mismatch, which reveals that attrition affects interface structures, but not <b>non-interface</b> structures. Second, we investigated the effects of recent (re) exposure to L 1 input on attrition. A second group of attriters carried out the same experiment after having been exposed exclusively to Spanish in a monolingual Spanish-speaking environment for a minimum of a week. Their eye-tracking results patterned with the monolingual group. This novel manipulation shows that attrition effects decrease as a result of L 1 exposure, which reveals that bilinguals are sensitive to input changes and that attrition affects online sensitivity rather than causing a permanent change in speakers’ L 1 grammatical representations...|$|E
40|$|Protein-protein {{interface}} residues, {{especially those}} {{at the core of}} the interface, exhibit higher conservation than residues in solvent exposed regions. Here, we explore the ability of this differential conservation to evaluate fittings of atomic models in low-resolution cryo-EM maps and select models from the ensemble of solutions that are often proposed by different model fitting techniques. As a prelude, using a non-redundant and high-resolution structural dataset involving 125 permanent and 95 transient complexes, we confirm that core interface residues are conserved significantly better than nearby <b>non-interface</b> residues and this result is used in the cryo-EM map analysis. From the analysis of inter-component interfaces in a set of fitted models associated with low-resolution cryo-EM maps of ribosomes, chaperones and proteasomes we note that a few poorly conserved residues occur at interfaces. Interestingly a few conserved residues are not in the interface, though they are close to the interface. These observations raise the potential requirement of refitting the models in the cryo-EM maps. We show that sampling an ensemble of models and selection of models with high residue conservation at the interface and in good agreement with the density helps in improving the accuracy of the fit. This study indicates that evolutionary information can serve as an additional input to improve and validate fitting of atomic models in cryo-EM density maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Motivation: Identification {{of protein}} {{interaction}} sites has {{significant impact on}} understanding protein function, elucidating signal transduction networks, and drug design studies. With the exponentially growing protein sequence data, predictive methods using sequence information only for protein interaction site prediction have drawn increasing interest. In this paper, we propose a predictive model for identifying protein interaction sites. Without using any structure data, the proposed method extracts {{a wide range of}} features from protein sequences. A random forest-based integrative model is developed to effectively utilize these features and to deal with the imbalanced data classification problem commonly encountered in binding site predictions. Results: We evaluate the predictive method using 2, 829 interface residues and 24, 616 <b>non-interface</b> residues extracted from 99 polypeptide chains in the Protein Data Bank. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than two other sequence-based predictive methods and can reliably predict residues involved in protein interaction sites. Furthermore, we apply the method to predict interaction sites and to construct three protein complexes: the DnaK molecular chaperone system, 1 YUW and 1 DKG, which provide new insight into the sequence-function relationship. We show that the predicted interaction sites can be valuable as a first approach for guiding experimental methods investigating protein-protein interactions and localizing the specific interface residues.
