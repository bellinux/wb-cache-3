50|$|A {{short circuit}} fault current can, within milliseconds, be {{thousands}} of {{times larger than the}} <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> of the system. Damage from short circuits can be reduced or prevented by employing fuses, circuit breakers, or other overload protection, which disconnect the power in reaction to excessive current. Overload protection must be chosen according to the current rating of the circuit. Circuits for large home appliances require protective devices set or rated for higher currents than lighting circuits. Wire gauges specified in building and electrical codes are chosen to ensure safe operation in conjunction with the overload protection. An overcurrent protection device must be rated to safely interrupt the maximum prospective short circuit current.|$|E

40|$|Emergency {{ratings have}} been {{introduced}} for operating transmission lines safely and supplying current capacity efficiently, as well as controlling load flow when occurring line faults. In this paper, short-term emergency ratings are calculated by using thermal equilibrium equation for bared conductors in double-circuit transmission lines. Overhead transmission lines installed in double-circuit have been extensively utilized worldwide to enhance power transmission. Such lines show various advantages in increasing transmission capacity and decreasing power loss {{as well as being}} operated flexibly during a contingency. Even when a fault occurs in one circuit, the healthy circuit can supply power continuously during emergency without outage. The utilization of such double-circuit transmission lines during normal and/or emergency operations is described. Maximum <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> based on fault duration, maximum allowable temperature of conductor, and thermal line ratings are evaluated. Several performances of dip/clearance affecting short-term emergency rating are also presented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMaintaining proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack operating temperature across transient current profiles presents a significant challenge for fuel cell vehicles. Liquid cooled systems require active control of coolant temperature and flow rate to match heat rejection to heat generation. Evaporative cooling {{is an alternative}} to conventional liquid cooling in automotive sized PEMFC stacks. In an evaporatively cooled system, liquid water is injected directly into the cathode flow channels where it evaporates, both cooling and humidifying the stack. This paper uses a validated simulation to explore the inherent temperature regulation abilities of an evaporatively cooled PEMFC stack {{across a range of}} current profiles and drive cycles. Results show that throughout the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> range, stack temperature varies by less than ±  2. 0  °C, this is comparable to liquid cooling but without the need for active temperature control. The introduction of variable operating pressure and cathode stoichiometry using proportional integral control, can further reduce temperature variation to ±  1. 0  °C and ± 1. 2  °C respectively for step increases in current demand.

The thermal resistance analysis model was applied in research the heat transfer process of the microelectronic chip cooling system and its characteristics. The results show that: When the {{thermoelectric cooling}} (TEC) system is in <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> condition,the Peltier effect is the dominant role in the thermoelectric cooling process despite the opposite actions of the Joule and Fourier effects. The thermal resistance of TEC, which is 2 θ, decreases when the <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> (I) increases. For the different chip power, there is an optimum current (opt I) making the interface thermal resistance between chip and TEC minimum (1 θ). 1 θ can obtain the minimum 0. 465 ℃·W- 1 when the chip power is 25 W and opt I is 2. 4 A.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} for any solar-to-hydrogen {{conversion process}} {{is particularly important}} because an area of land must be covered to collect the sunlight. Any efficiency losses in the system must be made up {{by an increase in}} the collector area. This will ultimately {{have a significant impact on}} the overall cost and siting ability of such a system. Section one of this report will explore the efficiency gains from a direct conversion system as compared to a separated PV/electrolysis system. Section two will discuss our results looking at the catalysis of hydrogen production on semiconductor electrodes. EFFICIENCY OF PEC SYSTEMS The energy efficiency of electrolysis can generally be defined as the chemical potential of hydrogen divided by the voltage required for electrolysis operation [1]. At the <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>current</b> density of commercial electrolyzers (~ 1 A/cm 2), this voltage ranges from 1. 8 — 2. 0 volts. Thus, an electrolyzer operating at 1. 9 volts operates with an energy efficiency of 65 % (1. 23 / 1. 9). Combining this electrolysis efficiency with a 12 % PV array efficiency gives a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 7. 8 %. To increase the overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, the energy efficiency o...|$|E
