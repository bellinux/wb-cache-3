5000|$|In July 2006, the United States Congress amended U.S. law to {{accommodate}} civilian <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade</b> with India. A meeting of NSG participating governments on 21-22 August 2008 on an India-specific exemption to the Guidelines was inconclusive. Several participating governments, including Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Ireland, and New Zealand, expressed {{reservations about the}} lack of conditions in the proposed exemption. In another meeting on 6 September 2008, the NSG participating governments agreed to grant India a [...] "clean waiver" [...] from its existing rules, which forbid <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade</b> with a country which has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The NSG's decision came after three days of intense U.S. diplomacy. The approval was based on a formal pledge by India stating that it would not share sensitive nuclear technology or material with others and would uphold its voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons. The pledge was contained in a crucial statement issued during the NSG meeting by India outlining the country's disarmament and nonproliferation policies.|$|E

40|$|In three {{important}} areas of international cooperation—global <b>trade,</b> <b>nuclear</b> security, and cli-mate change—states are shifting away from inclusive multilateralism toward more exclusion-ary forms of interstate cooperation. In this article, we offer a historical institutionalist {{account of this}} change. We propose that the maturation of the existing multilateral regimes changed the payoff structure, creating incentives for states to establish alternative institutions centered {{on the principles of}} selective and discriminatory cooperation. Our findings suggest that the growth in exclusive forms of cooperation in <b>trade,</b> <b>nuclear</b> nonproliferation, and climate change should not be considered aberrations but are rather part of a process of regime maturation...|$|R

50|$|While India {{continued}} {{to state that}} the test was for peaceful purposes, it encountered opposition from many quarters. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was formed {{in reaction to the}} Indian tests to check international nuclear proliferation. The NSG decided in 1992 to require full-scope IAEA safeguards for any new nuclear export deals, which effectively ruled out nuclear exports to India, but in 2008 it waived this restriction on <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade</b> with India as part of the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement.|$|E

40|$|India and Pakistan both faced {{widespread}} international condemnation {{following their}} 1998 nuclear tests. Today {{the two countries}} stand apart in the global nuclear order. Pakistan remains a nuclear outsider, while India has been labelled a responsible nuclear state and permitted access to exceptional civil <b>nuclear</b> <b>trading</b> rights. This article offers {{an explanation for the}} divergent international responses to India and Pakistan’s decision to become nuclear-armed states. Rather than presenting a materialist explanation for the differing responses of the international community in terms of geopolitical, strategic and economic factors, or a normative approach that focuses on shifting conceptions of India and Pakistan’s identities as political systems, we focus instead on changes in individual and collective perceptions of India’s trustworthiness. At the base of the starkly contrasting response to a nuclear India and a nuclear Pakistan, we argue, is an assessment that India can be trusted with nuclear weapons, while Pakistan cannot. We show how India made the journey from nuclear rogue to nuclear partner and demonstrate where Pakistan fell short. We conclude with some reflections on perhaps the most important question that can be asked of states and leaders in the nuclear age: who can be trusted with the possession of nuclear weapons...|$|R
50|$|On 1 August 2008, the IAEA {{approved}} the India Safeguards Agreement and on 6 September 2008, India was granted the waiver at the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) meeting held in Vienna, Austria.

While India could commence <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade</b> with other willing countries. The U.S. Congress approved this agreement and President Bush signed it on 8 October 2008.|$|E
50|$|India's {{domestic}} uranium {{reserves are}} small {{and the country is}} dependent on uranium imports to fuel its nuclear power industry. Since early 1990s, Russia has been a major supplier of nuclear fuel to India. Due to dwindling domestic uranium reserves, electricity generation from nuclear power in India declined by 12.83% from 2006 to 2008. Following a waiver from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in September 2008 which allowed it to commence international <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade,</b> India has signed bilateral deals on civilian nuclear energy technology cooperation with several other countries, including France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada. and South Korea. India has also uranium supply agreements with Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Argentina and Namibia. An Indian private company won a uranium exploration contract in Niger.|$|E

A group of seven NSG members suggested including some of the provisions of the U.S. Hyde Act in the final waiver. Daryll Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, said the NSG should at a minimum [...] "make clear that <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade</b> with India shall be terminated if it resumes testing for any reason. If India cannot agree to such terms, it suggests that India is not serious about its nuclear test moratorium pledge." ...|$|E

50|$|The United States and India {{signed a}} major nuclear {{co-operation}} agreement {{during a visit}} by United States President George W. Bush in March 2006. According to the nuclear deal, the United States was to give India access to civilian nuclear technology while India agreed to greater scrutiny for its nuclear programme. Later United States approved a controversial law allowing India to buy their nuclear reactors and fuel {{for the first time}} in 30 years. In July 2008, the United Progressive Alliance survived a vote of confidence brought after left-wing parties withdrew their support over the nuclear deal. After the vote, several left-wing and regional parties formed a new alliance to oppose the government, saying it had been tainted by corruption. Within three months, following approval by the U.S. Congress, George W. Bush signed into law a nuclear deal with India, which ended a three-decade ban on American <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade</b> with Delhi.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 January 2013, the Prime Minister of India conferred on him the Lifetime Achievement Award for {{the year}} 2011 for his {{outstanding}} contributions {{in the field of}} nuclear engineering, towards national initiative to open international civil <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade,</b> further development of framework for governance of nuclear power and human resource development. The citation for the award stated, [...] "During a career spanning four decades, Dr. Grover has distinguished himself as an academic, research and development engineer and a science administrator. His knowledge of nuclear engineering and nuclear law has earned him the title 'nuclear diplomat'." [...] Citation says, [...] " [...] He played maximum role in all steps taken by the Government of India towards opening international civil nuclear trade." [...] Citation also acknowledges his role during negotiations in 2005 aimed at India joining ITER and he has been leading the Indian delegation to ITER Council since its inception.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, the agreement, as {{a result}} of its {{compliance}} with the Hyde Act, contained a direct linkage between shutting down US <b>nuclear</b> <b>trade</b> with India and any potential future Indian nuclear weapons test, a point that was factually inconsistent with explicit reassurances made on this subject by Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, during final parliamentary debate on the nuclear deal. As professor Brahma Chellaney, an expert in strategic affairs and one of the authors of the Indian Nuclear Doctrine, explained:While the Hyde Act’s bar on Indian testing is explicit, the one in the NSG waiver is implicit, yet unmistakable. The NSG waiver is overtly anchored in NSG Guidelines Paragraph 16, which deals with the consequence of “an explosion of a nuclear device”. The waiver’s Section 3(e) refers to this key paragraph, which allows a supplier to call for a special NSG meeting, and seek termination of cooperation, in the event of a test or any other “violation of a supplier-recipient understanding”. The recently leaked Bush administration letter to Congress has cited how this Paragraph 16 rule will effectively bind India to the Hyde Act's conditions on the pain of a U.S.-sponsored cut-off of all multilateral cooperation. India will not be able to escape from the U.S.-set conditions by turning to other suppliers.|$|E
