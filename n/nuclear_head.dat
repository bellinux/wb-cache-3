40|$|This study proposes an {{effective}} method to inspect inaccessible <b>nuclear</b> power reactor <b>head</b> nozzles using interface waves that propagate along the shrink fit boundary of a reactor head. The reactor head is relatively thick, {{which makes it}} difficult to inspect from the outside by conventional ultrasonic testing. However, interface waves can propagate a long distance from a fixed transducer position. The inside of the nuclear reactor has limited access due to the high radiation, so the transducers are located outside the <b>nuclear</b> reactor <b>head,</b> and interface waves propagate into the nuclear reactor to detect defects. A numerical simulation and experiments were carried out to validate the method. Various defect cases that simulate field failures are also presented, and the proposed technique shows satisfactory defect classification...|$|R

40|$|Bull {{spermatozoa}} {{heads were}} separated from cytoplasmic contaminants, especially mitochondria-rich middle pieces, by centrifugation through 2. 4 M-sucrose. DNA polymerase activity was demonstrated by incubating <b>nuclear</b> <b>heads</b> for 1 h at 37 degrees C or for 20 h {{at room temperature}} in a medium containing detergent and dithiothreitol or 2 -mercaptoethanol. Optimal DNA polymerase activity was detected after extraction in a medium containing 50 mM-borate, pH 9, 1 mg of soya-bean trypsin inhibitor/ml and supplemented with either 20 mM-dithiothreitol and 4 % Tween 80 or 100 mM- 2 -mercaptoethanol and 10 % Tween 80. The DNA polymerase reaction was Mg 2 +-dependent; Mn 2 + or Ca 2 + could not replace Mg 2 + and all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates were required for optimal activity. The polymerase activity was pH-dependent (optimum between 8. 2 and 10. 5) and was a function of buffer composition and also of pH values. Optimal activity was obtained with 50 mM-Na+ or 150 mM-K+ and was partially lowered by N-ethylmaleimide; it was inhibited by spermidine and by salmon protamines, but was greatly stimulated by calf thymus histones. It was also resistant to actinomycin D, netropsin and ethidium bromide. The present results suggest that bull spermatozoa heads contain a beta-type DNA polymerase activity...|$|R

40|$|The 60 -kDa {{heat shock}} protein family (Hsp 60) is found in prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. The Hsp 60 {{proteins}} promote proper protein folding by preventing aggregation. In Drosophila melanogaster, the hsp 60 gene is essential {{for a variety of}} developmental processes, beginning at early embryogenesis. In this study we show that an additional member of the Drosophila hsp 60 gene family, hsp 60 B, is essential in male fertility. In males homozygous for a mutation of the hsp 60 B gene, developmental processes appeared normal throughout most of spermatogenesis, including spermatocyte growth, meiosis, and spermatid elongation. At these stages, mitochondria also displayed a differentiation process similar to wild-types. However, we found that the mutation disrupted a late stage of spermatogenesis, the spermatid individualization process. In this process, the individualization complex is assembled at spermatid <b>nuclear</b> <b>heads,</b> traverses along spermatid tails, and generates membranes for each of the spermatids in a cyst. Our analysis further shows that the individualization complex in sterile males displayed abnormal morphology as it was traveling along the spermatid tails. The Drosophila Hsp 60 proteins are believed to be exclusively localized in the mitochondria. Our observation that the hsp 60 B mutation displayed no apparent defect in mitochondrial differentiation during spermatogenesis suggests that the Hsp 60 B protein may operate in a nonmitochondrial location...|$|R
