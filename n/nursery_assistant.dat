40|$|This {{article is}} part of a {{comprehensive}} research on community nurseries in the city of Fortaleza. It represents the analysis of recorded questionnaires applied to 25 <b>nursery</b> <b>assistants</b> and 48 customer families. The assistants demonstrate some prejudice, besides lack of information about the children and families under their care, due to a generally short (or absence of) period of training and professional formation. The families also have neither education and political conditions nor information to property analyze the service available in the nurseries. Furthermore, both groups seem to be in need for better parameters of social care and assistance, assuming this service as a gift or a privilege beyond criticism. The work unveils the absence of adequate structure to offer good services in these institutions. Finally, it reinforces the urging need for democratization of information about the real and specific needs of early childhood. This information should be directed to NGOs, families and other groups interested in these problems, in order to help them in the search and discussion of strategies and solutions for nursery services...|$|R

50|$|In Northern Ireland funded Nursery School places can {{be applied}} for from ages 3 and up.Preschool {{education}} is delivered also by PreSchools, {{also referred to as}} Playschools or Playgroups. A Nursery School is allowed to enrol up to 26 children into a class, with the curriculum being delivered by a qualified teacher and a <b>Nursery</b> <b>Assistant.</b> A preschool, which delivers the same curriculum, is also permitted to admit a maximum of 26 children to any single session. However, the regulations for personnel differ. The Preschool must have a Supervisor with an NVQ 3 qualification in Child Care (or Equivalent). There must be one qualified and vetted adult for every 8 children. Funding is applied for through PEAGs (Preschool Education Advisory Group). Both nursery and preschool settings are inspected by the Education and Training Inspectorate. Preschools are also subject to inspection by local Social Services.|$|E

40|$|Children’s stubbornness is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} which is often present in the phase of their development. By being stubborn, the child expresses his reaction towards societal demands in his environment and shows his need to become independent {{as a response to}} the helplessness he feels towards those in a superior position. Because a child understands the worlds egocentrically, stubbornness can be a form of defiance towards the pressure of socialisation of his nature. Every child expresses stubbornness differently. We can identify many diverse forms of this phenomenon which occurs at different stages in a child’s development. In this thesis I investigate stubbornness through different scientific theories that have dealt with this phenomenon and its expression in children. According to the theory of Sigmund Freud, stubbornness is an expression of egocentrism, since children strive to be in the centre of attention and only gradually adjust their demands with the needs of the environment. The theory of psychosocial development explains stubbornness as a reflection of a child’s resistance due to the feelings of helplessness, which occur because of their growing awareness and consciousness, while physically the child is still clumsy and requires help and support of adults. From the point of view of behaviouristic theories, stubbornness is a reaction to the stimuli coming from the surrounding environment. The theory of social learning describes children’s behaviour as the result of social interactions based on rewards and punishments, as well as mimicking and observation. Jean Piaget’s work discovers that stubbornness in a child develops as a result of the wish to fulfil his or her needs, since the child is only gradually overcoming the egocentric phase and learns the social norms. Kohlberg’s theory explains the phenomenon of stubbornness as the outcome of a child’s imperfect understanding of what constitutes appropriate behaviour. According to Abraham Maslow on the other hand, it is possible to see it as a consequence of being spoiled. Furthermore, Carl Rogers interprets stubbornness as an expression of defiance of a child when he or she senses the lack of unconditional acceptance. By means of empirical research I also analyse how stubbornness is perceived by kindergarten/ nursery teachers (N= 47) and <b>nursery</b> <b>assistants</b> (N= 53) in kindergartens in both urban and rural areas. The analysis, which was undertaken through a questionnaire, disseminated to nine Slovenian kindergartens especially aims to identify how the teachers interpret and react to stubbornness in children. The analysis of results confirms that stubbornness is experienced and dealt with by all <b>nursery</b> teachers and <b>assistants.</b> On the other hand, some differences are observed regarding the interpretation and reaction to stubbornness among personnel working in urban and rural areas, as well as according to their working positions and work experience...|$|R

50|$|Under {{a law of}} August 1985 {{governing}} {{leave for}} training, retraining and reemployment, employers undertake to offer such leave to a specific number of wage-earners whose redundancy would have been authorised; during this period the workers concerned {{will be able to}} benefit from a number of activities organised to help them find new jobs. A law of January 1985 widened the scope of certain social provisions, including the encouragement of training work experience schemes for young people by setting up introductory apprenticeships and extending the fifth week of annual paid holiday to <b>nursery</b> school <b>assistants.</b> A law of July 1985, while increasing the number of cases in which a firm could use temporary workers and relaxing conditions regarding the duration of certain types of contracts, also introduced changes in the rules relating to the duration of probation periods and made it harder to re-employ temporary workers in the same job before a waiting period has expired, etc.|$|R
