5|$|Thulium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tm and atomic number 69. It is the thirteenth and third-last {{element in the}} lanthanide series. Like the other lanthanides, the most common oxidation state is +3, seen in its oxide, halides and other compounds; because it occurs so late in the series, however, the +2 oxidation state is also stabilized by the <b>nearly</b> <b>full</b> 4f shell that results. In aqueous solution, like compounds of other late lanthanides, soluble thulium compounds form coordination complexes with nine water molecules.|$|E

Subsidence and landslips have continued; the north-east tower largely collapsed in the 1950s, and further major slippages occurred in 1969, 1970, and 2002.

Chavanel took his first win since rejoining the team, and first in three years, at the Circuit de Lorraine, winning a <b>nearly</b> <b>full</b> field sprint. Kern took a strong win at the Critérium du Dauphiné, finishing alone 9 seconds clear of the main field full {{of some of the}} best climbers in the world, atop the short, steep climb at Les Gets. The team had been very active in the finale, with Rolland and Voeckler launching attacks in the run into the finish before Kern got clear. The team's performances on the race's last day got them the victory in the race's teams classification as well. Later in June, Turgot won the prologue time trial at the Boucles de la Mayenne, besting 's Alexander Wetterhall by less than a second. The squad won the team award at this race as well. Charteau showed his climbing prowess and cunning in stage 2 at the Route du Sud, outpacing 's Vasil Kiryienka to win alone on a Pyreneean hilltop in Cauterets. The team did not win any stage at the Tour du Poitou-Charentes, but they did win two jersey classifications, with Pichot taking the mountains classification and Gaudin the sprints.|$|E

25|$|The Polish People's Republic (1945-1989) {{was officially}} {{characterized}} by <b>nearly</b> <b>full</b> employment, not accounting for unofficial hidden unemployment. Following Poland's transformation from a communist to capitalist economy after the Revolutions of 1989, unemployment sharply increased from the officially reported 0% to 6.5% in 1990, peaking at 16.4% at 1993, and then decreasing to about 10.3% in 1997. The unemployment rate then begun rising again until 2002, reaching a zenith of almost 20% around that time. As Poland entered European Union in 2004 and its job market, mass emigration due to unemployment took place lowering the figure.

25|$|Perón {{created a}} {{political}} movement known as Peronism. He nationalized strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full external debt and achieved <b>nearly</b> <b>full</b> employment. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, Eva Perón, played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact women's suffrage in 1947, and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society. However, her declining health did not allow her {{to run for the}} vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Perón was reelected in 1951, even surpassing his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy bombed the Plaza de Mayo in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called Liberating Revolution coup, he resigned and went into exile in Spain.|$|E
25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} ARRA would positively impact GDP and employment, {{with primary}} impact between 2009 and 2011.

The impact to employment would be an increase of 0.8million to 2.3million by last-2009, an increase of 1.2million to 3.6million by late 2010, an increase of 0.6million to 1.9million by late 2011, and declining increases in subsequent years as the U.S. labor market reaches <b>nearly</b> <b>full</b> employment, but never negative. The CBO estimated that enacting the bill would increase federal budget deficits by $185 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, $399 billion in 2010, and $134 billion in 2011, or $787 billion over the 2009–2019 period.|$|E

This type of breast-strap harness became known in Central Asia and elsewhere with the Avars, Magyars, Bohemians, Poles, and Russians during the 7th to 10th centuries. After Central Asia, the first breast-strap harness was spread to Europe by the 8th century (in depicted artwork), and became more widespread by the following 9th century (for example, depicted in a tapestry of the Oseberg ship burial).|$|E
