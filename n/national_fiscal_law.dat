40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the general {{characteristics of a}} state’s fiscal jurisdiction and how they influence the process of interaction with other national tax jurisdictions. The paper figures out essential internal substance of fiscal jurisdiction and its reflection on the necessity of interstate fiscal cooperation. After considering this substance the thesis goes on to explore the limits beyond which national jurisdictions cannot go in collection of taxes. Absence of common bases of these limits leads to conflicts between national jurisdictions and calls for close international fiscal cooperation. The thesis argues {{that the process of}} cooperation becomes more evident. In summary the thesis states that today’s main characteristics of a state’s jurisdiction to tax do not comply with the necessity of effective administration of <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>law</b> in the integrated world. Thus, a particular fiscal jurisdiction needs another qualitative dimension, which can be achieved on the higher level of international systematic cooperation...|$|E

In the economic reality and in the rise of the tax fraud phenomenon, in the contemporary fiscal doctrine it is stated that the public desiderate of “loyal collaboration between the tax payer and the revenue agency” with the purpose of correctly setting taxes and tariffs and other required fund needed for creating public interest monetary funds. The economic, social and political globalization tendencies of the last decade have stimulated and supported actions relating to eluding the fiscal dispositions, actions which have moved more and more {{from the center of the}} national fiscal system towards the exterior, outside the field of action of the <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>law.</b> In this regard show that reducing fiscal evasion, allows the creation of budgetary resources, necessary for funds allocation for economical growth. In Romania, one of the basic economic problems is the lack of investment resources allocated, these being the main contributor to economic growth, in which the reduction of fraud and tax evasion is the solution to increase this allocation which can be rated as one of the priority tasks of the state. ...|$|E

40|$|The present EU {{budget is}} {{inconsistent}} with the current state and future prospects of European integration. Three failures are most evident: first, spending is heavily tilted towards {{the support of a}} declining sector, agriculture; second, {{it is almost impossible to}} reallocate spending across time and across policies; and third, its size is unrelated with the goals of the Union. Transforming the Community budget into a means through which the economic policy of the Union is consistently defined and put into practice requires correcting these failures. This can be done by moving towards a fully fledged 'European Budgetary System' in which the EU and national budgets pursue, in a co-ordinated manner, commonly-agreed objectives set in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. On a multi-annual basis, the EU Financial Perspectives and the national Stability and Convergence Programmes would be set within an aggregate European Budgetary Programme.

Therefore, <b>fiscal</b> <b>law</b> can constrain a Federal agency from the quickest, easiest, or cheapest way to accomplish its mission. This Constitutionally mandated {{oversight of the}} use of public funds is associated with the principle of checks and balances. A good working relationship and robust communication between the Executive and Legislative branches is the key to avoiding problems in this area.|$|R

40|$|The {{enhanced}} Stability and Growth Pact {{calls on}} euro area members and aspirants to set boundaries to fiscal deficits through high-level legislation. A {{limit on the}} deficit, such as the deficit ceiling in Bulgaria''s organic budget law, serves to protect solvency. The recent crisis clearly indicated that the key challenges are not only to contain the deficit but also to avoid a procyclical stance during upswings and to build a buffer for rainy days. Ideally, fiscal policymaking is guided by a fiscal rule that adapts through the economic cycle. This paper lays out the objectives of fiscal rules and analyzes how these objectives can be met in Bulgaria through either a growth-adjusted balance rule or an expenditure rule complemented by a deficit ceiling.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} multiple <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy- makers and a single monetary policy maker in response to shocks to govern- ment debt in {{some or all of}} the countries of a monetary union. We assume that national governments respond to excess debt in an optimal manner, but that they do not have access to a commitment technology. This implies that <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy gradually reduces debt: the lack of a commitment technology pre- cludes a random walk in steady state debt, but the need to maintain national competitiveness avoids excessively rapid debt reduction. If the central bank can commit, it adjusts its policies only slightly in response to higher debt, allowing <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy to undertake most of the adjustment. However if it cannot commit, then optimal monetary policy involves using interest rates to rapidly reduce debt, with significant welfare costs. We show that in these circumstances the central bank would do better to ignore <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies in formulating its policy. ...|$|R

This paper analyzes the stabilization of output fluctuations induced by symmetric and asymmetric macroeconomic shocks in the EMU. It is shown how <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> flexibility and flexibility of the monetary policy of the ECB can stabilize fluctuations of the average EU business cycle that are generated by symmetric shocks. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how, under EMU, <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> flexibility and a system of fiscal transfers are able to stabilize differences in national business cycles that are generated by asymmetric shocks...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} role of <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies, as {{automatic}} stabilizers, within a monetary union. We use a two-country New Keynesian DGE model which incorporates non-Ricardian consumers (as in Gal? et al. 2004) and a home bias {{in the composition of}} national consumption bundles. We find that fiscal policies stabilize the aggregate economy but, in some cases, generate conflicting views among national policymakers. Finally, model determinacy requires that <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> feedbacks on debt accumulation be designed with reference to the debt dynamics of the entire monetary union. This is in sharp contrast with the "Brussels consensus" based on the view that the ECB alone should stabilize the union-wide economy and <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies should react to idiosyncratic shocks and to national debt levels...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fiscal</b> Responsibility <b>Laws</b> (FRLs) {{appear to}} be more popular in middle-income {{countries}} than advanced countries, even though their success is limited. The reasons why few advanced countries have a FRL include: the existing legal framework for the budget system is adequate; supranational rules and political agreements in EU countries; failed attempts to include quantitative fiscal rules in laws; lack of consensus or interest in attaining the goals of FRL-type legislation; and lack of need for a <b>law</b> to regulate <b>fiscal</b> transparency, accountability and macro-fiscal stabilization. Without commitment to fiscal discipline, adoption of a FRL may not contribute to attaining fiscal consolidation goals.
