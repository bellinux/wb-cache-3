5|$|On 8 May 1947, Pilecki {{was arrested}} by agents of the Ministry of Public Security. Prior to trial, he was {{repeatedly}} tortured. The investigation of Pilecki's activities was supervised by Colonel Roman Romkowski. He was interrogated by Col. Józef Różański, and lieutenants S. Łyszkowski, W. Krawczyński, J. Kroszel, T. Słowianek, Eugeniusz Chimczak and S. Alaborski – men who were especially infamous for their savagery. But Pilecki sought to protect other prisoners and revealed <b>no</b> <b>sensitive</b> information.|$|E
500|$|The same evidences of {{mourning}} were seen along the levee. The Halliday Hotel the City National Bank {{and the gas}} office all bore crepe on their doors, while a number of buildings along the levee were draped in black and flags hung at half-mast.The funeral of the late Capt. Halliday {{was held at the}} Halliday Hotel Tuesday afternoon. [...] Long before two o’clock the crowds commenced to gather and when the services began the parlors and halfway were crowded with people and numbers could not get upstairs but waited in the office or outside on the street. Rev. F. A. DeRosset, rector of the Church of the Redeemer, conducted the last solemn rites and a quartette choir composed of Mr. Buchanan, Miss Lelia Miller, and Messrs. Buchanan and Tunnel sang several beautiful hymns. [...] The funeral address was delivered by Rev. C. T. Phillips, of Princeville, Ill., formerly pastor of the Presbyterian Church here. [...] Mr. Phillips was a close friend of the deceased, and it was the wish of Capt. Halliday that he might assist in the service. [...] Mr. Phillips spoke of the Captain’s kindness and generosity, how he rendered assistance to so many and did it in such a delicate way that <b>no</b> <b>sensitive</b> or proud natures were hurt. [...] He spoke of the Captain’s loyalty to Cairo. [...] How he aided the city in its struggle against the great floods; how he instructed the bank to cash all paper issued by the city in those dark days; how his fortune was ready to be used in protecting life and property here, and how his barges were always placed in readiness to be sunk opposite weak places in the levee. [...] He told of a conversation the Captain had with him in the panic days of 1892-’93, when banks were failing everywhere, in which the deceased said his entire fortune was ready to preserve the integrity of the bank here and to protect the businessmen from loss. [...] He told what a kind employer Capt. Halliday was, how a position with him was a life job if the employee did his work faithfully. [...] Mr. Phillips said he had known men at DuQuoin 21 years ago that were still in the service of Capt. Halliday. [...] He told how Capt. Halliday watched the careers of young men who were striving to get ahead in life, and how he helped them to get on by opening the way for them without ever letting them see his hand. [...] All this he told and more of the man whom he termed the best friend Cairo ever had.|$|E

60|$|How and in {{what way}} could he have told her? Leaving out the {{delicate}} and difficult periphrase by which her mother's shame {{would have to be}} explained to an innocent school-girl--what right could he have assumed to tell it? As the guardian who had never counseled or protected her? As an acquaintance of hardly an hour ago? Who would have such a right? A lover--on whose lips it would only seem a tacit appeal to her gratitude or her fears, and whom <b>no</b> <b>sensitive</b> girl could accept thereafter? No. A husband? Yes! He remembered, with a sudden start, what Pendleton had said to him. Good Heavens! Had Pendleton that idea in his mind? And yet--it seemed the only solution.|$|E

Had I been more familiar with the world, I should have thought nothing of a thing that was so common; or, did I understand human nature better, I might have known that <b>no</b> <b>sensitive</b> and delicate woman would betray a secret that was dear to her, under so idle a form. But I was young, and ready myself to toast the girl I preferred before the universe; and I could not make suitable allowances for difference of sex and temperament. Lucy's toast made me very uncomfortable {{for the rest of the}} evening; and I was not sorry when Rupert reminded me that it was eleven, and that he would go with me to a tavern, in order to look for a room.|$|E
