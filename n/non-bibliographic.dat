Some courts and advocates around the country have begun adopting Garner's recommended style of footnoted citations, and a surprising degree of internal strife has resulted within some organizations. For example, one appellate judge in Louisiana refused to join in a colleague's opinions written in the new format. Garner says that one of the main reasons for the reform is to make legal writing more comprehensible to readers who lack a legal education. But he has attracted vehement opposition, most notably from Judge Richard A. Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and from his co-author, Justice Antonin Scalia.|$|E

50|$|A {{full text}} {{database}} or a complete text database is a database {{that contains the}} complete text of books, dissertations, journals, magazines, newspapers or other kinds of textual documents. It is opposed both to a bibliographic database (only covering bibliographical information and possibly abstracts and thus being a partial text database) and to a <b>non-bibliographic</b> database (such as, for example, a directory or a numeric database).|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We did {{formative}} {{evaluations of}} several variations to the computation of related articles for <b>non-bibliographic</b> {{resources in the}} medical domain. METHODS: A binary model and several variations of the vector space model were used to measure similarity between documents. Two corpora were studied, using a human expert as the gold standard. RESULTS: Variations in term weights and stopword choices made little difference to performance. Performance was worse when documents were characterized by title words alone or by MeSH terms extracted from document references. DISCUSSION: Further {{studies are needed to}} evaluate these methods in medical information retrieval systems...|$|E

As an integrated system DOBIS has to consider the divergent requisitions of circulation and cataloguing. For catalogue output it makes available bibliographically correct descriptions of the entire periodical. For circulation it provides information concerning the single periodical volume and its <b>non-bibliographic</b> data, e. g. status and circulation conditions. The bibliographic description and the affiliated volumes are connected in the data base by sorted references. By this means {{it is possible to}} show on the screen a list of the volumes belonging to a periodical in inverse chronological order...|$|E

40|$|By imparting higher education, {{conducting}} research and interacting with individuals and institutions {{at different levels}} within and outside India, our universities have been major contributors to the generation and dissemination of knowledge. Being one of the significant contributions {{to the growth of}} knowledge, research work produced in the form of Ph. D. theses is the unique vital information sources. It is estimated that nearly 8000 - 10000 Ph. D. theses are produced every year by all the universities put together in India. Being a vital source of information, Ph. D theses have been attracting a great interest from academic and research communities in the country and abroad. INFLIBNET has therefore made an effort to collect, organise and make available this valuable information over the network. The Centre is also developing union bibliographic databases of Books, and Serials available in Indian Universities, and <b>non-bibliographic</b> databases of Indian Projects and Experts in various fields. All databases can be accessed through the websit...|$|E
40|$|Academic {{libraries}} can add {{quality to}} their services by going beyond standard bibliographic resources. In {{order to maintain}} relevance to the teaching and research missions of our institutions, libraries need to widen their range of information sources to include emerging data repositories. Bioinformatics provides a clear example of a discipline rich in freely available information that students and faculty can use to create new knowledge. Adding instruction in using key genetics databases to an existing suite of information literacy sessions allowed this librarian to expand his own subject knowledge, develop a productive collaboration with a faculty member and provide a high-quality, innovative learning experience for students. This session will place bioinformatics databases such as OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), and ExPASyâ€™s ProtParam (Protein Parameter) {{within the context of}} library reference and instruction. Critical aspects of each resource and the joys and pitfalls of learning and using them will be outlined as examples for effectively incorporating <b>non-bibliographic</b> resources into research assignments. Participants will be invited to contribute their own experiences with using similar tools...|$|E
40|$|The study {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a sample survey carried out using two sub-sample populations (Rural Communities and Information providers). The main objective of the study is to explore the Community Information Needs of rural communities in Sri Lanka and their information behaviour. Fifteen categories of basic information needs of two types (Ã¢ survivalÃ¢ and Ã¢ strategicÃ¢) were identified. The nature of community information is recognized as <b>non-bibliographic</b> and service-oriented. The information supply position was identified as stagnated at service points, and the dynamism of the information has deteriorated within the delivery mechanisms limited to system structure. It was possible to calculate a Channel Dependency Rate (CDR) which showed that channels appropriate to provide certain categories of information were not strong and or operating as they should be. Rural citizens were also found to encounter a range of difficulties in accessing information, and it was found that these were related to geographical, structural (socio-economic and cultural) factors and personal reasons. The study proposes Community Information Centres using e-governance strategy with One Stop Shop (OSS) model, to be established at the village level using prevailing infrastructure to bridge the information gap existing in the rural areas of Sri Lanka...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a tool that generates {{authority}} files to be integrated with linked data by means of learning rules. AUTHORIS is software developed to enhance authority control and information exchange among bibliographic and <b>non-bibliographic</b> entities. Design / methodology / approach: The article analyzes different methods previously developed for authority control as well as IFLA and ALA standards for managing bibliographic records. Semantic Web technologies are also evaluated. AUTHORIS relies on Drupal and incorporates the protocols of Dublin Core, SIOC, SKOS and FOAF. The tool has also taken into account the obsolescence of MARC and its substitution by FRBR and RDA. Its effectiveness was evaluated applying a learning test proposed by RDA. Over 80 percent of the actions were carried out correctly. Findings: The use of learning rules and the facilities of linked data make it easier for information organizations to reutilize products for authority control and distribute them in a fair and efficient manner. Research limitations / implications: The ISAD-G records were the ones presenting most errors. EAD was found to be second in the number of errors produced. The rest of the formats [...] MARC 21, Dublin Core, FRAD, RDF, OWL, XBRL and FOAF [...] showed fewer than 20 errors in total. Practical implications: AUTHORIS offers institutions the means of sharing data with a high level of stability, helping to detect records that are duplicated and contributing to lexical disambiguation and data enrichment.
