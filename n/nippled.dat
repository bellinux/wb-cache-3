50|$|Entoloma mammosum, {{commonly}} known as the bell-shaped Nolanea, is a species of fungus in the family Entolomataceae. The fruit bodies are small and <b>nippled,</b> with a striate cap, salmon-colored gills, and a stately stalk. It is typically found growing in feather moss under spruce and Jack pine in the summer and fall. It is saprobic, and derives nutrients from rotting organic matter. The fungus was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Agaricus mammosus. American mycologist Lexemuel Ray Hesler transferred it to Entoloma in 1967.|$|E
50|$|The tree {{is nearly}} thornless. The fruit is about 6 cm in diameter, often with {{slightly}} <b>nippled</b> ends, {{and is usually}} sold while green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is also widely available dried, as it is often used this way in Persian cuisine. It is larger, thicker-skinned, with less intense citrus aromatics than the key lime (Citrus aurantifolia). The advantages of the Persian lime in commercial agriculture compared to the key lime are the larger size, absence of seeds, hardiness, absence of thorns on the bushes, and longer fruit shelf life. They are less acidic than key limes {{and do not have}} the bitterness that lends to the key lime's unique flavor.|$|E

50|$|An {{inverted}} <b>nipple</b> (occasionally invaginated <b>nipple)</b> is {{a condition}} where the <b>nipple,</b> instead of pointing outward, is retracted into the breast. In some cases, the <b>nipple</b> will be temporarily protruded if stimulated. Women and men can have inverted <b>nipples.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{strategies}} for protracting inverted <b>nipples</b> include regularly stimulating the <b>nipples</b> to a protruding state, {{in an attempt}} to gradually loosen the <b>nipple</b> tissue. Some sex toys designed for <b>nipple</b> stimulation, such as suction cups or clamps may also cause inverted <b>nipples</b> to protract or stay protracted longer. There are special devices specifically designed to draw out inverted <b>nipples,</b> or a home-made <b>nipple</b> protractor can be constructed out of a 10 ml disposable syringe. These methods are often used in preparation for breast-feeding, which can sometimes cause inverted <b>nipples</b> to become protracted permanently.|$|R
25|$|Very rarely, <b>nipple</b> {{pain can}} be caused by {{vasospasm}} of the <b>nipple.</b> In essence, blood does not flow properly to the <b>nipple</b> which causes the <b>nipple</b> to blanch. This {{can be caused}} by trauma to the <b>nipple</b> through early breastfeeding or candidal infection of the <b>nipple.</b> The pain is intense during the latch stage and in between breastfeeding sessions there is a throbbing pain when the <b>nipple</b> is blanched. The <b>nipple</b> can be massaged to help blood flow return to reduce pain, as well as avoiding cold. In some instances, heart medication, nifedipine, is used to help the blood flow return to the <b>nipple.</b>|$|R

40|$|BackgroundNipple {{reconstruction}} following breast mound reconstruction is {{the final}} step in breast reconstruction. Although <b>nipple</b> reconstruction is a simple surgery, the psychological aspects of <b>nipple</b> reconstruction {{are thought to be}} important. <b>Nipple</b> projection is a key factor in determining patient satisfaction with the surgery. In the present study, the Hammond flap technique was introduced for <b>nipple</b> reconstruction. MethodsTwenty-six patients who had undergone breast reconstruction from February 2008 to March 2012 were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients were evaluated based on preoperative photos, and their <b>nipple</b> diameters and heights were measured. Postoperative evaluation was conducted 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following <b>nipple</b> reconstruction. A questionnaire on patient satisfaction with the <b>nipple</b> reconstruction was administered 12 months after <b>nipple</b> reconstruction. Moreover, the same plastic surgeon scored <b>nipple</b> projection and overall cosmetic result of the new <b>nipple.</b> ResultsThe mean projection was 4. 4 mm (range, 3 - 6 mm), and it well matched the contralateral <b>nipple.</b> Twelve months following <b>nipple</b> reconstruction, the mean reduction rate in the <b>nipple</b> projection was 43. 6 %.

40|$|While <b>nipple</b> pain {{is common}} in the first 10 days of {{breastfeeding}} and during the infant’s teething process, sore <b>nipples</b> should not persist beyond this period and are often disregarded as “normal ” by many providers. Sore and painful <b>nipples</b> are NOT normal side effects of breastfeeding. Sore <b>nipples</b> {{may be due to}} abrasions that occur during feeding or from tight fitting clothing. These breaks in the skin pre-dispose the mother to infections of the <b>nipple,</b> as well as mastitis. Less common causes include psoriasis, eczema and contact dermatitis. Always bring mother in for a <b>nipple</b> and latch evaluation. Improper latch or flat/inverted <b>nipples</b> are common causes of <b>nipple</b> pain without infection. Consult with an IBCLC to evaluate latch depth and consider changing position during feeding or use of a <b>nipple</b> shield if indicated. If pumping, have mother bring in her pump and flanges to ensure a proper fit. Remember to evaluate the infant for ankyloglossia as a potential cause of <b>nipple</b> pain. For non-infected cracked <b>nipples,</b> breast milk combined with <b>nipple</b> cream, such as lanolin may promote healing thus we often encourage patients to express and apply breast milk to the healing <b>nipple</b> after and in-between feeds.

5000|$|Since spoke {{threading}} and <b>nipple</b> threading must match, {{boxes of}} spokes usually include a like number of <b>nipples.</b> Weight savings or {{the need for}} great strength due to building a wheel with few spokes might call for obtaining different <b>nipples</b> than those shipped with the spokes. Standard materials for <b>nipples</b> are brass (usually nickel-plated) and aluminum. Brass is heavier but more durable and less prone to corrosion, rounding of flats while tightening, breaking and galling; aluminum is far lighter. If using aluminum <b>nipples,</b> the spokes should be long enough to engage {{the full length of}} spoke <b>nipple</b> threads so that the load is carried from spoke {{to the top of the}} <b>nipple.</b> [...] If the spoke is only part way into the <b>nipple,</b> the <b>nipple</b> carries the tension load and is prone to breaking from fatigue failure. Also, with aluminum <b>nipples</b> care and a good spoke wrench are needed to avoid rounding the flats while tightening. Recently, titanium <b>nipples</b> have become available from both US and Chinese sources.

Furthermore, partial relationship of one of the new strains to all of the arginine-utilizing mycoplasma species of human origin was demonstrated with the agar gel diffusion technique. Thus, the new strains appear to constitute a new mycoplasma species, for which the name M. orale type 3 is tentatively proposed.
