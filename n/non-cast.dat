500|$|Songs {{included}} on the three soundtrack albums accompanying the season feature additional vocals by <b>non-cast</b> members. Adam Anders, Kamari Copeland, Tim Davis, Emily Gomez, David Loucks, Chris Mann and Windy Wagner appear on all three albums, as does Nikki Anders, née Hassman, who is credited as Hassman {{on the first two}} and Anders on the third; Zac Poor sings on the second and third albums. Jasper Randall appears on Glee: The Music, Volume 1, and David Baloche, Jenny Karr, Kerri Larson and Tiffany Palmer feature on Glee: The Music, Volume 2. Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers features additional vocals by Kala Balch, David Baloche, Colin Benward, Ravaughn Brown, Storm Lee, Chaz Mason, Jeanette Olsen, Jimmy Andrew Richard, Drew Ryan Scott, Shelley Scarr and Onitsha Shaw. While recurring cast members Morris, Rivera, Shum, Jr., and Talton perform in the group numbers on screen, only Rivera is credited with performing vocally on any soundtrack albums or EPs, gaining her first solo part on [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] in the episode [...] "The Power of Madonna", and appearing on Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers as well as the two EPs, Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna and Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals.|$|E

40|$|Prolonged {{inactivity}} induces muscle loss {{due to an}} {{activation of}} proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis; the latter is also involved in the recovery of muscle mass. The aim of the present work was to explore the evolution of muscle mass and protein metabolism during immobilization and recovery and assess {{the effect of a}} nutritional strategy for counteracting muscle loss and facilitating recovery. Adult rats (6 - 8 months) were subjected to unilateral hindlimb casting for 8 days (10 - 18) and then permitted to recover for 10 to 40 days (R 10 -R 40). They were fed a Control or Experimental diet supplemented with antioxidants/polyphenols (AOX) (10 to 18), AOX and leucine (AOX + LEU) (18 to R 15) and LEU alone (R 15 to R 40). Muscle mass, absolute protein synthesis rate and proteasome activities were measured in gastrocnemius muscle in casted and <b>non-casted</b> legs in post prandial (PP) and post absorptive (PA) states at each time point. Immobilized gastrocnemius protein content was similarly reduced (- 37 %) in both diets compared to the <b>non-casted</b> leg. Muscle mass recovery was accelerated by the AOX and LEU supplementation (+ 6 % AOX+LEU vs. Control, P< 0. 05 at R 40) due to a higher protein synthesis both in PA and PP states (+ 23 % and 31 % respectively, Experimental vs. Control diets, P< 0. 05, R 40) without difference in trypsin-and chymotrypsin-like activities between diets. Thus, this nutritional supplementation accelerated the recovery of muscle mass via a stimulation of protein synthesis throughout the entire day (in the PP and PA states) and could be a promising strategy to be tested during recovery from bed rest in humans...|$|R
40|$|Sarcopenia is {{the general}} muscle mass and {{strength}} loss associated with ageing. Muscle atrophy could be made worse by exposure to acute periods of immobilization, because muscle disuse by itself is a stimulus for atrophy. Using a model of unilateral hindlimb casting in old adult rats, we have already demonstrated that the primary effect of immobilization was atrophy in the casted leg, but was also surprisingly associated with a retarded atrophy in the <b>non-casted</b> leg during rehabilitation. In search of mechanisms involved in this generalized atrophy, we demonstrated {{in the present study}} that contrary to pair-fed non-immobilized control animals, muscle protein synthesis in the non-immobilized limb was unable to adapt and to respond positively to food intake. Because pair-fed control rats did not lose muscle mass, this defect in muscle protein synthesis may represent one of the explanation for the muscle mass loss observed in the non-immobilized rats. Nevertheless, in order to stimulate protein turn over and generate a positive nitrogen balance required to maintain the whole muscle mass in immobilized rats, we tested a dietary free leucine supplementation (an amino acid known for its stimulatory effect on protein metabolism) during the rehabilitation period. Leucine supplementation was able to overcome the anabolic resistance in the non-immobilized limb. A greater muscle protein synthesis up-regulation associated with a stimulation of the mTOR signalling pathway was indeed recorded but it remained inefficient to prevent the loss of muscle in the non-immobilized limb. By contrast, we demonstrated here that whey protein or high protein diets were able to preven...|$|R

5000|$|Goober's Garage—George Lindsay, in his Andy Griffith role of Goober, as {{the owner}} of the local garage where he would talk about cars and jalopies with whomever {{appeared}} in the sketch that week. Sometimes <b>non-cast</b> member Jack Burns would appear in the sketch as the city slicker/con-artist type trying to pull a fast one with Goober emerging more intelligent. For a short time in the early 1980s, Chase Randolph appeared in the sketch as a muscular [...] "hunk" [...] mechanic hired by Goober and being pursued by Honeys Diana Goodman, Misty Rowe, and Nancy Traylor. The running gag was that Randolph was more interested in fixing up cars than giving in to the advances of the girls, while Goober then offered to go out with the girls instead—only for the girls to ignore his requests and appear disappointed. In later seasons, after Randolph's run, Goober was joined in the sketch by Goodman, Rowe, and Lisa Todd as his beautiful but not very bright mechanics.|$|E
5000|$|In this song, {{during a}} musical {{performance}} of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew (the subplot of Kate), three suitors (Gremio, Lucentio and Hortensio) compete to win Bianca's affections (Gremio claiming wealth; Hortensio offering social standing; and Lucentio {{with a promise}} of love). Whereas other songs from Kiss Me, Kate (such as [...] "So in Love" [...] and [...] "Too Darn Hot") were released as singles and achieved commercial success outside the show ("So in Love" [...] reached the top ten on the Hit Parade in 1949 and has since been covered by scores of recording artists), [...] "Tom, Dick or Harry" [...] was written expressly to advance the Shrew subplot and is, therefore, a showtune in the truest sense of the word. This is why many studio (<b>non-cast)</b> recordings of Kiss Me, Kate {{do not include the}} song. Perhaps the best-known example of this is Frank Sinatra's Kiss Me, Kate studio album which is part of his four album (four show) project that also includes Finian's Rainbow (1947), South Pacific (1949) and Guys and Dolls (1950) and which he produced in 1963 to promote his fledgling label, Reprise Records; hence the project title, the star-studded Reprise Musical Repertory Theatre.|$|E
40|$|Earthworms are {{considered}} soil ecosystem engineers that {{play an important}} role in soil organic matter dynamics and physical structure. Due to both their size and activities these organisms can accelerate the decomposition and mineralization of organic matter by reducing the size of residues to particles more available to microflora. Consequently, their impact in nutrient availability and cycling in natural and agricultural ecosystems can be considerable. Three experiments were performed in a natural herbaceous savanna and in a selected Brachiaria decumbens and Pueraria phaseoloides ("Kudzu") pasture: one field study and two laboratory/incubation studies, at the CIAT-CORPOICA research station at Carimagua in the isohyperthermic savannas on the Colombian Orinoco basin. Total P content was higher in earthworm casts than in the surrounding soil in field samples, i. e., 50 % in native savanna soil and more than 100 % in pasture soil, but not (or very little) in laboratory casts (10 %- 20 %). Under field conditions almost without exception, all P fractions increased in casts compared with the control soil. Increases were relatively greater in the labile inorganic P fractions. Except in the native savanna under field conditions, the phosphatase activity was reduced on casting. Our results suggest that earthworms in the field incorporate P from litter or undecomposed plant and root material which is not normally measured in the analysis of bulk (<b>non-cast)</b> soil. This P from litter enters into all P fractions (organic and inorganic) but to a greater extent into labile Pi fractions. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of an abundant native anecic earthworm on phosphorus availability in Oxisols of supposedly low fertility characteristics...|$|E
