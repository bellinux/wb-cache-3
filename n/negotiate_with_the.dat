5|$|A fierce {{defense was}} {{launched}} {{from within the}} walls, even as Bowie and Travis made unsuccessful attempts to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Mexican army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements. Although Santa Anna refused to consider a proposed conditional surrender, he extended an offer of amnesty for all Tejanos inside the fortress to walk away unharmed. Most Tejanos evacuated from the fortress about February 25, either {{as part of the}} amnesty, or as a part of Juan Seguín's company of courier scouts on their last run.|$|E
5|$|After {{his tenure}} in Congress, Rowan {{was elected to}} {{represent}} Nelson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1813 to 1817. In 1817, the House debated a resolution instructing Governor Gabriel Slaughter to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> governors of Indiana and Ohio to secure passage of legislation requiring citizens of those states to return fugitive slaves. Representative James G. Birney vigorously opposed the resolution, and it was defeated. The pro-slavery members of the House then rallied behind Rowan's leadership to pass a substitute resolution which softened the most objectionable language but retained the call for fugitive slave legislation in Indiana and Ohio.|$|E

The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers.

5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E

5|$|Politically, Leopold {{disliked the}} Socialist party, preferring to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Party, which held power {{for much of}} his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, who saw him as meddling in state {{business}} and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, public awareness of the atrocities committed under his colonial regime, as well as his marital infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity. Following his death in December 1909, his funeral cortege was booed.|$|E
5|$|Speidel {{met with}} former foreign {{minister}} Konstantin von Neurath and Strölin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel's request, although {{the latter was}} not present. Neurath and Strölin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations with the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations. However, {{around the same time}} the plotters in Berlin were not aware that Rommel had reportedly decided {{to take part in the}} conspiracy. On 16 May, they informed Allen Dulles, through whom they hoped to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support.|$|E
5|$|The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was {{instructed}} by Frederick III to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Swedes, {{and the resulting}} peace treaty can largely be credited to him. Without any direct involvement by foreign powers, the Danes and Swedes managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much {{to the surprise of}} both parties. A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} sponsored numerous {{initiatives aimed}} at improving conditions or achieving repatriation. At {{the request of the}} Vichy government, Georges Scapini, a deputy and World War I veteran, was appointed to lead a committee to monitor the treatment of French prisoners in Germany. Scapini's Service Diplomatique des Prisonniers de Guerre (Diplomatic Service of Prisoners of War; SDPG) was given responsibility to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German authorities in all matters concerning prisoners of war.

Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent his private secretary Vo Van Hai to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coup leaders. In the afternoon, Khanh left the palace to meet with rebel officers to keep abreast of their demands, which they reiterated. The rebels' negotiators were Đông and Major Nguyen Huy Loi. They wanted officers and opposition figures to be appointed to a new government to keep Diệm in check.|$|E
5|$|Turnbull's {{willingness}} to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> government {{was met with}} opposition from some Coalition MPs. By September 2009, The Australian was reporting that only 12 of the 59 Liberal backbenchers supported negotiations. On 18 October 2009, Turnbull fronted a meeting of Coalition MPs with a proposal to negotiate amendments to the government's ETS. This meeting supported his proposal, in what {{was seen as a}} test of Turnbull's leadership. However, there was speculation that a number of Coalition Senators would defy Turnbull and cross the floor of the Senate to vote against any ETS legislation. The ETS opponents argued that it would be premature for Parliament to pass ETS legislation before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change.|$|E

The first court hearing was held on November 4, but the judge put the case on hold until the strike could be resolved. The case was later annulled on November 7 when the same judge ruled that Pearson had no standing to bring such a suit before the court.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Netherlands or Luxembourg, whose monarchies {{went into}} exile {{alongside}} the government, King Leopold III {{surrendered to the}} Germans alongside his army – contrary to {{the advice of his}} government. In the days before his surrender, he allegedly attempted to form a new government under the pro-Nazi socialist Henri De Man though this was never realized. He remained a prisoner of the Germans, under house arrest, {{for the rest of the}} war. Although the government briefly attempted to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German authorities from exile in France, the German authorities passed a decree forbidding members of the Belgian government returning to the country and the talks were abandoned.|$|E

Tiverton Borough Council gave the committee the power to <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British Waterways Board in March 1967, but the Board were unwilling to offer financial assistance.|$|E
