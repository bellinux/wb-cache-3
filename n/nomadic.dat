5|$|Commanders in the Tang army were {{familiar}} with the political culture of <b>nomadic</b> empires. <b>Nomadic</b> alliances were formed through distributing war plunder and ensuring the security of tribal property, and grew tenuous when rulers failed to deliver their promises. The Chinese understood that disaffected tribes were vulnerable to switching allegiances, and used this to their advantage.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{population}} resisted conversion for many years, particularly the <b>nomadic</b> Fulbe herders. They rightly feared that the marabouts would abuse their authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} in the San Juan Basin were hunter-gatherers: the Archaic–Early Basketmaker people. These small bands descended from <b>nomadic</b> Clovis big-game hunters who arrived in the Southwest around 10,000 BC. More than 70 campsites from this period, carbon-dated to the period 7000–1500 BC and mostly {{consisting}} of stone chips and other leavings, were found in Atlatl Cave and elsewhere within Chaco Canyon, {{with at least one}} of the sites located on the canyon floor near an exposed arroyo. The Archaic–Early Basketmaker people were <b>nomadic</b> or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who over time began making baskets to store gathered plants. By the end of the period, some people cultivated food. Excavation of their campsites and rock shelters has revealed that they made tools, gathered wild plants, and killed and processed game. Slab-lined storage cists indicate a change from a wholly <b>nomadic</b> lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of the ancient city of Jeitun, which dates to 6000 BC, kept sheep and goats as their primary livestock. There have also been numerous identifications of <b>Nomadic</b> pastoralism in archaeological sites, identified by a prevalence of sheep and goat bones, a lack of grain or grain-processing equipment, very limited architecture showing a set of characteristic traits, a location outside the region's zone of agriculture, and ethnographic analogy to modern <b>nomadic</b> pastoral peoples.|$|E
5|$|While the Parthians {{regained the}} territories {{lost in the}} west, another threat arose in the east. In 177–176BC the <b>nomadic</b> {{confederation}} of the Xiongnu dislodged the <b>nomadic</b> Yuezhi from their homelands {{in what is now}} Gansu province in Northwest China; the Yuezhi then migrated west into Bactria and displaced the Saka (Scythian) tribes. The Saka were forced to move further west, where they invaded the Parthian Empire's northeastern borders. Mithridates was thus forced to retire to Hyrcania after his conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be <b>nomadic,</b> holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, <b>nomadic</b> or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|Between 1969 and 1972, as he {{was working}} on The <b>Nomadic</b> Alternative, Chatwin {{travelled}} extensively and pursued other endeavours in an attempt to establish a creative career. He co-curated an exhibit on <b>Nomadic</b> Art of the Asian Steppes, which opened at Asia House Gallery in New York City in 1970. He considered publishing an account of his 1969 trip to Afghanistan with Peter Levi. Levi published his own book about it, The Light Garden of the Angel King: Journeys in Afghanistan (1972). Chatwin contributed two articles on nomads to Vogue and another article to History Today.|$|E

5|$|Dusky woodswallows {{adhere to}} {{seasonal}} migration and movements. The birds are a <b>nomadic</b> species, {{and tend to}} move quite spontaneously. However, one certain change of habitat occurs for the south-eastern birds, who migrate northward for Autumn.|$|E
5|$|Exiled prince Viserys Targaryen plots to {{overthrow}} King Robert and reclaim his father's throne. To this end, he brokers a marriage between his sister Daenerys {{and a powerful}} warlord Khal Drogo, leader of a <b>nomadic</b> horde of Dothraki.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to modern}} {{settlement}} in villages, the <b>nomadic</b> indigenous peoples of Ethiopia provided easy hunting {{grounds for the}} bushcrow as they left loose, dung-covered soil behind as they moved their cattle. This provided a rich abundance of beetle larvae for the bushcrow to feed upon.|$|E
5|$|Relations between steppe nomads and the settled {{people in}} and around Central Asia were often marked by conflict. The <b>nomadic</b> {{lifestyle}} was well suited to warfare, and steppe cavalry became {{some of the most}} militarily potent forces in the world, only limited by nomads' frequent lack of internal unity. Periodically, strong leaders would organise several tribes into one force, creating an almost unstoppable power. These unified groups included the Huns, who invaded Europe, and under Attila, conducted campaigns in both eastern France and northern Italy, over 500miles apart, within two successive campaign seasons. Other unified <b>nomadic</b> forces included the Wu Hu attacks on China, and the Mongol conquest of much of Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{evidence}} {{of people in}} Scarborough comes from an archaeological site in Fenwood Heights, which has been dated to 8000 BCE. The site contains {{the remains of a}} camp of <b>nomadic</b> hunters and foragers, and {{there is no evidence of}} permanent settlers.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a large}} but {{constantly}} declining {{minority of}} <b>nomadic</b> and seminomadic pastoralists {{in countries such as}} Saudi Arabia (probably less than 3%), Iran (4%), and Afghanistan (at most 10%).|$|E
5|$|A Corded Ware culture princely burial {{was found}} in Szczytna, Subcarpathian Voivodeship. The grave, well-secured three meters below the surface, {{contained}} a man's skeleton and a funerary gift collection of highly valuable copper decorations, containers, stone tools and arrowheads. The uniquely equipped burial of a warrior-chief has close analogies with finds from Transylvania, a testimony to geographically extensive contacts of Corded Ware culture <b>nomadic</b> people.|$|E
5|$|Al-Tabari's account {{does not}} mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; {{focusing}} on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based {{on the story of}} Zenobia, it is probably conflated with the story of a semi-legendary <b>nomadic</b> Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba' fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the book, Peter Grant, who {{has joined}} a <b>nomadic</b> gang of feral adolescents, accidentally shoots and kills Abby, whom he has not seen for the last four years. However, at {{the end of the}} current {{incarnation}} of Survivors series 2, Peter shoots but doesn't kill Tom, and Abby is finally reunited with Peter, without her accidental death.|$|E
5|$|Australian kites may be {{sedentary}} or <b>nomadic,</b> {{and generally}} occur in open grasslands or valleys {{where there are}} scattered clumps of trees. In urban areas they are found {{on the edge of}} towns on wasteland, irregularly mown areas, or grassy roadside verges. They also hunt over coastal dunes, drier marshland, and farmland.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They {{have been trained to}} dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe at least since the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, <b>nomadic</b> Romani bear {{handlers}} called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Chipped {{stone tools}} found at Zemun {{show that the}} area around Belgrade was {{inhabited}} by <b>nomadic</b> foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools belong to the Mousterian industry, which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980. Part {{of the difficulty}} in estimating the city's population {{is that part of}} it is <b>nomadic,</b> setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to be close to one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E
5|$|Human {{habitation}} on the Santa Ana River {{dates back}} 9,000 to 12,000 years ago, {{close to the}} early stages of the Holocene period. The first Native Americans to live in the area were <b>nomadic</b> tribes that traveled from place to place, grazing animals on fertile grasslands and gathering fruits and seeds for food. The ancestors of these early people originated from the Shoshone and Uto-Aztecan people of the northwestern United States. Eventually, the human population of the watershed reached a peak of about 15,000. About 8,000 years ago, the climate experienced a change becoming more arid and the originally <b>nomadic</b> tribes began to stay in individual places longer, becoming semi-nomadic. However, they did not establish agriculture, nor did they raise animals or live in villages. Like many Native American tribes in California, acorns were a staple food of many of the inland valley people. People closer to the ocean often fished and hunted small animals, often from tide pools and coastal stream areas, for food.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the Somali studies scholar Charles Geshekter {{produced}} The Parching Winds of Somalia. Shot {{on location}} in Somalia, the film examines how the country's <b>nomadic</b> inhabitants managed to withstand the ravages of a harsh desert environment and the encroachment of imperial forces by synthesizing knowledge of the past, Muslim practices, and skillful livestock management in a successful fusion of traditional values with modern techniques.|$|E
5|$|In dry tall grasslands in monsoonal areas, {{the change}} in {{vegetation}} may be so great due to either fires or wet season growth that birds may be more <b>nomadic</b> and change territories more than other fairywrens. They form more stable territories elsewhere, such as in coastal areas. Cooperative breeding is less common with this species than with other fairywrens; helper birds have been sporadically reported, but the red-backed fairywren has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} live {{sedentary}} {{people such as}} the Sara, the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential social unit is the lineage. In the Sahel sedentary peoples live side-by-side with <b>nomadic</b> ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly Toubous.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nomadic</b> {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The <b>nomadic</b> life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|Nueces Bay formed {{approximately}} 9,000 years ago, as the {{sea level}} rose {{at the conclusion of}} the last ice age. The sea level stabilized 6,000 years later, shaping the present-day Nueces Bay. The first human inhabitants were the <b>nomadic</b> Aransas Indians, who settled between the Copano and Baffin bays about 8,000 years ago, until 1300 CE. In the next century, the Karankawa Indians arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore.|$|E
5|$|Oueddei {{captured}} about 2,500 {{prisoners in}} 1977 and 1978; as a result, the Chadian Armed Forces lost at least 20% of its manpower. In particular, the National and <b>Nomadic</b> Guard (GNN) was decimated {{by the fall}} of Fada and Faya. Oueddei used these victories to strengthen his position in the FROLINAT: during a Libyan-sponsored congress held in March in Faya-Largeau, the insurgency's main factions reunited themselves and nominated Oueddei as the secretary-general.|$|E
5|$|Several <b>nomadic</b> {{indigenous}} groups in Maritime Southeast Asia live in boats and derive nearly {{all they need}} from the sea. The Moken people live on the coasts of Thailand and Burma and islands in the Andaman Sea. The Bajau people are originally from the Sulu Archipelago, Mindanao, and northern Borneo. Some Sea Gypsies are accomplished free-divers, able to descend to depths of , though many are adopting a more settled, land-based way of life.|$|E
5|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; {{two of the}} most prominent being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many surrounding tribes. Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion. Indigenous Arabs were either <b>nomadic</b> or sedentary, the former constantly travelling {{from one place to another}} seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. <b>Nomadic</b> survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not view this as a crime.|$|E
5|$|The Australian ringneck {{is active}} {{during the day}} and can be found in {{eucalypt}} woodlands and eucalypt-lined watercourses. The species is gregarious and depending on the conditions can be resident or <b>nomadic.</b> In trials of growing hybrid eucalypt trees in dry environments parrots, especially the Port Lincoln parrot, caused severe damage to the crowns of the younger trees during the research period between 2000–3.|$|E
5|$|The Director of Dependent States (Dian shuguo 典屬國), whose salary-rank was 2,000-dan, was {{responsible}} for embassies to foreign countries and <b>nomadic</b> peoples along Han's borders and the annual exchange of hostages—usually foreign princes—submitted to the Han court. Dependent States (Shuguo 屬國) were first established in 121 BC and composed mostly non-Han-Chinese <b>nomadic</b> tribes and confederations who surrendered after negotiation or armed conflict and accepted Han suzerainty. They served as a buffer between Han territory and hostile tribes, such as the Xiongnu, and {{as a means to}} quell tribes in the Ordos Desert. The Han court appointed a Commandant (Duwei 都尉), also known as Chief Commandant, ranked Equivalent to 2,000-dan, to govern the non-Han-Chinese populations of each Dependent State. The Director of Dependent States' title was abolished in 28 BC; his duties and his subordinates, the Commandants, became the responsibilities of the Minister Herald. The Protectorate of the Western Regions, established in 60 BC, which conducted foreign affairs with the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, was not the responsibility of the Director of Dependent States.|$|E
5|$|The Scythians were a {{group of}} north Iranian <b>nomadic</b> tribes, {{speaking}} an Iranian language (Scythian languages) who had invaded Media, killed Cyrus in battle, revolted against Darius and threatened to disrupt trade between Central Asia and {{the shores of the}} Black Sea as they lived between the Danube River, River Don and the Black Sea.|$|E
