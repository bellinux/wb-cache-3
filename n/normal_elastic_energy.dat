40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> storage is {{more important in the}} locomotion of larger mammals. This is based on: (a) comparison of kangaroos with the smaller kangaroo rat; and (b) calculations that predict that the capacity for <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> storage relative to body mass increases with size. Here we argue that: (i) data from kangaroos and kangaroo rats cannot be generalized to other mammals; (ii) the <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> storage capacity relative to body mass is not indicative of the importance of <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> to an animal; and (iii) the contribution of <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> to the mechanical work of locomotion will not increase as rapidly with size as the mass-specific energy storage capacity, because larger mammals must do relatively more mechanical work per stride. We predict how the ratio of <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> storage to mechanical work will change with size in quadrupedal mammals by combining empirical scaling relationships from the literature. The results suggest that the percentage contribution of <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> to the mechanical work of locomotion decreases with size, so that <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> is more important in the locomotion of smaller mammals. This now needs to be tested experimentally...|$|R

Wet granulation formulations were prepared using ACM, SP as binder (equal to 2. 5 %, 5 % or 10 % starch concentration), SSG as disintegrant (0 %, 4 %, 8 %, or 12 % w/w), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and magnesium stearate (MS) (1. 5 % w/w). Upper and lower punch force displacement data during in-die compaction was captured using a fully instrumented rotary tablet press at 13. 8 rpm at 96 ± 8, 163 ± 13, 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures. <b>Elastic</b> <b>energy</b> [EE] and tablet tensile strength was determined {{as a function of}} starch and SSG concentration and compaction pressure.

The negative effect of SSG on the overall compressibility of granules was due to its high <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> anddecrease in interparticulate bonding. When examining the <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> at increasing SP levels, a decrease in <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> was evident (0. 60, 0. 50 and 0. 31 Nm for 2. 5 %, 5 % and 10 % starch at 4 % SSG and 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures respectively).

40|$|The {{sizes of}} {{earthquakes}} are measured using well-defined, measurable quantities such as seismic moment and released (transformed) <b>elastic</b> <b>energy.</b> No similar measures {{exist for the}} sizes of volcanic eruptions, {{making it difficult to}} compare the energies released in earthquakes and eruptions. Here I provide a new measure of the <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> (the potential mechanical energy) associated with magma chamber rupture and contraction (shrinkage) during an eruption. For earthquakes and eruptions, <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> derives from two sources: (1) the strain energy stored in the volcano/fault zone before rupture, and (2) the external applied load (force, pressure, stress, displacement) on the volcano/fault zone. From thermodynamic considerations it follows that the <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> released or transformed (dU) during an eruption is directly proportional to the excess pressure (pe) in the magma chamber at the time of rupture multiplied by the volume decrease (-dVc) of the chamber, so that. This formula {{can be used as a}} basis for a new eruption magnitude scale, based on <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> released, which can be related to the moment-magnitude scale for earthquakes. For very large eruptions (> 100 km 3), the volume of the feeder-dike is negligible, so that the decrease in chamber volume during an eruption corresponds roughly to the associated volume of erupted materials, so that the <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> is. Using a typical excess pressures of 5 MPa, it is shown that the largest known eruptions on Earth, such as the explosive La Garita Caldera eruption (27 - 28 million years ago) and largest single (effusive) Colombia River basalt lava flows (15 - 16 million years ago), both of which have estimated volumes of about 5000 km 3, released <b>elastic</b> <b>energy</b> of the order of 10 EJ.
