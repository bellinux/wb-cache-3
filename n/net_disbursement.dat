40|$|Using a {{model of}} aid fungibility, the authors examine the {{relationship}} between foreign aid and public spending. Based on a panel of cross-country and time-series data, their results show that roughly 75 cents of every dollar given in net development assistance goes to current spending and 25 cents to capital spending in the recipient countries. But concessionary loans - a component of development assistance - stimulate far more government spending. Their results also show that aid increases both public and private investment. To test aid fungibility across both public spending categories, they use a newly constructed data series on the <b>net</b> <b>disbursement</b> of concessionary loans. They find that concessionary loans given to the transport and communication sector are fully nonfungible. But loans to the energy sector are converted into fungible monies and part of the funds leak into transport and communications. Loans to agriculture and education are also fungible. There is no evidence of concessionary funds being diverted for military purposes. Their results show that total public spending in the health sector has no impact on reducing infant mortality, but concessionary loans to the health sector do. This finding leads the authors to conclude that linking foreign aid to an agreed-upon public spending program in areas critical to development might be an effective way to transfer resources to developing countries.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a stochastic {{framework for the}} analysis of transactions and precautionary demand for money. The analysis is based on the principles of inventory managements and the key feature of the model is its stochastic characteristics which lead to the need for precautionary reserves. The formal solution for optimal money holdings is derived and is shown to depend on the rate of interest, the mean rate of <b>net</b> <b>disbursements,</b> the cost of portfolio adjustment and the variance of the stochastic process governing <b>net</b> <b>disbursements.</b> One solution is obtained by minimizing the present value of financial management. This solution is compared with an alternative that is derived from the more conventional methodology of minimizing the steady-state cost function. The comparison shows that the two approaches may yield solutions that differ significantly from each other. The paper concludes with an application of the model to an empirical examination of countries' holdings of international reserves. The empirical results are shown to be consistent with the predictions of the model. ...|$|R

This brings an undeniable opportunity and incentives for many students and professionals to go abroad. Recently, the IOM (2008) stated that international students represent around 20 % of the skilled migration. To test this mechanism we check for the direct effect of technical cooperation from the six countries on the selection rate and on the skill composition of emigrants.

With tremendous economic development as time elapsed, Japan expanded and increased its ODA each year. At present, Japan is the top donor in {{the world in terms of}} <b>net</b> <b>disbursements.</b> There is World Health Organization (WHO) as a chief multilateral donor organization in the health sector, to which Japan bears approximately 12 % of its total budget. This is the second largest amount of the contribution next to the USA. The prioritized activities by WHO include promotion of primary health care, action programme on essential drugs, AIDS control, tabacco issue, special programme for research and training in tropical diseases, global polio eradication initiative, humanitarian/emergency relief, and the comprehensive plan with main emphases of lowering infant mortality rate. A major portion of bilateral cooperation is implemented by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). JICA is responsible for contributiing to the economic and social development of developing countries and to promote international cooperation which includes governmental based technical cooperation, promotion of grant-aid programme, dispatch of Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers, overseas emigration and dispatch of Japan Disaster Relief team. As main and comprehensive approach to promoting technology transfer, JICA implements the project type cooperation programme. In the health sector, the fields of project type cooperation comprise: 1) clinical activity or hospital administration; 2) medical research or health service laboratory; 3) public health improvement including communicable disease control; 4) health manpower development; 5) production and quality control of vaccines and 6) population control and family planning, more than half of which are associated with the grant-aid assistance for the construction of physical facilities and the provision of major equipment and machinery. In addition, other programmes and methodologies implemented by JICA are explained, and the discipline and the priorities in the execution of the Japan's ODA are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{document}} {{some key}} business cycle properties {{of foreign aid}} flows to developing countries. We identify two striking empirical regularities. First, aid flows are highly volatile over time [...] on average, {{two to three times}} as volatile as the recipient's output. Second, for most African countries, net aid inflows are strongly positively correlated with their domestic output. Outside of Africa, we find a similar, if somewhat less pronounced, pattern of aid procyclicality. To see why these empirical regularities are important, recall that output fluctuations in developing countries are much stronger than in industrialized economies. Indeed, we document that the gross domestic product of an aid recipient is on average six times as volatile as that of a donor. For developing countries, though, customary ways to smooth out the impact of output fluctuations on domestic consumption are likely to be very onerous. For instance, moral hazard and repudiation risk imply that heavily indebted nations are often denied new loans (or are asked to repay old ones) precisely when their economies suffer adverse shocks [...] see, e. g., Atkeson- 1991). At the same time, foreign aid is a sizeable source of income to recipients, especially in Africa, where it averages 12. 5 % of gross domestic product and constitutes the main source of foreign capital. In such an environment, foreign aid flows have the potential to {{play a key role in}} smoothing out developing countries' output fluctuations. Our results imply that, all in all, aid does not play that role. Admittedly, it might be argued that, except for emergency relief, the chief purpose of foreign aid is not to act as an insurance device but, instead, to fuel economic development, in which case it is not clear a priori whether one should expect aid flows to be procyclical or countercyclical. It is well known, however, that output fluctuations affect growth negatively [...] see, e. g., Hamilton (1989) and Ramey&Ramey (1995). Hence, even if aid were meant solely to help foster growth, serious concerns should nonetheless arise from the fact that aid disbursement patterns contribute to the volatility of developing countries' disposable income. Our findings are robust. Our data set comprises various yearly aid and output series for sixty-three recipient and eighteen donor countries between 1969 and 1995. We find few differences between the cyclical behavior of multilateral as opposed to bilateral aid disbursements, even though multilateral aid flows are relatively more volatile than their bilateral counterparts. Likewise, aid commitments fluctuate more than actual <b>net</b> <b>disbursements,</b> but both commitments and disbursements are procyclical. We also pay special attention to Africa, because it is the region where aid is largest relative to recipient GDP and aid procyclicality is most striking. We show that, regardless of the domestic output measure used, net aid receipts are procyclical for at least two-thirds of the thirty-eight countries in our African subsample and are countercyclical for, at most, two of them. Key components of African aid, such as grants or technical assistance, are as strongly procyclical as total aid flows. Finally, we can find no evidence that, among African countries, the procyclicality of aid might be a function of the recipient's former colonial power, choice of exchange rate regime or some other criterion. We complete the paper by analyzing the cyclical properties of aid flows from the donors' perspective. For almost all donor countries, we find that total aid disbursements are strongly positively correlated with the donor's output. In a clear majority of cases, however, those same donors' bilateral aid flows to the sample countries are not positively correlated with the donor's output. A corollary is that the procyclicality of aid inflows experienced by aid recipients is not the mere result of the conjunction of (i) positive comovements between North-South business cycles [Kouparitsas (1998); Agenor&Prasad (1999) ] and (ii) a positive correlation between donors' aid policies and their business cycles. ...|$|R

40|$|Pregnant {{women in}} malaria-endemic {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Africa {{are especially vulnerable}} to malaria. Recommended prevention strategies include intermittent preventive treatment with two doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine {{and the use of}} insecticide-treated nets. However, progress with implementation has been slow and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership target of 80 % coverage of both interventions by 2010 has not been met. We aimed to review the coverage of intermittent preventive treatment, insecticide-treated nets, and antenatal care for pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa and to explore associations between coverage and individual and country-level factors, including the role of funding for malaria prevention. We used data from nationally representative household surveys from 2009 - 11 to estimate coverage of intermittent preventive treatment, use of insecticide-treated nets, and attendance at antenatal clinics by pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Using demographic data for births and published data for malaria exposure, we also estimated the number of malaria-exposed births (livebirths and stillbirths combined) for 2010 by country. We used meta-regression analysis to investigate the factors associated with coverage of intermittent preventive treatment and use of insecticide-treated nets. Of the 21 Â· 4 million estimated malaria-exposed births across 27 countries in 2010, an estimated 4 Â· 6 million (21 Â· 5 %, 95 % CI 19 Â· 3 - 23 Â· 7) were born to mothers who received intermittent preventive treatment. Insecticide-treated nets were used during pregnancy for 10 Â· 5 million of 26 Â· 9 million births across 37 countries (38 Â· 8 %, 34 Â· 6 - 43 Â· 0). Antenatal care was attended at least once by 16 Â· 3 of 20 Â· 8 million women in 2010 (78 Â· 3 %, 75 Â· 2 - 81 Â· 4; n= 26 countries) and at least twice by 14 Â· 7 of 19 Â· 6 million women (75 Â· 1 %, 72 Â· 9 - 77 Â· 3; n= 22 countries). For the countries with previous estimates for 2007, coverage of intermittent preventive treatment increased from 13 Â· 1 % (11 Â· 9 - 14 Â· 3) to 21 Â· 2 % (18 Â· 9 - 23 Â· 5; n= 14 countries) and use of insecticide-treated nets increased from 17 Â· 9 % (15 Â· 1 - 20 Â· 7) to 41 Â· 6 % (37 Â· 2 - 46 Â· 0; n= 24 countries) in 2010. A fall in coverage by more than 10 % was seen in two of 24 countries for intermittent preventive treatment and in three of 30 countries for insecticide-treated <b>nets.</b> High <b>disbursement</b> of funds for malaria control and a long time interval since adoption of the relevant policy were associated with the highest coverage of intermittent preventive treatment. High disbursement of funds for malaria control and high total fertility rate were associated with the greatest use of insecticide-treated nets, whereas a high per-head gross domestic product (GDP) was associated with less use of nets than was a lower GDP. Coverage of intermittent preventive treatment showed greater inequity overall than use of insecticide-treated nets, with richer, educated, and urban women more likely to receive preventive treatment than their poorer, uneducated, rural counterparts. Although coverage of intermittent preventive treatment and use of insecticide-treated nets by pregnant women has increased in most countries, coverage remains far below international targets, despite fairly high rates of attendance at antenatal clinics. The effect of the implementation of WHO's 2012 policy update for intermittent preventive treatment, which aims to simplify the message and align preventive treatment with the focused antenatal care schedule, should be assessed to find out whether it leads to improvements in coverage.
