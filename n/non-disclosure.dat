5|$|Devices called HDCP {{strippers}} {{can remove}} the HDCP {{information from the}} video signal so the video can play on non-HDCP-compliant displays, though a fair use and <b>non-disclosure</b> form must usually be signed with a registering agency before use.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 Bancoult went {{to court}} {{to argue that the}} {{judgement}} should be set aside due to the <b>non-disclosure</b> of a 2002 feasibility study relating to the resettlement of the former inhabitants of the Chagos Islands. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled against reviewing the case on 29 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers for The Progressive voluntarily {{underwent}} {{security reviews}} and were granted Q clearances {{that allowed them}} to access restricted nuclear information. Morland and The Progressives editors declined to obtain clearances, as {{they would have had to}} sign <b>non-disclosure</b> agreements that would have prevented them from publishing the article. This resulted in the lawyers being restricted in their communications with their clients.|$|E
5|$|After {{downloading}} {{that originated}} from Singaporean IP addresses had been recorded by BayTSP, Odex sent letters of demand to people {{associated with the}} IP addresses it had tracked. The letters requested monetary compensation for downloads of the company's licensed material. The recipients were asked to contact Odex within one week and pay settlement fees from S$3,000 to S$5,000 or face legal action. The recipients also had to sign a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement, promise to destroy all copies of the downloaded anime, and stop downloading the copyrighted material.|$|E
5|$|The iPad {{does not}} employ digital rights {{management}} (DRM), but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple's platform without authorization, such as TV shows, movies, and apps. Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process {{and control of the}} platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to digital rights advocates is Apple's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time.|$|E
5|$|Titan {{was funded}} {{primarily}} by the US Department of Energy through ORNL. Funding was sufficient to purchase the CPUs {{but not all of}} the GPUs so the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agreed to fund the remaining nodes in return for computing time. ORNL scientific computing chief Jeff Nichols noted that Titan cost approximately $60 million upfront, of which the NOAA contribution was less than $10 million, but precise figures were covered by <b>non-disclosure</b> agreements. The full term of the contract with Cray included $97 million, excluding potential upgrades.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In <b>non-disclosure</b> testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
25|$|Nichols (2006) {{compiled}} {{some common}} clinical issues: countertransference, <b>non-disclosure,</b> coming-out, partner/families, and bleed-through.|$|E
25|$|Before the IBM representatives {{would explain}} the purpose of their visit, they insisted that Dorothy sign a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement. On the advice of DRI {{attorney}} Gerry Davis, Dorothy refused to sign the agreement without Gary's approval. Gary returned {{in the afternoon and}} tried to move the discussion with IBM forward, but accounts disagree on whether he signed the <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement, as well as if he ever met with the IBM representatives.|$|E
25|$|Note that Promissory Estoppel {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Estoppel for <b>Non-disclosure</b> of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a party to a contract indicates that they have some knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is estopped from their <b>non-disclosure,</b> and is forced to impart it equitably.|$|E

25|$|A {{lawsuit filed}} by Eduardo Saverin against Facebook and Zuckerberg was settled out of court. Though terms of the {{settlement}} were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook. Saverin signed a <b>non-disclosure</b> contract after the settlement.|$|E
25|$|Before Fuller's termination, {{attempts}} were made by former President Jimmy Carter to broker an agreement that would allow Fuller to retire with his $79,000 salary intact; when Fuller {{was found to have}} violated the <b>non-disclosure</b> portion of this agreement, he was subsequently fired.|$|E
25|$|Service Pack 1 Release Candidate Preview {{was only}} {{released}} on Microsoft Connect to selected testers on November 12, 2007.

25|$|A tenth film, , began filming {{in early}} 2016. Like Revelations, {{it will not}} feature Doug Bradley as Pinhead, the actor having turned the role down due to the {{production}} company's refusal {{to allow him to}} read the film's script unless he signed a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement regarding its contents.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman {{has spent}} most of his time advocating for free {{software}}, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital restrictions management, and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms. This has included software license agreements, <b>non-disclosure</b> agreements, activation keys, dongles, copy restriction, proprietary formats and binary executables without source code.|$|E
25|$|Many {{expected}} that CP/M {{would be the}} standard operating system for 16-bit computers. In 1980 IBM approached Digital Research, at Bill Gates' suggestion, to license a forthcoming version of CP/M for its new product, the IBM Personal Computer. Upon the failure to obtain a signed <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement, the talks failed, and IBM instead contracted with Microsoft to provide an operating system. The resulting product, MS-DOS, soon began outselling CP/M.|$|E
25|$|The {{epilogue}} {{states that}} Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received {{a settlement of}} $65 million, signed a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement, and rowed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, placing sixth; Eduardo Saverin received a settlement of an unknown amount and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead as a co-founder; the website has over 500 million members in 207 countries and is valued at 25 billion dollars; and Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest self-made billionaire.|$|E
25|$|Those {{working for}} Wikileaks are {{reportedly}} required to sign sweeping <b>non-disclosure</b> agreements covering all conversations, conduct, and material, with Assange having sole power over disclosure. The penalty for non-compliance {{in one such}} agreement was reportedly £12 million. Wikileaks has been challenged for this practice, as it seen to be hypocritical for an organisation dedicated to transparency to limit the transparency of its inner workings and limit the accountability of powerful individuals in the organisation.|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} of the SD specification were available only after agreeing to a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement (NDA) that prohibited development of an open source driver. However, the system was eventually reverse-engineered, and free software drivers provided access to SD cards that did not use DRM. Since then, the SDA has provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license. Although most open-source drivers were written before this, it has helped to solve compatibility issues.|$|E
25|$|Mike S. Zafirovski, who {{had served}} as President and CEO of GE Lighting and then as Motorola President and COO, succeeded Owens as {{president}} and CEO on November 15, 2005. Motorola filed a suit against Zafirovski's hiring, alleging that his new position would break {{the terms of the}} <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement he had signed. Nortel agreed to pay $11.5 million on his behalf to settle the lawsuit. Nortel also paid out US$575 million and 629 million common shares in 2006 to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of misleading investors about the company's health.|$|E
25|$|Casting began around August 2013, with Abrams {{meeting with}} {{potential}} actors for script readings and screen tests. Open auditions {{were held in}} the UK, Ireland, and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of Rachel and Thomas. Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams. Screen tests with actors continued until at least {{three weeks before the}} official announcement on April 29, 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks prior. Actors testing had strict <b>non-disclosure</b> agreements, preventing them, their agents or publicists from commenting on their potential involvement.|$|E
25|$|In April 2017, a {{story was}} {{published}} by Der Spiegel based on leaked documents provided by Football Leaks relating to an alleged rape by Ronaldo, stating that the alleged assault occurred in 2009 but that a legal agreement and accompanying <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement was entered into, resulting in the alleged charges being dropped. Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes denied the claims labelling them 'journalistic fiction', with the player stating it was consensual sex. Der Spiegel published a further story {{in response to the}} denial, alleging that text messages sent by Ronaldo showed that he was aware of the legal negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Haringey Council {{initiated}} {{an internal}} audit serious case review (SCR) after Peter's death. After {{completion of the}} court case, only an executive summary was released to the public. The full report was kept confidential, with only some employees of Haringey Council and Haringey councillors allowed access. The two local MPs whose constituencies cover Haringey (Lynne Featherstone and David Lammy), {{leader of the opposition}} Robert Gorrie, and opposition spokesperson for Children's Services were asked to sign <b>non-disclosure</b> agreements to view the document. Ed Balls condemned the serious case review and called for a second report with an independent adjudicator.|$|E
25|$|The {{recycling}} of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, {{and credit card}} numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if {{there is more than}} one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement.|$|E
25|$|Before broadcast, {{the plot}} of series two was closely guarded. Cast members were sworn to secrecy about the details, and {{required}} to sign <b>non-disclosure</b> agreements. Actor Andrew Buchan said cast members were told little about the plot, except on a need-to-know basis as they prepared for their performances in each episode. Actor Joe Sims said that actors only receive two scripts {{at a time to}} ensure {{that they did not know}} where the plot was headed. Several different endings for series two were filmed, and Chibnall said that even cast members would remain in the dark about the programme's outcome until the final episode aired.|$|E
25|$|Israeli {{authorities}} {{state that}} their reason of these restrictions is fear of his spreading further state secrets {{and that he}} is still bound by his <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement. While a court found in 2005 that he should be free to go to the Gaza Strip and West Bank, a year later further restrictions explicitly forbade him to visit either, reversing the court's initial decision. Vanunu said his knowledge was outdated and that he had nothing more he could reveal that is not already widely known. Despite the stated restrictions he gave interviews to the foreign press since his release, for which he has been arrested.|$|E
25|$|A {{trade secret}} is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are {{that the value of}} a trade secret continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a trade secret is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E
25|$|The {{sale was}} not {{announced}} until January 2007 {{as a result}} of a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement with the previous owner. The sale drew a mixed response from the San Francisco community. Many people welcomed this use of The Armory as a way of revitalizing the structure and bringing back business to the area without altering the appearance of the historic building, as well as being in keeping with San Francisco's tradition of accommodating sexual minorities. Others were disturbed that a pornography studio would be located in the middle of a residential neighborhood near schools, or were opposed to the abandonment of plans for low-income housing at the site, as well as the lack of community input into this use of The Armory.|$|E
25|$|By {{presenting}} such a card, purchasers typically {{earn the}} right either to a discount {{on the current}} purchase, or to an allotment of points {{that they can use}} for future purchases. Hence the card is the visible means of implementing a type of what economists call a two-part tariff. Application forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically <b>non-disclosure</b> (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) as part of its marketing research. Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or whether he or she is a vegetarian. Where a customer has provided sufficient identifying information, the loyalty card may also be used to access such information to expedite verification during receipt of cheques or dispensing medical prescription preparations, or for other membership privileges (e.g., access to a club lounge in airports, using a frequent-flyer card).|$|E
25|$|Another {{problematic}} case is {{the cases}} of desired <b>non-disclosure</b> of PGD results for some genetic disorders that may not yet be apparent in a parent, such as Huntington disease. It is applied when patients {{do not wish to}} know their carrier status but want to ensure that they have offspring free of the disease. This procedure can place practitioners in questionable ethical situations, e.g. when no healthy, unaffected embryos are available for transfer and a mock transfer has to be carried out so that the patient does not suspect that he/she is a carrier. The ESHRE ethics task force currently recommends using exclusion testing instead. Exclusion testing is based on a linkage analysis with polymorphic markers, in which the parental and grandparental origin of the chromosomes can be established. This way, only embryos are replaced that do not contain the chromosome derived from the affected grandparent, avoiding the need to detect the mutation itself.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Metra CEO Alex Clifford {{abruptly}} resigned his position with no public comment. It gradually {{was reported that}} his exit had been demanded by the Metra board, which negotiated a $871,000 severance package including a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement. Clifford's ouster was allegedly arranged because he rejected requests for patronage hiring and promotion, including a request to promote a longtime supporter of State Representative Michael Madigan. In the wake of this scandal, five board members resigned. In August 2013, the remaining board members unanimously elected Don Orseno as interim CEO. (The six-member board was operating with reduced membership and thus lacked the authority to elect a permanent CEO. Orseno and Alex Wiggins shared duties as co-executive directors.) Orseno's long railroad career, beginning with work to set up trains and check doors for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad played favorably in the board's decision. By October 2013, local officials had restored Metra's board to 11 members. After reviewing four candidates, the re-constituted board formally appointed Orseno CEO of Metra in January 2014.|$|E
25|$|After touring duties for {{the album}} were finished, Metallica {{filed a lawsuit}} against Elektra Records, which tried to force the record label to {{terminate}} the band's contract and give the band ownership of their master recordings. The band based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. Metallica had sold 40million copies worldwide upon the filing of the suit. Metallica had been signed to the label for over a decade but was still operating under the terms of its original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate. The band members said they were taking the action because they were ambivalent about Robert Morgado's refusal to give them another record deal along with Bob Krasnow, who retired from his job at the label shortly afterwards. Elektra responded by counter-suing the band, but in December 1994, Warner Music Group United States chairman Doug Morris offered Metallica a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit, which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January 1995, both parties settled out of court with a <b>non-disclosure</b> agreement. Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.|$|E
