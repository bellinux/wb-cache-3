40|$|Maxillary {{hypoplasia}} is {{a common}} developmental problem in cleft lip and palate deformities. These deformities have traditionally been corrected by means of orthognathic surgery. Management of skeletal deformities in the maxillofacial region has been a challenge for maxillofacial surgeons and orthodontists. Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a surgical technique that uses body′s own repairing mechanisms for optimal reconstruction of the hard and soft tissues. We present four cases of anterior maxillary distraction osteogenesis with tooth-borne distraction device— Hyrax, which were analyzed retrospectively using cephalometrics. Changes in nasolabial angle and interincisal angle after distraction of anterior maxillary segment were studied to conclude that there was <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> in the the nasolabial angle while the interincisal angle showed marked improvement...|$|R
50|$|The {{story goes}} that Ram {{has a problem}} with his brain and is unable to control his hyper {{emotions}} about few things which makes him a beast at times. He would not even hesitate to kill and does not like anyone being praised or belittling him. In this process, he builds a grudge against his own brother who is good at everything and tries to kill him right during their childhood. Their mother (Seetha) is unable to tolerate all this and takes it upon herself to change Ram, so she takes him away from Hari to avoid further hatred but then not <b>much</b> <b>change</b> <b>happens</b> in the nature of Ram even after they grow up. Meanwhile, Hari is often chased by Anjali (Priyamani) who poses as a bank employee but in truth she is actually a CBI officer who comes to arrest Hari since she suspects his hand in the killings. Apparently, the doctor happens to be the younger brother of the health minister Siva Reddy (Kota Srinivasa Rao) and from then on the minister is closely {{on the heels of the}} killer. Anjali finally manages to arrest Hari successfully through a plan of hers and soon she realizes her folly when she chances upon his mother and understands the entire story of Hari and Ram.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Depending on the {{oxidation}} {{extent and}} the surface roughness after coating manufacturing, CoNiCrAlY coating displays different performance in thermal barrier coating systems. In this study, plasma-sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings were treated by dry-ice blasting. Various treatment approaches of dry-ice blasting were assessed by means of comparing the coating quality in terms of cross-sectional structure, oxide concentration, surface morphology and roughness, and microhardness. The results showed that CoNiCrAlY coating including decreased oxides and smoother internal texture can be obtained in comparison with that deposited by conventional APS, no matter what type of treatment. The oxidation content differs after using different jet angle and installation location of dry-ice blasting. To some extent, dry-ice blasting has some cleaning effect on those splashed particles. However, <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> can be recognized in the top-surface morphology and surface roughness, because of the relatively small hardness of dry-ice pellets. There is a slight decrease in hardness probably resulting from the decrease in the oxide...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{sharing in}} network society is common {{particularly}} with the current enormous {{increase in the number}} of Internet users with respect to limited resources. The emergence of new application such as real-time applications with more sensitivity and odd behavior required fundamental change in resource sharing policy. The delay which caused by congestion could sensationally demolish all the aspiration for delivering such sensitive application with respect to its restrictions. Scheduling mechanism plays an essential and crucial part of this function since queuing delay is the largest delay which experienced by the packet. Therefore, this paper is looking at the evolution of scheduling mechanism in the academic environment. We present the development in top-down approach form the last proposal to the very beginning. Although such approach provides a comprehensive knowledge, intensive information and rigorous tracking of the evolution of scheduling mechanism, the results shows that there is <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>changes</b> in the principle of the scheduling except for most recent scheduler named as Just Queuing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Some of {{the truck}} {{producer}} involved in production of municipal-service vehicles make some modifications in the main chassis and permit overloading on it. With doing these modifications some special instructions must be considered such as: decreasing speed, strengthening the springs and chassis beams, and so on. Hence chassis vibrational behavior will change the dynamic behavior of automobile effectively, adding auxiliary chassis is an alternative trend to change the rigidity. But, the main question that must be answered is: Are natural frequencies of the modified chassis in suitable range? So, this paper investigates the vibrational characteristics of the chassis before and after strengthening. For this purpose, the modal analysis has been accomplished by the commercial finite element packaged ANSYS and natural frequencies and mode shapes have been determined. In addition, the relationship between natural frequencies and engine operating speed has been explained and, finally advantages of the modified chassis {{which leads to the}} increase of the rigidity with <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>changes</b> in natural frequencies, has been discussed. The results show that the road excitation is the main disturbance to the truck chassis as the chassis natural frequencies lie within the road excitation frequency range...|$|R

The {{transition}} {{was being}} made from the older RORC to the then newer IOR rule, {{and because of this}} the decision was made by Sadler and Rogers not to design the yacht 'to a rule', but simply to produce the best design. This means the Contessa avoided the sometimes extreme dimensions associated with boats designed to achieve a favourable rating rather than simply to perform well. As the design has lived through the transition from the IOR to the IMS, the IMS to the IRC, and increasing popularity of the ORC rule, the decision not to design to a rule has been thoroughly borne out, and the Contessa has gained a timeless, 'classic' aura.|$|R

Classification methods like decision trees, machine learning, rule mining, etc can be applied on the educational data for forecasting the student’s behavior, performance of them in examination etc. This prediction will well helpful for tutors to classify the weak students and help them to score improved marks. The classification approach is applied on student’s internal assessment data to predict their performance in the final exam. The result of the classification categorized {{the number of students who}} are to be expected to fail or pass. The outcome result is given to the tutor and steps were taken to improve the performance of the students who were predicted as fail in the examination. After the statement of the results in the final examination the marks acquired by the students are provide into the system and the results were investigated. The proportional analysis results states that the prediction has helped the weaker students to improve and brought out betterment in the result. The algorithm is also analyzed by duplicating the same data and the result of the duplication brings <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> in predicting the student’s outcome.

40|$|Background: Hypercholesterolemia is the {{accepted}} causal {{risk factor for}} atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of cholesterol advised to tailor high-intensity statin for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, its impact of real clinical practice has not been examined in China. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 3592 patients with CAD were consecutively enrolled who were receiving statins in outpatient department (at least 4  weeks) before they were admitted to the ward at five University hospitals from April 2011 to December 2015. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to the admission time before (group A, n =  1521) or after (group B, n =  2071) online announcement date of 2013 ACC/AHA guideline. The situation of statin application and LDL-C target achievement (LDL-C <  1. 8  mmol/L) in both groups were compared. Results: Data indicated that the constituent ratio of different kinds of statins usage was significantly different between the two groups (p <  0. 05), and the proportion of rosuvastatin application grew up in group B (20. 00 %) when compared with group A (10. 50 %, p <  0. 05). However, the mean dosage of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin had no significant change. More importantly, the achievement of LDL-C target in both groups was still extremely low (27. 9 % in group A vs. 26. 9 % in group B, p =  0. 5077). Conclusion: <b>No</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> of clinical practice with regard to cholesterol management was found in Chinese patients with CAD, accompanied by very low achievement of LDL-C target, suggesting that there is a great room for the improvement of cholesterol control in Chinese patients with CAD...|$|R

The pastoralist respondents maintained that frequent, prolonged drought events have increased in severity over the past decade or so. This perception corroborate Nicholson’s ([2014]) assertion about drought events in northern Kenya, with rainfall being at least 50 % to 75 % below normal in almost half of the drought-stricken region and is likely to be linked to changing climatic conditions within the greater Horn of Africa.

It is argued that due to the frequency of shocks in the study area, adaptive or coping capacity and mechanisms adopted by vulnerable households could well have equal or larger ranges to that of exposure and sensitivity. As discussed earlier on vulnerability, the interaction of environmental (biophysical) forces determines exposures and sensitivities, and various social, cultural, political and economic forces shape adaptive capacity (Yohe and Tol [2002]; Turner et al.
