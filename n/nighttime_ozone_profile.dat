A SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> dataset has been generated for Payerne, Switzerland, with a temporal resolution of 3 profiles a week for the time period ranging from 2011 to 2013. The relative difference of the SASBE <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> to the AURA/MLS <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> lies between − 3 to 6 % over the vertical range of 20 – 65 km.

For most applications it is important that the climatology represents not only long term mean values but also the links between ozone and dynamic input parameters. These dynamic input parameters should be easily accessible from auxiliary datasets or easily measureable, and obviously should have a high correlation with <b>ozone.</b> For <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> these parameters are mainly total ozone column and temperature profile data. This was the outcome of a user consultation carried out in the framework of developing a new, dynamic <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology. The new <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatology is based on the Neural Network Ozone Retrieval System (NNORSY) widely used for <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> retrieval from UV and IR satellite sounder data. NNORSY allows implicit modelling of any non-linear correspondence between input parameters (predictors) and <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> target vector. This paper presents the approach, setup and validation of a new family of <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> climatologies with static as well as dynamic input parameters (total <b>ozone</b> and temperature <b>profile).</b> The neural network training relies on <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> measurement data of well known quality provided by ground based (ozonesondes) and satellite based (SAGE II, HALOE, and POAM-III) measurements over the years 1995 – 2007.

In this paper we present the <b>nighttime</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> distribution measured by GOMOS in 2003. We show monthly latitudinal distributions of the ozone number density and mixing ratio profiles, as well as the seasonal variations of profiles at several latitudes. The stratospheric profiles are compared with the Fortuin-Kelder daytime ozone climatology. Large differences are found in polar areas and they can be shown to be correlated with large increases of NO 2. In the upper stratosphere, ozone values from GOMOS are systematically larger than in the Fortuin-Kelder climatology, which {{can be explained by the}} diurnal variation. In the middle and lower stratosphere, GOMOS finds a few percent less ozone than Fortuin-Kelder.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} the smoothness of vertical <b>profiles</b> of <b>ozone</b> concentrations. We describe the smoothness of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> via a characteristic {{scale of the}} profile fluctuations. The characteristic scale was computed for 11 -years (1989 - 1999) ozone sonde data at Sodankylä. Mean values of the characteristic scale were determined. They are ~ 1 km in the troposphere and ~ 1. 4 km in the lower stratosphere (up to 25 km). Only slight seasonal variations of these parameters are observed. The information about smoothness of <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> is needed both in the instrumental design for defining the vertical resolution requirements and {{in the development of}} inversion algorithms from remote sensing measurements, in order to obtain the best accuracy in retrieved <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> and sufficient resolution...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, {{the decline}} of summertime daytime peak ozone in the last 20 years has been clearly {{connected}} to reductions in anthropogenic emissions. Yet questions remain on how and through what mechanisms ozone at other times of day have changed over the recent decades. Here we analyze the interannual variability and trends of ozone at different hours of day, using observations from about 1000 US sites during 1990 – 2014. We find a clear diurnal cycle both in the magnitude of ozone trends and in {{the relative importance of}} climate variability versus anthropogenic emissions to ozone changes. Interannual climate variability has mainly been associated with the de-trended fluctuation in the US annual daytime ozone over 1990 – 2014, with a much smaller effect on the <b>nighttime</b> <b>ozone.</b> Reductions in anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides have led to substantial growth in the US annual average <b>nighttime</b> <b>ozone</b> due to reduced ozone titration, while the summertime daytime ozone has declined. Environmental policymaking might consider further improvements to reduce ozone levels at night and other non-peak hours...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} {{simultaneous}} ozone and aerosol lidar measurements {{taken in the}} preriod July-early October 1991 are presented. The main problem for retrieving the <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> is the correction of the on and off DIAL signials. The backscattering ratio obtained by the off signal is {{used for this purpose}} and <b>ozone</b> <b>profile</b> are validated against ozonesonde data. A number ao cases are oresented including a few occasions of layers with large backscattering ratio...|$|R

The system {{is based on the}} existing TM 3 DAM scheme for assimilation of total ozone columns. For the GOA project (EU FP 5 project, contract no.

40|$|Satellite remote {{measurements}} of stratospheric aerosol and <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> using the solar occultation approach were analyzed {{based on the}} known properties of the atmospheric parameters. Atmospheric refraction effects which are important in this experiment were determined analytically. Different inversion techniques were developed based on inverting simulated irradiance data. It was shown that aerosol and <b>ozone</b> <b>profiles</b> in the stratosphere can be inverted from the irradiance measurements to an accuracy of better than 10 percent...|$|R
