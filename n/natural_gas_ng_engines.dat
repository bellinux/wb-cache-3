This study examines the factors which caused the LNG tank pressure on KV Bergen to fall, leading to the de-loading of the <b>Natural</b> <b>Gas</b> (<b>NG)</b> <b>engines.</b> One reason for the drop in tank pressure is that external disturbances from rough seas destroy the liquid surface layer, causing an increase in the rate of condensation occurring inside the tank.

40|$|Turbocharging port-injected <b>Natural</b> <b>Gas</b> (<b>NG)</b> <b>engines</b> {{allows them}} to recover gaseous-fuel related power gap with respect to {{gasoline}} engines. However, turbolag reduction is necessary to achieve high performance during engine transient operations and to improve vehicle fun-to-drive characteristics. Significant support {{for the study of}} turbocharged Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) engines and guidelines for the turbo-matching process can be provided by 1 -D numerical simulation tools. However, 1 -D models are predictive only when a careful tuning procedure is set-up and carried out {{on the basis of the}} experimental data. In this paper, a 1 -D model of a Heavy-Duty (HD) turbocharged CNG engine was set up in the GT-POWER (Gamma Technologies Inc., Westmont, IL, US) environment to simulate transient operations and to evaluate the turbolag. An extensive experimental activity was carried out to provide experimental data for model tuning. The model buildup and tuning processes are described in detail with specific reference to the turbocharger model, whose correct calibration is a key factor in accounting for the effects of turbine flow pulsations. The second part of the paper focuses on the evaluation of different strategies for turbolag reduction, namely, exhaust valve variable actuation and spark timing control. Such strategies were aimed at increasing the engine exhaust-gas power transferred to the turbine, thus reducing the time required to accelerate the turbocharger group. The effects of these strategies were examined for tip-in maneuvers at a fixed engine speed. Depending on the engine speed and the applied turbolag reduction strategy, turbolag reductions from 70 % to 10 % were achieve...|$|E

Considering the short ferry routes (about 4 km) and the ship operating profile (24 hours/day of continuative operation), two different solutions are compared for the renewed propulsion engine system: traditional diesel four stroke <b>engines</b> (DE) and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (<b>NG)</b> fueled marine <b>engines.</b> This second alternative {{is considered due to}} the better performance in terms of pollutant emissions and efficiency, if compared to DE of the same power and rotational speed, as verified by the authors in a recent paper. The different engines fuel types require different solutions for the fuel storage and handling that involve significant differences in the engine room layout, vessel structures, general arrangements, load capacity and ship stability.

40|$|A {{previously}} {{developed and}} validated zero-dimensional, multi-zone, thermodynamic combustion {{model for the}} prediction of spark ignition (SI) engine performance and nitric oxide (NO) emissions has been extended to include second-law analysis. The main characteristic of the model is {{the division of the}} burned gas into several distinct zones, in order to account for the temperature and chemical species stratification developed in the burned gas during combustion. Within the framework of the multi-zone model. the various availability components constituting the total availability of each of the multiple zones of the simulation are identified and calculated separately. The model is applied to a multi-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged and aftercooled, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (<b>NG)</b> SI <b>gas</b> <b>engine</b> running on synthesis gas (syngas) fuel. The major part of the unburned mixture availability consists of the chemical contribution, ranging from 98 % at the inlet valve closing (IVC) event to 83 % at the ignition timing of the total availability for the 100 % load case, which is due to the presence of the combustible fuel. On the contrary, the multiple burned zones possess mainly thermomechanical availability. Specifically, again for the 100 % load case, the total availability of the first burned zone at the exhaust valve opening (EVO) event consists of thermomechanical availability approximately by 90 %, with similar percentages for all other burned zones. Two definitions of the combustion exergetic efficiency are used to explore the degree of reversibility of the combustion process in each of the multiple burned zones. It is revealed that the crucial factor determining the thermodynamic perfection of combustion in each burned zone is the level of the temperatures at which combustion occurs in the zone, with minor influence of the whole temperature history of the zone during the complete combustion phase. The availability analysis is extended to various engine loads. The engine in question is supplied with increasingly leaner mixtures as loads rise {{in order to keep the}} emitted nitrogen oxides (NO,) low. Therefore, in-cylinder combustion temperatures are reduced, resulting in increased destruction of availability due to combustion and reduced availability losses due to heat transfer with the cylinder walls, when expressed as percentages of the fuel chemical availability. Specifically, when engine load increases from 40 % to 100 % of full load, with the relative air-fuel ratio also increasing from 1. 56 to 1. 83, the destroyed availability due to combustion rises from 14. 19 % to 15. 02 % of the fuel chemical availability, while the respective percentage of the Cumulative availability loss due to heat transfer decreases from 13. 37 % to 9. 05 %.
