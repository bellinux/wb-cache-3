50|$|A new {{approach}} to seismic <b>noise</b> <b>studies</b> will be introduced with the EarthScope project, in {{that there are no}} attempts to screen the continuous waveforms to eliminate body and surface waves from the naturally occurring earthquakes. Earthquake signals are not generally included in the processing of noise data, because they are generally low probability occurrences, even at low power levels. The two objectives behind the collection of the seismic noise data are to provide and document a standard method to calculate ambient seismic background noise, and to characterize the variation of ambient background seismic noise levels across the United States as a function of geography, season, and time of day. The new statistical approach will provide the ability to compute probability density functions (PDFs) to evaluate the full range of noise at a given seismic station, allowing the estimation of noise levels over a broad range of frequencies from 0.01-16 Hz (100-0.0625s period). With the use of this new method it will be much easier to compare seismic noise characteristics between different networks in different regions.|$|E
50|$|Laboratory studies {{reported}} {{many examples of}} dramatic improvements in sensitivities from appropriately structured perceptual learning tasks. In visual Vernier acuity tasks, observers judge whether one line is displaced above or below a second line. Untrained observers are often already very good with this task, but after training, observers' threshold {{has been shown to}} improve as much as 6 fold. Similar improvements have been found for visual motion discrimination and orientation sensitivity.In visual search tasks, observers are asked to find a target object hidden among distractors or in <b>noise.</b> <b>Studies</b> of perceptual learning with visual search show that experience leads to great gains in sensitivity and speed. In one study by Karni and Sagi, the time it took for subjects to search for an oblique line among a field of horizontal lines was found to improve dramatically, from about 200ms in one session to about 50ms in a later session. With appropriate practice, visual search can become automatic and very efficient, such that observers do not need more time to search when there are more items present on the search field. Tactile perceptual learning has been demonstrated on spatial acuity tasks such as tactile grating orientation discrimination, and on vibrotactile perceptual tasks such as frequency discrimination; tactile learning on these tasks has been found to transfer from trained to untrained fingers. Practice with Braille reading and daily reliance on the sense of touch may underlie the enhancement in tactile spatial acuity of blind compared to sighted individuals.|$|E
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{difficulties}} with urban environmental noise mapping is disseminating results from <b>noise</b> <b>studies</b> {{in a manner that}} is easily under stood by the general public. Indeed, it is one of the requirements of the Environmental Noise Directive (END) that information from <b>noise</b> <b>studies</b> is disseminated to the general public so that awareness of environmental noise issues is increased. This paper presents preliminary work undertaken to integrate results from environmental <b>noise</b> <b>studies</b> into a virtual sound environment. The model uses appropriate sound mixing techniques to integrate background sound from prediction software while direct sound is integrated from appropriate sound samples. In the virtual environment sound is output using audio rendering and clustering techniques which take account of the position of the individual in the virtual environment. The model demonstrates the possibility of using virtual urban simulations as a framework for evaluating the environmental and visual impact of major urban developments particularly in terms of the impact on the surrounding urban sounds cape. In addition, the model framework may be used as a demonstration method whereby the sensitivity of the urban sound environment to different traffic management scenarios is presented to urban inhabitants...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a successful case <b>study</b> of <b>noise</b> assessment and abatement {{for a new}} racetrack in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. The first races at the new facility generated widespread concern about noise. In the absence of applicable noise regulations, the county administration contracted for a <b>noise</b> <b>study</b> to evaluate the impact of racing noise in the adjacent rural community, and to examine appropriate noise abatement strategies. The owner desired a permit {{to increase the number}} of race days over what had been approved, and agreed to limit vehicle noise emissions and enforce the use of mufflers. The <b>noise</b> <b>study</b> evaluated expected community reaction based on Normalized DNL for existing conditions and future conditions with appropriate <b>noise</b> abatement. The <b>study’s</b> abatement recommendations were developed in coordination with the county and the owner, and included noise limits on individual vehicles and noise shielding around the track. The study projected significant average reduction in Normalized DNL in the surrounding community for the future conditions. The owner implemented noise abatement inexpensively, and the county employed noise monitors at two locations. Monitoring results indicate that measured DNL is below the desired maximum, and the model predicted DNL from racing activity accurately. Community complaints about racing noise have dropped. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{integrates}} {{findings from}} the literature and new results regarding noise sensitivity. The new results are based on analyses of 28 combined datasets (N= 23 038), and separate analyses of a large aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>study</b> (N= 10939). Three topics regarding noise sensitivity are discussed, namely, its relationship with noise exposure, its working mechanism, and the scope of its influence. (1) A previous review found that noise sensitivity has no relationship with noise exposure. The current analyses give consistent results, and {{show that there is}} at most a very weak positive relationship. (2) It was observed earlier that noise sensitivity alters the effect of noise exposure on noise annoyance, and does not (only) have an additive effect. The current analyses confirm this, and show that the relation of the annoyance score with the noise exposure is relatively flat for nonsensitives while it is steeper for sensitives. (3) Previous <b>studies</b> showed that <b>noise</b> sensitivity also influences reactions other than noise annoyance. The current analyses of the aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>study</b> extend these results, but also indicate that noise sensitivity has relatively little influence on reactions to nonenvironmental conditions. © 2003 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{systematic}} noise effects {{started in}} Germany {{back in the}} fifties with basic experimental studies on humans. As a result, noise was classified as a non-specific stressor, which could cause an ergotropic activation of the complete organism. In the light of this background research a hypothesis was proposed that long-term noise exposure could have an adverse effect on health. This hypothesis was further supported by animal studies. Since the sixties, the adverse effects of chronic road traffic noise exposure were further examined in humans {{with the help of}} epidemiological studies. More epidemiological aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>studies</b> followed in the 1970 s and thereafter. The sample size was increased, relevant confounding factors were taken into account, and the exposure and health outcomes were investigated objectively and with higher quality measures. To date, more than 20 German epidemiological traffic <b>noise</b> <b>studies</b> have focused on noise-induced health effects, mainly on the cardiovascular system. In particular, the newer German <b>noise</b> <b>studies</b> demonstrate a clear association between residential exposure to traffic noise (particularly night noise) and cardiovascular outcomes. Nevertheless, additional research is needed, particularly on vulnerable groups and multiple noise exposures. The epidemiological findings have still not been fully considered in German regulations, particularly for aircraft noise. The findings, however, were taken into account in national recommendations. The Federal Environment Agency recommends noise rating levels of 65 dB(A) for the day and 55 dB(A) for the night, as a short-term goal. In the medium term, noise rating levels of 60 / 50 (day, night) should be reached and noise rating levels of 55 / 45 in the long run...|$|E
