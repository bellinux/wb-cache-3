40|$|The {{problem of}} the <b>no-answer</b> <b>rate</b> in both {{personal}} and telephone surveys has been an issue of great concern in the sector for decades. Several {{studies have shown that}} the two principal components of this variable, namely the inaccessibility of potential respondents and their refusal to participate in surveys, have evolved in a negative manner. Changing lifestyles, the development of new technologies and saturation caused by the growing demands of the marketing sector and commercial and social research are all factors that serve, in part, to explain the increasing difficulties involved in producing complete samples. However, these factors do not affect the entire population in the same manner. Indeed, the {{problem of the}} <b>no-answer</b> <b>rate</b> affects respondents with different profiles in diverse ways. Traditionally, young people have been a difficult population to locate, albeit when contact is made, they are generally more willing to take part in surveys. As regards the issue of location, there are numerous conditioning factors that affect this group to a larger degree such as job instability or geographic mobility. Furthermore, as the literature has pointed out, young people are more difficult to contact once they have been localised due to the fact that they tend to spend less time at home than other types of respondents. The aim of the present paper is to explore in depth the specific difficulties involved in locating and gaining access to younger populations in survey research. To do so, data is analysed on incidences that have occurred when doing field work for different computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted by the Institute for Advanced Social Studies of Andalusia, as well as other data arising from secondary statistical sources.
