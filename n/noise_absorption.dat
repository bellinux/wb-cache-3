50|$|Initially, riometers were single, wide-beam {{detectors}} and measured the cosmic <b>noise</b> <b>absorption</b> (CNA). Multi-beam riometers {{have also been}} developed, which have multiple narrow beams, typically formed by a Butler matrix on a phased antenna array. Each beam forms its own riometer and has its own quiet-day curve determination. These individual beams form pixels on the sky allowing simple images of cosmic <b>noise</b> <b>absorption</b> to be formed. More recently, interferometry {{has been used to}} provide all-sky, spatially-continuous imaging of CNA. It is also possible to use riometers to observe multiple frequencies (typically in the range 25-40 MHz). An inverse problem technique {{can be applied to the}} measurements to ascertain not just the absorption, but a model of the electron content as a function of sight distance.|$|E

Ideal acoustical panels are those without a face or finish material that interferes with the acoustical infill or substrate. Fabric covered panels are one way to heighten acoustical absorption. Perforated metal shows also sound absorbing qualities. Finish material is used to cover over the acoustical substrate. Mineral fiber board, or Micore, is a commonly used acoustical substrate. Finish materials often consist of fabric, wood or acoustical tile. Fabric can be wrapped around substrates to create what {{is referred to as}} a [...] "pre-fabricated panel" [...] and often provides good <b>noise</b> <b>absorption</b> if laid onto a wall.|$|E

50|$|Short wave {{radio waves}} (in the HF range) are {{absorbed by the}} {{increased}} particles in the low altitude ionosphere causing a complete blackout of radio communications. This is called a short wave fading. These fadeouts last {{for a few minutes}} to a few hours and are most severe in the equatorial regions where the Sun is most directly overhead. The ionospheric disturbance enhances long wave (VLF) radio propagation. SIDs are observed and recorded by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter.A whole array of sub-classes of SIDs exist, detectable by different techniques at various wavelengths: the SPA (Sudden Phase Anomaly), SFD (Sudden Frequency Deviation), SCNA (Sudden Cosmic <b>Noise</b> <b>Absorption),</b> SEA (Sudden Enhancement of Atmospherics), etc.|$|E

A typical joint is a bellows of metal (most commonly stainless steel), plastic (such as PTFE), fabric (such as glass fibre) or an elastomer such as rubber. A bellows {{is made up}} of a series of convolutions, with the shape of the convolution designed to withstand the internal pressures of the pipe, but flexible enough to accept axial, lateral, and angular deflections. Expansion joints are also designed for other criteria, such as <b>noise</b> <b>absorption,</b> anti-vibration, earthquake movement, and building settlement. Metal expansion joints have to be designed according to rules laid out by EJMA, for fabric expansion joints there are guidelines and a state-of-the-art description by the Quality Association for Fabric Expansion Joints. Pipe expansion joints are also known as [...] "compensators", as they compensate for the thermal movement.|$|E

40|$|Ground-based {{images of}} auroral optical {{emissions}} and cosmic radio <b>noise</b> <b>absorption</b> {{provide information on}} particle precipitation which enhances ionospheric conductances. Knowledge of this conductance field {{is important to understand}} the current systems associated with auroral features. Three methods of using ground-based optical and riometer data to estimate ionospheric conductances in the aurora are compared to conductances derived from incoherent scatter radar measurements. It is shown that a method using the 557. 7 nm emission intensity alone gives the best results for the Pedersen conductance whilst a method using both this intensity and cosmic <b>noise</b> <b>absorption</b> is best for the Hall conductance. A method using cosmic <b>noise</b> <b>absorption</b> alone gives reasonable performance for the Hall conductance and the Hall/Pedersen conductance ratio, but performs poorly for the Pedersen conductance. It also appears to underestimate the Hall conductance significantly during times when softer precipitation is present, for example in discrete auroral arcs.

40|$|Abstract. We present {{simultaneous}} riometer {{observations of}} cosmic <b>noise</b> <b>absorption</b> in the nightside and dawn-noon sectors during sawtooth particle injections during 18 April 2002.

This event provides an opportunity to compare the absorption that accompanies periodic electron injections with the accepted paradigm of substorm-related absorption.

30|$|The {{result of}} the PHITS {{simulation}} for model C {{is represented by the}} black lines in Fig.  5 b.
