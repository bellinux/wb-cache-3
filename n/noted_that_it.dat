5|$|Breaking with tradition, the Fighting Irish {{announced}} in June {{that they would}} be wearing their alternative green jerseys instead of blue against USC; Weis <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in honor of the 1977Irish team that switched to green jerseys before defeating the Trojans en route to a national championship (Weis was a student at Notre Dame at the time). Previously, the Irish did not let the public know when they would be wearing their green jerseys.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was rather}} simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of user-friendly options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E

Amstrad Action rated this version at 54% calling it challenging, but lacking in action. They described environmental detail and fighting as the high points, but criticized sound as poor and graphics as slow.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Drax Power Limited, in {{response}} to a government consultation, stated they were sponsoring development studies into carbon capture and storage (CCS), but <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not then commercially viable, with costs comparable with nuclear or offshore wind power. On 17 June 2009, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband announced plans to require all UK coal-fired power stations should be fitted with CCS technology by the early 2020s or face closure.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of Spec Ops: The Line {{were mostly}} positive, with many critics praising the narrative, themes, and the provocative take on {{violence}} in video games, but <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> failed to innovate or present a strong multiplayer component.

Previews of the game, {{as well as the}} game itself, were banned in the United Arab Emirates for the depiction of Dubai in a state of destruction.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have disagreed with parts of Watson's proposal, {{arguing that the}} four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period, and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman irrigation network in Spain.

5|$|The {{election}} of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate.

The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.|$|E
5|$|A {{remake of}} Conker's Bad Fur Day, titled , was {{ultimately}} released for the Xbox in 2005 to generally favourable critical reception. Developers <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was difficult to}} port the game to the Xbox system because Bad Fur Days microcoded performance optimisations had been deeply customised for the Nintendo 64 hardware. Conker: Live & Reloaded features updated graphics and a multiplayer mode that supports the Xbox Live service. Additionally, some aspects in the single-player mode were adjusted: several minor obscenities within the voice dialogue that {{are present in the}} Nintendo 64 game were censored at Microsoft's request, the camera control was refined and improved with a zoom function, and an auto-targeting system was added to the game.|$|E

5|$|A soundtrack album, Soma Bringer Original Soundtrack, was {{released}} through the Sleigh Bells label on April 2, 2008. The soundtrack covers three discs. In addition to tracks used in-game, the album includes four tracks with full orchestral versions of particular tracks. Ben Schweitzer, writing for RPGFan, positively compared the score to earlier works by Mitsuda, calling it his best recent soundtrack despite some tracks being overly similar to earlier work. Don Kotowski of Video Game Music Online gave the soundtrack album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. He frequently praised Mitsuda's style, and like Schweitzer <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> often recalled his earlier work. He also praised the additional tracks for their richness and depth, finishing his review {{by saying that}} it was a soundtrack not to be missed by buyers of video game music.|$|E
5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} towards Living Proof was mixed. Some music critics <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was even}} better than Believe, while others criticized the excessive use of Auto-Tune. Commercially, the album did not reach the same success as its predecessor, debuting at number nine on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 82,000 copies. It was also received moderately in Europe, peaking within the top 30 in Sweden and the top 50 in the United Kingdom, despite being certified gold by both Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF) and British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Living Proof is estimated to have sold {{more than a million}} copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, four ceramic sherds {{were found in}} the vicinity which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; although most of these were dated to the fourth century, the sherds reflected all four centuries of this period. Dated to the fourth century was a hut that had been erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Evidence of human activity at this hut was found in the form of 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E
5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and {{is powered by a}} USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could also be used to record iPad games with the right setup.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{had spoken}} out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When {{it reached the}} Senate floor in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray <b>noted</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E
