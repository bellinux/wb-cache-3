5000|$|Their Honours {{held that}} the Excise Tariff Act 1906 was invalid {{because it was not}} in {{substance}} a tax, but rather an impermissible attempt to regulate the conditions of manufacture, and that went beyond extent of the taxation power. Their Honours approached the substance of the Act by considering the position of the States, which could directly regulate the wages of employees in manufacturing, and could enforce that with a penalty for <b>non-compliance.</b> <b>A</b> State could not impose an excise as this power was exclusive to the Commonwealth. It followed in their Honour's judgement that such a penalty, even if calculated by reference to the quantity of articles manufactured, was not an excise, where the purpose was [...] "not {{to raise money for the}} purposes of government, but to regulate the conditions of labour". The Excise Tariff Act was held to be in substance a regulation of the manufacture". The decision in this respect has been criticised as a collapse into formalism, holding that 'motive' and 'consequences' were irrelevant while the 'purpose apparent on its face' was relevant. Further a particular tax may have more than one objective.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{literature}} on regulatory instruments considers efficiency in terms of monetary costs. CAC has been labelled by many critics as ‘inefficient’ as a system that spends resources but generates little revenue. The cost of compliance is perceived to be high, which can result in costs that are higher than the sanctions for <b>non-compliance.</b> <b>A</b> summary of 10 studies demonstrated significant differences in cost between CAC and least cost alternatives. Some have moved to defend certain aspects of a CAC approach, arguing against the commonly held belief that these regimes are inherently inefficient. Economics incentives are frequently referred to as a considerably more efficient approach to regulation. The most commonly used incentives in this method relate to tax. The administrative costs of tax collection can be understated. Advocates of incentives have been accused of making simplifying assumptions and not fully taking into account the costs of administrating tax systemsIn some circumstances, CAC regulation can end up being a less costly option. Whilst economic instruments may act to reduce compliance costs, in certain cases their total costs may actually be higher, This may stem from the high level of monitoring that is required to make an incentivised method viable and successful.|$|E

The impact on compliance is quantified, using survey data from purchasing professionals of the Dutch Ministry of Defence.

40|$|This paper reviews {{three decades}} of gender quota {{policies}} in Germany and assesses policy adoption in parties, public administration, {{as well as on}} corporate and public boards. Germany was an early adopter of quotas for women in political parties and in public administration. Even though both measures were controversial when first enacted in the 1980 s and early 1990 s, they have since become rather low-profile gender equality strategies. A recent initiative to adopt quotas for women on corporate and public boards, by contrast, produced substantial public discussion. The mainstreaming of positive action plans in public institutions that include decision quotas, fixed quotas and goal quotas has given gender advocates formally strong leverage to advance a gender equality agenda. At the same time, a culture of minimalist compliance has pervaded the public sector and parties. Male institutions and organizations tend to exhibit more passive resistance than vocal opposition, thus making it difficult for feminists to engage effectively with <b>non-compliance.</b> <b>A</b> lack of sanctions as well as intricate strategies to circumvent quota decisions add to a sense among German feminist activists that quotas are one, but {{by no means the only}} strategy for gender equality in public life...|$|E
40|$|What is an {{effective}} and efficient enforcement policy for fire safety in the catering industry? When and why is an informal, cooperative enforcement style through warnings, persuasion and advice (a so called compliance strategy) effective in inducing compliance with the fire safety regulation? The standard economic model of enforcement {{stresses the importance of}} immediately punishing individuals and firms for <b>non-compliance</b> (<b>a</b> deterrence strategy). Part I of this thesis analyzes the economic literature to discuss whether and when a compliance strategy can be beneficial. It discusses which enforcement method (private, administrative or criminal) is effective and efficient to enforce safety standards. Part II of this thesis analyzes the optimal enforcement policy for the case of fire safety in the catering industry in the Netherlands. Enforcement officials have been interviewed to examine the use of a compliance strategy in practice. The benefits and costs of the enforcement efforts of the past years are estimated to see whether these efforts have been a desirable investment. Also, the compensation of the victims of the Volendam disaster is investigated to analyze the incentive to take precautions. Finally, a simulation of different enforcement policies in a representative municipality examines which policy is efficient. Promotor: K. P. Goudswaard, Co-promotor: B. C.

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{represents a}} significant economic opportunity for Europe. However, this growth {{is threatened by}} adoption barriers largely related to trust. This position paper examines trust and confidence issues in cloud computing and advances a case for addressing them through {{the implementation of a}} novel trustmark scheme for cloud service providers. The proposed trustmark would be both active and dynamic featuring multi-modal information about the performance of the underlying cloud service. The trustmarks would be informed by live performance data from the cloud service provider, or ideally an independent third-party accountability and assurance service that would communicate up-to-date information relating to service performance and dependability. By combining assurance measures with a remediation scheme, cloud service providers could both signal dependability to customers and the wider marketplace and provide customers, auditors and regulators with a mechanism for determining accountability in the event of failure or <b>non-compliance.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the trustmarks would convey to consumers of cloud services and other stakeholders that strong assurance and accountability measures are in place for the service in question and thereby address trust and confidence issues in cloud computing.

40|$|For {{over more}} than 50 years the EU Commission has used a {{deterrence}} approach in the imposition of fines to enforce EU competition law and pursue the EU competition policy. Although, it has adopted many other instruments to enhance its detection rate and provide more efficient and forward-looking outcomes in pro of competition; the aim to deter {{in order to achieve}} prevention has not changed. Nevertheless, empirical evidence has shown that the optimal deterrence framework based on the legal-economic theory is far from even deterring let alone prevent. Criminology and behavioural economics have provided new insights that call for the adoption of a more realistic approach that seeks to elevate the perception of certainty of punishment by increasing the informal costs for individuals and undertakings’ subunits who can prevent competition law violations in the first place. In this regard, a compliance approach that seeks to elevate the immediate costs perception and create a monitoring network that can effectively influence social norms that constraint behaviour, is able to result in a culture of compliance that makes <b>non-compliance</b> <b>a</b> less likely option. By embracing instruments such as compliance programmes, designation of external monitors and availability of whistleblowing rewards among others, the social internalization of compliance norms is feasible and thus, prevention possible...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the population health effects, costs and cost effectiveness of selected cataract surgery interventions {{in areas of}} the world with different epidemiological profiles. METHODS: Effectiveness estimates are based on {{a review of the literature}} taking into account factors such as operative failure, complications and patient <b>non-compliance.</b> <b>A</b> population model was applied to follow the lifelong impact on individuals having cataract surgery. Costing estimates are based on primary data collected in 14 epidemiological subregions by regional costing teams and on a literature review. Costings were estimated for different geographical coverage levels using non-linear cost functions. FINDINGS: Intra- and extra-capsular cataract surgeries are cost-effective ways to reduce the impact of cataract-blindness. Extra-capsular cataract surgery is more cost-effective than intra-capsular surgery in all regions considered. Providing extra-capsular cataract surgery to 95 % of those who need it (95 % coverage level) would avert over 3. 5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per year globally. The cost-effectiveness ranges from 57 International dollars (1 dollar) per DALY in the WHO South-East Asia Region where there is high overall child and adult mortality to 1 dollar 2307 per DALY in the WHO Western Pacific Region where there is low overall child and adult mortality. CONCLUSION: Extra-capsular surgery for cataracts at a high level of coverage is the most cost-effective way of restoring sight in all epidemiological subregions considered. Analysts from countries within a region are encouraged to further contextualize the results based on their own country's specific parameters...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates implementation {{problems in}} economic sanctions {{and how a}} state's concerns about policy implementation affect its decisions and the outcomes of sanctions. This study builds {{on the premise that}} sanctions are carried out by firms within a sanctioning state, not the state itself. First, using a game-theoretical model, I show that firms' non-compliance with sanction policies not only undermines the effectiveness of unilateral sanctions, but also has a counter-intuitive effect on a sanctioning state's decision to impose sanctions. The model suggests that a state is more likely to impose sanctions when it anticipates firms' <b>non-compliance.</b> <b>A</b> number of empirical implications are derived from the model and corroborated with data. Second, this study also investigates a sanctioning state's decision to sanction multilaterally or unilaterally, and how its expectations about the enforcement of sanctions influence this decision. When the enforcement of unilateral sanctions is expected to be difficult, the state is more likely to sanction multilaterally, but only when it has enough resources and the bureaucratic capability to help other states enforce their sanctions. The empirical evidence also buttresses these theoretical results. This study highlights the importance of incorporating expectations about enforcement into a full understanding of the sanctions processes. The conclusion is that states' ability to influence firms' decisions at home as well as abroad is a crucial determinant of whether they impose, how they design, and the effectiveness of sanctions...|$|E

An evidence-based organizational model of colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) should assure feasibility and high compliance. Methods A multidisciplinary Working Group (WG), reviewed literature and guidelines to define evidence-based recommendations. The WG identified {{the need for}} further local studies: physicians' CRCS attitudes, the effect of test type and provider on compliance, and individual reasons for <b>non-compliance.</b> <b>A</b> survey of digestive endoscopy services was conducted. A feasibility study on a target population of 300. 000 has begun. Results Based on the results of population trials and on literature review the screening strategy adopted was Faecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) every two years for 50 – 74 year olds and, for positives, colonoscopy. The immunochemical test was chosen because it has 20 % higher compliance than the Guaiac. GPs were chosen as the preferred provider also for higher compliance. Since we observed that distance is the major determinant of non-compliance, we choose GPs because they are the closest providers, both geographically and emotionally, to the public. The feasibility study showed several barriers: GP participation was low, there were administrative problems to involve GPs; opportunistic testing by the GPs; difficulties in access to Gastroenterology centres; difficulties in gathering colonoscopy results; little time given to screening activity by the gastroenterology centre.

40|$|Background While Koch’s postulates {{have been}} {{fulfilled}} for Lyme disease; causing transient fever, anorexia and arthritis in young dogs; treatment of sero-positive dogs, especially asymptomatic animals, remains {{a topic of}} debate. To complicate this matter the currently recommended antibiotic treatments of Lyme Disease in dogs caused by Borrelia burgdorferi require daily oral administrations for 31 days or longer, which makes <b>non-compliance</b> <b>a</b> concern. Additionally, there is no approved veterinary antimicrobial {{for the treatment of}} Lyme Disease in dogs in the USA and few recommended treatments have been robustly tested. In vitro testing of cefovecin, a novel extended-spectrum cephalosporin, demonstrated inhibition of spirochete growth. A small pilot study in dogs indicated that two cefovecin injections two weeks apart would be as efficacious against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto as the recommended treatments using doxycycline or amoxicillin daily for 31 days. This hypothesis was tested in 17 – 18 week old Beagle dogs, experimentally infected with B. burgdorferisensu stricto, using wild caught ticks, 75 days prior to antimicrobial administration. Results Clinical observations for lameness were performed daily but were inconclusive as this characteristic sign of Lyme Disease rarely develops in the standard laboratory models of experimentally induced infection. However, each antibiotic tested was efficacious against B. burgdorferi as measured by a rapid elimination of spirochetes from the skin and reduced levels of circulating antibodies to B. burgdorferi. In addition, significantly less cefovecin treated animals had Lyme Disease associated histopathological changes compared to untreated dogs. Conclusions Convenia was efficacious against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in dogs as determined by serological testing, PCR and histopathology results. Convenia provides an additional and effective treatment option for Lyme Disease in dogs...|$|E
