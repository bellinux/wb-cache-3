40|$|Quality of life {{in third}} world {{countries}} around the world is mostly dependent on the availability of food and water, sanitation, and affordable healthcare. Hence, easy access to fresh clean water and health diagnostics is crucial for leveraging these communities out of poverty. In light of these challenges, the recent decade has brought marked advances in the field of bio- and chemical sensors for detection of various infectious diseases and assessment of water quality. Investigations exploiting novel materials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, conductive polymers, and metal nanoparticles have shown the feasibility of miniaturization of diagnostic sensors. Furthermore, instruments for promising detection techniques such as quartz micro-balance, surface acoustic waves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy {{have been shown to be}} miniaturizable, truly opening the way for field-use of biosensors outside the standard lab settings. At the same time, numerous microfluidic platforms were introduced. These are crucial when handling complex fluids such as blood or urine, and generally integrating sensor into lab-on-a-chip devices. The aspect that is gaining more attention recently is the cost when trying to bring these sensors out of the lab to the market. Commercialization requires the use of scalable technologies that are easily accessible for mass production. Usually, in fundamental research, silicon or glass substrates are used, and the chips are produced in expensive clean-room facilities. Although standard clean room techniques are also scalable if produced in vast amounts, they are often too expensive to allow lower volume market entry for new products. Therefore, a lot of effort has been directed introduce low-cost technologies such as roll-to-roll printing, hot embossing, and injection molding. We have recently demonstrated a low-cost approach using simple printed devices for the electrochemical real-time detection of neurotransmitter release. 1 Now we are looking forward to apply high-precision ink-jet printing for the fabrication of microelectrode-based electrochemical sensors. Various conducting materials are available for printing as ink formulations, such as gold or silver nanoparticle-based inks as well as carbon-based materials that are not readily available for most standard clean-room processes such as carbon nanotubes. Features down to approximately 20 µm, are achievable via careful adjustment of substrate surface chemistry and ink viscosity as well as surface tension. Moreover, ink-jet <b>nanoinks</b> can be applied to any surface, either hydrophobic or hydrophilic, owing to the availability of both water-based and hydrocarbon-based inks. We would like to utilize these unique properties and print the microelectrodes directly into the microfluidic devices. The latter also need to be produced in a cost-effective way, and preferably be roll-to-roll scalable. That is why we are testing such widespread materials as polyethylene or polycarbonate, with structures being applied via hot-embossing. We believe, that the transfer of existing sensing methods from clean-room to printing technologies will allow significant cost reduction of devices. In addition to that, availability of novel materials and substrates, only available for printing methods, will open up new sensing approaches and offer further technology development. At last, reduction of reagents used throughout the fabrication and almost waste-free processes enable sustainable manufacturing of sensing devices, the benefits of which can spread into point-of-care diagnostics and water treatment...|$|R

Furthermore, the additional sonication process, introduced to the soft-{{printing process}}, could facilitate further decreasing the thickness of residual layer. Consequently, ZnO nanostructures having negligible residual layer were successfully fabricated, and Ag nanostructures having 63. 1 % average transmittance were demonstrated.

The microstructure of the sintered copper film was investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray micro tomography, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The sintered copper film has a grainy structure with neck-like junctions. The resulting resistivity was 5  μΩ[*]cm of electrical resistivity which is only 3 times as high as that of bulk copper.

30|$|There is no {{surprise}} {{to the fact that}} organic silver conductive ink (OSC ink) has received increasing attention as a potentially much lower cost alternative[19 – 21]. This kind of ink mainly consists of a silver carrier, weak reduction agent, solvent, and additives, and a continuous conductive silver track can be fabricated during the sintering process. This strategy can compensate for the lack of conductive metal <b>nanoink</b> and thus becomes the development direction of conductive ink for macroelectronics[22 – 25].|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} flash light {{sintering}} of inkjet-printed silver <b>nanoink</b> and show its application in printed and flexible thin film transistors. Flash method, which uses pulsed light to sinter metal nanoparticles, {{is a very}} fast and low-temperature sintering method. Hence, it facilitates in quick fabrication of low cost, flexible electronic devices. In the current work, various silver patterns were obtained by inkjet printing of silver <b>nanoink</b> on flexible substrate and then the patterns were sintered by flashmethod. Several flash sintering parameters were carefully optimized to achieve high electrical conductivity. In next stage, such printed and flash sintered silver patterns were used as source and drain contacts in thin-film transistor. Indium tin oxide coated polyethylene terephthalate sheet was used as substrate as well as bottom gate contact in transistor structure. On the other hand, polystyrene and pentacene were used in gate dielectric and channel layer, respectively. Such printed transistor with channel length of 28 mu m and width of 68 mu m exhibited field effect mobility of 0. 09 cm(2) V(- 1) s(- 1) and ON/ OFF ratio {{on the order of}} 106. Finally, a comparative study was made between transistor performance with printed silver contacts and vacuum deposited silver contacts to ensure printing and sintering steps do not cause any notable degradation to the organic semiconducting layer...|$|E
40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} of electrode using copper nanoparticle ink is presented. Electrode was printed on a flexible glass epoxy composite substrate using drop on demand piezoelectric dispenser and was sintered at 200 °C in N 2 gas condition. The printed electrodes {{were made with}} various widths and thicknesses. Surface morphology of electrode was analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). Reliable dimensions for printed electronics were found from this study. 	Single-crystalline silicon solar cells were tested under four-point bending to find the feasibility of directly integrating them onto a carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminate. These solar cells {{were not able to}} withstand 0. 2 % strain. On the other hand, thin-film amorphous silicon solar cells were subjected to flexural fatigue loadings. The current density-voltage curves were analyzed at different cycles, and there was no noticeable degradation on its performance up to 100 cycles. A multifunctional composite laminate which can harvest and store solar energy was fabricated using printed electrodes. The integrated printed circuit board (PCB) was co-cured with a carbon/epoxy composite laminate by the vacuum bag molding process in an autoclave; an amorphous silicon solar cell and a thin-film solid state lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery were adhesively joined and electrically connected to a thin flexible PCB; and then the passive components such as resistors and diodes were electrically connected to the printed circuit board by silver pasting. Since a thin-film solid state Li-ion battery was not able to withstand tensile strain above 0. 4 %, thin Li-ion polymer batteries were tested under various mechanical loadings and environmental conditions to find the feasibility of using the polymer batteries for our multifunctional purpose. It was found that the Li-ion polymer batteries were stable under pressure and tensile loading without any noticeable degradation on its charge and discharge performances. Also, the active materials did not decompose at 80 °C, and the battery was performing well under low temperature of - 27 °C. Lastly, the batteries were embedded inside a carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminate to characterize their performance under fatigue loading. Finally, an intense pulsed light (IPL) was used to sinter printed silver <b>nanoink</b> patterns. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to find grain size of printed silver <b>nanoink</b> patterns. From these analyses it was confirmed that IPL is able to adequately sinter silver <b>nanoink</b> patterns for printed electronics without degradation of the substrates in less than 30 ms...|$|E

Such plasmonic interfaces enhance light absorption and photocurrent in solar cells. We report a cost-effective and scalable room temperature/pressure spin-coating route to fabricate broadband plasmonic interfaces consisting of silver NPs. The NP interface yields photocurrent enhancement (PE) in thin film silicon devices by up to 200 % which is significantly greater than previously reported values. For coatings produced from Ag <b>nanoink</b> containing particles with average diameter of 40 [*]nm, an optimal NP surface coverage ϕ of 7 % is observed. Scanning electron microscopy of interface morphologies revealed that for low ϕ, particles are well separated, resulting in broadband PE.

The composition of Al in the resulting NP is related solely to the composition of the reaction mixture and the size is controllable with the temperature of the reaction. The AZO NP dispersion has been proven to be stable over a 24 h period by dynamic light scattering measurements. The influence of the synthetic conditions, such as temperature, reaction time and the Al doping content, on the properties of NPs have also been investigated.

The effect of carbon nanotube length was also studied with regard to enhancing the conductivity and fatigue resistance of flash light sintered Cu NP/CNT composite films.

30|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{technology is}} an emerging area, where existing printing technologies {{are used to}} enable the flexible, large-area, low-cost, and environment-friendly mass production of electronic devices, such as organic photovoltaics (OPVs), copper indium gallium diselenide solar cells CIGSs), {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs), radio-frequency identification (RFID), and flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBSs) [1]. As printed electronics involves the convergence of various technologies, such as printing, fine mechanics, electronics, and nanotechnology, this raises new concerns over health and safety [2]. Especially, printed electronic devices include conductive nanoparticles, nanotubes such as single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs), nanoplates such as graphene, and new chemicals with unidentified health and safety effects. These nanomaterials used in printed electronics have been known to cause health effects in in vitro cellular toxicity studies as well as in vivo animal toxicity studies. Since risk is function of hazard and exposure, estimating exposure is a critical step in evaluating risk. Workers and researchers related to printed electronics are particularly at risk of exposure to nanomaterials, such as silver nanoparticles, representing the major conductive <b>nanoink</b> used in printed electronics. Despite difficulties in obtaining permission to do exposure assessment, the current authors already conducted several exposure assessment studies to evaluate the silver nanoparticle exposure in printed electronics workplaces. The results found a minimal level of silver nanoparticle exposure that did not represent any health and safety concern [3]. Further exposure simulation studies would be useful to clarify potential exposure and risk to silver nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|Metal {{conductive}} ink for flexible electroncs has exhibited a promising future recently. Here, an innovative strategy {{was reported to}} synthesize silver nanocolloid (2. 5 ± 0. 5 nm) and separate solid silver nanoparticles (< 10 nm) effectively. Specifically, silver nitrate (AgNO 3) was used as silver precursor, sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) as reducing agent, fatty acid (CnH 2 n+ 1 COOH) as dispersant agent, ammonia (NH 3 •H 2 O) and hydrochloride (HCl) as pH regulator and complexing agent in aqueous. The main mechanism is the solubility changes of fatty acid salts (CnH 2 n+ 1 COO-NH 4 +) and fatty acid (CnH 2 n+ 1 COOH) coated on the synthesized silver nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous. This change determinates the suspension and precipitation of silver NPs directly. The results show that when n in dispersant is 12, and molar ratio (C 12 H 24 O 2 /AgNO 3) is 1. 0, the separation yield of silver NPs is up to 94. 8 %. After sintered at 125 ℃ for 20 minutes, the as-prepared conductive silver <b>nanoink</b> (20 wt. %) presents a satisfactory resistivity (as low as 6. 6 μΩ. cm on polyester-PET substrate), about 4 times the bulk silver.

40|$|Thermoelectric {{materials}} convert {{thermal energy}} to electrical energy and vice versa. Thermoelectrics have {{attracted much attention}} and research efforts due to the possibility solving electronic cooling problems and reducing energy consumption through waste heat recovery. The efficiency of a thermoelectric material {{is determined by the}} dimensionless figure of merit ZT, which depends on both thermal and electrical properties. Researchers have worked for several decades to improve the ZT, but there had been little progress until nanomaterials and nanofabrication became widely available. Nanotechnology makes the ZT enhancement attainable by disconnecting the linkage between thermal and electrical transport. Printing customized, flexible thermoelectric devices opens the door to new applications and energy saving solutions, while probing the impact of different structure on properties and performance. This study combines nanostructured materials with 3 D printing technology to enable development of customized thermoelectric devices with mechanical flexibility, which is not possible in commercially-available devices. A 3 D printer is fabricated to allow printing of nanostructured thermoelectric inks, and can print customized devices by controlling the movement of the substrates and the mechanisms of ink dispensing. The properties and performance of the devices are measured with the modified Harman method. Although the selected <b>nanoink</b> (zinc oxide in ethanol) yields low figures of merit, this work demonstrates the feasibility of using 3 D printing to fabricate flexible thermoelectric devices.

This gradual change in material composition is aimed at improving mechanical, thermal and/or electrical properties of the material. FGMs are being increasingly used in a variety of applications including aerospace, biomedical and nuclear. FGMs have been produced using additive manufacturing processes such as laser engineered net shaping (LENS) and 30 printing. A relatively new process category called direct write (OW) printing has evolved over the past decade. OW techniques such as multi-material micro-extrusion are capable of producing FGMs. To fully utilize the capabilities of multi-material micro-extrusion, experimentation and modeling is needed to determine the factors that significantly affect the mass flow rate and proportion of each <b>nanoink</b> being dispensed. The objectives of this study were to develop a parametric model for multi-material pneumatic microextrusion and to develop equations to determine the parameter values to achieve the desired ink proportions during ink deposition. Experiments were conducted using red, blue and yellow acrylic inks that were printed using a commercially available three material pneumatic micro-extruder from nScrypt. Preliminary experiments determined that air pressure and valve needle position were significant parameters affecting the mass flow rate of the inks. A 26 experiment was then designed and carried out. Parametric equations thus developed provided relationships between the parameter values and the proportions of inks dispensed.
