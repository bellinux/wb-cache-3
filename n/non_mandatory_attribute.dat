40|$|Background: In Ireland, {{salmonellosis}} is {{the second}} most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. A new electronic system for reporting (Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting- CIDR) of Salmonella cases was established in 2004. It collates clinical (and/or laboratory) data on confirmed and probable Salmonella cases. The authors studied the completeness and the timeliness of Salmonella notifications in 2008. Methods: This analysis was based upon laboratory confirmed cases of salmonella gastroenteritis. Using data contained in CIDR, we examined completeness for certain non-mandatory fields (country of infection, date of onset of illness, organism, outcome, patient type, and ethnicity). We matched the CIDR data with the dataset provided by the national Salmonella reference laboratory (NSRL) to which all Salmonella spp. isolates are referred for definitive typing. We calculated the main median time intervals in the flow of events of the notification process. Results: In total, 416 laboratory confirmed Salmonella cases were captured by the national surveillance system and the NSRL and were included in the analysis. Completeness of <b>non</b> <b>mandatory</b> fields varied considerably. Organism was the most complete field (98. 8 %), ethnicity the least (11 %).

40|$|Wallonia (Southern Region of Belgium) {{implemented}} the Nitrates Directive through a first actions plan in 2002 {{followed by a}} second action plan in 2007. It designated vulnerable zones and introduced various mandatory practices {{in order to reduce}} the nitrate contamination risk. At the same time, the government decided to fund <b>non</b> <b>mandatory</b> practices focused on agro-environment. Some of these (like buffer strips) should also be useful in nutrient mitigation. In order to assess the global effectiveness of all the mitigation practices, we have been developing a hydrological model spatially distributed using a 1 km² grid cell on the whole Region (16 900 km²). The EPICgrid model represents the root zone and the vadose zone. In Wallonia, groundwater tables are more than 30 m deep in 8 % of the territory. It is therefore of major importance to fill the gap between the root zone and the groundwater bodies. It allows us to assess the nitrate transfer time and forecast the mitigation measures’ effect in time, space and amplitude. On the ground, runoff and sediment yield are modelled at the small watershed scale in order to assess buffer strips’ effect on sediment deposition and its consequences on N and P mitigation. The poster will explain the more recent results that consist in forecasting action plans’ effect until 2015 (on both surface water bodies and groundwater bodies) and modelling of the current buffer strips’ effect.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of {{security}} mechanisms in a system is to control access to information. Until the early 1970 s, it was not generally realized that two fundamentally different types of access controls exist. Discretionary access control is the most common: users, at their discretion, can specify to the system who can access their files. Under discretionary access controls, a user (or any of the user's programs or processes) can choose to share files with other users. Under nondiscretionary or mandatory access control, users and files have fixed security attributes that are used by the system {{to determine whether a}} user can access a file. The <b>mandatory</b> security <b>attributes</b> are assigned administratively (such as by a person called the security administrator) or automatically by the operating system, according to strict rules. The attributes cannot be modified by users or their programs. If the system determines that a user's <b>mandatory</b> security <b>attributes</b> are inappropriate for access to a certain file, then nobody—not even the owner of the file—will {{be able to make the}} file accessible to that user. 6. 1 ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM Before we worry about access to information within the system, we should pause to consider control of access to the system itself.

40|$|An {{important}} feature of some conceptual modelling grammars is the features they provide to allow database designers to show real-world things {{may or may not}} possess a particular attribute or relationship. In the entity-relationship model, for example, the fact that a thing may not possess an attribute can be represented by using a special symbol to indicate that the attribute is optional. Similarly, the fact that a thing {{may or may not be}} involved in a relationship can be represented by showing the minimum cardinality of the relationship as zero. Whether these practices should be followed, however, is a contentious issue. An alternative approach is to eliminate optional attributes and relationships from conceptual schema diagrams by using subtypes that have only <b>mandatory</b> <b>attributes</b> and relationships. In this paper, we first present a theory that led us to predict that optional attributes and relationships should be used in conceptual schema diagrams only when users of the diagrams require a surface-level understanding of the domain being represented by the diagrams. When users require a deep-level understanding, however, optional attributes and relationships should not be used because they undermine users 2 ̆ 7 abilities to grasp important domain semantics. We describe three experiments which we then undertook to test our predictions. The results of the experiments support our predictions...|$|R

But nowadays the museum is also perceived as the market of cultural values. The activities of the modern museums are increasingly measured by economic criteria: proﬁtability, eﬃciency, number of visitors, the cost of a visit, demand, cultural product, etc. And this happens not only in USA or Western Europe, but throughout the world, including the Republic of Moldova. In order to survive in the society of market economy, museums use marketing strategy, and marketing is increasingly seen as a very useful tool for the successful execution of their duties in the public interest. The purpose of marketing is to attract visitors by ﬁnding the best ways to meet their needs and desires. Since the entrance to most museums is paid, the author of this article examines the marketing function of a museum ticket as a museum product. For analysis several tickets of the museums of the Republic of Moldova, as well as from a number of European countries were taken. The objectives of the museum ticket are the same everywhere: little information for visitors, promotion of the museum, the museum advertising, and so on.

Completeness of <b>non</b> <b>mandatory</b> fields varied considerably. Organism was the most complete field (98. 8 %), ethnicity the least (11 %). The median time interval between sample collection (first contact of the patient with the healthcare professional) to the first notification to the regional Department of Public Health (either a clinical or a laboratory notification) was 6 days (Interquartile 4 - 7 days). The median total identification time interval, time between sample collections to availability of serotyping and phage-typing results on the system was 25 days (Interquartile 19 - 32 days). Timeliness varied with respect to Salmonella species. Clinical notifications occurred more rapidly than laboratory notifications. Conclusions Further feedback and education should be given to health care professionals to improve completeness of reporting of non-mandatory fields. The efficiency of reporting was similar to that published elsewhere. Delays in the reporting system at present mean that although the system is of value in facilitating comprehensive reporting it is unlikely it can be relied upon for rapid detection of outbreaks at an early stage.
