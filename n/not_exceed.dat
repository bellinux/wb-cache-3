5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E

5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} rings were identified. Two additional rings {{were discovered}} in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings. The rings are extremely dark—the Bond albedo of the rings' particles does <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> 2%. They are probably composed of water ice {{with the addition of}} some dark radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September10, the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961mbar (28.38inHg) but sustained winds did <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> 90mph (140km/h) according to the NHC. Luis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula in eastern Newfoundland early on September11. While tracking over Newfoundland, cold, dry air became entrenched in Luis's circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough. The NHC issued their final advisory on Hurricane Luis at 0900UTC on September11 as it tracked nearly 65mph (100km/h) to the northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants persisted for 30more hours over the North Atlantic Ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of Greenland late on September12.|$|E
5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|Having {{realised}} the Hungarian Estates' growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November. The Diet again authorized him to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax, stipulating that {{the sum of}} all taxes payable per porta could <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> one florin. The Estates also {{made it clear that they}} opposed the war in Bohemia. George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471. The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May. The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus's election void and confirmed Matthias's position as King of Bohemia, but the Imperial Diet refused Matthias's claim.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May 2009, the Government {{announced}} that it would refine the size and number of GRCs. This could be achieved without amending either the Constitution or the Parliamentary Elections Act. Instead, when the next EBRC was appointed, its terms of reference would instruct the Committee to plan for fewer six-member GRCs than at present, and to reduce the average size of each GRC. The average size of GRCs at that time was 5.4 MPs because there were only five-member and six-member GRCs. The new average, however, would <b>not</b> <b>exceed</b> five MPs.|$|E
