Gaskell (1833) 1 Mylne & Keen 103, to be <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> having <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> men skilled in jurisprudence for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> administration <b>of</b> justice. It was not, he said, on account of any particular importance which the law attributed to <b>the</b> business <b>of</b> people in <b>the</b> legal profession or of any particular disposition to afford them protection, {{though it was not}} easy to see why a like privilege was refused to others, especially to medical advisers.|$|R
60|$|As Washington beheld one hostile {{armament}} {{after another}} winging {{its way to}} the South, and received applications from that quarter for assistance, which he had not the means to furnish, it became painfully apparent to him, that the efforts to carry on the war had exceeded <b>the</b> natural capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. Its widely diffused population, and the composition and temper of some of its people, rendered it difficult to draw together its resources. Commerce was almost extinct; there was not sufficient natural wealth on which to found a revenue; paper currency had depreciated through want of funds for its redemption until it was nearly worthless. <b>The</b> mode <b>of</b> supplying <b>the</b> army by assessing a proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> productions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth, had proved ineffectual, oppressive, and productive of an alarming opposition. Domestic loans yielded but trifling assistance. These considerations Washington was continually urging upon <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> Congress in his full and perspicuous manner; <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> which was to enforce his opinion that a foreign loan was indispensably necessary to a continuance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. His earnest counsels and entreaties were at length successful in determining Congress to seek aid both in men and money from abroad. Accordingly, on <b>the</b> 28th <b>of</b> December they commissioned Lieutenant-colonel John Laurens, special minister at <b>the</b> court <b>of</b> Versailles, to apply for such <b>aid.</b> <b>The</b> situation he had held, as aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief, had given him an opportunity <b>of</b> observing <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> affairs, and acquainting himself with the wants and resources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country; and he was instructed to confer with Washington, previous to his departure, as to <b>the</b> objects <b>of</b> his mission. Scarce had Colonel Laurens been appointed when a painful occurrence proved <b>the</b> urgent <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> required <b>aid.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> contingence or <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> causal {{relationship}} between the Prime Cause and its effect, as treated by Avicena and Thomas Aquinas. In order to this, we consider <b>the</b> parallel treatments <b>of</b> Divine Intelligence and Will in both authors. They agree that God knows Himself and by doing so, He also knows the things other than Him. Likewise, that He loves or wants Himself and by doing so, He accidentally wants the things other than Him. However, their conclusion regarding <b>the</b> contingence or <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world is not the same. According to Avicena, the world is possible in itself but necessary with relation to another. According to Aquinas, that God wants the world with hypothetical necessity refers to <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> His will, without determining <b>the</b> contingence or <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world in itself. In fact, a universe in which necessity and contingence are combined is preferable, in Aquinasâs view, because it represents {{in a better way}} Godâs multiple perfections...|$|R
