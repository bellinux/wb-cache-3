5|$|Graham was at {{the centre}} of {{development}} across platforms, and had <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the Game Gear version having vehicle behaviour similar to the NES version.

5|$|Later, Detective Thomas tells Black that {{he really}} has <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Murphy—his true issue with the case is his own past. Having {{investigated}} sexual offences in the past, Thomas had found the cases affecting him personally, leaving him unable {{to have sex with}} his wife and leading to their divorce.|$|E
5|$|As {{he tries}} to {{investigate}} further, Quatermass finds that other figures in high levels of government have gained 'the mark' after coming across meteorites. Quatermass leaves the inquiry, then returns with Fowler to find that Broadhead has been 'marked' and now claims there is <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the project. Fowler takes Quatermass to meet with civil servant Rupert Ward, who {{has the authority to}} inspect the plant. Back at the Rocket Group, Leo and Paula deduce and discover with a radio telescope that an asteroid is orbiting the Earth invisibly and discharging the meteorites when it reaches the near point, 400 000 miles over Southern England every 14 hours.|$|E

5|$|Jerry {{is unable}} {{to decide whether or}} not to tell George he is dating Marlene, but Jerry's ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) {{eventually}} convinces him that he should. After being informed, George informs Jerry he has <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> him dating Marlene. The following night, Jerry asks Marlene to come to his apartment, but she tells him that it might be better not to date him anymore. Jerry asks her why, to which she replies that she did not think his stand-up comedy act was funny, and that she could not date someone if she did not respect what they did.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa {{arrive at}} the beach, but {{discover}} {{that the ability to}} help the animals is reserved for celebrities, who are already doing the job. The two are put to work cleaning rocks, and soon abandon the job and drive home. While picking up Bart, Homer learns about {{the true nature of the}} burlesque house, but does nothing about Bart working there. Principal Skinner visits the house and sees Bart as the door greeter. He reports it to the Lovejoys and the Flanders, who confront Homer about the matter. Homer declares that he has <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Bart working there just as Marge returns home unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|The racial {{segregation}} of local schools {{meant that the}} nearest white school was several miles away; Bakshi obtained his mother's permission to attend the nearby black school with his friends. Bakshi was the only white student in the classroom. Most {{of the students had}} <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Bakshi's presence, but a teacher sought advice from the principal, who called the police. Fearing that segregated whites would riot if they learned that a white student was attending a black school, the police removed Bakshi from his classroom. Meanwhile, his father had been suffering from anxiety attacks. Within a few months, the family moved back to Brownsville, where they rarely spoke of these events.|$|E

5|$|Widespread {{segregation}} in 19th- and early 20th-century North America {{made it difficult}} for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions– and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans, Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{understood}} {{what the market}} in the eastern United States would value, and in his catalog stressed the use of natural materials and primitive technology. Nevertheless he introduced production-line techniques, and had <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> using machine-produced yarns with synthetic dyes.|$|E
25|$|Of these groupings, the Independents {{integrated}} {{the most}} readily into Canadian capitalist society.

25|$|It {{was there}} that he decided that the {{predisposition}} of Americans to see blacks as inferior was a learned viewpoint. The French had <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> blacks learning and interacting with others. Therefore, he determined to become an abolitionist upon his return to America.|$|E
25|$|At {{the last}} summit in China, two countries, Turkey and Mongolia have spoken {{out to the}} {{chairman}} Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte about their intentions to join the association of countries.

25|$|A major <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the car's initial {{race was}} its front {{splitter}}.

25|$|Branyan {{began the}} season playing a platoon role with {{teammate}} Bill Hall. Hall {{did not like}} the shared role, feeling that he should be playing full-time. Branyan expressed <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the platoon role, but stated that he understood why Hall disliked the situation. Branyan started the season earning praise from manager Ned Yost and soon saw increased playing time. Later in the season, however, Branyan's playing time was decreased.|$|E
25|$|As {{she puts}} it, “The problem with 'whiteshamans' {{is one of}} {{integrity}} and intent, not of topic, style, interest, or experimentation.” Rose has <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> other races writing about Native Americans and their history, {{so long as it}} is written from their perspective and not from a falsely manufactured “whiteshaman” persona who simply asserts that they have the authority to talk about and understand the Native American experience.|$|E
25|$|Bellarmine found <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> heliocentrism {{so long as}} it {{was treated}} as a purely {{hypothetical}} calculating device and not as a physically real phenomenon, but he did not regard it as permissible to advocate the latter unless it could be conclusively proved through current scientific standards. This put Galileo in a difficult position, because he believed that the available evidence strongly favoured heliocentrism, and he wished to be able to publish his arguments.|$|E

25|$|In a 2017 {{interview}} on French Canadian television, {{he opened up}} about his time being drafted by the Nordiques. He later stated that he had <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Quebec City or the people, stating that his wife is French Canadian. He stated that the real reason was he did not respect Marcel Aubut and criticized on how he would never play for him.

25|$|The Zune 2.0–3.* {{firmware}} {{does not}} support non-romanized fonts other than Cyrillic. East Asian characters used in Chinese and Japanese, for example, {{show up on the}} Zune device as mojibake instead of characters. Microsoft's Zune desktop software has <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Unicode. Users have improvised ways to downgrade the firmware on the Zune device to older version that support Asian characters (V1 Zunes can be hacked to display Asian font). This is, however, not recommended by anyone, as future firmware versions contain significant improvements and added codec support.|$|E
25|$|Due to 2012's {{national}} budget cuts, the AHR was removed. The regulation of assisted reproduction was then delegated to each province. This delegation provides provinces {{with a lot}} of leeway to do as they please. As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down's syndrome and founder of , saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada. He dismissed all controversies regarding catalogue babies and states that he had <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> perfect babies.|$|E
