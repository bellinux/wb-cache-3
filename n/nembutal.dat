25|$|<b>Nembutal</b> is a {{trade name}} for pentobarbital, {{which is a}} long-acting {{barbiturate}} used as a sedative. The drug is commonly used in suicides; and is also used in executions in the United States and The People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|On 9 August 1967, Kenneth Halliwell bludgeoned 34-year-old Orton {{to death}} {{at their home}} at 25 Noel Road, Islington, London, with nine hammer blows to the head, and then {{committed}} suicide with an overdose of 22 <b>Nembutal</b> tablets washed down with the juice from canned grapefruit. Investigators determined that Halliwell had died first, because Orton's sheets were still warm.|$|E
25|$|Drug users tend {{to prefer}} short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates. The most {{commonly}} used are amobarbital (Amytal), pentobarbital (<b>Nembutal),</b> and secobarbital (Seconal). A combination of amobarbital and secobarbital (called Tuinal) is also highly used. Short-acting and intermediate-acting barbiturates are usually prescribed as sedatives and sleeping pills. These pills begin acting fifteen to forty minutes after they are swallowed, and their effects last from five to six hours.|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was {{assisted}} in their investigation by psychiatrists from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide [...] It was estimated that Monroe had died between 8:30 and 10:30p.m., and the toxicology report later {{revealed that the}} cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning. She had 8mg% (milligrams per 100 milliliters of solution) chloral hydrate and 4.5mg% of pentobarbital (<b>Nembutal)</b> in her blood, and a further 13mg% of pentobarbital in her liver. Empty bottles containing these medicines were found next to her bed. The possibility that Monroe had accidentally overdosed was ruled out, because the dosages found in her body were several times over the lethal limit. Her doctors stated that she had been prone to [...] "severe fears and frequent depressions" [...] with [...] "abrupt and unpredictable" [...] mood changes, and had overdosed several times in the past, possibly intentionally. Due to these facts and the lack of any indication of foul play, the coroner classified her death as a [...] "probable suicide".|$|E

2500|$|Dr Smith {{became a}} {{practitioner}} of [...] "painless childbirth" [...] {{in the early}} 1930s, using premedication with the barbiturate <b>Nembutal</b> combined with hyosine. This proved very popular and attracted women to Rawene from far afield. The annual average of thirty births per year now peaked at two hundred. in 1937 a [...] "Commission of Inquiry into Rural Maternity Services" [...] was established with Smith's practice as its primary concern. Smith fronted up with case notes on his last two hundred patients, and his results could not be bettered anywhere.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{intended}} as a nonsense song for children, [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] received various social and political interpretations at the time; music journalist Peter Doggett wrote that the [...] "culturally empty" [...] song [...] "became a kind of Rorschach test for radical minds." [...] The song's chorus was reappropriated by schoolchildren, sports fans, and striking workers in their own chants. At a Mobe protest in San Francisco, a yellow papier-mâché submarine made {{its way through the}} crowd, which Time magazine interpreted as a [...] "symbol of the psychedelic set's desire for escape". A reviewer for the P.O. Frisco wrote in 1966, [...] "the Yellow Submarine may suggest, {{in the context of the}} Beatles' anti-Vietnam War statement in Tokyo this year, that the society over which Old Glory floats is as isolated and morally irresponsible as a nuclear submarine." [...] Writing for Esquire, Robert Christgau felt that the Beatles [...] "want their meanings to be absorbed on an instinctual level" [...] and wrote of the interpretations, [...] "I can't believe that the Beatles indulge in the simplistic kind of symbolism that turns a yellow submarine into a <b>Nembutal</b> or a banana—it is just a yellow submarine, damn it, an obvious elaboration of John 's submarine fixation, first revealed in A Hard Day's Night." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lundbeck {{formerly}} {{held the}} only license to manufacture pentobarbital (<b>Nembutal)</b> in the United States. The drug {{is commonly used}} for execution by lethal injection in the United States (either {{as part of a}} three drug cocktail or by itself). After coming under criticism for not adding an ‘end user’ agreement to prevent importers from selling Nembutal® to American prisons for use in executions, Lundbeck announced that it would not sell <b>Nembutal</b> to prisons in U.S. states that carry out executions. By introducing a new distribution system, <b>Nembutal</b> will be supplied exclusively through a specialty pharmacy drop ship program that will deny distribution of the product to prisons in U.S. states currently active in carrying out the death penalty by lethal injection. [...] In December 2011 Lundbeck divested a portfolio of products including <b>Nembutal</b> to US pharmaceutical company Akorn Inc. As part of the agreement, Akorn committed to continue with Lundbeck's restricted distribution program for <b>Nembutal,</b> which was implemented to restrict the use of the product in the US.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nembutal,</b> {{developed}} by Ernest H. Volwiler and Donalee L. Tabern of Abbott Laboratories in 1930, was a novel barbiturate that could induce sleep within 20 minutes. It {{had the advantage}} of rarely producing hangovers or other side effects. An oral-hypnotic barbiturate, <b>Nembutal</b> has a long narcotic duration, with attendant risk of abuse.|$|E

50|$|It was {{alleged that}} Joe Waterman, 25, had {{committed}} suicide after accessing Nitschke's online euthanasia handbook, by misrepresenting his age as over 50. Waterman subsequently imported <b>Nembutal</b> and ended his life. In another case Lucas Taylor, 26, committed suicide in Germany by taking <b>Nembutal</b> after soliciting advice at an Exit International online forum (which, according to Nitschke, he accessed by claiming his age was 65).|$|E

5000|$|In 2009 Nitschke made a {{barbiturate}} testing kit available, initially {{launched in}} the UK, then Australia. Nitschke said the kit was made available by Exit International in response to growing demand for something to test the <b>Nembutal</b> obtained from Mexico, often delivered in the post without labels. [...] "They {{want to be sure}} they have the right concentration," [...] Nitschke said. The kits have chemicals that change colour when mixed with <b>Nembutal.</b> He was detained for an hour for questioning on arrival at Auckland Airport in New Zealand on a trip to hold public meetings and launch the kit.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2016 British police, {{acting on}} an Interpol drug alert, forced {{entry into the}} home of a member of Nitschke's organisation, retired {{professor}} Dr Avril Henry, aged 81, who was in ill health. Without knocking, police —accompanied by a psychiatrist, GP and social worker— forced their way into Dr Henry's home by smashing her glass front door at 10pm and questioned her for six hours, confiscating a bottle of imported <b>Nembutal,</b> and leaving at 4am. They decided Dr Henry [...] "had capacity" [...] and would not be sectioned (detained involuntarily for mental assessment). Worried that the police would return and confiscate her remaining <b>Nembutal,</b> she committed suicide four days later. Dr Nitschke commented that police had made Dr Henry's last days on earth a misery and that “police need to realise that in the UK, suicide is not a crime, and mental health authorities need to recognise that not everyone who seeks to end their life is in need of psychiatric intervention", adding that the police action was [...] "a significant abuse of power against a vulnerable elderly woman".|$|E
50|$|Reliability of {{the drugs}} method highly depends on chosen drugs and {{additional}} measures {{such as the use}} of antiemetics to prevent vomiting. Average fatality rate for overdoses in the U.S. is estimated to be only 1.8%.

50|$|Joel's {{first wife}} was Elizabeth Weber Small. When their {{relationship}} began, {{she was married}} to Jon Small, his music partner in the short-lived duo Attila, with whom she had a son. When the infidelity was exposed, Weber (temporarily) severed her relationships with both of them. Distraught, Joel overdosed on <b>Nembutal</b> while at his mother's house on Long Island, and called Small to apologize. Small then went to the house and, finding Joel unconscious, got him medical attention.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, coroner Thomas Noguchi {{published}} his memoirs, {{in which he}} discussed Monroe's case and the allegations of discrepancies in the autopsy and the coroner's verdict of suicide.

50|$|On 9 August 1967 Halliwell killed Orton {{with nine}} hammer blows {{to the head}} and then overdosed on <b>Nembutal</b> {{sleeping}} pills. Halliwell died first.
