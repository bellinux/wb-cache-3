25|$|In July 1856, the Bank of Toronto {{opened its}} offices at 78 Church Street, Toronto, {{with a staff}} of three and {{immediately}} began development of a provincial <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches.</b> In 1860, it opened its first branch outside of Ontario, in Montreal, Quebec.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, against a backdrop of deregulation and technological change, internationalisation of the markets and the emergence of new financial instruments, Société Générale set itself two commercial objectives. It focused increasingly on private customers via its <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> and by acquiring specialised subsidiaries. It pursued and expanded its activities in the capital markets in France, and then, on a selective basis, in the different international financial centres.|$|E
500|$|Chemical {{completed}} its largest acquisition to that point, in 1954, merging with the Corn Exchange Bank {{to become the}} Chemical Corn Exchange Bank. [...] Founded in 1853, the Corn Exchange Bank was based in New York City, but had built a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> in other states through the acquisition of community banks. [...] The merger with the Corn Exchange Bank added 98 additional branches to Chemical's system largely in the New York City and $774 million in deposits.|$|E

2500|$|In 1871, a {{group of}} {{entrepreneurs}} and professionals {{under the leadership of}} James Austin launched the Dominion Bank to join the Bank of Toronto in the Ontario market. They were dedicated to creating a new institution [...] "conducive to the general prosperity of that section of the country." [...] Like the Bank of Toronto, the Dominion Bank was a cautious institution, [...] "selecting its customers carefully, serving them well, and duly prospering with them" [...] (in the words of the official history). It also created a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches,</b> and in 1872 became the first Canadian bank to have two branches in one city–Toronto.|$|E
2500|$|Concealment and evasion. Camouflage {{was used}} heavily. Roads were {{sometimes}} [...] "roofed" [...] with a <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches,</b> brush and other greenery, and {{vehicles on the}} roads sported foliage to aid in concealment. Night movement was almost constant, with drivers being guided on the roads by white poles painted by the Youth Shock Brigades, or personnel dressed in white. Truck headlights were sometimes mounted under the vehicle to help escape detection from the air. Truck driving was a dangerous task, and drivers were expected to not only dodge aircraft but help with vehicle and road repairs. Traffic was regulated by numerous civilian helpers, often young girls. In the air defense effort around important targets, labor units often constructed up to 4 dummy positions for each real anti-aircraft concentration.|$|E

50|$|New Zealand {{once had}} a very {{extensive}} <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branch</b> lines, especially in the South Island regions of Canterbury, Otago, and Southland. Many {{were built in the}} late 19th century to open up inland regions for farming and other economic activities. The branches in the South Island regions were often general-purpose lines that carried predominantly agricultural traffic, but lines elsewhere were often built to serve a specific resource: on the West Coast, an extensive <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branch</b> lines was built in rugged terrain to serve coal mines, while in the central North Island and the Bay of Plenty, lines were built inland to provide rail access to large logging operations.|$|R
60|$|Hare {{lay back}} in his {{blankets}} and saw lustrous stars through the <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches.</b> With their light {{in his face and}} the cold wind waving his hair on his brow he thought of the strangeness of it all, of its remoteness from anything ever known to him before, of its inexpressible wildness. And a rush of emotion he failed wholly to stifle proved to him that he could have loved this life if--if he had not of late come to believe that he had not long to live. Still Naab's influence exorcised even that one sad thought; and he flung it from him in resentment.|$|E
60|$|A shout from Manuel {{directed}} {{me toward}} the extreme eastern end of the island. On the way I discovered many little dead birds, and the farther I went the more I found. Among the low bushes were also many old rabihorcados, dead and dry. Some were twisted among the <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches,</b> and several were hanging in limp, grotesque, horribly suggestive attitudes of death. Manuel had all of the Indian's leaning toward the mystical, and he believed the rabihorcados had destroyed themselves. Starved they {{may very well have}} been, but to me the gales of that wind-swept, ocean desert accounted for the hanging rabihorcados. Still, when {{face to face with the}} island, with its strife, and its illustration of the survival of the fittest, all that Manuel had claimed and more, I had to acknowledge the disquieting force of the thing and its stunning blow to an imagined knowledge of life and its secrets.|$|E
6000|$|So we {{made sure}} to work against the wind, which, however, was so light as almost to be imperceptible, and stole along the dark ravine, taking half a dozen steps or so at a time. How still the forest! When {{it was like this}} I always felt as if I had {{discovered}} something new. The big trees loomed stately and calm, stretching a rugged <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> over us. Fortunately no saucy squirrels or squalling jays appeared to be abroad to warn game of our approach. Not only a tang, but a thrill, seemed to come pervasively on the cool air. All the colors of autumn were at their height, and gorgeous plots of maple thicket and sumac burned against the brown and green. We slipped along, each of us strung {{to be the first to}} hear or see some living creature of the wild. R.C., as might have been expected, halted us with a softly whispered: [...] "Listen." [...] But neither Copple nor I heard what R.C. heard, and presently we moved on as before. Presently again R.C. made us pause, with a like result. Somehow the forest seemed unusually wild. It provoked a tingling expectation. The pine-covered slope ahead of us, the thicketed ridge to our left, the dark, widening ravine to our right, all seemed to harbor listening, watching, soft-footed denizens of the wild. At length we reached a level bench, beautifully forested, where the ridge ran down in points to where the junction of several ravines formed the head of Gentry Canyon.|$|E

60|$|For {{some moments}} I stood {{still on the}} ridge, struck by the {{somewhat}} weird aspect of the shadowed scene before me--the long strip of dull uniform green, with {{here and there a}} slender palm lifting its feathery crown above the other trees, standing motionless, in strange relief against the advancing blackness. Then I set out once more at a run, taking advantage of the downward slope to get well on my way before the tempest should burst. As I approached the wood, there came a flash of lightning, pale, but covering the whole visible sky, followed after a long interval by a distant roll of thunder, which lasted several seconds and ended with a succession of deep throbs. It was as if Nature herself, in supreme anguish and abandonment, had cast herself prone on the earth, and her great heart had throbbed audibly, shaking the world with its beats. No more thunder followed, but the rain was coming down heavily now in huge drops that fell straight through the gloomy, windless air. In half a minute I was drenched to the skin; but for a short time the rain seemed an advantage, as the brightness of the falling water lessened the gloom, turning the air from dark to lighter grey. This subdued rain-light did not last long: I had not been twenty minutes in the wood before a second and greater darkness fell on the earth, accompanied by an even more copious downpour of water. The sun had evidently gone down, and the whole sky was now covered with one thick cloud. Becoming more nervous as the gloom increased, I bent my steps more to the south, so as to keep near the border and more open part of the wood. Probably I had already grown confused before deviating and turned the wrong way, for instead of finding the forest easier, it grew closer and more difficult as I advanced. Before many minutes the darkness so increased that I could no longer distinguish objects more than five feet from my eyes. Groping blindly along, I became entangled in a dense undergrowth, and after struggling and stumbling along for some distance in vain endeavours to get through it, I came to a stand at last in sheer despair. All sense of direction was now lost: I was entombed in thick blackness--blackness of night and cloud and rain and of dripping foliage and <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>branches</b> bound with bush ropes and creepers in a wild tangle. I had struggled into a hollow, or hole, as it were, in the midst of that mass of vegetation, where I could stand upright and turn round and round without touching anything; but when I put out my hands they came into contact with vines and bushes. To move from that spot seemed folly; yet how dreadful to remain there standing on the sodden earth, chilled with rain, in that awful blackness in which the only luminous thing one could look to see would be the eyes, shining with their own internal light, of some savage beast of prey! Yet the danger, the intense physical discomfort, and the anguish of looking forward to a whole night spent in that situation stung my heart less than the thought of Rima's anxiety and of the pain I had carelessly given by secretly leaving her.|$|E
