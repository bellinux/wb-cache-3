5|$|The Swedish {{commander}} Sulzbach made {{a tactical}} error in not attacking either Schack or Eberstein {{before they could}} join up, even though his generals urged him to do so. Instead, he chose to withdraw to Nyborg. The Swedish king was not pleased and immediately sent Gustaf Otto Stenbock to relieve Sulzback of his command. When Stenbock arrived he found the city's defenses wanting and sent a <b>note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king {{that he could not}} guarantee that he would hold the city.|$|E

Although Young did not walk a batter, the Spiders {{committed}} four errors while on defense. One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit, but the Cleveland third baseman sent a <b>note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press box after the eighth inning, saying he had made an error, and the ruling was changed. Young later said, that, despite his teammate's gesture, he considered the game to be a one-hitter.|$|E

5|$|On September 5, 1920, Polish Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha {{delivered}} a diplomatic <b>note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> League of Nations asking it {{to intervene in}} the Polish–Lithuanian War. He claimed that Lithuania allowed free passage through its territory for Soviet troops and therefore violated its declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. The next day Lithuania responded with a direct note to Poland in which Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Purickis proposed to negotiate a demarcation line and other issues in Marijampolė. On September 8, during a planning meeting for what later was the Battle of the Niemen River, the Poles decided to maneuver through the Lithuanian territory {{to the rear of the}} Soviet Army. In an attempt to conceal the planned attack, Polish diplomats accepted the proposal to negotiate. The negotiations started on September 16 in Kalvarija, but collapsed just two days later.|$|E

40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{structure}} of the financial statements of business corporations in the Czech republic and focuses on <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial statements. In the theoretical part the bachelor's thesis concentrates on user's requirements for the information presented in the financial statements and general accounting principles which lead to meet these requirements. Afterwards the structure and contents of four fundamental parts of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial statements is described in detail. The theoretical part is <b>the</b> key <b>to</b> solve <b>the</b> issue in the practical part which analyses <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial statements of certain health care companies. The practical part examines in which part of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial statements is the highest frequency of mistakes. The bachelor's thesis evaluated the frequency of mistakes and explored the most common mistakes occuring in all parts of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial statements...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{appointments}} to the Order were largely political, from the 1770s appointments to the Order were increasingly made for naval, military or diplomatic achievements. This is {{partly due to}} the conflicts Britain was engaged in over this period. The Peninsular War resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of Extra Knights in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military <b>note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Order. Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period not exceeding 42 days in any year, to serve in any part of Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four trumpeters, and was also to appoint eight officers for this body, however the statute was never invoked.|$|E
5|$|Ripostes, {{published}} in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration {{of meaning and}} economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward Imagism; his first {{use of the word}} Imagiste appears in his prefatory <b>note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century Old English poem The Seafarer, although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that in some circles, Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to The Seafarer was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919. His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also {{published in}} 1912.|$|E
5|$|After his {{recovery}} Sérurier took command at Livorno (Leghorn) {{but he was}} thrilled to get the order {{to return to the}} army. On 27 December 1796 he resumed command of the Mantua siege corps, replacing Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine who had also become ill. The corps consisted of 10,000 men in two divisions under Thomas-Alexandre Dumas and Claude Dallemagne. On 14–15 January 1797 Bonaparte defeated József Alvinczi in the Battle of Rivoli, inflicting terrible losses on the Austrians. Meanwhile, a relief column under Giovanni Marchese di Provera reached the north side of Mantua and on 16 January there was a battle. The Mantua garrison launched a sortie led by Karl Philipp Sebottendorf that made progress at first but was beaten back by reinforcements under Claude Perrin Victor. At the same time, Sérurier and 1,500 troops at La Favorita Palace blocked Provera from joining the garrison. By noon Provera was hemmed in by French reinforcements and at 2:00 pm he surrendered to Sérurier with 7,000 men, 22 field guns, a pontoon train and a food convoy. Afterward, Sérurier got into a dispute with Dumas, who had commanded armies but was now a mere division commander. Angry that his contributions were not recognized, Dumas sent an abusive <b>note</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> army chief of staff Louis-Alexandre Berthier and was demoted by Bonaparte. On 30 January, Wurmser began negotiations with Sérurier for the capitulation of Mantua; this was signed on 2 February 1797 by the two generals. The articles permitted Wurmser, his staff, his generals, 700 soldiers and six artillery pieces to go free, but 16,324 men of the garrison became prisoners of war.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> amendment of accounting legislation, which came into force on 1 January, 2016, and its connection with individual financial statements. The main emphasis is put on <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial statements. The theoretical part of this thesis {{is concerned with the}} most important changes in the accounting legislation. This changes are mainly connected with a new classification of accounting units, which was arguably the most principal change in the accounting regulations. Furthermore, it includes a description of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial statements after the amendment. In the practical part, there is a description of <b>the</b> <b>notes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finacial statements before the amendment was approved.
