25|$|The Admiralty had {{intended}} that the 80-gun ships {{should no longer}} be built, they being too short and lacking in stability so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to open their lower ports in anything much above a calm sea. The committee the Admiralty had set up disagreed with their assessment however, and the suggestion to switch to 74-gun ships {{in lieu of the}} 80s was rejected. The size of ships was to be limited according to the depth of water available in the country's ports, and so even the 90-gun ships were to remain smaller than some French and Spanish 74s. Despite these setbacks, the Admiralty had achieved much greater increases in the sizes of ships than with the previous establishments. Furthermore, the ship types of pre-1741 were restored (i.e. the 64s returned to being 70s, the 58s to 60s, etc.).|$|E

500|$|Carlsen had a poor {{result in}} the third edition of Norway Chess, held 15–26 June. In the first round he {{obtained}} a winning position against Topalov after pressing in a long endgame, only to lose on time when he mistakenly thought that he would receive 15 minutes of extra time at move 60. He was then outplayed by Caruana in the second round, missed a win against Anish Giri in round 3, and lost to Anand in round 4. He won against Grischuk in round 5, drew against Nakamura and Vachier-Lagrave in rounds 6 and 7, and defeated Aronian in round 8, but he lost the last round against Jon Ludvig Hammer, leaving him in seventh place and with a performance rating of 2693.

500|$|At this camp, Schuyler {{was visited}} {{by a local}} man, {{believed}} by some historians to be Moses Hazen. Hazen, a Massachusetts-born retired officer who lived near the fort, painted a bleak portrait of the American situation. He said that the fort was defended by the entire 26th regiment and 100 Indians, that it was well-stocked and ready for a siege. [...] He {{also said that the}} habitants, while friendly to the American cause, were unlikely to help the Americans unless the prospects for victory looked good. Schuyler held a war council on September 7, in which the command decided to retreat back to Île-aux-Noix. [...] However, on September 8, reinforcements arrived: another 800 men including Connecticut militia under David Wooster and New Yorkers with artillery, joined them. Heartened by this arrival, they decided instead to proceed with a nighttime attempt on the fort.

500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards equivocation. [...] Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by [...] "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards [...] "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" [...] apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. [...] Mrs Russell, attractive to [...] "a number of clients among the youth, who are fond of beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her [...] "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". [...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever {{in the performance of}} the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction {{on the part of the}} customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E

2500|$|One of Murphy's more {{dramatic}} actions as Attorney-General was his unannounced {{visit to the}} Melbourne headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in March 1973. This came about because ASIO officers were unable to satisfy his requests for information concerning intelligence on supposed terrorist groups operated by Croatian Australians. Murphy's concern about the matter was heightened by the impending visit to Australia of the Yugoslav Prime Minister Džemal Bijedić. ASIO officers claimed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to locate the file with which to properly brief Murphy. Murphy's belief was that though a security service was {{an important part of}} the Australian social fabric, like any other arm of executive government it must be accountable to the relevant Minister. According to journalist George Negus, then Murphy's press secretary: [...] "Lionel had asked for the files of the six most dangerous or subversive people in Australia".

2500|$|In Wildwood, {{everyone}} is either of The Wood, or is an Outsider, or, {{in the special}} case of the protagonists, a [...] "half breed", that is, an Outsider {{who is able to}} enter The Wood. A sort of [...] "aura or shine" [...] makes it possible to visually identify which of these things a person is. The first human Prue meets in The Wood is an old man driving a mail truck, Richard, the South Wood Postmaster General. She sees in him something she [...] "couldn't put her finger on that seemed to exude from him, something that made him seem like no one she'd ever met before. It was a kind of aura or shine, like the way a familiar landscape is transformed in the light of a full moon." [...] The natives of The Wood are consistently able to recognize Prue and Curtis as Outsiders, who ought <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to enter through the Periphery Bind surrounding The Wood, while only the people of the pastoral and meditative North Wood can see with an unexplained sense that Prue and Curtis have a dual nature, born outside The Wood yet unhindered by the magical barrier that keeps the Outsiders out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between the Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions is apparent, in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order (in the Apollonian sense) of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. Elaborating on the conception of Hamlet as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living antithesis to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his {{has the power to}} change this. For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the Primordial Unity, which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [...] Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the physiological condition that enables making of any art.

This was the cause of the death of my friend Captain Bayne, of the Alfred, who having had his knee so shattered with round shot that it was necessary to amputate the limb, expired under the operation, in consequence of the weakness induced by loss of blood in carrying him so far.
