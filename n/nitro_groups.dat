25|$|The {{electrons}} {{around a}} nucleus will circulate in {{a magnetic field}} and create a secondary induced magnetic field. This field opposes the applied field as stipulated by Lenz's law and atoms with higher induced fields (i.e., higher electron density) are therefore called shielded, relative to those with lower electron density. The chemical milieu of an atom can influence its electron density through the polar effect. Electron-donating alkyl groups, for example, lead to increased shielding while electron-withdrawing substituents such as <b>nitro</b> <b>groups</b> lead to deshielding of the nucleus. Not only substituents cause local induced fields. Bonding electrons {{can also lead to}} shielding and deshielding effects. A striking example of this are the pi bonds in benzene. Circular current through the hyperconjugated system causes a shielding effect at the molecule's center and a deshielding effect at its edges. Trends in chemical shift are explained based on the degree of shielding or deshielding.|$|E

2500|$|Phenol {{is highly}} {{reactive}} toward electrophilic aromatic substitution as the oxygen atom's pi electrons donate electron density into the ring. [...] By this general approach, many groups can be appended to the ring, via halogenation, acylation, sulfonation, and other processes. However, phenol's ring is so strongly activated—second only to aniline—that bromination or chlorination of phenol leads to substitution on all carbon atoms ortho and para to the hydroxy group, {{not only on}} one carbon. Phenol reacts with dilute nitric acid at room temperature to give a mixture of 2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol while with concentrated nitric acid, more <b>nitro</b> <b>groups</b> get substituted on the ring to give 2,4,6-trinitrophenol which is known as picric acid.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{influence}} of intra- and intermolecular interactions on properties of the <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> in para-substituted nitrobenzene derivatives, two sources of data were used: (i) Cambridge Structural Database and (ii) quantum chemistry modeling. In the latter case, “pure” intramolecular interactions were simulated by gradual rotation of the <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> in para-nitroaniline, whereas H-bond formation at the amino group allowed the intermolecular interactions to be accounted for. BLYP functional with dispersion correction and TZ 2 P basis set (ADF program) were used to perform all calculations.

The <b>nitro</b> <b>group</b> lies in the plane of the benzene ring for only a small number of molecules, whereas the mean value of the twist angle is 7. 3 deg, mostly due to intermolecular interactions in the crystals.
