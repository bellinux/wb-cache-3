25|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> <b>above,</b> {{significant}} changes have occurred at both Oxford and Cambridge {{over the last}} century, including Cambridge's diversification away from intense mathematical study and Oxford's renewed emphasis on ground-breaking scientific research, such as its influential work {{in the development of}} penicillin. However, the withdrawal of equal academic dress from Oxford's scientist alumni may perhaps reflect a current institutional preference towards the arts. Oxford offers the course of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, while Cambridge offers Human, Social and Political Sciences. Software tycoon Bill Gates gives scholarships to Cambridge, while Oxford is home to what is the oldest and arguably the most prestigious academic award for graduates – Rhodes Scholarship – instituted by Cecil Rhodes. US News and World Report rankings support this stereotype; Cambridge tends to rank higher in the sciences, and Oxford in the humanities.|$|E

3000|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> issues {{outlined}} <b>above,</b> <b>the</b> {{idea that}} novelty is pervading the biosphere is uncontroversial {{even if it}} is regretted by some. Indeed, it is expected that the novelty of ecosystems will increase over time (Jackson 2013). Given this increasing novelty, {{it is more likely that}} thresholds associated with irreversible change will be crossed, and novel ecosystems will therefore increase in prominence. Since novel ecosystems, by definition, resist traditional restoration efforts it would be tempting to ignore them, but the increasing prominence of novelty prompts us to consider what place novel ecosystems might have in restoration planning and practice. If novel ecosystems do have a place in restoration, can we set socially acceptable and innovative goals for their management? If so, are such goals lower than the bar set by traditional ecological restoration? [...]...|$|R

50|$|During {{the late}} 1890s, {{it was thought}} that around 3 to 4 miles would be the norm for {{battleship}} engagements. Although 305 mm/40 caliber guns were quite capable of reaching out to the ranges that the Yellow Sea battle had opened up with (8 miles), the lack of effective range-finders and gun sights forced practical 305 mm (12 inch) gunfire to be held within a 3 to 4 mile range. During the battle, Russian battleships had Liuzhol Rangefinders with a range out to 4,000 m, while Japanese pre-dreadnoughts had the latest (1903) Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders, which had a range of 6,000 m. <b>Notwithstanding</b> all of <b>the</b> <b>above,</b> <b>the</b> world was quite surprised after the opponents opened fire upon one another while still over 8 miles apart.|$|R
30|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> {{argument}} <b>above,</b> {{one might}} assume that learners {{have a natural}} tendency to parse continuous outcome events into discrete outcome categories, {{and that it is}} this process that gives rise to the OD effect. Participants might spontaneously classify continuous events in discrete terms if doing so enabled them to decide whether outcome information was consistent with or contrary to their current causal hypothesis. This seems relatively plausible for Experiment 1, where the distribution of outcome magnitudes was bimodal and high and low outcomes were distinctly separated, even when variability was introduced to the precise magnitudes observed in each trial. It is less clear that it would be an obvious or indeed useful strategy for participants to adopt in Experiment 2, where the distribution of outcome magnitudes was unimodal. Nevertheless, even in this design, when confronted with ambiguous outcome magnitudes around the middle of the range, {{it is possible that the}} learner spontaneously classifies the outcome as being part of a high or low category, in which case they may do so in a way that is biased towards their current causal beliefs (e.g., an outcome around 50 counts as good recovery if Cloveritol was administered but is regarded as poor recovery if no treatment was delivered).|$|R

30|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> {{limitations}} cited <b>above,</b> {{this study}} offers a timely {{contribution to the}} literature, generating insight into the specific features of a music-making intervention known to facilitate recovery. The three features outlined in this article go some way to addressing the ‘how’ in Staricoff’s (2006) argument that ‘the value of evaluating {{the effect of the}} arts in healthcare resides in providing to all involved in designing, implementation and funding, the knowledge of what, when and how to introduce different art forms to achieve the most effective results’ (p. 116). Implications for practice include the importance of recognising the communicative function of music, particularly in its nonverbal form, as well as the central role played by rhythm and beat, both aurally and through the physical connection with the drum. Further, the mutual aspects of the practice point towards the value of group activities, carefully fostered in order to maximise opportunities for acceptance, identity building, and connectedness, within a learning environment that removes the fear of mistakes and that embraces an embodied, rather than cognitive, approach to music-making. Finally, as evidenced in this research, the choice of musical facilitator is crucial, acting as a conduit for recovery through his or her input and ability in fostering the mechanisms outlined in this study. Further opportunities for musicians to experience and train in facilitating music practices for mental health recovery, including their own, are certainly warranted.|$|R
