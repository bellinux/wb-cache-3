40|$|Very {{few studies}} concern the {{isotropic}} phase of Side-Chain Liquid-Crystalline Polymers (SCLCPs). However, the {{interest for the}} isotropic phase appears particularly obvious in flow experiments. Unforeseen shear-induced nematic phases are revealed away from the N-I transition temperature. The non-equilibrium nematic phase in the isotropic phase of SCLCP melts challenges the conventional timescales described in theoretical approaches and reveal very long timescales, neglected until now. This spectacular behavior is the starter of the present survey that reveals long range solid-like interactions up to the sub-millimetre scale. We {{address the question of}} the origin of this solid-like property by probing more particularly the non-equilibrium behavior of a polyacrylate substituted by a <b>nitrobiphenyl</b> group (PANO 2). The comparison with a polybutylacrylate chain of the same degree of polymerization evidences that the solid-like response is exacerbated in SCLCPs. We conclude that the liquid crystal moieties interplay as efficient elastic connectors. Finally, we show that the “solid” character can be evidenced away from the glass transition temperature in glass formers and for the first time, in purely alkane chains above their crystallization temperature. We thus have probed collective elastic effects contained not only in the isotropic phase of SCLCPs, but also more generically in the liquid state of ordinary melts and of ordinary liquids...|$|E
40|$|Aromatic compounds, {{accessible}} only by multistep procedures, can be synthesized easily by nucleophilic substitution of nitrite in nitrobenzenes, <b>nitrobiphenyls,</b> and nitronaphthalenes. Thus, meta-substituted phenols 3, 4, and 7 are obtained from 1, 3 -dinitrobenzene (1) and meta-substituted nitrobenzenes 6, as well as 3, 5 -disubstituted phenols 10 and 5 -substituted resorcinol derivatives 11 from 3, 5 -disubstituted nitrobenzenes 9. The unsymmetrically substituted <b>nitrobiphenyls</b> 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 24, and 26 are also available by nitrite exchange from the corresponding easily accessible dinitrobiphenyls 16, 18, 20, 22, and 25. A nitrite exchange with nucleophiles is easily possible in the 1, 5 -disubstituted naphthalenes 29, 34, while {{in the case of}} the 1, 8 -disubstituted naphthalenes 31, 36 only the chloro derivative 36 undergoes this exchange under much stronger conditions in low yield...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and adsorptive {{stripping}} voltammetry (AdSV) at {{a hanging}} mercury drop electrode (HMDE) {{was used for}} the determination of trace amounts of carcinogenic <b>nitrobiphenyls,</b> namely 2 -nitrobiphenyl (2 -NBP), 3 -nitrobiphenyl (3 -NBP) and 4 -nitrobiphenyl (4 -NBP) within the concentration range from 2. 10 - 8 to 1. 10 - 5 mol⋅L- 1 for DPV and from 2. 10 - 9 to 1. 10 - 7 mol⋅L- 1 for AdSV using a Britton-Robinson buffer – methanol (1 : 1) mixture with resulting pH 12 as a base electrolyte. The practical applicability of newly developed methods was verified using model samples of drinking and river water and liquid-liquid extraction for a preliminary separation and preconcentration...|$|R
