Data obtained from a driver sleepiness study involving real-world driving are used in order to analyse the performance of several sleepiness indicators based on driving behavior; such as, for example, variability in lateral position and heading angle.

However, the data indicate that there is {{a significant difference in the}} average lane position for sleepy and alert drivers, respectively, such that a sleepy driver generally places the vehicle closer (by about 0. 2 m) to the centre of the road than an alert driver. The analysis also shows a significant, monotonous, increase in average lateral position (measured from the right, outer, lane boundary towards the lane centre) between the four cases of (i) daytime alert driving, (ii) daytime sleepy driving, (iii) night-time alert <b>driving</b> and (iv) <b>nighttime</b> sleepy <b>driving...</b>|$|R

30|$|Young drivers {{up to the}} age of 19 {{are more}} {{affected}} by risk factors, such as <b>nighttime</b> and weekend <b>driving,</b> the presence of other passengers - especially teens in the car, and by negative interaction of these attributes. However, these factors have a lesser effect on young drivers between the ages of 19 – 24  years [10, 1, 29, 28]. Furthermore, the impact of the presence of passengers in the car on the 19 – 24  year-olds, for example, can be considered ambiguous and depends on socio-economic characteristics and social interactions between the driver and the passengers [10, 11].

S. with a market-weighted median beam pattern of tungsten-halogen lamps for vehicles of the same model year. The {{results indicate that the}} HID lamps tended to provide wider beam patterns than did the tungsten-halogen lamps, which, in turn, should improve the visibility of pedestrians on curves and may make the lane-maintenance task less demanding. On right curves, there was an increase in glare illumination towards oncoming drivers, while on left curves there was a decrease in glare illumination. On straight roads, the HID lamps produced more illumination for pedestrians and road delineation {{on the left side of}} the road. This was also the case for the right side of the road, but only for the projector HID lamps; the nonprojector HID lamps produced less illumination at the relevant locations than did the tungsten-halogen lamps. Finally, on straight roads HID lamps produced less glare for oncoming drivers than did the tungstenhalogen lamps. The results for traffic-sign illumination varied with the location of the sign. HID lamps produce more light than do tungsten-halogen lamps. Consequently, they hold great promise for improving the <b>nighttime</b> safety of <b>driving</b> by improving the lowbeam light distribution.

40|$|Study Objectives: Most {{studies of}} sleepy driving {{have been carried}} out in driving simulators. A few studies of real driving are available, but these have used only a few {{sleepiness}} indicators. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to characterize sleepiness in several indicators during real driving at night, compared with daytime driving. Design: Participants drove 55 km (at 90 km/h) on a 9 -m-wide rural highway in southern Sweden. Daytime driving started at 09 : 00 or 11 : 00 (2 groups) and night driving at 01 : 00 or 03 : 00 (balanced design). Setting: Instrumented car on a real road in normal traffic. Participants: Eighteen participants drawn from the local driving license register. Interventions: Daytime and nighttime drives. Measurement and Results: The vehicle was an instrumented car with video monitoring of the edge of the road and recording of the lateral position and speed. Electroencephalography and electrooculography were recorded, together with ratings of sleepiness every 5 minutes. Pronounced effects of night driving were seen for subjective sleepiness, electroencephalographic indicators of sleepiness, blink duration, and speed. Also, time on task showed significant effects for subjective sleepiness, blink duration, lane position, and speed. Sleepiness was highest toward the end of the <b>nighttime</b> drive. Night <b>driving</b> caused a leftward shift in lateral position and a reduction of speed. The latter two findings, as well as the overall pattern of sleepiness indicators, provide new insights into the effects of night driving.

40|$|Problem: Accident {{statistics}} {{demonstrate that}} there should be a greater focus on <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> to improve our knowledge of driver behavior under poor lighting conditions. However, the current geometric design criteria do not take into account driving at night. Moreover, studies that propose predictive models of operating speed only consider daytime driving conditions. Method: This study compares driver speed behavior during daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> and models operating speeds and speed differentials, identifying significant factors that influence speed behavior under different lighting conditions. The research was carried out using a driving simulator for a section of an existing two-lane rural road composed of 39 tangent-curve configurations. Speed profiles were recorded for 40 drivers under simulated daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> conditions. Results: New predictive speed models, differentiated for daytime and <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving,</b> are proposed that highlight the effects of different geometric predictors under different visibility conditions. Specifically, predictive models for operating speed on curves identified the inverse of the radius and the deflection angle of the curve as predictors under both driving conditions. For speed differentials based on the 85 th percentile for maximum speed reduction (85 MSR), we found that the inverse of the approaching tangent length and of the curve radius significantly explained the dependent variable in both cases, with a higher dependence of nighttime 85 MSR on the curve geometry than on the tangent length. Tangent length had a significant effect on operating speed for independent tangents only for the daytime model, whereas the inverse of the previous radius was confirmed as a predictor for both visibility conditions.

40|$|Problem: Due to {{inexperience}} {{and inadequate}} driving skills, {{the road is}} a very risky place for young and beginning drivers, yet such experience and skills can only be built by increased driving and exposure to risks on the road. Graduated driver licensing (GDL) allows beginning drivers to get their initial driving experience under less risky conditions and gradually eases them into more complex driving situations. This paper reviews the literature exploring two key features of the intermediate licensing phase of GDL, <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> restrictions and passenger restrictions. Method: Literature review. Results: <b>Nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> restrictions {{have been shown to}} effectively reduce the number and rate of crash involvements on the part of teenage drivers.

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} various presbyopic vision corrections on <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> performance on a closed-road driving circuit. Methods. Participants were 11 presbyopes (mean age, 57. 3 ± 5. 8 years), with a mean best sphere distance refractive error of R+ 0. 23 ± 1. 53 DS and L+ 0. 20 ± 1. 50 DS, whose only experience of wearing presbyopic vision correction was reading spectacles. The study involved a repeated-measures design by which a participant's <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> performance was assessed on a closed-road circuit while wearing each of four power-matched vision corrections. These included single-vision distance lenses (SV), progressive-addition spectacle lenses (PAL), monovision contact lenses (MV), and multifocal contact lenses (MTF CL) worn in a randomized order. Measures included low-contrast road hazard detection and avoidance, road sign and near target recognition, lane-keeping, driving time, and legibility distance for street signs. Eye movement data (fixation duration and number of fixations) were also recorded. Results. Street sign legibility distances were shorter when wearing MV and MTF CL than SV and PAL (P < 0. 001), and participants drove more slowly with MTF CL than with PALs (P = 0. 048). Wearing SV resulted in more errors (P < 0. 001) and in more (P = 0. 002) and longer (P < 0. 001) fixations when responding to near targets. Fixation duration was also longer when viewing distant signs with MTF CL than with PAL (P = 0. 031). Conclusions. Presbyopic vision corrections worn by naive, unadapted wearers affected <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving.</b> Overall, spectacle corrections (PAL and SV) performed well for distance driving tasks, but SV negatively affected viewing near dashboard targets.

We conducted a retrospective study comparing {{the two types of}} IOLs. The multifocal group included 46 patients who were implanted with Tecnis® multifocal IOLs bilaterally. The monofocal group was an age- and sex-matched control group, and included 85 patients who were implanted with Tecnis® monofocal IOLs bilaterally. Lens opacity grading, the radius of corneal curvature, corneal astigmatism, axial length and the refractive status were measured preoperatively. Pupil size, ocular aberrometry, distance, intermediate and near visual acuity, contrast sensitivity with and without glare and the responses to a quality-of-vision questionnaire were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS: The uncorrected near visual acuity was significantly better in the multifocal group, whereas both the corrected intermediate and near visual acuity were better in the monofocal group. Contrast sensitivity (with and without glare) was significantly better in the monofocal group. The rate of spectacle dependency was significantly lower in the multifocal group.

40|$|The current {{research}} represents an initial investigation of drivers’ understanding of high beam and low beam headlight patterns in a <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> environment. Fifty-four university students used a highlighter to indicate {{on a paper}} diagram of a roadway scene {{the portion of the}} scene that they felt their headlights would illuminate. Although the headlight patterns produced by participants varied more than expected, several consistent patterns emerged. Classification and evaluation of these drivers’ responses revealed that many drivers misunderstand the area of the roadway that is illuminated by their headlights. These misunderstandings fall into fairly distinct patterns. The results indicate many drivers possess an incomplete understanding of the pattern of illumination provided by their headlights. These results are consistent with earlier evidence that many road users fail to appreciate the visibility challenges that exist at night...|$|E
30|$|There was a {{significant}} difference in ORS ratings due to participant (F(39, 2116) =  2.07, p <  0.001), condition (F(1, 2116) =  7.99, p < = 0.01) and SRS rating (F(2, 2116) =  58.22, p <  0.001). The post-hoc test revealed that higher ORS ratings were provided during night-time compared to daytime, and that increasing ORS ratings were accompanied by increasing SRS ratings. This means that the raters are influenced by lighting conditions. The distribution of ORS ratings per condition were ORS 0 (day 419, night 312), ORS 1 (day 373, night 488), and ORS 2 (day 288, night 279). A greater number of daytime video clips were scored as alert (ORS 0) while a higher number of <b>nighttime</b> <b>driving</b> video clips were scored as sleepy (ORS 1 or ORS 2). Of the three ORS levels, ORS 2 was the least scored and ORS 1 the most scored.|$|E
