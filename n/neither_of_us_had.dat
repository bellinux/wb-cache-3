It was about, like, 'Man let's give the world what they want. Let's do a real girl-power {{collaboration}} where we support one another.' I said, 'I want to do you in your video, and I want to tribute you. I want to dress up like you'. And Hype Williams ... was so excited. He was like, 'Gaga I want no makeup on your face.' It was really stripped down — real Beyoncé hair, and we wore the same outfit in the video, and I [...] her. [...] I wanted to [...] because this was an era for her in her career where she defined herself aesthetically. And that should be applauded that a woman did that. She's so great at what she does." ...|$|E

As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
60|$|They hadn't, and we soon {{produced}} a very tolerable breakfast. But <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> much appetite.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so. Lending <b>us</b> £200, when <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> a {{shilling}} in our pocket, is a {{very good}} deed. Don't you think so, Rachel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Frightfully at times. If {{it were a}} boy {{it would}} be easier. It needs {{constant}} tact and dexterity to fix things up. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> any. It needs attention...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{in point}} of fortune we are pretty even, since <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> got any," [...] {{continued}} Hector. [...] "There may be an error, but I cannot plead guilty to presumption." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; we <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any letter, in {{the morning}} anyhow. He may have {{received}} one in the afternoon, for anything I know." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> {{come through}} the {{conflict}} unscathed, but the marvelous, healing salves of Barsoom had sufficed, overnight, to make us as good as new.|$|E
60|$|To {{all this}} my brother agreed. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> the {{slightest}} fear of hunger in the country. It {{was the city}} that gave us pause.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> imitated your forethought," [...] Ritzer said with a laugh. [...] "I have only my last month's pay in my pocket, and Stauffen is no better off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here, sonny: if {{we share}} this cake we shall <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> enough. Let <b>us</b> {{see who can}} tell the biggest lie, {{and the one who}} lies the best shall have the whole cake.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,' {{observed}} my host; 'we <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> {{the privilege}} <b>of</b> owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I {{said she was}} my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.' ...|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} we fished. I {{went up the}} river half a mile, while R.C. fished the lake. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any luck. Later we caught four trout, {{one of which was}} fair sized.|$|E
6000|$|As {{graduation}} {{day came}} on, Burton and I became very serious. The question {{of our future}} pressed upon us. What were we to do when our schooling ended? <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any hope of going to college, and <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any intention of going to Dakota, although I had taken [...] "Going West" [...] as the theme of my oration. We were also greatly worried about these essays. Burton fell off in appetite and grew silent and abstracted. Each of us gave much time to declaiming our speeches, {{and the question of}} dress troubled us. Should we wear white ties and white vests, or white ties and black vests? ...|$|E
6000|$|We were strolling {{one night}} {{down a long}} dirty street in the {{vicinity}} of the Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once Dupin broke forth with these words: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, when I've got the money. When I ain't, I go without. Seein' 's how <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> had any breakfast, {{what do you}} say to huntin' for a {{place where}} we can git five-cent soup?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear," [...] she resumed; [...] "we were lunching at {{the very}} same shop as you were--and we had two glasses of {{lemonade}} and three sandwiches and five biscuits--and <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> the least idea what we paid. Have we, sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You look older {{today than}} you did yesterday," [...] the latter said, as he held his hand and gazed into Dick's face. [...] "I fancy that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> had any sleep to speak of. As for myself, I have not closed an eye." ...|$|R
60|$|Kulan Tith looked {{first at}} me and then at Thuvan Dihn, as though to ask our {{judgment}} upon the man, but the error was so evidently excusable that <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any mind to see the young officer suffer for a mistake that any might readily have made.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Chipmunk had a sharp reply {{right on}} the tip of his tongue, but he checked it just in time. 'What's the use of quarreling over {{something}} <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> anything to do with?' said he. 'It must be that we are cousins. Where do you live?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With her {{constitution}} {{she should}} have lived to a good old age: her life was shortened by trouble." [...] And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I. <b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> dropt a tear.|$|E
6000|$|CRICHTON. I am {{thinking}} of two people whom <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> seen for a long time--Lady Mary Lasenby, and one Crichton, a butler. (He says the last word bravely, a word he once loved, though {{it is the most}} horrible of all words to him now.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arlington {{made a joke}} in the House last night," [...] said Eleanor Stringham to her mother; [...] "in all {{the years}} we've been married <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> made jokes, and I don't like it now. I'm afraid it's the {{beginning}} of the rift in the lute." ...|$|R
6000|$|Leger smiled. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm uncommonly {{glad to hear}} it; and {{in regard}} to the other {{question}} <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> any intention <b>of</b> blaming you. So far, we have been a good deal better off than we probably should ever have been in England." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{wondered}} at the mood he was in, {{that made him}} choose me rather than the adulation and applause he was sure to receive at Brooks's for the part he had played that night. After we had satisfied our hunger,--for <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> dined,--and poured out a bottle of claret, {{he looked up at}} me quizzically.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} indeed to hear this," [...] the woman said, [...] "and I am sure my husband will be too. He will feel that, {{in a certain}} measure, he has betrayed Captain Francis's trust. At {{the same time we}} <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any idea that {{anything}} of this sort was to be feared, or we would have kept watch." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> {{ever been}} abroad. And {{although}} {{it was before the}} days of swimming-pools and gymnasiums and a la carte cafes on ocean liners, the Atlantic was imposing enough. Maude had a more lasting capacity for pleasure than I, a keener enjoyment of new experiences, and as she lay beside me in the steamer-chair where I had carefully tucked her she would exclaim: ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{were much}} {{surprised}} to hear this, and the man added: [...] "It's a pretty big river, and the current is strong. I know a man who lives on the opposite bank, for I've seen him there a good many years; but we've never spoken because <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> ever crossed over." ...|$|R
5000|$|Annie's Mailbox was {{syndicated}} {{in numerous}} newspapers throughout the US, until June 30, 2016. On that date, Mitchell and Sugar, wrote [...] "...we say farewell. It {{is time for}} us to step aside and take advantage <b>of</b> opportunities <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> had the time for until now." [...] They also introduced columnist Annie Lane, known as Dear Annie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why should Leopold seek to harm me now?" [...] asked Barney. [...] "It {{has been}} almost two years since you and I placed him upon his throne, only to be rewarded with threats and hatred. In that time <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> {{returned}} to Lutha nor in any way conspired against the king. I cannot fathom his motives." ...|$|R
60|$|Now it was I {{realized}} that some one {{well acquainted with}} the locality should have been sent with us, for we were obliged to go on blindly, as it were, trusting that chance, and what we might see of the disposition of the enemy's forces, would bring us to the point we desired to gain, for <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever visited Fort Schuyler.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{a strange}} place, mother; yes, {{in that very}} spot where many years ago Suzanne came upon me {{starving}} after the shipwreck. There in the glade and by the flat stone on which I had lain down to die was the buck, quite dead. We knew the dell again, though <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> visited it from that hour to this, and rested there awhile before we turned home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well," [...] General Herkimer replied, and it pleased {{me that he}} held himself {{yet more}} stiffly than did the messenger. [...] "Say to my brother, Captain Brant, that we also will come without arms, and he and I shall meet as we met years ago, {{when there was no}} need to light the pipe of peace, because <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> listened to the songs of wicked men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True; and a noble, manly, gentleman-like {{calling it}} is! I {{never see a}} sailor that I do not envy him his advantages. Why, Miles, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> ever been in town even, while your mother's boatmen, or your own, as they are now, go there {{regularly}} once a-week. I would give {{the world to be}} a sailor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, to {{tell you}} the truth, dear Lord Montfort, Ferdinand is placed in a very awkward {{position}} with me. You are our friend, and so I speak to you in confidence. Sir Ratcliffe and Lady Armine both expect that Ferdinand and myself are going to be married. Now, <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> the slightest intention of anything of the sort.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad it is over; {{and whether}} we have done ill or well, time alone will show, but <b>neither</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> seen {{the last of the}} cross-marked man," [...] he said. [...] "In the meantime, we want more {{carriers}} and supplies. Go back to the coast and get them. You will have much less trouble on the return journey. I will stockade a camp in the hills yonder and wait for you." ...|$|R
