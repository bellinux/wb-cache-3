40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety and suitability for use by infants of follow-on formulae (FOF) based on cow's milk intact protein with a protein content of at least 1. 6 g/ 100 kcal (rounded value) that meet otherwise the requirements of relevant EU legislation. If the formula under evaluation {{is considered to be}} safe and suitable for use by infants, the <b>NDA</b> <b>Panel</b> is also asked to advise on whether FOF based on goat's milk intact protein, soy protein isolates or protein hydrolysates are also safe and suitable for infants under the same conditions. The Panel concludes that the use of FOF with a protein content of at least 1. 6 g/ 100 kcal from either intact cow's milk protein or intact goat's milk protein otherwise complying with the requirements of relevant EU legislation is safe and suitable for healthy infants living in Europe with an intake of complementary foods of a sufficient quality. This conclusion does not apply to infant formula (IF). The Panel also concludes that the safety and suitability of FOF with a protein content of at least 1. 6 g/ 100 kcal manufactured from either protein hydrolysates or soy protein isolates cannot be established with the available data. The same conclusion applies to IF. The <b>NDA</b> <b>Panel</b> endorsed a draft of this scientific opinion on 14 December 2016 for public consultation. The draft document has been revised and updated according to the comments received, where appropriate. (C) 2017 European Food Safety Authority.

40|$|As part of {{a series}} of {{scientific}} opinions on dietary references values (DRVs) for micronutrients for the European population, the EFSA Panel on Dietetics Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) is reviewing the scientific evidence to set DRVs for sodium. The protocol presented in this document describes the methodology that will be applied for: i) the assessment of possible relationships between sodium intake and health outcomes, including dose-response relationship(s), where applicable, and ii) the integration of different lines of evidence for setting DRVs. In particular, systematic reviews on the relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, bone mineral density, bone mineral content, and osteoporotic fractures will be conducted. The protocol will be implemented in 2018. The outcome will be used by the <b>NDA</b> <b>Panel</b> to complete its scientific opinion on DRVs for sodium.

40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has {{recently}} highlighted {{the need to}} provide scientific requirements for health claims and to find new regulatory issues for healthy food products. For this reason, EFSA asked its Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (<b>NDA)</b> <b>panel</b> to draft additional guidelines on scientific assessment of these claims. A new approach for a strict substantiation of health issues in selected fields: the Regulation (EC) No. 1924 / 2006 established in fact that health claims applications should only be authorized after a high level of scientific validation conducted by EFSA using appropriate measures in this evaluation. The legislation should not only protect consumers but also define specific research areas with appropriate outcome measures to assess the quality, relevance and adequacy of studies conducted for scientific validation of health claims. The new system was not only a necessary support for consumers to make the correct choice of products, but rather a way for EFSA to demonstrate transparency of this new approach. This was the field of the pharmaceutical industry, this new regulation is, therefore, also for EFSA, an expensive learning process...|$|E
40|$|Zeaxanthin is a {{nutritional}} carotenoid with {{a considerable amount}} of safety data based on regulatory studies, which form the basis of its safety evaluation. Subchronic OECD guideline studies with mice and rats receiving beadlet formulations of high purity synthetic zeaxanthin in the diet at dosages up to 1000 [*]mg/kg body weight (bw) /day, and in dogs at over 400 [*]mg/kg[*]bw/day, produced no adverse effects or histopathological changes. In developmental toxicity studies, {{there was no evidence of}} fetal toxicity or teratogenicity in rats or rabbits at dosages up to 1000 or 400 [*]mg/kg[*]bw/day, respectively. Formulated zeaxanthin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo tests for genotoxicity. A 52 -week chronic oral study in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 0. 2 and 20 [*]mg/kg[*]bw/day, mainly designed to assess accumulation and effects in primate eyes, showed no adverse effects. In a rat two-generation study, the NOAEL was 150 [*]mg/kg[*]bw/day. In 2012, this dosage was used by EFSA (<b>NDA</b> <b>Panel),</b> in association with a 200 -fold safety factor, to propose an Acceptable Daily Intake equivalent to 53 [*]mg/day for a 70 [*]kg adult.

40|$|As part of {{its mandate}} from the European Commission, EFSA must review {{existing}} advice from the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) on Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for energy, macro- and micronutrients and other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect, including magnesium, copper and phosphorus. This report summaries current general scientific information for the micronutrients magnesium, copper and phosphorus collated as part of preparatory work for the setting of DRVs by the <b>NDA</b> <b>Panel.</b> Data has been collated via a literature review of published, peer reviewed scientific literature from two online databases: Google Scholar and PubMed. Information contained within a total of 183 documents for magnesium, 181 documents for copper and 167 documents for phosphorus have been evaluated and included. As well as describing the methodological approach, this report covers the occurrence, geology and chemistry of magnesium, copper and phosphorus; approaches to and limitations of the chemical analysis of clinical samples; the biological functions of magnesium, copper and phosphorus and {{an overview of the}} health consequences of magnesium, copper and phosphorus deficiency.

40|$|EFSA {{asked the}} Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) {{to update the}} {{scientific}} and technical guidance for the preparation and presentation of an application for authorisation of a health claim published in 2011. Since then, the <b>NDA</b> <b>Panel</b> has gained considerable experience {{in the evaluation of}} health claims. Lessons learnt from these experiences have been translated into a new General scientific guidance for stakeholders on health claim applications (published in January 2016). In this context, it is noted the need to adapt the existing guidance to the new scientific and technical developments in this area. This guidance document presents a common format for the organisation of information for the preparation of a well-structured application for authorisation of health claims which fall under Articles 13 (5), 14 and 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1924 / 2006. This guidance outlines the information and scientific data which must be included in the application, the hierarchy of different types of data and study designs, and the key issues which should be addressed in the application to substantiate the health claim.

40|$|Over {{its first}} three {{mandates}} the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (<b>NDA</b> <b>Panel)</b> has provided scientific advice {{on a range}} of issues related to human nutrition. The scientific outputs adopted over this time are summarised within the six main areas within the remit of the Panel: (i) tolerable upper intake levels for nutrients; (ii) safety of novel foods; (iii) food allergens; (iv) dietetic products; (v) population reference intakes for nutrients; and (vi) nutrition and health claims on foods. The scientific advice of the Panel was provided mainly in response to requests from the European Commission and applications for authorisation of novel foods, health claims and for exemption from allergen labelling. The outputs of the Panel have been extensively used by the European Commission and Member States in the implementation of European Union (EU) policy and legislation. In addition, some of the scientific opinions assess key elements of the evidence on nutrition in obesity and other diet related diseases and are an important source of scientific advice for policy makers who wish to address these important issues in public health. Throughout the different areas of its work, the Panel has placed considerable focus on consultation with stakeholders. In the area of health claims in particular, EFSA has had continuing consultation with stakeholders in developing extensive guidance for applicants.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was {{requested}} to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety assessment of the flavouring substances caffeine [FL-no: 16. 016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16. 032] in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 49, Revision 1. Consequent to the 2015 scientific opinion from the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on the safety of caffeine from all dietary sources, the CEF Panel considered it inappropriate to evaluate the two substances through the Procedure. For caffeine, the Panel based its assessment on the safety threshold of 5. 7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for adults, except pregnant/lactating women, and 3 mg/kg bw per day for children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, as established by the <b>NDA</b> <b>Panel.</b> The safety evaluation of theobromine takes into account that approximately 11 % of an oral dose of caffeine is metabolised to theobromine and that both substances have a similar pharmacological profile. For the exposure assessment, a brand loyalty model was chosen. In this model, {{it was assumed that}} a consumer is exposed on a long-term basis to a specific category of food (i. e. non-alcoholic beverages), containing caffeine or theobromine at their respective maximum use levels. For the rest of the categories, normal use levels applied. Daily dietary exposure to caffeine and theobromine (excluding systemic exposure) added as a chemically defined flavouring substance ranged 0 - 2. 3 and 0 - 0. 4 mg/kg bw, respectively, across all population groups. The Panel concluded that caffeine [FL-no: 16. 016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16. 032] would not be expected to present safety concern based on their estimated levels of intake from their use as flavouring substances...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission has {{drafted a}} {{proposal}} of Regulation concerning {{the use of}} nutrition and health claims in the labelling, presentation and advertising of food products. In turn, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) through the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (<b>NDA</b> <b>Panel)</b> has issued a scientific Opinion concerning possible nutrition claims relating to omega- 3 fatty acids, monounsaturated fat, unsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat. This is an initial response from the EFSA to a question concerning nutrition claims. The reactions in Spain regarding the nutrition claims for omega- 3 fatty acids proposed by the European Commission has been varied, mainly from entities in the food and drink industry and from associations in the sector. The Spanish Food Safety Agency (AESA) has been informed of these reactions, and {{this has led to}} the need for an Opinion from the EFSA Scientific Panel regarding various aspects of the content of the claims. These aspects refer to the minimum quantities of omega- 3 fatty acids, the way in which this content is expressed and the number of arguments favouring reference in claims to long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids separately and not merely to all omega- 3 fatty acids in general. Following an analysis of the proposal regarding the nutrition claims of omega- 3 fatty acids, the Scientific Committee of the AESA has practically reached the same conclusions as the Scientific Committee of the EFSA. That is, the preference for only one nutrition claim for omega- 3 fatty acids in general is not justified, but, to the contrary, sufficient scientific evidence exists to assign separate claims relating to the principal types of recognised omega- 3 fatty acids from the nutritional point of view.
