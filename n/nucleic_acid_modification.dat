40|$|<b>Nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> {{are subject}} to {{extensive}} chemical modification by all organisms. These modifications display incredible structural diversity, and some are essential for survival. Intriguingly, several of these modifications are unique to bacteria, including many human pathogens. Given the enormous global disease burden due to bacterial infections, and the rapidly increasing rates of antibiotic resistance reported across the world, the need for research to address mechanisms of bacterial survival is more pressing than ever. The goal of this thesis {{was to determine the}} function of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>modifications</b> in pathogenic bacteria, and to evaluate their impact on the three major stages of the infectious disease process: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy. We first used quantitative profiling of tRNA modifications to identify novel stress responses that help mediate host invasion in the world's most common pathogen, Helicobacter pylori. This work uncovered potentially novel targets for the development of new compounds that inhibit pathogenesis. We then developed a new animal model of mycobacterial lung infection that enables drug development and biomarker screening studies in standard laboratories without high-containment facilities. We showed that infection with Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin produces a granulomatous lung disease in rats that recapitulates many of the important pathological features of human tuberculosis. This model also allowed us to test the utility of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>modifications</b> as diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, we investigated the effect of the common, transferable bacterial DNA modification phosphorothioation on oxidative and antibiotic stress responses in several pathogens. We showed that phosphorothioation can reduce the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, which may make it an environmental source of acquired antibiotic resistance. These studies show that <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>modifications</b> play diverse roles in pathogenic bacteria, and that their modulation may be a promising target for developing new tools that can disrupt pathogenesis, improve diagnosis, and strengthen therapy. by Brandon S.

40|$|Queuosine (Q) was {{discovered}} in the wobble position of a transfer RNA (tRNA) 47 years ago, yet the final biosynthetic enzyme responsible for Q-maturation, epoxyqueuosine (oQ) reductase (QueG), was only recently identified. QueG is a cobalamin (Cbl) -dependent, [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster-containing protein that produces the hypermodified nucleoside Q in situ on four tRNAs. To understand how QueG is able to perform epoxide reduction, an unprecedented reaction for a Cbl-dependent enzyme, we have determined a series of high resolution structures of QueG from Bacillus subtilis. Our structure of QueG bound to a tRNA[superscript Tyr] anticodon stem loop shows how this enzyme uses a HEAT-like domain to recognize the appropriate anticodons and position the hypermodified nucleoside into the enzyme active site. We find Q bound directly above the Cbl, consistent with a reaction mechanism that involves {{the formation of a}} covalent Cbl-tRNA intermediate. Using protein film electrochemistry, we show that two [4 Fe- 4 S] clusters adjacent to the Cbl have redox potentials in the range expected for Cbl reduction, suggesting how Cbl can be activated for nucleophilic attack on oQ.

In vitro repair activity, or other <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>modification</b> activity, has been reported for some of the mammalian homologs, while at least one homolog has been shown to have a protein substrate. The function is still unknown or disputed for several of the mammalian AlkB homologs. In this study, a set of nearly 200 metazoan high quality AlkB homolog sequences has been collected and carefully analyzed. The present work for the first time presented a detailed, extensive and reliable phylogeny for the AlkB homologs in vertebrates and other metazoans.

Structural and sequence data for the AlkB homologs have been analyzed in order to help unravel the function of these enzymes.

Consistent with this, the conformations of FANA and ANA {{were found to be}} intermediate between the A- and B-forms. However, FANA opposite RNA is preferred by RNase H over ANA, and the RNA affinity of FANA considerably exceeds that of ANA. By investigating the conformational boundaries of FANA and ANA residues in crystal structures of A- and B-form DNA duplexes at atomic resolution, we demonstrate that FANA and ANA display subtle conformational differences. The structural data provide insight into the structural requirements at the catalytic site of RNase H.

Recent advances in RNAi delivery and target selection provide remarkable opportunities for translational medical research. The induction of RNAi relies on small silencing RNAs, which affect specific messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation. Two types of small RNA molecules, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), have a central function in RNAi technology. The success of RNAi-based therapeutic delivery may be dependent upon uncovering a delivery route, sophisticated delivery carriers, and <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>modifications.</b> Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, for which novel therapeutic strategies are critically needed.

This toxicity was evident for multiple sequences targeting three different biological targets, as well as in mismatch control sequences having no known mRNA targets. Histopathological evaluation of tissues from LNA treated animals confirmed the hepatocellular involvement. Toxicity was observed as early as 4 days after a single administration.

40|$|Activation-induced {{cytidine}} deaminase (AID) {{is essential}} for two processes of immunoglobulin diversification in germinal center B cells: somatic hypermutation (SHM), in which mutations are introduced into immunoglobulin (Ig) genes, and class-switch recombination (CSR), in which genomic constant regions are recombined to encode antibodies of different isotypes. Both of these processes require AID-catalyzed C-to-U lesions at the Ig loci, which are resolved to generate point mutations or double-stranded DNA breaks {{in the cases of}} SHM and CSR, respectively. Despite over a decade of intense study, a number of open issues remain surrounding AID. The diversity of findings regarding AID’s role in DNA demethylation raises the question of the scope of its involvement in this process. Additionally, while it is clear that AID-mediated damage occurs, the effects of this damage on the average B cell have not been characterized. Finally, the issue of whether AID is able to edit RNA in vivo has never been rigorously addressed in the literature. In each of these cases, the advent of high-throughput sequencing provides methods for genome-wide characterization of AID’s effects. This thesis presents the application of a number of genome-scale, sequencing-based methods to characterize the effects of AID deficiency and overexpression on the activated B cell: mRNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq allow for measurements of RNA expression and editing, while reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) assays DNA methylation. These analyses confirmed AID’s known role in immunoglobulin isotype switching, while also demonstrating that it has little other effect on gene expression. Additionally, no evidence of AID-dependent mRNA or miRNA editing could be detected. Finally, RRBS data failed to support a role for AID in the regulation of DNA methylation. Thus, despite evidence of its additional activities in other systems, antibody diversification appears to be AID’s sole physiological function in activated B cells. Following the conclusion of my studies of AID’s effects in B cells, I applied similar genomics tools to two amenable topics in <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>modifications.</b> First, I used mRNA-Seq to attempt to determine the substrate of the orphan cytidine deaminase Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 2 (APOBEC 2).

The promoter of human KRAS contains a nuclease-hypersensitive element (NHE) that can fold in G 4 -DNA structures binding to nuclear proteins, including MAZ (myc-associated zinc-finger). Here, {{we report that}} MAZ activates KRAS transcription. To knockdown oncogenic KRAS in pancreatic cancer cells, we designed oligonucleotides that mimic one of the G-quadruplexes formed by NHE (G 4 -decoys). To increase their nuclease resistance, two locked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (LNA) <b>modifications</b> were introduced at the 3 '-end, whereas to enhance the folding and stability, two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon units (TINA or AMANY) were inserted internally, to cap the quadruplex. The most active G 4 -decoy (2998), which had two para-TINAs, strongly suppressed KRAS expression in Panc- 1 cells. It also repressed their metabolic activity (IC 50 = 520 nM), and it inhibited cell growth and colony formation by activating apoptosis. We finally injected 2998 and control oligonucleotides 5153, 5154 (2 nmol/mouse) intratumorally in SCID mice bearing a Panc- 1 xenograft. After three treatments, 2998 reduced tumor xenograft growth by 64 % compared with control and increased the Kaplan-Meier median survival time by 70 %.

To date, great efforts have {{been focused on the}} modification of certain regions of siRNA, such as the 3 '/ 5 '-termini and the seed region. Only a few reports have described the roles of central positions flanking the cleavage site during the silence process. In this study, we investigate the potential correlations between the thermodynamic and silencing properties of siRNA molecules carrying, at internal positions, an acyclic L-threoninol <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (aTNA) <b>modification.</b> Depending on position, the silencing is weakened or impaired. Furthermore, we evaluate the contribution of mismatches facing either a natural nucleotide or an aTNA modification to the siRNA potency. The position 11 of the antisense strand is more permissive to mismatches and aTNA modification, in respect to the position 10. Additionally, comparing the ON-/OFF-target silencing of central mismatched siRNAs with 5 '-terminal modified siRNA, we concluded: (i) central perturbation of duplex pairing features weights more on potency rather than silencing asymmetry; (ii) complete bias for the ON-target silencing can be achieved with single L-threoninol modification near the 5 '-end of the sense strand...|$|R

40|$|Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are now {{established}} as the preferred tool to inhibit gene function in mammalian cells yet trigger unintended gene silencing {{due to their}} inherent miRNA-like behavior. Such off-target effects are primarily mediated by the sequence-specific interaction between the siRNA seed regions (position 2 – 8 of either siRNA strand counting from the 5 ′-end) and complementary sequences in the 3 ′UTR of (off-) targets. It was previously shown that chemical modification of siRNAs can reduce off-targeting but only very few modifications have been tested leaving more to be identified. Here we developed a luciferase reporter-based assay suitable to monitor siRNA off-targeting in a high throughput manner using stable cell lines. We investigated the impact of chemically modifying single nucleotide positions within the siRNA seed on siRNA function and off-targeting using 10 different types of chemical modifications, three different target sequences and three siRNA concentrations. We found several differently modified siRNAs to exercise reduced off-targeting yet incorporation of the strongly destabilizing unlocked <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> (UNA) <b>modification</b> into position 7 of the siRNA most potently reduced off-targeting for all tested sequences.

40|$|A {{multitude}} of functions have evolved around cytosine within DNA, endowing the base with physiological significance beyond simple information storage. This versatility arises from enzymes that chemically modify cytosine {{to expand the}} potential of the genome. Cytosine can be methylated, oxidized, and deaminated to modulate transcription and immunologic diversity. At the crossroads of these modifications sit the AID/APOBEC family deaminases, which accomplish diverse functions ranging from antibody diversification and innate immunity to mRNA editing. In addition, novel roles have been proposed in oncogenesis and DNA demethylation. Behind these established and emerging physiologic activities remain important questions about the substrate specificity of these deaminases, reflecting a broader need to elucidate how AID/APOBEC enzymes engage their substrates for deamination. The work here addresses this larger question by focusing on the molecular basis of two important aspects of AID/APOBEC specificity: selectivity for DNA over RNA, and biochemical plausibility of deamination-coupled demethylation. To address these questions, we have synthesized chimeric <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> substrates and characterized their reactivity with AID {{and the rest of the}} APOBEC family. With regards to <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> selectivity, <b>modifications</b> to the 22 ̆ 7 -position of the target nucleotide sugar significantly alter AID 2 ̆ 7 s reactivity. Strikingly, within a substrate that is otherwise DNA, a single RNA-like 22 ̆ 7 -hydroxyl substitution at the target cytosine is sufficient to compromise deamination. Alternatively, modifications that favor a DNA-like conformation (or sugar pucker) are compatible with deamination. Inversely, with unreactive 22 ̆ 7 -fluoro-RNA substrates, AID 2 ̆ 7 s deaminase activity was rescued by introducing a trinucleotide DNA patch spanning the target cytosine and two upstream nucleotides. With regards to demethylation, AID has substantially reduced activity on 5 -methylcytosine relative to cytosine, its canonical substrate, and no detectable deamination of 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine. This finding is explained by the reactivity of a series of modified substrates, where steric bulk at the 5 -position was increasingly detrimental to deamination. We found that these <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> determinants, localized to the nucleotide base and sugar, are conserved across the entire AID/APOBEC family. Taken together, we consolidate these findings into a unifying, mechanistic model for substrate engagement that clarifies the established and proposed functions of the AID/APOBEC family. ...|$|R
40|$|Human {{chromosomes}} {{have been}} studied for over a century, but it took until the 1950 s that the correct human chromosome number was determined. The development of chromosome pretreatment procedures and modification of DNA staining techniques some 20 years later, allowed more precise chromosome identification based on banding patterns. This landmarkadvance in human cytogenetics allowed researchers to address specific clinical and research questions and make rapid progress in understanding the chromosomal basis of many genetic diseases and cancer. Although banding methodologies allow the distinction of individual chromosome pairs and the detection of gross karyotype aberrations, the analysis is heavily dependent on the accumulated experience and sometimes subjective interpretation of cytogeneticists. The low mitotic index, poor growth rate and sub-optimal chromosome morphology, which are hallmarks of tumour metaphase chromosome preparations, make cancer cytogenetics a particularly difficult discipline. Introduction of fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) in combination with recombinant DNA technology opened {{a new chapter in}} detection and investigation of chromosomal basis of human genetic diseases in the 1990 s. The success of this new discipline, molecular cytogenetics, in gene mapping and precise characterisation of chromosomal abnormalities, hinged on development of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> <b>modification</b> to incorporate fluorescent reporter molecules into <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> hybridization probes. This thesis contributes to further advancement of molecular cytogenetics. The pq-COBRAFISH method presented in Chapter 2, employs a combination of binary and ratio-labelling to discriminate in one experiment all human chromosome arms, thus enhancing and objectifying the detection of chromosomal abnormalities. In Chapter 3, it has been used to detect chromosomal rearrangements in individuals with abnormal phenotype and normal G-banding patterns. It also aided in identification of a novel cancerous gene alteration by discovering BCL 11 B, as a new candidate gene in acute myelocytic leukaemia. pq-COBRA-FISH readily resolves complex karyotypes, characteristic of solid tumours. As such it was instrumental to discovery of a novel function of the chromatin remodelling complex, hSNF 5, in maintenance of chromosome stability and ploidy (Chapter 4). Although molecular cytogenetics with its sophisticated multicolour FISH technology has allowed significant advancement in cancer and has become an intricate part of diagnosis and research there are still analytical and methodological problems in cancer cytogenetics. Full karyotyping, for example, is still restricted to mitotic cells. Chapter 5 of this thesis presents studies where a potent phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, was employed to prematurely condense the chromosomes of non-mitotic cells. This premature chromosome condensation technique or PCC increases the number of analysable chromosome structures compared to classical mitotic arrest, with minimum culture. This greatly improves the capacity of researchers to cytogenetically study solid tumours, where the success of comprehensive karyotyping of biopsy material has always been problematic. The specific morphological characteristics of PCC chromosomes furthermore allow distinction of the G 1 and G 2 phases of the cell cycle. The possibility to assess (differences in) chromosomal abnormalities of cells in the various cell cycle phases can offer valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis processes, including the much debated chromosome instability.
