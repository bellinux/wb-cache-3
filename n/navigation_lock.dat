25|$|The Barrage Vauban, or Vauban Dam, is a bridge, weir and {{defensive}} work erected in the 17th century on the River Ill {{in the city}} of Strasbourg in France. At that time, it was known as the Great Lock (grande écluse), although it does not function as a <b>navigation</b> <b>lock</b> in the modern sense of the word. Today it serves to display sculptures and has a viewing terrace on its roof, with views of the earlier Ponts Couverts bridges and Petite France quarter. It has been classified as a Monument historique since 1971.|$|E
25|$|Between St Ives and Bedford, {{there were}} ten sluices, which were pound locks {{constructed}} at locations where mill weirs {{would have prevented}} navigation. There were also five staunches, which were flash locks constructed near to fords and shallows. Operation of the beam and paddle provided an extra volume of water to carry the boats over such obstructions. On the lower river, a combination of high spring tides and large volumes of floodwater resulted in the complete failure of Denver sluice in 1713. While there were celebrations among the navigators, the problem of flooding returned, and the channel below Denver deteriorated. Charles Labelye therefore designed a new sluice for the Bedford Level Corporation, which was constructed between 1748 and 1750 and included a <b>navigation</b> <b>lock.</b> No tolls were charged on the river below St Ives or on the New Bedford, and those responsible for drainage complained about damage to the sluices and to banks by the horses used for towing boats. An Act of Parliament to regulate the situation was defeated in 1777 after fierce opposition, {{and it was not}} until 1789 that a Haling Act was passed, which ensured that tolls were charged and landowners were repaid for damage to the banks caused by horses. These measures were a success, as there were few complaints once the new system was in place.|$|E

500|$|Reports on {{improvements}} to the system were produced in 1843 by the surveyor Mr W Lewin and in 1845 by Sir John Rennie. Rennie's scheme involved the provision of a catchwater drain to collect water draining from the higher ground to the west before it entered the fenlands, but an Act of Parliament to authorise its construction was defeated, and so in 1846 a report by Mr W Cubit which proposed {{improvements to}} the existing infrastructure was accepted by the Commissioners. A new Black Sluice, including a [...] wide <b>navigation</b> <b>lock,</b> was constructed {{to the south of}} the original one, with the cill level [...] lower, which enabled the gradient of the South Forty-Foot Drain to be increased to 3inches per mile (5cm/km). Many of the tributary drains were also improved. 1846 also {{marked the beginning of the}} use of steam engines for pumping. Ten years later, a map covering [...] of the Black Sluice area showed nine steam-powered and eight wind-powered drainage engines in use.|$|E
500|$|Scots Float sluice, some [...] {{from the}} mouth of the river, is used to control levels. It is named for Sir John Scot(t), who {{enlarged}} a harbour on the site around 1480. The river below it is tidal, and it is closed as the tide rises, to prevent salt water passing up the river. During dry years, the sluice may be kept closed for most of the summer, as the water is used to maintain the marsh environment. A <b>navigation</b> <b>lock</b> bypasses the sluice. If heavy rainfall coincides with a high tide, where outflow is tide-locked, the river above the sluice to Bodiam acts as a huge holding reservoir for flood water, and is managed as such. In times of high flow, water is also pumped from the river into Darwell Reservoir, which can hold 167 million cubic feet (4728 Ml) of water. It covers an area of [...] and was built between 1937 and 1949. Since the 1980s, its output has been taken by pipeline to Beauport Park, from where it provides a public water supply for Hastings.|$|E

500|$|Perry was {{succeeded by}} John Grundy, Sr., who {{published}} {{a paper in}} 1734 on flow in open drains. He calculated theoretic flow rates, and then used observation {{in the field to}} modify the results. He oversaw a programme of repairs to the Deeping Bank, which ran for [...] along the north and west side of the river, while John Scribo was employed {{to do the same for}} the Country Bank, which ran for [...] on the south and east. Grundy made the river deeper above Spalding, and also constructed a sluice and reservoir at the mouth of the Glen. The reservoir covered [...] and provided water to scour the channel below the sluice. His son, John Grundy, Jr., took over after the death of his father in 1748, and spent nearly £10,000 on bank repairs between then and 1764. He rebuilt Perry's sluice soon after 1750, with taller doors and a set of tide gates to prevent the tide moving upstream, and rebuilt the <b>navigation</b> <b>lock</b> in 1754. After 1764, Thomas Hogard became the surveyor of works, but Grundy continued to act as a consultant engineer.|$|E
500|$|The {{drainage}} of Deeping Fen {{was again}} addressed in 1664, when the Deeping Fen Act awarded the Earl of Manchester and others [...] {{of land in}} return for the drainage works. They were also obliged to maintain the banks of the river, to ensure that both the Welland and the Glen were kept clean and free-flowing, and to ensure that no tolls were charged for navigation on any part of the river below East Deeping. The inadequacy of the outfall and a spate of bad weather stopped them from completing their task. They tried renting out the land they had been granted, but many tenants were unable to pay the rent, due to the poor state of the drainage which reduced crop yields. In April 1729, the Deeping Fen Adventurers received a letter from Captain John Perry, expressing the opinion {{that the only way to}} improve the drainage was to improve the river outfalls, and proposing the construction of scouring sluices on the river at Spalding, on Vernatt's drain at its outfall, and on the River Glen at Surfleet. Perry was an engineer of some repute, who had set the standard for engineering reports in 1727, when he published his recommendations for the North Level of the Fens. His plans were approved, and the Adventurers offered to give him land covering nearly [...] in payment for the work. He sold one-third of the land to finance the project, and began work in 1730. Cowbit sluice on the Welland had six [...] wide gates which were operated by chains connected to a treadwheel. At high tide, water was penned in Cowbit Wash, between banks which were set well back from the main channel. The bed of the river below the sluice was loosened by dragging wooden rollers with iron spikes over it. At low tide, the sluice gates were opened, and the flow scoured out the silt for some [...] downstream. A <b>navigation</b> <b>lock</b> was constructed beside the sluice, so that vessels could still gain access to the river above. Perry died in February 1733, and was buried in Spalding churchyard. The lock lasted until it was removed by the Welland commissioners in 1813.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the death}} of Pearce in 1733, Cassels became the {{engineer}} for the project, which included building the first <b>navigation</b> <b>lock</b> in Ireland. He was discharged in 1736, probably because he was {{paying more attention to}} the architectural commissions he had taken over from Pearce. He was replaced by Thomas Steers, who employed a local man called William Gilbert to oversee the work, which was completed by 1741. Legal disputes delayed the official opening until 1742, and a barge loaded with coal from the Tyrone coalfields reached Dublin on 28 March 1742, although the first part or the journey had involved carriage of the coal overland to Lough Neagh, as the Tyrone Navigation, begun in 1732, was far from complete.

2500|$|Development of the St. Lawrence River {{which serves}} as a border between Canada and the United States was in its early stages in 1871 when the Treaty of Washington was signed, which in part demarcated the St. Lawrence River as a {{boundary}} and offered Americans greater use of the Canadian side of the river for shipping. In 1895 the Deep Waterways Commission was established to explore expanded use of the river for navigation. International shipping on the river would {{have a positive impact on}} trade between the two countries. The early St. Lawrence Seaway was proposed but railway companies in the United States stopped its construction because they felt it would reduce their profits. The Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 further solidified cooperation between the U.S. and Canada on the river, allowing [...] "free and open" [...] navigation and establishing the International Joint Commission (IJC) to resolve disputes. In 1931, New York's Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Power Authority Act which allowed the development of the St. Lawrence River for power use. A primary site was just below the Long Sault Rapids. Despite the cooperation, the U.S. Federal Government was unable to open up the river for increased navigation and development due to political issues. Upset with this, Canada unilaterally passed two acts in 1951 which allowed projects on the St. Lawrence for power and navigation purposes. They pressured the U.S. to act and in 1952, President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a hydroelectric dam on the river. The next year a proposal for a hydroelectric dam and <b>navigation</b> <b>lock</b> was submitted to the IJC for approval. In October 1952 the project was approved.|$|E
