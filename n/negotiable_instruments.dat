5|$|Since {{substitute}} {{checks are}} considered legal checks, substitute checks {{are subject to}} existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the Expedited Funds Availability Act, Article3 (<b>Negotiable</b> <b>Instruments),</b> and Article4 (Bank Deposits and Collections) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along {{with a variety of}} state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check. If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check21Act, the Check21Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.|$|E

25|$|In {{most common}} law jurisdictions {{there is a}} Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in {{relation}} to <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments,</b> including cheques, and this Act contains a statutory {{definition of the term}} banker: banker includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with changes}} to {{surveillance}} measures, the Patriot Act also made substantial changes to laws relating to money laundering. The main law changed was the Money Laundering Control Act (MLCA), which was itself {{an amendment to}} the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) The BSA was passed by Congress in 1970 and is designed to fight drug trafficking, money laundering and other financial crimes. It requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments,</b> file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $US10,000, and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities. The MLCA, passed in 1986, further enhanced the BSA by making it a crime to structure transactions {{in such a way as}} to avoid BSA reporting requirements.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{courts have}} limited Erie slightly, {{to create a}} few {{situations}} where United States federal courts are permitted to create federal common law rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. See, e.g., Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, [...] (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments</b> backed by the federal government); see also International News Service v. Associated Press, [...] (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of [...] "hot news" [...] that lacks any statutory grounding); but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc., 105 F.3d 841, 843–44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of INS [...] "hot news" [...] tort under New York state law, but leaving open {{the question of whether}} it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.|$|E
2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments,</b> uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Negotiable</b> <b>instruments</b> are {{unconditional}} {{and impose}} few to no duties on the issuer or payee other than payment.

The negotiability of mortgage notes has been debated, particularly due to the obligations and [...] "baggage" [...] associated with mortgages; however, in mortgages notes are often determined to be <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|E

The underlying contract contemplates the right to hold the instrument as, and to negotiate the instrument to, a holder in due course, the payment on which is {{at least part of the}} performance of the contract to which the <b>negotiable</b> <b>instrument</b> is linked. The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a [...] "bearer instrument", wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment. Certain exceptions exist, such as instances of loss or theft of the instrument, wherein the possessor of the note may be a holder, but not necessarily a holder in due course.
