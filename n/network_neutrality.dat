40|$|Phase {{transitions}} play {{an important}} role in understanding search difficulty in combinatorial optimisation. However, previous attempts have not revealed a clear link between fitness landscape properties and the phase transition. We explore whether the global landscape structure of the number partitioning problem changes with the phase transition. Using the local optima network model, we analyse a number of instances before, during, and after the phase transition. We compute relevant <b>network</b> and <b>neutrality</b> metrics; and importantly, identify and visualise the funnel structure with an approach (monotonic sequences) inspired by theoretical chemistry. While most metrics remain oblivious to the phase transition, our results reveal that the funnel structure clearly changes. Easy instances feature a single or a small number of dominant funnels leading to global optima; hard instances have a large number of suboptimal funnels attracting the search. Our study brings new insights and tools to the study of phase transitions in combinatorial optimisation...|$|R

This paper {{shows that the}} performance of capsule-based active networks can benefit from compiling active network programs into native network processor instructions at traversed routers (just-in-time compilation). A key aspect of the paper is to demonstrate that just-in-time compilers for active networks can be fast and small enough for applicability in the datapath of network processors. The approach has been implemented based on the SNAP active network framework for the PowerNP network processor...|$|R

One CuI atom is tetrahedrally bound to four CN groups, and the other CuI atom is bonded to three CN groups in an approximate trigonal-planar coordination. The tetrahedrally coordinated CuI atoms are linked into centrosymmetric dimers by the C atoms of two end-on bridging CN groups which bring the CuI atoms into close contact at 2. 5171  (7)  Å. Two of the cyanide groups bonded to the CuI atoms with trigonal-planar surrounding link the dimeric units into columns along the a axis, and the third links the columns together to form the network.

40|$|Lygus pratensis (L.) is an {{important}} cotton pest in China, especially in the northwest region. Nymphs and adults cause serious quality and yield losses. However, the genetic structure and geographic distribution of L. pratensis is not well known. We analyzed genetic diversity, geographical structure, gene flow, and population dynamics of L. pratensis in northwest China using mitochondrial and nuclear sequence datasets to study phylogeographical patterns and demographic history. L. pratensis (n = 286) were collected at sites across an area spanning 2, 180, 000 km 2, including the Xinjiang and Gansu-Ningxia regions. Populations in the two regions could be distinguished based on mitochondrial criteria but the overall genetic structure was weak. The nuclear dataset revealed a lack of diagnostic genetic structure across sample areas. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a lack of population level monophyly {{that may have been}} caused by incomplete lineage sorting. The Mantel test showed a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances among the populations based on the mtDNA data. However the nuclear dataset did not show significant correlation. A high level of gene flow among populations was indicated by migration analysis; human activities may have also facilitated insect movement. The availability of irrigation water and ample cotton hosts makes the Xinjiang region well suited for L. pratensis reproduction. Bayesian skyline plot analysis, star-shaped <b>network,</b> and <b>neutrality</b> tests all indicated that L. pratensis has experienced recent population expansion. Climatic changes and extensive areas occupied by host plants have led to population expansion of L. pratensis. In conclusion, the present distribution and phylogeographic pattern of L. pratensis was influenced by climate, human activities, and availability of plant hosts...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to develop new {{international}} financial integration indicators together with their determinants: financial openness and regularity (balance) of bilateral financial flows. The study s contribution is based on the definition of the Standard of Perfect Financial Integration (SPFI). This standard characterizes the scenario attainable when financial flows are not geographically biased, and cross-border asset trade is not affected by home bias. We assess the gap between a hypothetical scenario of geographic neutrality and the current level of financial integration, along with both of its components. The empirical application to the banking systems of 18 countries-accounting for 83 % of international banking markets-over the 1999 - 2006 period enables us to conclude that the level of financial integration has advanced rapidly over the last few years, and is close to 50 % as of 2006, i. e., we are halfway to the SPFI. However, notable differences among countries are both persistent and growing, and the integration level achieved for each banking system differs when assessed from the financial inflows or outflows perspective.

25|$|Formed in 2010 and legalised on 12 March 2012, the Tunisian Pirate Party {{is a small}} {{political}} party in Tunisia. It's {{one of the first}} outgrowths of the Pirate Party movement in continental Africa. The party achieved notoriety during the Tunisian revolution, as party members declared their intention to break a media blackout on the social unrest taking place across the country. Members distributed censorship circumvention software, and assisted in documenting human rights abuses during the riots in the cities of Sidi Bouzid, Siliana, and Thala. After the revolution, a Pirate Party member who had been detained during the unrest, Slim Amamou, was briefly selected as Secretary of State for Sport and Youth in the new government. He later resigned in protest of the transitional government's censorship of several websites {{at the request of the}} army. He was arrested on 6 January 2011 during the protests that led to the Tunisian Revolution, alongside others including Azyz Amami. The Anonymous hacktivist group had led attacks on the Tunisian government's websites, and Amamou was held for five days by the state security forces under the suspicion of having collaborated with the hackers. Following a mass internet campaign and protest, Amamou and other bloggers were released from government custody. He supports the legalisation of cannabis in Tunisia.

40|$|Open-ocean environments provide few obvious {{barriers}} to the dispersal of marine organisms. Major currents and/or environmental gradients potentially impede gene flow. One system hypothesized to form an open-ocean dispersal barrier is the Antarctic Polar Front, an area characterized by marked temperature change, deep water, and the high-flow Antarctic Circumpolar current. Despite these potential isolating factors, several invertebrate species occur in both regions, including the broadcast-spawning nemertean worm Parborlasia corrugatus. To empirically test {{for the presence of}} an open-ocean dispersal barrier, we sampled P. corrugatus and other nemerteans from southern South America, Antarctica, and the sub-Antarctic islands. Diversity was assessed by analyzing mitochondrial 16 S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequence data with Bayesian inference and TCS haplotype <b>network</b> analysis. Appropriate <b>neutrality</b> tests were also employed. Although our results indicate a single well-mixed lineage in Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic, no evidence for recent gene flow was detected between this population and South American P. corrugatus. Thus, even though P. corrugatus can disperse over large geographical distances, physical oceanographic barriers (i. e. Antarctic Polar Front and Antarctic Circumpolar Current) between continents have likely restricted dispersal over evolutionary time. Genetic distances and haplotype network analysis between South American and Antarctic/ sub-Antarctic P. corrugatus suggest that these two populations are possibly two cryptic species...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ethical issues {{surrounding}} {{the concept of}} Internet neutrality focusing specifically on the correlation between neutrality and fairness. Moving from {{an analysis of the}} many available definitions of Internet neutrality and the heterogeneity of the Internet infrastructure, the common assumption that a neutral Internet is also a fair Internet is challenged. It is argued that a properly neutral Internet supports undesirable situations in which few users can exhaust the majority of the available resources or in which specific types of applications and services cannot be developed or properly deployed. The solution offered to these shortcomings is based on (1) an environmental approach to the Internet, (2) the four guiding principles of Floridi???s Information Ethics and (3) a principle called ???Information Diversity???. The paper is divided into six sections. Section 1 briefly presents the debate concerning the concepts of <b>network</b> and Internet <b>neutrality.</b> Section 2 poses a general and unifying definition of Internet neutrality based on the critical assessment of several domain-specific approaches to the problem of neutrality. Section 3 is dedicated to the analysis of the relationship between Internet neutrality and the ethical principle of fairness. Section 4 introduces Floridi???s Information Ethics, the definition of Information Diversity and an analysis of how they can be used to address the limitations of Internet neutrality. Section 5 summarises the ethics of Internet neutrality and Information Diversity defining their relationship. Section 6 reviews the arguments presented in the paper clarifying the foundational role played by Information Diversity and Information Ethics in Internet policy-making activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of Internet-based services depends on many server-side, client-side, and network related factors. Often, the interaction among the factors or {{their effect on}} service performance is not known or well-understood. The complexity of these services {{makes it difficult to}} develop analytical models. Lack of models impedes network management tasks, such as predicting performance while planning for changes to service infrastructure, or diagnosing causes of poor performance. We posit that we can use statistical causal methods to model performance for Internet-based services and facilitate performance related network management tasks. Internet-based services are well-suited for statistical learning because the inherent variability in many factors that affect performance allows us to collect comprehensive datasets that cover service performance under a wide variety of conditions. These conditional distributions represent the functions that govern service performance and dependencies that are inherent in the service infrastructure. These functions and dependencies are accurate and can be used in lieu of analytical models to reason about system performance, such as predicting {{performance of}} a service when changing some factors, finding causes of poor performance, or isolating contribution of individual factors in observed performance. We present three systems, What-if Scenario Evaluator (WISE), How to Improve Performance (HIP), and <b>Network</b> Access <b>Neutrality</b> Observatory (NANO), that use statistical causal methods to facilitate network management tasks. WISE predicts performance for what-if configurations and deployment questions for content distribution networks. For this, WISE learns the causal dependency structure among the latency-causing factors, and when one or more factors is changed, WISE estimates effect on other factors using the dependency structure. HIP extends WISE and uses the causal dependency structure to invert the performance function, find causes of poor performance, and help answers questions about how to improve performance or achieve performance goals. NANO uses causal inference to quantify the impact of discrimination policies of ISPs on service performance. NANO is the only tool to date for detecting destination-based discrimination techniques that ISPs may use. We have evaluated these tools by application to large-scale Internet-based services and by experiments on wide-area Internet. WISE is actively used at Google for predicting network-level and browser-level response time for Web search for new datacenter deployments. We have used HIP to find causes of high-latency Web search transactions in Google, and identified many cases where high-latency transactions can be significantly mitigated with simple infrastructure changes. We have evaluated NANO using experiments on wide-area Internet and also made the tool publicly available to recruit users and deploy NANO at a global scale. Ph. D.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that much of {{evolution}} takes place in the absence of fitness gradients. Such periods of evolution can be analysed by examining the mutational network formed by sequences of equal fitness, that is, the neutral network. It has been demonstrated that, in large populations under a high mutation rate, the population distribution over the neutral network and average mutational robustness are given by the principal eigenvector and eigen- value, respectively, of the network's adjacency matrix. However, little progress has been made towards understanding {{the manner in which the}} topology of the neutral network influences the resulting population distribution and robustness. In this work, we build on recent results from spectral graph theory and utilize numerical methods to enhance our understanding of how populations distribute themselves over neutral networks. We demonstrate that, in the presence of certain topological features, the population will undergo an exploration catastrophe and become confined to a small portion of the network. We further derive approximations, in terms of mutational biases, for the population distribution and average robustness in networks with a homogeneous structure. The applicability of these results is explored, first, by a detailed review of the literature in both evolutionary computing and biology concerning the structure of neutral networks. This is extended by studying the actual and predicted population distribution over the neutral networks of H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 influenza haemagglutinin during seasons between 2005 and 2016. It is shown that, in some instances, these populations experience an exploration catastrophe. These results provide insight into the behaviour of populations on neutral <b>networks,</b> demonstrating that <b>neutrality</b> does not necessarily lead to an exploration of genotype/phenotype space or an associated increase in population diversity. Moreover, they provide a plausible explanation for conflicting results concerning the relationship between robustness and evolvability...|$|R

2500|$|The {{court upheld}} the FCC's {{authority}} to regulate broadband providers to encourage nationwide broadband deployment, agreeing with the FCC's interpretation of section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.

Legal scholar Annemarie Bridy predicted that the case will force the FCC's hand in reclassifying broadband providers as [...] "telecommunications services," [...] something which the FCC has so far resisted doing.

2500|$|Lessig {{has long}} been known to be a {{supporter}} of net neutrality. In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify Michael Powell's four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, [...] "Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the <b>network</b> <b>neutrality</b> movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough.

After discovering the true potential to hold an intelligent conversation in the game, he was inspired to create a talk show, originally to be called The Spartan 117 Dialogs, the name of which would have come from the official code for the Master Chief, protagonist of the Halo video game series. However, before episode one was released the name was changed to This Spartan Life, and all releases have been under that name.
