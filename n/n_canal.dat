50|$|The Gogo Building, {{formerly}} known as the River Center, is located at 111 <b>N.</b> <b>Canal</b> Street in the West Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. Originally constructed as a warehouse in the early 1900s, the vintage, loft-style building is now home to various commercial tenants, most notably Gogo Inflight Internet, as seen by their logo on the cube topping the building. Other tenants include Twitter, Uber, Vivid Seats, Fieldglass, Potbelly and Solstice.

50|$|True to its name, the street, {{which began}} as an Indian trail, {{eventually}} leads north {{to the state of}} Wisconsin and through Kenosha and Racine towards Milwaukee, though not directly. Starting with a short section at <b>N.</b> <b>Canal</b> and W. Lake Streets, it begins in earnest at the corner of N Desplaines and W. Kinzie Streets and heads northwest for about 40 mi before joining Skokie Highway (U.S. Route 41) in Gurnee, Illinois, which eventually merges at Interstate 94 where Skokie Highway and the Tri-State Tollway split off, continuing to Milwaukee. From Harlem Avenue northwards it is Illinois Route 21.|$|E
50|$|There are two massive {{red brick}} {{buildings}} along the Chicago River {{just south of}} where the river splits, {{formerly known as the}} Butler Brothers Warehouse buildings. They were both designed for the Butler Brothers Company, a mail order company, similar to Montgomery Ward's and Sears & Roebuck at the time. The northern structure was designed by Daniel Burnham, a famous Chicago architect, with its completion date being 1913- a year after Burnham’s death. This building only stood for 7 years before being completely demolished and rebuilt exactly as it stood before by the Chicago Union Station Company on the adjacent lot to allow for new railroad construction along the Chicago River. The warehouse was a huge shipping and distribution center at the time. The recently renovated building still stands on this lot today at 111 <b>N.</b> <b>Canal</b> Street and is known as The Gogo Building. In 1990 the Morton International Building, now the Boeing International Headquarters, was built on the original Butler Brothers Warehouse lot facing the river. Because of this, only the top block of The Gogo Building can now be seen from the Chicago River. The Boeing International Headquarters building was constructed with only the air rights above the railroad tracks, meaning Amtrak still owns the ground rights to the area and the tracks built in 1920 are still in service beneath the building.|$|E

More precisely, a cascade of <b>n</b> <b>canal</b> reaches, joined by gates, is considered, and, by using measurements of the water level in three points per reach, we design an observer capable of estimating both the infiltration and discharge in the middle point of each reach. To facilitate the observer design, the system dynamics is modeled by considering a linearized approximation of the underlying nonlinear dynamics around the subcritical uniform flow condition. The proposed solution {{is based on the}} unknown-input and proportional-integral observers theory. Simulation results are discussed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a problem of}} state and disturbance estimation for an open-channel hydraulic system. Particularly, a cascade of <b>n</b> <b>canal</b> reaches, joined by gates, is considered. The underlying Saint-Venant system of PDEs is managed {{by means of a}} collocation-based finite-dimensional approximation. The resulting nonlinear systems' dynamics are linearized, and an estimation algorithm is designed by combining a conventional linear unknown-input observer (UIO) and a nonlinear disturbance observer (DO) based on the sliding-mode approach. By using measurements of the water level in three points per reach, the suggested algorithm is capable of estimating, both, the time varying infiltration and the discharge variables in the middle point of the reaches. The UIO and DO design procedures are constructively illustrated throughout the paper, and simulation results are discussed to verify their effectiveness...|$|E
