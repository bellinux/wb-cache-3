One panel consists of an upper dry surface coated aluminum sheet laminated to an ethylene vinyl acetate foam backing block having a pattern of parallel flow water channels and header channels milled into its mating surface prior to lamination to the aluminum sheet. This configuration provides a fin and channel radiator instrument whereby circulating water may be used to measure the heat loss from this panel to <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation.</b> In a second configuration, the surface of a panel without buried water channels but otherwise identical may be wetted in order to study and compare the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> from its wet surface. In this case, the measuring water is circulated over the upper face of this panel. In a third configuration, water is sprayed onto the surface of the second panel (or a similar panel) so that an evaporative cooling effect is gained in addition to the radiation effect. Initial TRNSYS simulations for the performance of all three configurations are presented and it is planned to use the panels as calibrated instruments for discriminating between the cooling effects of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> and evaporation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop methods that reduce energy consumption in a residential building in a hot and humid climate region (Thailand) using efficient architectural building components and renewable energy (solar energy) to produce electricity, domestic hot water, and supplemental cooling by <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation.</b> Improving the architectural building components, including building materials, is an option to reduce energy consumption in a building. Using renewable energy sources is another option to reduce the consumption of non-renewable energy. In residential buildings, solar energy has been utilized for space heating and domestic hot water using active solar collector systems and for generating electricity using photovoltaic (PV) systems. One photovoltaic system, the hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collector system, has been developed by several researchers over the last 20 years. The hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collector system is a combination photovoltaic (for producing electricity) and solar thermal collector (for producing hot water). Theoretical and experimental studies of this collector have highlighted the advantages of the hybrid PV-T collector system over separate systems of PV and solar collector in term of system efficiency and economics. Unfortunately, very little experimental data exists that demonstrates the advantages of a combined system. Therefore, one of the objectives of this study conducted was an experimental study of this system as an auxiliary energy source for a residential building. <b>Night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> has also been studied as a cooling strategy. However, no attempt so far could be found to integrate it to a hybrid PV-T collector system. The <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> strategy could be operated with the hybrid PV/T collector system by using existing resources that are already present in the solar system. The integration of the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> into the hybrid PV-T collector system should yield more productivity of the system than the operation of the Hybrid PVT system alone. The research methods used in this work included instrumentation of a case-study house in Thailand, an experimental PV-T collector system, and a calibrated building thermal simulation. A typical contemporary Thai residential building was selected as a case-study house. Its energy use and local weather data were measured and analyzed. Published energy use of Thai residential buildings was also analyzed as well to determine average energy consumption. A calibrated computer model of the case-study building was constructed using the DOE- 2 program. A field experiment of the thermal PV system was constructed to test its ability to simultaneously produce electricity and hot water in the daytime, and shed heat at night as a cooling strategy (i. e., <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation).</b> The resultant electricity and hot water produced by the hybrid PV-T collector system helped to reduce the use of non-renewable energy. The cooling produced by the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> also has to potential to reduce the cooling load. The evaluation of the case-study house and results of the field experiment helped to quantify the potential reduction of energy use in Thai residential buildings. This research provided the following benefits: 1) experimental results of a hybrid PV-T solar collector system that demonstrates its performance compared to typical system of separate photovoltaic and solar collector, 2) results of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> experiments using a photovoltaic panel as a radiator to demonstrate the performance of this new space cooling strategy, and 3) useful data from the case-study house simulation results and guidelines to assist others in transferring the results to other projects...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe hot dry {{regions in}} Mexico occupy more than seventy-five {{percentage}} of total land surface with severe climate conditions for both cooling and heating seasons. The buildings located in these regions present large energy consumption patterns due to their high dependence on air conditioning (AC) for providing comfort to the occupants, which in turns provokes the emission of huge amounts of greenhouse gasses (GHG) to the atmosphere, affecting the environment at regional al global levels. For those people who cannot afford AC in their buildings, the situation is even worse, as it severely affects their health conditions. This research work deals with the investigation of several passive cooling and heating techniques in experimental modules aimed at achieving hygrothermal conditions for building occupants. These cooling techniques involved the four environmental heat sinks and included: Ground cooling, solar control, night ventilation, direct evaporative cooling, <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> infrared <b>radiation</b> and thermal insulation. During the typical underheating season, direct and indirect heating techniques along with infiltration control and thermal insulation were implemented and examined. These systems were built and implemented in experimental cells during the prevailing overheating and underheating periods and {{the results showed that}} the combined effect of the strategies provided more promising synergy results than the single influence of any of them. During the underheating period, the indoor minimum temperature was 15 ° C, and the maximum temperature during the overheating season registered 29 ° C. Therefore, it is suggested to implement the combined action of the passive cooling and heating techniques in buildings located in representative hot dry regions of Mexico, to improve hygrothermal comfort and to reduce the energy consumption for AC and this would eventually reduce also the emission of pollutants to the atmosphere...|$|R

During the summer of 1985,? with the test room decoupled from the roof pond itself, several series of tests were initiated. The first experiment (fig. 1) was to test the overall response of the system by forcing the temperature in storage to a preset value and observe its decay / curve with ponding and spray. The second experiment (fig* 2) was similar to the first but with ponding only and no spray.

40|$|The subalpine {{environment}} {{is characterized by}} the possibility of frost throughout the summer. The frequency and severity of summertime frost episodes appeared particularly dependent on net losses of infrared energy to a cold <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> (<b>radiation</b> frost), as well as air temperature and wind speed. Longwave radiation minima from the night sky were strongly correlated with the occurrence of leaf temperature minima. Leaf temperatures were modeled using an energy balance simulation that quantified the specific effects of ambient air temperature, wind speed, sky infrared radiation, and sky exposure characteristic of this high-elevation environment. Plants growing in exposed and sheltered habitats have characteristic leaf structures (smaller, thicker leaves in more exposed locations) that have been traditionally associated with the total amount of incident sunlight. However, smaller leaves also appear adaptive for reducing the susceptibility to radiation frosts. Larger, more exposed leaves resulted in colder nocturnal leaf temperatures and greater frost frequencies. Microsite sky radiation, microtopography, plant habit and leaf structure all have important implications for estimating growing season length and plant distribution patterns, especially at higher elevations where summer frosts are common. Radiational frosts at night are typically followed by clear skies and full-sun exposure the next morning. The combination of low temperature stress followed by high light exposure can result in strong photoinhibition of photosynthesis. The morphology of a variety of conifer needles as well as of a broadleaf was modeled to evaluate the effect on incident sunlight intensity. Conifer leaf morphology was found to be particularly adaptive for avoiding high incident light conditions compared to broadleaves...|$|E

In computer electronics application, {{the trend of}} the computer processors performance and power consumption has been increased significantly each year. Heat dissipation has been increased but in contrast the size of die on the processor has been reduced or remained the same size due to nano-size circuit technology and thus the heat flux is critically high. The heat flux was about 10 - 15 W/cm 2 in the year 2000 and had reached over 100 W/cm 2 in 2010. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide insight into how to extend the air cooling capability and maximize its performance by use of heat pipes. The global warming crisis is real, and it is a responsibility for all individuals to put forth effort to reduce and prevent further damage to the global environment. In most countries worldwide, the majority of electric power is generated from non-renewable energy sources including coal, gas, and nuclear power, which degrade earth’s atmosphere by green house gas emissions.

40|$|The {{durability}} of mineral fiber insulations depends {{to a large}} extent on coinciding temperature and humidity conditions within these materials. Existing test procedures use combinations of rather extreme temperature and humidity conditions above 60 or 70 °C and 95 to 100 % RH. However, these test conditions lead to a significant reduction of the mechanical strength of glass fiber insulation materials which cannot be observed in real life. Subject of this work is to evaluate these loads in lightweight flat roofs with mineral fiber insulation and dark roofing membranes. Therefore a test roof was built up at the field test site of the Fraunhofer IBP in Holzkirchen (alpine region of Germany, 680 m a. s. l.). The solar radiation and the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> at this altitude lead to rather extreme temperature conditions in the test roof. In order to achieve the most unfavorable humidity conditions within the insulation two liters of water per m² were inserted to the roof before closing the construction. The measured conditions in the roof serve also to validate hygrothermal simulation results which allow in a second step to "transfer" the test roof to other locations in northern and southern Europe. Thus, the most extreme temperature and moisture conditions likely to occur in the glass fiber insulation layer of light-weight flat roofs can be determined. A material test procedure for durability assessments should accelerate the normal degradation process but not make fail a solution which performs well in reality. Therefore, new test conditions are proposed which are closer to the conditions occurring in real life while still allowing the normal aging process to be accelerated. The result will be a more realistic decrease of the material strength compared to the present procedures...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The global {{energy demand}} {{has seen a}} {{significant}} increase over the past decade. Our inseparable need for energy has created a number of serious concerns. The most important concern is {{the environmental impact of}} our energy generating methods. Another looming concern is our global fossil fuel resources that are diminishing progressively. These two major concerns have turned attention to research and development of energy efficient and alternative energy systems. A field of alternative energy that has been untapped is nocturnal radiative cooling. The idea behind this is to utilise the cooling effect between a hot surface and the night sky. The setup {{is similar to that of}} a solar water heating system but is used for cooling instead of heating. Previous studies on radiative cooling systems have all focussed on forced circulation systems. The aim of this study is to analyse the performance of a natural circulating system. The current knowledge on radiative cooling systems is limited and experimental research is often a costly and time consuming exercise. As a result it is difficult to get an understanding of the performance of a radiative cooling system in various operating environments. The aim of this study is to overcome this limitation by developing a theoretical model to simulate the performance of a natural circulating radiative cooling system. A natural circulating solar water heater model was used as a basis for the natural circulating radiative cooling model. A <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> model replaced the solar radiation component to give the radiative heat transfer of the panel to the night sky. Fundamental heat transfer and fluid flow theories also formed part of the model. The theoretical model was able to give realistically accurate predictions compared to data from an experimental setup. The model made it possible to study the impact of various parameters on the system performance without the constraints of experimental setups. The performance of a natural circulating radiative cooling system was simulated over a year under different operating climates by using historical weather data. The results obtained with the help of the model indicated that natural circulating radiative cooling is indeed able to provide a sufficient cooling effect that can be utilised in a practical manner. This study gives indication that radiative cooling systems are worthy of further development to ensure that it forms part of the current line–up of alternative energy systems. Master...|$|E

The evolution of this indirect evaporative cooling technique is discussed. Psychrometric and sol-air principles are covered and a simplified method of evaluation presented. A {{life cycle energy}} savings example is discussed. Benefits of roof life and roof top equipment efficiency and maintenance are covered as well as water consumption and performance trade-offs with alternate methods of roof heat gain control. Testimonials and case studies are presented. The gradual migration of business, industry, and populace to the southern United States was largely {{brought on by the}} advent of the practical air-conditioner, cheap electricity, and the harshness of northern winters. But while "wintering at Palm Beach" has been replaced by "Sun Belt industries"; the compression-refrigeration cooling cycle is about the only thing separating millions of southerners (native and adopted) from August heat stroke and the Detroit News employment ads. This migration has been spurred by economic recessions which hit harder at the competitively populated northern centers than at the still growing industries of the south. These trends are important illustrations of the concern for efficient cooling strategies. Not only are homes in hot climates vulnerable to the now not-so-low cost of electricity but large, compact. and heavily occupied buildings (offices, schools, hospitals, theaters, etc.) often must air-condition year-around. In 1968. air-conditioning was 3 % of U. S. end energy consumption compared to 18 % for space heating and 25 % for transportation. By 1980, according to Electric Power Research Institute's Oliver Yu, air-conditioning use was 12. 5 % of all electricity generated and by the year 2000 is projected to reach 16. 7 % "as migration slows and the GNP reaches a stable 3 % growth rate" (EPRI 1982 to 1986 Overview and Strategy). Of further significance is the effect of air-conditioning loads on the peak generating requirements of electrical utilities. Because utilities must build generating capacity to meet peak requirements, they normally charge a higher summer kWh rate (for residential) and levy a peak kW demand charge on a monthly or even annual "ratchet" rate (for larger service customers). The June ' 83 cover of Houston City Magazine, in reference to future electrical rates, promised: "Pay or Sweat".

40|$|Silicon wafer {{fabrication}} facilities require {{a significant amount}} of temperate cooling water to meet high internal cooling loads. The tertiary chilled water systems operate year round to fulfil the constant cooling load needed for production. Conventional chillers require a large amount of electricity to cool the water by the vapor compression cycle. As energy costs increase and environmental stewardship becomes the norm in industry, sustainable technologies are needed to chill process cooling water without the significant energy consumption of today’s chillers. <b>Night</b> <b>sky</b> <b>radiation</b> cools a medium by radiating heat from a warm medium to the colder night sky. The Intel silicon wafer manufacturing facility in Rio Rancho, New Mexico was selected to be an ideal location for the implementation of two full-scale designs. Numerous system designs were examined during a thorough literature survey, and an open water system was chosen as the best alternative because of its superior heat transfer ability and lower construction cost. At the suggestion of an external auditor, a closed system was studied further, designed, and economically analyzed. Recommendations for system choice are based on economic analyses, system operability, and environmental considerations. To aid in model construction and full-scale design, an extensive research program was developed to confirm literature correlations and determine the effectiveness of radiation to the night sky as a method used to cool water. Experiments that cooled an aluminum plate through the ambient temperature were used to confirm and verify the accuracy of Berdahl and Martin’s correlation for calculating the effective temperature of the night sky. A prototype for the open water system was built to demonstrate the cooling ability of the design. Operation of the prototype successfully demonstrated radiative night sky cooling, showed the benefit of convective heat transfer when the ambient air temperature is below the water temperature, and validated Berdahl and Martin’s model. With the experimental stage complete, the prototype system was scaled-up to a system for the Intel facility in Rio Rancho. The system diverts cooling water from Intel’s cooling water system into surge tanks. From the surge tanks, water is pumped up to the roof and is distributed among corrugated metal roofing units placed on top of the Intel central utilities building. The corrugated panels are supported by a pressure treated lumber frame. The chilled water isdistributed and collected by a PVC piping network. Model simulations of the full-scale system determined the cooling capability of the system. The full-scale simulation predicted that the system would eliminate over 90 % of the night-time chiller cooling loads during the winter. Throughout the year, the chillers use $ 280, 000 worth of electricity 1. The radiative cooling system will save the company $ 75, 000 in annual electricity costs, a decrease in electricity consumption of 27 %. The electricity generation portfolio of PNM, Intel’s electricity provider, was used to determine that the system will prevent approximately 930 tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere. The reduction of produced electricity will also conserve 4, 220, 000 gallons of water, a scarce resource in the southwestern Unites States. For the open system, the total capital cost is $ 353, 500 and the operating cost, including electricity to operate the unit, is $ 31, 600 /year. For the closed system, the total capital cost is $ 636, 500 and the operating cost, including electricity to operate the unit, is $ 12, 000 /year. The average net reduction in annual electrical usage is 1, 282 MW-hr and the average yearly electrical cost savings is $ 75, 265 for both systems. The payback period for the open and closed systems are estimated to be 4. 77 years and 6. 8 years, respectively. The radiative cooling system will economically benefit the Intel facility; however, the reduction in carbon emissions and water usage is of immense importance to the public and a company as dedicated to environmental initiatives as is Intel...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the light {{pollution}} produced {{in the city of}} Perth, Western Australia, we have used a hand-held sky brightness meter to measure the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness across the city. The data acquired facilitated the creation of a contour map of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness across the 2400 km(2) area of the city - the first such map to be produced for a city. Importantly, this map was created using a methodology borrowed from the field of geophysics - the well proven and rigorous techniques of geostatistical analysis and modelling. A major finding of this study is the effect of land use on <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness. By overlaying the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness map on to a suitably processed Landsat satellite image of Perth we found that locations near commercial and/or light industrial areas have a brighter <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> whereas locations used for agriculture or having high vegetation coverage have a fainter <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> than surrounding areas. Urban areas have intermediate amounts of vegetation and are intermediate in brightness compared with the above-mentioned land uses. Regions with a higher density of major highways also appear to contribute to increased <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness. When corrected for the effects of direct illumination from high buildings, we found that the <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness in the central business district (CBD) is very close to that expected for a city of Perth's population from modelling work and observations obtained in earlier studies. Given that our <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness measurements in Perth over 2009 and 2010 are commensurate with that measured in Canadian cities over 30 years earlier implies that the various lighting systems employed in Perth (and probably most other cities) have not been optimised to minimize light pollution over that time. We also found that <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness diminished with distance with an exponent of approximately - 0. 25 +/- 0. 02 from 3. 5 to 10 km from the Perth CBD, a region characterized by urban and commercial land use. For distances from 10 out to about 40 km from the CBD the radial variation of <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> brightness steepens to have an exponent value of approximately - 1. 8 +/- 0. 2. This steepening is associated with land use because vegetation cover increases with further distance from the CBD...|$|R
