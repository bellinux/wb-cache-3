40|$|Excerpt] The U. S. farm {{sector is}} vast and varied. It {{encompasses}} production {{activities related to}} traditional field crops (such as corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton) and livestock and poultry products (including meat, dairy, and eggs), as well as fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables. In addition, U. S. agricultural output includes greenhouse and nursery products, forest products, custom work, machine hire, and other farm-related activities. The intensity and economic importance {{of each of these}} activities, as well as their underlying market structure and production processes, vary regionally based on the agro-climatic setting, market conditions, and other factors. As a result, farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the United States. However, this report focuses singularly on aggregate <b>national</b> <b>net</b> farm <b>income</b> and the farm debt-to- asset status as reported by the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Annual U. S. net farm income is the single most watched indicator of farm sector well-being, as it captures and reflects the entirety of economic activity across the range of production processes, input expenses, and marketing conditions that have persisted during a specific time period. When <b>national</b> <b>net</b> farm <b>income</b> is reported together with a measure of the national farm debt-to-asset situation, the two summary statistics provide a quick indicator of the economic well-being of the national farm economy...|$|R

5000|$|A {{variety of}} {{measures}} of national income and output {{are used in}} economics to estimate total economic activity in a country or region, including gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>income</b> (NNI), and adjusted national income (NNI* adjusted for natural resource depletion). All are specially concerned with counting {{the total amount of}} goods and services produced within some the economy and by different sectors. The boundary is usually defined by geography or citizenship, and may also restrict the goods and services that are counted. For instance, some measures count only goods & services that are exchanged for money, excluding bartered goods, while other measures may attempt to include bartered goods by imputing monetary values to them.|$|E

40|$|In this manuscript, I {{consider}} {{the interplay between}} public finance and U. S. immigration policy. Immigration is making the U. S. population larger and more ethnically diverse and the U. S. labor force more abundant in low-skilled labor. One consequence of these changes has been lower wages for low-skilled U. S. workers. More generally, the benefits and costs of immigration appear to be distributed quite unevenly. Capital owners, land owners, and employers capture most of the benefits associated with immigration, which they enjoy {{in the form of}} higher factor returns. Taxpayers in high-immigration U. S. states shoulder most of immigration’s fiscal costs, which they bear in the form of higher taxes that go to pay for public services used by immigrant households. On net the economic impact of immigration on the United States is small. However, small <b>net</b> changes in <b>national</b> <b>income</b> mask potentially large changes in the distribution of income. These distributional changes appear to be an important ingredient in how individuals form opinions about immigration policy. Survey data suggest that individuals are more opposed to immigration if they (a) are more exposed to immigration’s labor-market consequences, as are low-income workers livin...|$|R

40|$|Access to {{healthcare}} {{is mostly}} contingent on out-of-pocket spending (OOPS) by health seekers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This would require many LMICs to raise enough funds to achieve universal health insurance coverage. But, are individuals or households {{willing to pay}} for health insurance, and how much? What factors positively affect WTP for health insurance? We wanted to examine the evidence for this, through a review of the literature. We systematically searched databases up to February 2016 and included studies of individual or household WTP for health insurance. Two authors appraised the identified studies. We estimated the WTP as a percentage of GDP per capita, and adjusted <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>income</b> per capita of each country. We used meta-analysis to calculate WTP means and confidence intervals, and vote-counting to identify the variables that more often affected WTP. 16 studies (21 articles) from ten countries met the inclusion criteria. The mean WTP of individuals was 1. 18 % of GDP per capita and 1. 39 % of adjusted <b>net</b> <b>national</b> <b>income</b> per capita. The corresponding figures for households were 1. 82 % and 2. 16 %, respectively. Increases in family size, education level and income were consistently correlated with higher WTP for insurance, and increases in age were correlated with reduced WTP. The WTP for healthcare insurance among rural households in LMICs was just below 2 % of the GPD per capita. The findings demonstrate that in moving towards universal health coverage in LMICs, governments should not rely on households' premiums as a major financing source and should increase their fiscal capacity for an equitable health care system using other sources...|$|E
