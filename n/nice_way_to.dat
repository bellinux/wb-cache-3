25|$|Hirano et al. {{previously}} {{found that}} the newborns {{did not have a}} true lamina propria, but instead had cellular regions called maculae flavae, located at the anterior and posterior ends of the loose vocal fold tissue. Boseley and Hartnick examined at the development and maturation of pediatric human vocal fold lamina propria. Hartnick {{was the first one to}} define each layer by a change in their cellular concentration. He also {{found that the}} lamina propria monolayer at birth and shortly thereafter was hypercellular, thus confirming Hirano’s observations. By 2 months of age, the vocal fold started differentiating into a bilaminar structure of distinct cellular concentration, with the superficial layer being less densely populated than the deeper layer. By 11 months, a three-layered structure starts to be noted in some specimens, again with different cellular population densities. The superficial layer is still hypocellular, followed by an intermediate more hypercellular layer, and a deeper hypercellular layer, just above the vocalis muscle. Even though the VF seem to start organizing, this is not representative of the trilaminar structure seen in adult tissues, where the layer are defined by their differential elastin and collagen fiber compositions. By 7 years of age, all specimens show a three-layered vocal fold structure, based on cellular population densities. At this point, the superficial layer was still hypocellular, the middle layer was the hypercellualr one, with also a greater content of elastin and collagen fibers, and the deeper layer was less cellularly populated. Again, the distinction seen between the layers at this stage is not comparable to that seen in the adult tissue. The maturation of the VF did not appear before 13 years of age, where the layers could be defined by their differential fiber composition rather than by their differential cellular population. The pattern now show a hypocellular superficial layer, followed by a middle layer composed predominantly of elastin fiber, and a deeper layer composed predominantly of collagen fibers. This pattern can be seen in older specimens up to 17 years of age, and above. While this study offers a <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see the evolution from immature to mature VF, it still does not explain what is the mechanism behind it.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a partial {{summary of the}} survey paper [1]. In particular, we are {{interested}} in telling the following story: given a lattice polytope, P, one would like to find an efficient way of counting the lattice points contained in P. One of the <b>nicest</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> accomplish this is to use algebraic geometry in a clever and beautiful way. Namely, from P one can construct a toric variety, XP, together with a line bundle, LP, on XP. Then {{it turns out that the}} Euler characteristic χ(XP, LP) is equal to the number of lattice points contained in P. Moreover, the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem tells us how to calculate this Euler characteristic in terms of the Todd class of the toric variety XP. This yields an efficient method for counting the lattice points in P, because there is a polynomial time algorithm that computes the Todd class of XP given the polytope P. 1 Constructing XP and LP from P In this section we will briefly recall the construction of the toric variety XP and the line bundle LP from the lattice polytope P.

However, the medal collection is a <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> compete with friends and the reviewer enjoyed the game. Dragon Warriors English remake, {{as part of the}} dual GBC cartridge Dragon WarriorI&II, received better reviews than the original, garnering praise. IGN and Nintendo Power gave it an 8 out of 10. IGN's Marc Nix noted that while [...] "it's one of the only interesting RPGs on the Game Boy Color to actually make American shores", players will feel frustrated; those who played the original will lament the changes, while new players will feel that the game is too linear and simple. GameSpot gave it a 9.6 out of 10, citing the great improvements to sound quality and the appeal of playing both games in succession, and GameRankings reports an 83.46% overall score. It received RPGamer's Game Boy Color Award of the Year for 2000. [...] Comparing it to its NES counterpart, RPGamer's Derek Cavin awarded it 3 out of 5, and wrote that the game is above average in all aspects, and particularly praised the visual elements. He criticized the game's repetitiveness, and said that it is short enough that most players should finish the game before repetition becomes an issue. Combined, both the SNES and GBC remakes saw more than 1.94million copies sold worldwide. With the remakes' good sales performances, Enix released Dragon WarriorIII for the GBC in 2001, which was based on a previously unreleased SNES update of Dragon QuestIII English version.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this article}} I use {{data from a}} large, {{national}} data base, the Australian Mathematics Com-petition, to explore the suitability of mathematics curriculum content for students with different abilities. Drawing on items common to papers attempted by students at four grade levels {{it is possible to}} identify the characteristics of mathematical problems found easy and difficult by distinct groups of students in different grade levels. These findings have important curriculum implications, for example, for those planning extension work for mathematically able students. Preamble I first met Hans-Georg Steiner in the mid 1980 s, at an annual conference of PME, the Interna-tional Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education. Our conversations were far ranging and included discussions on the school curricu-lum, instructional strategies, and the leadership of PME. The first mentioned helped me decide the topic of my contribution for this special issue of ZDM. The last explains my willingness to be involved in this project. Hans-Georg actively encouraged me (or should I say bullied me in the <b>nicest</b> possible <b>way!)</b> <b>to</b> stand for the PME executive and this eventually led to my term as President. ...|$|R
40|$|Absract: Much of the {{emphasis}} {{of the research on}} North American relations is focused on NAFTA and NORAD as they represent major cooperative efforts involving a substantial amount of negotiation between the two countries with differing initial positions. However, there has been little systematic research examining cooperation that takes place at lower diplomatic levels (i. e. exchanges of diplomatic notes, memorandums of understanding etc). Cooperation at lower diplomatic levels may allow leaders to bypass the normal legislative approval mechanisms making them a <b>nice</b> <b>way</b> for leaders <b>to</b> exercise effective foreign policy autonomy especially when the domestic political environment constrains leaders. Using information provided by a new dataset on North American military technical cooperation between 1950 and 2005, this study explores the depth of military technical cooperation between the US and Canada. The goal of the study is to gain a more complete understanding of both the complexity and density of cooperative endeavors between these two close nations in order to shed light on how cooperative structures developed at lower diplomatic levels are an important element of foreign policy interactions among close allies. Insights drawn from this research may be of interest to scholars designing nascent European military technical cooperation...|$|R
