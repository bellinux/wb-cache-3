40|$|In {{this chapter}} we {{investigate}} growth {{differences in the}} urban system of the EU 12 over the last {{decades of the twentieth}} century, defined in two distinct ways: as growth in population, off setting for natural change so proxying for net migration; or as growth in real GDP percent. Each of these growth processes is investigated using a family of related models. We do not give substantial technical details of the two families of models used since these are available in Cheshire and Magrini (2006 a, b). Rather the purpose is to highlight the similarities and the differences in the drivers of urban population as compared to “economic” growth and in doing so, reveal some interesting features of spatial adjustment processes in Europe and – briefly – how these compare to those in the USA. We start with a brief analysis of population growth in the major city regions of the EU of 12 over the period 1980 – 2000. These “city regions” are represented as Functional Urban Regions or FURs – as briefly explained in Sect. 16. 2. Since we include the rate of population growth in the area of each country outside its major FURs as a control variable, we are, in effect, analyzing the pattern of <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>change</b> over the two decades in each FUR. The conclusion is that interregional migration is orders of magnitude less in the EU than in the USA and that while internal migration flows do respond to the most obvious quality of life differences they do so only as quality of life varies within countries. We also find that national boundaries continue to be substantial barriers to spatial adjustment processes in Europe. The conclusion is, therefore, that in a European context one does not observe spatial equilibrium in a single “urban system”; in other words there are people who could improve their welfare by moving to another city region in another country but constraints on mobility prevent them from doing so...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{recent trends}} in in- and out-migration in the 3 core wards of Tokyo, and clarified their contribu-tions to <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>changes</b> {{in the late}} 1990 s. Data of Tokyo-to Jumin Kihon Daicho Jinko Ido Hokoku revealed that in Chuo and Minato, especially in the former, a rise in in-migration played the major role in increasing <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> in the late 1990 s. This tendency was less conspicuous in Chiyoda. When we focused on the situation of Chiyoda {{at the end of}} the 1990 s and after, however, an increase in in-migration basically contributed to an increase in <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> more than a decrease in out-migration did. It is implied that in the recent Toshin Kaiki, the massive construction of apartment houses in the core of Tokyo- a major socio-economic determinant of the recent increase in net migration-has functioned to attract migrants from outside, rather than to absorb potential out-migrants and sup-press their outmove from the ward.

This paper examines <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> by county for Montana between 1995 and 2000 disaggregated by age and educational level. Montana was chosen because it straddles the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions and thus provides an opportunity to compare and contrast <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and population <b>change</b> in two regions undergoing fundamentally different population processes. Regression analysis was applied to determine the predictor variables responsible for <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> between 1995 and 2000. Dependent variables concerned economic, demographic, and environmental characteristics of each of the counties. Overall, median household income and the Rocky Mountains explained the greatest amount of variance in the dependent variables, suggesting that both economics and the environment play a role in migration patterns in Montana...|$|R

In this paper we use data from 1982 to 1996 to estimate a structural econometric model of inter-regional migration.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 County-level <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and {{employment}} growth rates {{associated with the}} Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) are examined. The NWFP area encompasses federal land in 53 Oregon, Washington and California counties; 20 counties adjacent to NWFP counties are {{also included in the}} sample. The NWFP was enacted in December of 1993, however, this analysis examines the 24 year time period from 1980 through 2003. <b>Net</b> <b>migration</b> (the <b>change</b> in population due to in-migration and out-migration) {{and employment}} growth are represented by a simultaneous equation model (SEM) that is corrected for spatial autocorrelation. While the NWFP land allocations are expected to influence <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and employment growth, they are potentially determined by similar processes as the endogenous economic indicators. Logistic regression analysis shows the probability that NWFP lands were allocated to biodiversity purposes or to land uses subject to timber harvest depends on natural, political and economic variables. The SEM is run on a yearly basis to explore <b>changes</b> in <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and employment growth due to policy enactment, future expectations about land allocations, and market fluctuations. These results suggest the time period was characterized by many changes the endogenous variables from the effects of land management. In addition, the yearly analysis suggests that variation in yearly employment growth and <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> may not be sufficient for precise estimation {{of the effects of the}} exogenous variables. Pooling the yearly data over policy-relevant time periods is thus appropriate and provides insight into the NWFP effects on the economic indicators. Counties with more land reserved for biodiversity purposes had higher <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and employment growth. In contrast, counties with more land allocated to extractive uses experienced low <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> During the period following NWFP enactment, from 1994 to 2003, the classification of land according to NWFP management yields no significant relationship, suggesting adjustment to the NWFP had occurred. The effects of land management variables for rural and metropolitan counties are distinguished in another SEM. Contrary to the popular notion that employment effects were felt in large part by rural counties, this analysis shows changes in employment growth due to policy effects were felt primarily in metropolitan counties within the NWFP region. In addition, higher <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> occurred in rural and metropolitan counties containing land reserved for biodiversity purposes. These counties also experienced a simultaneous increase in employment growth as a result of allocation of these lands. Analysis of employment growth changes in specific industry sectors indicates manufacturing jobs were lost, however, service industry growth was encouraged as a result of NWFP land allocations. In addition, land allocated solely for the purpose of biodiversity services was not associated with changes in the manufacturing employment while potentially promoting growth in service sector employment...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{questions}} in economics are why some regions are richer than others, why their economic growth rates vary, whether their growth tends to converge {{and the key}} {{factors that contribute to}} the variations. These questions have not yet been fully addressed, but changes in the local tax base are clearly influenced by the average income growth rate, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate, and <b>changes</b> in unemployment rates. Thus, the main aim {{of this paper is to}} explore in depth the interactive effects of these factors (and local policy variables) in Swedish municipalities, by estimating a proposed three-equation system. Our main finding is that increases in local public expenditures and income taxes have negative effects on subsequent local income growth. In addition, our results support the conditional convergence hypothesis, i. e. that average income tends to grow more rapidly in relatively poor local jurisdictions than in initially “richer” jurisdictions, conditional on the other explanatory variables...|$|R
30|$|As {{explained}} before, Bruni and Venturini (1995) {{distinguish between}} migration pressure, measured as excess labour force or {{size of the}} non-employed population, and actual migration. The former is determined by macro-level economic factors while actual emigration and immigration is determined by micro-level factors where migration depends on a person’s propensity to migrate. Thus, {{it is possible that}} in a positive economic growth scenario migration pressure decreases because employment opportunities increase, while actual emigration also increases. The latter may occur if the propensity to emigrate rises. Therefore, migration assumptions for population scenarios up to 2050 do not conflict with inferences derived from results of those population scenarios regarding <b>migration</b> pressure (i.e. <b>changes</b> {{in the size of the}} non-employed population). Since immigration and, in particular, emigration statistics are often unreliable, we use migration assumptions expressed in <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> numbers. Baseline and historical <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> estimates were obtained from databases maintained by the UN (e.g. Preston et al. 2001). For the business-as-usual scenario, we adopted the United Nations medium variant <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> assumptions (UNPD 2016). The open economies scenario assumes higher <b>net</b> negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> up to 2020 than in the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, as emigration is expected to increase in the take-off stage of development while immigration hovers around a constant low level. Between 2020 and 2025, growth of emigration is expected to level off and decrease when production and numbers of jobs start increasing. Return migration and immigration also increases, so that by 2025, negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> is at the BAU level, and by 2030, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> has become zero. Between 2030 and 2050, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> turns positive, and by 2050, it has reached a historically high (positive) level. The reason for this pattern of change is that, initially, during the take-off stage of economic growth, it takes time before sufficient numbers of quality and adequately paid jobs are generated which make many prospective migrants decide to stay and attract immigrants and return migrants. The closed economies scenario assumes that emigration increases while immigration and return migration become very low leading to an increase in negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> after 2025 to a historically high level of negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> number by 2050. In all scenarios, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> numbers are redistributed to sex and age groups according to model age schedules of <b>migration,</b> while <b>change</b> over time is assumed to unfold in a linear way (Rogers and Castro 1981; UN 1992).|$|R

50|$|The <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate is the {{difference}} between the number of immigrants (people coming into an area) and the number of emigrants (people leaving an area) throughout the year. When the number of immigrants is larger than the number of emigrants, a positive <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate occurs. A positive <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rates indicates that there are more people entering than leaving an area. So when we have more emigrants than immigrants the result is a negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate, meaning that more people are leaving than entering the area. When there is an equal amount of immigrants and emigrants, the <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate is balanced.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{migration}} on population growth {{has become a}} ubiquitous argument in UK immigration debates, leading {{to the introduction of}} immigration restrictions to reduce <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and prevent the UK population from reaching 70 million.

A framework for analysing the effects of <b>migration</b> policies on <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> is proposed and applied to UK official migration data. The results show that, due to various policy constraints, competing objectives and unintended feedbacks, it is neither optimal nor entirely feasible to prioritize a reduction of <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> as a target for migration policies. Nevertheless, factoring <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> into the migration policy debate provides useful insights on the long-term implications of migration policies in the context of broader demographic changes...|$|R

40|$|Death {{distribution}} methods {{proposed for}} death registration coverage {{by comparison with}} census age distributions assume no <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> This assumption makes it problematic to apply these methods to sub-national and national populations affected by substantial <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> In this paper, we propose and explore a two-step {{process in which the}} Growth Balance Equation is first used to estimate <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rates, using a model of age-specific migration, and then it is used to compare the observed death rates over successive ages against residual estimates made up by the entry rate plus the <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate minus the growth rate. This methodology is predicated on the observation that migration rates have a very different age pattern from death rates; it is only when this condition is true that <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and deaths can be distinguished. The procedure proposed here works reasonably well in populations that generally have good data and rather high <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rates.
