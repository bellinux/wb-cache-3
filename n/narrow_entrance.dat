5|$|The A350 road is Poole town centre's main artery, running north along Holes Bay {{and on to}} the A35, and as {{a single}} {{carriageway}} to Bath and Bristol. To the east, the A337 road leads to Lymington and the New Forest. The A35 trunk road runs from Devon to Southampton and connects to the A31 {{on the outskirts of the}} town. The A31, the major trunk road in central southern England, connects to the M27 motorway at Southampton. From here the M3 motorway leads to London, and fast access may also be gained via the A34 to the M4 north of Newbury. Poole Bridge, a narrow bascule bridge constructed in 1927, connects the town centre and Hamworthy. Approval for a second bridge was given by the Department for Transport in 2006 and the £37million Twin Sails bridge was completed in 2012. A road link to Studland and the Isle of Purbeck across the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> of Poole Harbour is provided by the Sandbanks Ferry.|$|E
25|$|The old {{part of the}} city, {{where the}} port and {{fortified}} city were located, protrudes from the coastline, exposing {{both sides of the}} narrow piece of land to the sea. This could maximize its efficiency as a port, and the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> to this protrusion served as a natural and easy defense to the city. Both the archaeological record and Crusader texts emphasize Acre's strategic importance—a city in which it was crucial to pass through, control, and, as evidenced by the massive walls, protect.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower is}} {{surrounded}} by {{the remains of a}} stone barmkin wall, within which the ruins of outbuildings and a small chapel are still visible. The east part of the barmkin once contained a small garden, all of which is now gone. The western barmkin is more intact, with walls up to first floor level around the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> in the west wall. The courtyard, around 16m by 19m, contains the foundations of a single-storey hall house of the 17th century to the north, and a two-roomed kitchen block to the south.|$|E
50|$|Three other fjords in Norway with <b>narrow</b> <b>entrances</b> (and thus strong tidal streams) {{also have}} names {{including}} -salten: Busalten in Fosnes, and Nordsalten and Sørsalten in Nærøy.|$|R
50|$|There are villagers {{who believe}} that one day the door will open again, and they perform pujas (worship rituals) {{regularly}} on the southeastern side of the Dravyappara where there are three <b>narrow</b> <b>entrances.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{island and}} {{neighbouring}} Motu Nui are riddled with caves, {{many of which}} show signs of past human use for planting and as fortifications, including <b>narrowed</b> <b>entrances</b> and crawl spaces with ambush points. Many caves feature in the myths and legends of the Rapa Nui.|$|R
25|$|In June 1813, Colonel John Bowyer {{completed}} the fort. The fort, which initially had 14 guns, {{was made of}} sand and logs and fan-shaped, with the curved face facing the ship channel into Mobile Bay. On the landward side there was a bastion, flanked by two demi-bastions. The fort's purpose was to impede any British invasion at this point on the Gulf Coast, as the fort commanded the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> to Mobile Bay. About {{a year after the}} fort's construction the Americans abandoned it, but in August 1814, Major William Lawrence and 160 men from the 2nd U.S. Infantry re-garrisoned it.|$|E
25|$|Smyrna is shut in on {{the west}} by a hill now called Deirmen Tepe, with {{the ruins of a}} temple on the summit. The walls of Lysimachus crossed the summit of this hill, and the acropolis {{occupied}} the top of Pagus. Between the two the road from Ephesus entered the city by the Ephesian gate, near which was a gymnasium. Closer to the acropolis the outline of the stadium is still visible, and the theatre was situated on the north slopes of Pagus. Smyrna possessed two harbours. The outer harbour was simply the open roadstead of the gulf, and the inner was a small basin with a <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> partially filled up by Tamerlane in 1402 AD.|$|E
25|$|Port Phillip lies in {{southern}} Victoria, separated from Bass Strait by the Bellarine Peninsula {{to the southwest}} and Mornington Peninsula to the southeast. It is the largest bay in Victoria {{and one of the}} largest inland bays in Australia. The <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> to the bay, called the Rip, between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean, features strong tidal streams made turbulent by the uneven contours of the seabed. The best time for small craft to enter the Rip is at slack water. Large ships require expert local guidance to enter and exit, provided by the Port Phillip Sea Pilots. Work has commenced to deepen the channel entrance, to allow newer, larger container ships to access Melbourne's docks.|$|E
25|$|Red-headed trogons usually nest {{in natural}} tree cavities, 1.5 to 5m above the ground. The {{entrance}} hole is generally wide. Indeed, the pair will enlarge <b>narrow</b> <b>entrances,</b> and occasionally, will excavate the entire nesting cavity. Birds {{have been seen}} using old nesting holes of woodpeckers and barbets.|$|R
25|$|Residencia Armstrong-Poventud is {{a two-story}} masonry {{building}} on the westside of Calle Union (No. 9), {{directly in front of}} the Cathedral and Plaza of the historic urban center of Ponce.

Although the storm petrel is generally non-territorial when breeding, a pair will defend the nest chamber itself after the eggs have been laid.|$|R
25|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, {{control of}} Brownsea {{passed to the}} Crown. Henry VIII {{recognised}} the island's strategic importance of guarding the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> to the expanding port of Poole. As part of a deterrent to invasion forces from Europe, the island was fortified in 1547 {{by means of a}} blockhouse, which became known as Brownsea Castle. In the following centuries, the island passed into the hands of a succession of various owners. In 1576, Queen Elizabeth I made a gift of Brownsea to one of her court favourites and rumoured lover, Sir Christopher Hatton. During the English Civil War, Poole sided with Parliament and garrisoned Brownsea Castle. Colonel Thomas Pride, the instigator of Pride's Purge– the only military coup d'état in English history – was stationed on the island in 1654. Sir Robert Clayton, a Lord Mayor of the City of London and wealthy merchant became owner in the mid-1650s and after his death in 1707 the island was sold to William Benson, a Whig Member of Parliament and architect. He converted the castle into a residence and was responsible for introducing many varieties of trees to the island.|$|E
25|$|If we draw {{a square}} and divide each side into three {{so that the}} middle parts are greater than the others, and then divide the area into nine from these points, we {{approximate}} to the typical setting out of a plan of this time. Now add three apses {{on the east side}} opening from the three divisions, and opposite to the west put a <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> porch running right across the front. Still in front put a square court. The court is the atrium and usually has a fountain in the middle under a canopy resting on pillars. The entrance porch is the narthex. Directly under the center of the dome is the ambo, from which the Scriptures were proclaimed, and beneath the ambo at floor level was the place for the choir of singers. Across {{the eastern side of the}} central square was a screen which divided off the bema, where the altar was situated, from the body of the church; this screen, bearing images, is the iconostasis. The altar was protected by a canopy or ciborium resting on pillars. Rows of rising seats around the curve of the apse with the patriarch's throne at the middle eastern point formed the synthronon. The two smaller compartments and apses at the sides of the bema were sacristies, the diaconicon and prothesis. The ambo and bema were connected by the solea, a raised walkway enclosed by a railing or low wall.|$|E
500|$|The {{chambered}} cairn of Vinquoy, {{located in}} a commanding position overlooking the Calf Sound, is [...] in diameter and [...] high. The <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> passage of this Maeshowe-type tomb leads to a central chamber with four side-cells. [...] Other sites of interest on Eday include the Stone of Setter standing stone that dominates the col north of Mill Loch, and which at [...] high {{is one of the}} tallest monoliths in Orkney. There are two more chambered cairns at Braeside and Huntersquoy and another on the Calf of Eday. Rectangular in shape, it was excavated in 1936–37 and contains a small chamber with two compartments and a larger one with four stalls that has a separate entrance and was probably added at a later date.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} to the market is on Gracechurch Street. The double height entrance is flanked by tall, narrow gabled red brick and Portland stone blocks in a C17 Dutch style. The adjacent buildings to the south have a continuous retail frontage which is punctuated by <b>narrow</b> <b>entrances</b> to pedestrian ways into the market.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the northwestern}} part, {{there is a}} sector known as Pueblo Alto (Spanish for high town), with a wall of 11.5 meters high, which is {{accessed}} by 02 <b>narrow</b> <b>entrances.</b> [...] North of Pueblo Alto, a tower-like structure named Torreón (Spanish for tower) rises up to 7 meters {{and may have been}} used for defensive purposes as stone weapons have been found there.|$|R
2500|$|An {{hour after}} the meeting began as {{scheduled}} at 16:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh {{with a group of}} ninety Sikh, Gurkha, Baluchi, Rajput from 2-9th Gurkhas, the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles soldiers. Fifty of them were armed with [...]303 Lee–Enfield bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armored cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrances.</b> The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had few <b>narrow</b> <b>entrances.</b> Most of them were kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.|$|R
500|$|Zmaj {{appears to}} have been little used in her {{intended}} role; only her salvage of an upside-down Dornier Wal in the Bay of Kotor in 1936 has been confirmed. This may be why she was converted to a minelayer the following year. Following her conversion she made port visits to Piraeus and Istanbul, accompanied by the destroyer Dubrovnik and the submarines [...] and [...] Zmaj served as the fleet flagship in 1939 and witnessed the new destroyer [...] run aground and sink in January 1940 at the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> to Sebenico harbor. Shortly before the German invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 Zmaj laid defensive minefields along the Dalmatian Coast and off the main ports. These minefields may have caused the loss of the Yugoslav passenger ships SS Karađorđe and SS Prestolonaslednik Petar off Zlarin. Zmaj was captured in Split by the Germans on 17 April.|$|E
500|$|Legal {{concerns}} were alleviated when the Royal Letters Patent were eventually granted in 1778, and the theatre became a patent theatre {{and took up}} the name [...] "Theatre Royal". At this time the theatre also started opening for the winter season, and a joint company was established to perform at both the Bath Theatre Royal and in Bristol, featuring famous names including Sarah Siddons, whose ghost, according to legend, haunts the Bristol theatre. The auditorium was rebuilt with a new sloping ceiling and gallery in 1800. After the break with Bath in 1819 the theatre was managed by William M'Cready the elder, with little success, but slowly rose again under his widow Sarah M'Cready in the 1850s. Following her death in 1853 the M'Creadys' son-in-law James Chute took over, but he lost interest in the Theatre Royal, which fell into decline {{when he opened the}} Prince's Theatre, originally known as the New Theatre Royal, in 1867. A new, <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> was constructed through an adjacent building in 1903.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "bottle dungeon" [...] is {{sometimes}} simply another term for an oubliette. It has a <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> {{at the top}} and sometimes the room below is even so narrow {{that it is impossible to}} lie down but in other designs the actual cell is larger.|$|E
50|$|At {{the onset}} of the Civil War, Stevens offered to donate his gunboat to the Navy, but {{officials}} refused the gift, explaining that the untried prototype was not suitable for Navy missions. Stevens then donated her to the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service, providing them with their first ironclad gunboat. E.A. Stevens was stationed as one of the cutters patrolling the Varrazano <b>Narrows</b> <b>entrance</b> to New York harbor.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{entrance}} (isango) {{was on the}} northern, or lower, side of the slope against which the complex lay. This entrance was divided into two sections to control incoming and outgoing traffic. <b>Narrow</b> <b>entrances</b> at several places in the palisade controlled access to the ikhanda. Inside the arena were smaller cattle enclosures; these were built bordering the inside palisade of the hut circle, and contained the herds.|$|R
60|$|A {{ripple of}} {{laughter}} came to applaud Leduc's excursion into irony. The arbor had another, <b>narrower</b> <b>entrance,</b> on the left. Hortensia had approached this, all unheard {{on the soft}} turf, and stood there now, a heavenly apparition in white flimsy garments, head slightly a-tilt, eyes mocking, lips laughing, a heavy curl of her dark hair falling caressingly into the hollow where white neck sprang from whiter shoulder.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> to the harbour is to {{the east}} of the Miramar Peninsula, and {{contains}} the dangerous shallows of Barrett Reef, where many ships have been wrecked (notably the inter-island ferry [...] in 1968). The harbour has three islands: Matiu/Somes Island, Makaro/Ward Island and Mokopuna Island. Only Matiu/Somes Island is large enough for habitation. It {{has been used as a}} quarantine station for people and animals, and was an internment camp during World War I and World War II. It is a conservation island, providing refuge for endangered species, much like Kapiti Island farther up the coast. There is access during daylight hours by the Dominion Post Ferry.|$|E
2500|$|... and [...] {{arrived and}} began embarking Force Buttercup {{and some of}} the Irish Guards. The Germans had taken up {{positions}} overlooking the harbour and engaged the Guards and the ships, which used their guns to counter the German fire. German tanks advanced towards the quayside but were knocked out by the 4.7 inch guns of Venomous, one tank turning [...] "over and over, like a child doing a cart-wheel". German field guns bombarded the harbour and as [...] moved through the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> channel, it was hit several times and set on fire but managed to reverse out and make way for Venomous and Wild Swan which also backed out, Venomous steering with its engines as the rudder had jammed.|$|E
2500|$|At about 11 a.m. of [...] {{a change}} of wind allowed Codrington to order the move into the harbor. It was agreed that the English and Russian squadrons enter the harbor in {{parallel}} lines, followed by the French. At about 1 p.m. Codrington, cautious about the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> into the harbor, changed the plan and signaled orders to take formation in a single line. The allied fleet took position in an arc side-by-side with the Turkish fleet. Azov headed to its planned position {{at the very center}} of the allied arc, with the rest of the Russian fleet to its port, the English and French battleships to its starboard, and the English frigates in the rear. Soon the Turks fired at a British cutter, killing lieutenant Fitzroy and igniting an all-out naval battle. Sources disagree on exact timing of events owing to different timekeeping practices and the confusion of the battle; the first shots were marked at either 2:00, 2:20 or even 2:45p.m.; ship log of Azov recorded them at 2:30. At this moment Azov was still on the move to its planned station and had just escaped the firing range of Turkish coastal artillery. The smoke of English-Turkish shootout obstructed their view to starboard; Azov fired its first shots to port at 2:45.|$|E

2500|$|The first nonindigenous person {{recorded}} as visiting {{the region was}} Lt. John Murray, who commanded the brig [...] After anchoring outside Port Phillip Heads (the <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> to Port Phillip, onto which both Geelong and Melbourne now front), on 1 February 1802, he sent a small boat with six men to explore. Led by John Bowen, they explored the immediate area, returning to the Lady Nelson on 4 February. On reporting favourable findings, the Lady Nelson entered Port Phillip on 14 February, and did not leave until 12 March. During this time, Murray explored the Geelong area and, whilst {{on the far side}} of the bay, claimed the entire area for Britain. He named the bay Port King, after Philip Gidley King, then Governor of New South Wales. Governor King later renamed the bay Port Phillip after the first governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip. Arriving not long after Murray was Matthew Flinders, who entered Port Phillip on 27 April 1802. He charted the entire bay, including the Geelong area, believing he was the first to sight the huge expanse of water, but in a rush to reach Sydney before winter set in, he left Port Phillip on 3 May.|$|E
2500|$|The second patrol of U-161 {{was under}} the command of Albrecht Achilles. [...] Achilles and his first watch officer Bender had both visited Trinidad while {{employed}} by Hamburg America Line before the war. [...] U-161 entered Trinidad's Gulf of Paria harbor at periscope depth during daylight through a deep, narrow passage or Boca. [...] An electronic submarine detection system registered its passage at 0930 on 18 February 1942, but the signal was dismissed as caused by a patrol boat. [...] After spending the day resting {{on the bottom of the}} harbor, U-161 surfaced after dark to torpedo two anchored ships. [...] U-161 then left the gulf with decks awash and running lights illuminated to resemble one of the harbor small craft; and then moved off to the northwest before returning to sink a ship outside the Boca. [...] After sunset on 10 March 1942 U-161 silently entered the shallow, <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance</b> of Castries harbor surfaced on electric motors to torpedo two freighters at dockside; and then raced out under fire from machine guns. [...] The two freighters had just arrived with supplies to construct the new US base; and the harbor previously considered immune to submarine attack was later fitted with an anti-submarine net. [...] U-161 started home on 11 March 1942.|$|E

They again reached the col on 11 August and on this occasion the mist cleared after many hours {{and they were able to}} get the first photograph of the Khumbu Icefall leading up to the Western Cwm. Bryant wrote [...] "A westerly spur of Nuptse curled round to the north thus squeezing the glacier of the upper basin into a narrow lip over which it poured in a gigantic ice-fall, a wild tumble of contorted ice, to the Khumbu Glacier 2,000 feet below. The cwm itself must be an amazing place, completely ringed in as it is, except for that <b>narrow</b> <b>entrance,</b> by a mountain wall nowhere less than 25,000 feet high." [...] Shipton reported how the Sherpas became quite excited as they recognised landmarks in their homeland, the Solu Khumbu. He said of the route up the icefall and cwm [...] "it did not look impossible, and I should very much like to have the opportunity one day of exploring it".|$|E
