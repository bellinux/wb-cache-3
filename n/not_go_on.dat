He sold insurance for several years, then reentered school and graduated from Virginia Tech in 1994 with a degree.|$|E
5|$|Born in Preston in 1850, {{descended from}} an old Preston family that {{included}} a Preston Guild Mayor, Sudell joined the Preston Nelson sports club in August 1867, aged 17. During this period the club were recruiting many young sportsmen from the area to play new sports, in order to relieve financial pressures. Sudell proved adept at several sports including swimming, cycling, cricket and rugby. The club played its first game of association football in 1878, against Eagley, with Sudell {{a member of the}} team. However, Sudell did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to play on a regular basis; only two other football matches featuring him as a player are known.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} the Cook Islands, the Cook Islands Sports and National Olympic Committee sent a team to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, marking its sixth {{consecutive}} appearance at the Olympics since its debut in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. The country sent four athletes to the Games across three sports and four distinct events (Gordon Heather and Tereapii Tapoki in track and field, Petero Okotai in swimming, and Sam Pera, Jr. in weightlifting). No athlete of the Cook Islander delegation progressed past the first rounds in their events (with the exception of weightlifting, where the first round was the only round) and did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to win medals. Pera was the nation's flag bearer at the ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory has}} been rebuffed {{medically}} as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, {{are based on a}} misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood. Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to publish his work more widely. Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention and entered popular modern folklore.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 5/6 August, {{infantry}} in the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade and 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade were at Abu Hamra, the 127th (Manchester) Brigade (42nd Division) at Hod el Enna, the 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade (42nd Division) on its left {{in touch with the}} 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, (52nd Division) which had its left on Redoubt No. 21. The next morning, infantry in the 42nd Division was ordered to advance eastwards at 04:00 and occupy a line from Bir el Mamluk to Bir Katia, while the 52nd (Lowland) Division was to advance from Abu Hamra and prolong the infantry line of the 42nd Division to the north-east. Although they carried out their orders during their two-day march from Pelusium Station to Katia, infantry in the 127th (Manchester) Brigade lost 800 men, victims to thirst and the sun; other infantry brigades suffered similarly. It became clear that the infantry could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> and they ceased to be employed in the advance. Indeed, it was necessary for the Bikanir Camel Corps and Yeomanry detachments, as well as the medical services, to search the desert for those who had been left behind.|$|E
5|$|Romas keel {{was laid}} by the Italian {{shipbuilder}} Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico on 18 September 1938, {{and she was}} launched on 9 June 1940. After just over two years of fitting-out, the new battleship was commissioned into the Regia Marina on 14 June 1942. She arrived in the major naval base of Taranto on 21 August, and {{was assigned to the}} Ninth Naval Division. Although Roma took part in training exercises and was moved to various bases including Taranto, Naples, and La Spezia, in the next year, she did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> any combat missions as the Italian Navy was desperately short of fuel. In fact, by the end of 1942, the only combat-ready battleships in the navy were the three Vittorio Venetos because the fuel shortage had caused the four modernized battleships to be removed from service. When combined with a lack of capable vessels to escort the capital ships, the combat potential of the Italian Navy was virtually non-existent.|$|E

5|$|The 2010–11 season saw {{virtually}} no {{change to the}} structure of the season or league. All teams from the previous season remained in the league, and the number of games remained at 36. The regular season ran from 18 September 2010 to 20 February 2011. After two years of leading the league, Halla slipped to fourth place and Oji Eagles took the regular season honors with 76 points. Shunhei Kuji of Oji lead the league with 24 goals, while his teammate Yosuke Kon led with 45 assists. However, with a couple of second-place finishes, Go Tanaka of the Free Blades led the overall points race with 59. The League also maintained the number of play-off teams at four. Anyang faced Oji while Nippon faced Tohoku. Halla managed to take two of three in Japan and defeat Oji on home ice to advance. The Free Blades needed all five games to defeat the Cranes but the team came back with two straight wins to advance to the final {{for the first time in}} their short time in the league. However, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake near the Free Blades hometown forced the League to cancel the finals. Halla had already in Japan just an hour before the disaster struck the area. Fortunately, both teams survived, but the League felt the final could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on.</b> On 22 March 2011 the League declared that both Halla and the Free Blades would be declared co-champions. Though shortened, Masato Domeki of Oji led the playoffs with four goals, Bruce Mulherin led with six assists and fellow Free Blade Brad Farynuk had eights points overall.|$|E

By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{paper has}} been criticized for restricting its {{analysis}} to convenience samples of college students, possibly introducing systematic bias by excluding victims so traumatized that they did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to attend college.

India sent an under-strength squad with nine first-choice players either rested or injured. Yadav made his ODI debut in the tournament during India's loss to Zimbabwe, a team ranked tenth by the ICC at the time. Defending a score of 285, Yadav bowled eight wicketless overs while conceding 48runs. Playing in three matches, Yadav took a single wicket.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was {{president}} of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the next seven months, Polish forces {{successfully}} defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure. Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General Ivan Paskievich, many Polish troops, feeling they could <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on,</b> withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms. After the defeat, the semi-independent Congress Poland lost its constitution, army and legislative assembly, and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire.|$|E
25|$|The first {{digital camera}} {{to use a}} Foveon X3 sensor was the Sigma SD9, a digital SLR {{launched}} in 2002. This used a 2268x1512×3 (3.54×3 MP) iteration of the sensor, and was built on a Sigma-designed body using the Sigma SA mount. The camera was followed in 2003 by the improved but technically similar Sigma SD10, which was in turn superseded in 2006 by the Sigma SD14, which used a higher-resolution, 2640×1760×3 sensor. Sigma announced a successor, the Sigma SD15, in 2008, although the camera did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> sale until June 2010. It used the same 2640×1760×3 (4.7×3 MP) sensor as the SD14. As of 2011, it is Sigma's current prosumer digital SLR. In September 2010, the company announced the Sigma SD1, which uses a new, 4800×3200×3 sensor, and was aimed at the professional market.|$|E
