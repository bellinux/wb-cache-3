30|$|Sensor {{networks}} {{have been a}} very active area of research in recent years. However, most of the sensors used in the development of these {{networks have}} been local and <b>nonimaging</b> <b>sensors</b> such as acoustics, seismic, vibration, temperature, humidity. The emerging development of video sensor networks poses its own set of unique challenges, including high-bandwidth and low latency requirements for real-time processing and control. This paper presents a systematic approach by detailing the design, implementation, and evaluation of a large-scale wireless camera network, suitable for a variety of practical real-time applications. We take into consideration issues related to hardware, software, control, architecture, network connectivity, performance evaluation, and data-processing strategies for the network. We also perform multiobjective optimization on settings such as video resolution and compression quality to provide insight into the performance trade-offs when configuring such a network and present lessons learned in the building and daily usage of the network.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—While high resolution, {{regularly}} gridded {{observations are}} generally preferred in remote sensing, actual observations {{are often not}} evenly sampled and have lower-than-desired resolution. Hence, there is an interest in resolution enhancement and image reconstruction. This paper discusses a general theory and techniques for image reconstruction and creating enhanced resolution images from irregularly sampled data. Using irregular sampling theory, we consider how the frequency content in aperture function-attenuated sidelobes can be recovered from oversampled data using reconstruction techniques, thus {{taking advantage of the}} high frequency content of measurements made with nonideal aperture filters. We show that with minor modification, the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) is functionally equivalent to Grochenig’s irregular sampling reconstruction algorithm. Using simple Monte Carlo simulations, we compare and contrast the performance of additive ART, multiplicative ART, and the scatterometer image reconstruction (SIR) (a derivative of multiplicative ART) algorithms with and without noise. The reconstruction theory and techniques have applications with a variety of sensors and can enable enhanced resolution image production from many <b>nonimaging</b> <b>sensors.</b> The technique is illustrated with ERS- 2 and SeaWinds scatterometer data.

40|$|This is Chapter 16 in F. Flammini (Ed.), Critical Infrastructure Protection, WIT Press, 2012, pp. 241 - 254. Detection of improvised {{explosive}} devices is difficult and requires {{a wide spectrum of}} strategies. Detection during emplacement is the best hope. <b>Nonimaging</b> <b>sensors</b> provide several advantages over cameras in expense, robustness, and processing simplicity for this task. We describe experiments with inexpensive commercial sensors, and show how data can be combined to provide monitoring for suspicious pedestrian behavior at a 1 - 10 meter scale. Our approach preanalyzes terrain to rate likelihood of emplacement. We install sensors and monitor the terrain, seeking direct clues to suspicious behavior such as loitering and odd sounds such as excavation. We also use sensor data to track people by inferring their probability distributions, and use this to detect significant accelerations and atypical velocity vectors, both of which can indicate suspicious behavior. We describe experiments we have conducted with a prototype sensor network of eight kinds of sensors, from which it appears that motion and sonar sensors are the most helpful for this task. supported by the U.

40|$|This paper {{appeared}} in the Proceedings of Global Learn Asia Pacific 2011, Melbourne, Australia, April 2011. Physical-motion skills are important in physical education, theater, military training, and {{a wide range of}} vocational training. Teaching them is difficult because events happen quickly and the view of instructors is often occluded. We are developing training systems using modern surveillance technology that can automatically track and assess students exercising physical-motion skills. We describe two systems we have implemented, one with inexpensive <b>nonimaging</b> <b>sensors</b> and one with multi-camera fusion, to track U. S. Marines during training and assess how well they are performing. The key challenge is visually summarizing the data because there is usually too much for instructors to inspect manually. We describe several visualization methods we provide, including plots of unusual events in time and space broken down by student and type of event, plots of continuous-valued metrics, plots of group centroids, and comparison plots of similar exercises. Results show that interesting phenomena {{can be seen in the}} visualizations that are otherwise difficult to recognize. This work was sponsored by the U. S.

40|$|This paper {{appeared}} in the Proceedings of the Meeting of the Military Sensing Symposium Specialty Group on Battlespace Acoustic and Seismic Sensing, Magnetic and Electric Field Sensors, Laurel, MD, August 2008. We report on recent work we have done on detection of two kinds of militarily interesting behavior in an urban battlespace, detection of suspicious behavior and detection and classification of coordinated movements of groups of people. The first is important in detecting terrorism and IED emplacement, {{and the second is}} important in detecting military adversaries and what they are doing. Our approaches use only "pose" information, the locations and orientations of people within the sensor field, as extracted from tracking by a fusion of various nonimaging sensing modalities. Restriction to <b>nonimaging</b> <b>sensors</b> saves money, and restriction to pose information avoids most of the serious privacy concerns. We first explain our approach to tracking using signal strengths alone. From experiments with both staged and nonstaged behavior in a public area, we found that the most useful clue to suspicious behavior was the norm of the acceleration vector averaged over several different time scales. With detection and classification of groups of people, by contrast, no single metric was as good as combinations of metrics. We are exploring a variety including average distances between people, uniformity of distances, linearity of the positions of people, number of clusters of people, number of directions in which they can see, overall visibility, average speed of the group, and uniformity of the speed of the group. A key challenge is to make these metrics scale-free as with the acceleration vector analysis. supported in part by the National Research Council under their Research Associateship Program at the Army Research Laboratory, in part by the National Science Foundation under the EXP Program, and in part by the BASE-IT Project sponsored by the Office of Naval Researc...|$|R
40|$|In 2000, Iceland’s glaciers covered 11, 079 km 2, or 10. 7 % of its {{contiguous}} area. There are 269 named glaciers, including 14 ice caps with 109 associated outlet glaciers, 8 ice flow basins, 55 cirque glaciers, 73 mountain glaciers, and 5 valley glaciers. Twentyone surge-type glaciers {{have been}} documented. The superposition of ice caps on active volcanoes and associated rift zones within the neovolcanic zones of Iceland produces aperiodic jökulhlaups. Jökulhlaups also {{result from the}} failure of ice dams on ice-marginal lakes. In association with Icelandic scientists, airborne thermal infrared surveys of some glaciers were carried out in 1966, and, in 1974, the first analyses of satellite images of glaciers in Iceland were published. Icelandic scientists began radio-echo sounding to determine the thickness of ice caps in 1976. The start of systematic, annual field measurements of the fluctuations of Iceland’s glaciers were begun in 1930; now in the 21 st century, between 40 and 50 termini are being measured annually. Systematic instrumental measurements of meteorological variables were started in the 19 th century at a few coastal stations, and later expanded to a nationwide network. On September 8, 1972 the first medium resolution satellite images (ERTS- 1 /Landsat- 1) of Iceland’s glaciers were acquired; subsequently, a variety of imaging and <b>nonimaging</b> <b>sensors</b> on different polar-orbiting satellites have provided aperiodic coverage of Iceland’s glaciers. Long-term sets of glaciological data, whether compiled from sequential map series, ground observations (termini fluctuations), and other ground measurements (mass balance studies) or from analyses of data acquired by satellite sensors, such as Landsat MSS, RBV, TM, ETMþ, OLI, Seasat radar, Terra ASTER, and ICESat GLAS, have successfully documented changes {{in the area and}} mass balance (volume) of Iceland’s glaciers. Glacier variations, when correlated with changes in climate, show a close correspondence for more than 100 years of observation. Since the mid- 1990 s, in response to a warmer climate, most of Iceland’s glaciers have been undergoing an annual average shrinkage of about 0. 3 %. Except for glacier ice at the highest elevations, at the present rate of shrinkage, Iceland may be deglacierized by 2200...|$|R
