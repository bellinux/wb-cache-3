Aviation historian Åke Hall stated that it was the aircraft type which SAS has had the most challenges with throughout its history. First of all the production was delayed and by May only four of eleven planned deliveries had been made. One issue was false alarms created by the cockpit software, while oil leaks caused for engines to have to be replaced. By October there had been nine emergency landings caused by various technical faults, and SAS Commuter chose to ground the aircraft for several days. Deliveries came to a halt that month as the eleven first aircraft were all having faults caused by the same defects. Delivery of further aircraft resumed in February 2001.

40|$|Abstract—Scan chain (SC) is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} in recent VLSI chips to ease the test process of these chips. SCs enhance the observability and controllability of memory elements such as latches and flip-flops used in sequential parts of the chips. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel scan chain architecture which can effectively tolerate bit flip errors due to particle strikes. The proposed architecture is based on the use of redundant transistors in memory elements of the chip. Redundant transistors are added in a way which enables the memory elements to recover the stored value in the case of bit flip error occurrence in both test and <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Fault tolerance capability and energy consumption of the proposed scan architecture are compared with the previously proposed scan chains by the means of Spice simulations. Results of the simulation reveal that the proposed architecture has at least 40 % improvement in reliability of test process while its power consumption overhead is at most 10 % in both <b>normal</b> and test <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Index Terms—scan chain, testing, design for testability.

40|$|Range {{resolution}} {{for a given}} radar can {{be significantly}} improved by using very short pulses. Unfortunately, utilizing short pulses decreases the average transmitted power, which can hinder the radar’s <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> particularly for multi-function and surveillance radars. Since the average transmitted power is directly linked to the receiver SNR, it is often desirable to increase the pulse width while simultaneously maintaining adequate range resolution. This can be made possible by using pulse compression techniques. Pulse compression allows us to achieve the average transmitted power of a relatively long pulse, while obtaining the range resolution corresponding to a short pulse. In this paper, we shall implement two digital pulse compression techniques. The first technique is known as correlation processing which is predominantly used for narrow band and some medium band radar operations. The second technique is called stretch processing and is normally used for extremely wide band radar operations...|$|R

One such technique known as parallel coordinates was used to support the diagnosis of an event, detected by a neural network-based monitoring system, in a boiler at a Brazilian Kraft pulp mill.

The diagnostic procedure was carried out step-by-step going through exploratory, explanatory, confirmatory, and communicative goals. This tool allowed the visualization of the boiler dynamics in an easier way, compared to commonly used univariate trend plots. In addition it facilitated analysis of other aspects, namely relationships among process variables, distinct <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and discrepant data.

40|$|Abstract The racially disproportionate {{impact of}} {{counter-terrorism}} stop, search and surveillance powers, in the US and UK, {{has been widely}} borne out in statistical data, individual experiences and official reports. Such uneven police use of the powers failed to yield any discernible benefit in terms of safeguarding the population against the threat of terrorist attack and has instead {{been linked to the}} alienation of minority communities from law enforcement in both countries. Rather than seeing this outcome as a consequence of individual prejudice, this thesis uses a jurisprudential framework combining critical race theory and social systems theory to argue that, as a result of subsystem operational behaviours and obstructed inter-subsystem communications, what were intended as racially neutral, security-enhancing law enforcement tools were ineffective and racially uneven in deployment. Through the case study of the stop, search and surveillance powers, within section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, in the UK, and sections 214 and 215 of the USA Patriot Act, in the US, this thesis describes the <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> subsystem <b>operation,</b> created by each subsystem and seen as necessary to uphold {{the rule of law and}} the legitimacy of that subsystem. This analysis also demonstrates that within the law-making, policing and judicial subsystems the risk, in terms of jeopardising the legitimacy and efficacy <b>of</b> subsystem <b>operation</b> and output, <b>of</b> departing from these ideal subsystem programmes, was recognised. Despite such an understanding, in their response to the national security threat arising form international terrorist activities each subsystem departed from its normal operational standards, whilst maintaining a confidence that other subsystems could withstand the pressures arising from these contextual circumstances and adhere to its <b>normal</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> This thesis also analyses the communications within and between the three subsystems to demonstrate how each misunderstood the communications of other subsystems because each interpreted these communications in accordance with its own, system-specific <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> understanding. These subsystem behaviours resulted in gaps in the oversight of the statutory powers and left them without stringent safeguards to protect against their misuse. Finally, this thesis draws together the findings relating to the causes and consequences of each subsystem’s operational programme and offers recommendations for reform by which each of the subsystems in both the US and UK may be able to safeguard against the recurrence of such deleterious law-making, policing and judicial adjudication in the face of each new threat to national security. ...|$|R

40|$|DNA ligases are {{essential}} repair enzymes required for maintaining genomic integrity in cells. The first ligase {{to be discovered}} was Escherichia coli DNA ligase; a 670 amino acid, 74 kDa, NAD+ dependent ligase. This work reports {{a series of studies}} into the behaviour of His-tagged E. coli ligase. Order-of-addition studies on singly-nicked oligoduplexes under steady state conditions revealed that ligase undergoes an obligatory off-step from the DNA after sealing a break in a phosphodiester strand before readenylation in solution. These results corroborate the findings of Lehman that a sequential model is the <b>normal</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> Ligase <b>operation.</b> Ligase affinity for its substrates NAD+ and DNA were 3. 5 μM and 3. 5 nM respectively. Length dependency studies on singly-nicked PCR substrates revealed that when two different DNA lengths were in the same solution, the initial association rate was always faster for the longer DNA substrate. For example, 40 bp versus 902 bp gave initial rate values 0. 06 nM/min (40 bp) and 0. 28 nM/min (902 bp); increasing the length 22 fold increased the initial rate 4 fold. This hints that Ligase uses DNA flanking a nick to locate its specific site. Processivity studies were achieved to determine the one- or three-dimensional pathway of Ligase using doubly-nicked DNA. Nicks were either directly repeated (on the same DNA strand) or inverted (opposite strands). Results revealed Ligase is weakly processive; 32 % processive. However, when beta-clamp and gamma-loader were added to the reaction processivity significantly increased. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
