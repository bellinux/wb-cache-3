5|$|Further {{periods of}} {{intensified}} anti-German {{feeling in the}} Rhodesias followed the execution by the Germans of the British nurse Edith Cavell in Belgium in October 1915 ("the Crowning Crime", the Bulawayo Chronicle called it), the escalation of bombing raids by German Zeppelins on British cities during 1917, and the British reportage the same year of the Kadaververwertungsanstalt atrocity story—that the Germans supposedly rendered down battlefield corpses from both sides to make products such as <b>nitroglycerine</b> and lubricants.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powder, based on <b>nitroglycerine</b> or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s {{tended to be}} smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E

25|$|The {{vasodilatation}} {{caused by}} sodium nitroprusside {{has been shown}} to be mediated not only by NO generation, but also by endogenous cyanide generation, which adds not only toxicity, but also some additional antihypertensive efficacy compared to <b>nitroglycerine</b> and other non-cyanogenic nitrates which do not cause blood cyanide levels to rise.|$|E
25|$|Thomas McMahon, who {{had been}} arrested {{two hours before the}} bomb detonated at a Garda {{checkpoint}} between Longford and Granard on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle, was tried for the assassinations in Ireland, and convicted on 23 November 1979 by forensic evidence supplied by James O'Donovan that showed flecks of paint from the boat and traces of <b>nitroglycerine</b> on his clothes.

25|$|In 1862, the Troy and Greenfield Railroad {{defaulted}} on its {{loan from the}} Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which foreclosed on the mortgage and {{took control of the}} railroad, including the tunnel project. The state sent engineer Charles Storrow to Europe to study modern tunneling techniques, including the use of <b>nitroglycerine</b> and compressed air. In 1863 the state, with Alvah Crocker now superintendent of railroads, restarted the project and made Thomas Doane the chief engineer.|$|E
25|$|California Powder Works began {{producing}} {{smokeless powder}} for firearms ammunition {{in the early}} 1890s. Peyton Powder, prepared at Santa Cruz {{under the direction of}} assistant superintendent William Peyton, had an unusual addition of ammonium picrate to the conventional double-base formulation of nitrocellulose and <b>nitroglycerine.</b> Peyton Powder was selected by the United States Army in 1893 for early cartridges for the new Krag-Jørgensen service rifle. The powder works also produced CPW Smokeless powder and loaded shotgun ammunition marketed as Native Son Cartridges after the army adopted W.A. powder in 1896 to avoid cartridge case corrosion caused by picric acid in the Peyton Powder.|$|E
25|$|In mammals {{including}} humans, {{nitric oxide}} {{is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is a powerful vasodilator with a short half-life of a few seconds in the blood. Long-known pharmaceuticals such as <b>nitroglycerine</b> and amyl nitrite {{were found to be}} precursors to nitric oxide more than a century after their first use in medicine. Low levels of nitric oxide production are important in protecting organs such as the liver from ischemic damage. Nitric oxide production is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is essential for hepatic lipid metabolism under starvation.|$|E
25|$|Aman {{decided to}} {{activate}} the network in the Spring of 1954. On 2 July the cell detonated bombs at a post office in Alexandria, and on 14 July, it bombed the libraries of the U.S. Information Agency in Alexandria and Cairo and a British-owned theater. The homemade bombs, consisting of bags containing acid placed over <b>nitroglycerine,</b> were inserted into books, and placed on the shelves of the libraries just before closing time. Several hours later, as the acid ate through the bags, the bombs would explode. They did little damage to the targets and caused no injuries or deaths.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{chemical}} reactions can occur at normal temperatures (although different reactions proceed at different rates). However most reactions are accelerated by high temperatures, and {{the degradation of}} foods and pharmaceuticals is no exception. The same applies to the breakdown of many chemical explosives into more unstable compounds. <b>Nitroglycerine</b> is notorious. Old explosives are thus more dangerous (i.e. liable to be triggered to explode by very small disturbances, even trivial jiggling) than more recently manufactured explosives. Rubber products also degrade as sulphur bonds induced during vulcanization revert; this is why old rubber bands and other rubber products soften and get crispy, and lose their elasticity as they age.|$|E
25|$|When {{dynamite}} {{was invented}} in 1867 and quickly became popular, a new dynamite plant was opened in 1869 near San Francisco in the area which later became Golden Gate Park. The danger of accidental explosions near a population center became unacceptable as San Francisco expanded; and land was purchased on Point Pinole in 1879 to shift manufacturing to {{the east side of}} San Francisco Bay. After initial purchases in 1868, DuPont had obtained 43% interest in California Powder Works by 1876, and financed Hercules Powder Company with Laflin & Rand Powder Company in 1882. The city of Hercules was named after California Powder Works' blasting powder, known as Hercules Powder, which in turn was named for the powerful Greek demigod, Hercules. Guncotton and <b>nitroglycerine</b> manufactured at Hercules were shipped to the smokeless powder plant at Santa Cruz.|$|E
25|$|DuPont {{continued}} to expand, {{moving into the}} production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments. The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted {{in the creation of}} the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel). At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and <b>nitroglycerine.</b> DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.|$|E
500|$|Before {{and during}} World War I, the gun used about [...] of RP C/12 (Rohr-Pulver– tube powder) {{propellant}} {{that was a}} mix of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin and small amounts of other additives with a calorific value of 950 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2975 [...] kelvins. In World War II, it was replaced by RP C/38 that substituted diethylene glucol dinitrite for the <b>nitroglycerine</b> which had a calorific value of 810 and an uncooled explosion temperature of 2495 K. This had the virtue of being harder to ignite, lessening {{the risk of a}} catastrophic fire or explosion, and reduced the erosive effects of the gaseous propellant on the gun's bore. Sources differ on the amount of RP C/38 used by the gun during World War II; Campbell says , but Hogg says [...]|$|E
500|$|There was {{government}} funding provided of $9,000 then {{with support from}} Senators Charles B. Farwell and Leland Stanford for a full-scale test experiment in northern Texas. There was to be completed a scientific analysis of the results. The man-made rain project was to take place {{near the town of}} Midland. The equipment involved in this test was 100 [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloons, dozens of kites six to twelve feet high, miles of copper wire, <b>nitroglycerine,</b> dynamite, and gunpowder. Myers provided all the balloons and the gases. Electric batteries and generators were also part of the on-site equipment. The design of the rain experiment project was to have explosions stir up particle aggregation. Myers' balloon [...] "bombs" [...] were the start of many such explosions that were to take place in the rain producing experiment. His balloon [...] "bombs" [...] were one part oxygen gas combined with two parts of hydrogen gas, which would make a huge explosion upon detonation. The side effect of this balloon explosion was that water was produced. This water would drop from the sky at some high altitude and the idea was that all of this action would stimulate the atmosphere to make rain. The balloons made by Myers for the government at his [...] "balloon farm" [...] would hold 500 to 5000 cubic feet of gas. Myers had complete charge of the government rain producing experiments for years.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} [...]303 British service cartridge employed {{black powder}} as a propellant, and was adopted for the Lee–Metford rifle, which had rifling designed to lessen fouling from this propellant. The Lee–Metford {{was used as}} a trial platform by the British Committee on Explosives to experiment with many different smokeless powders then coming to market, including Ballistite, Cordite, and Rifleite. [...] Ballistite was a stick-type smokeless powder composed of soluble nitrocellulose and <b>nitroglycerine.</b> [...] Cordite was a stick-type or 'chopped' smokeless gunpowder composed of <b>nitroglycerine,</b> gun-cotton, and mineral jelly, while Rifleite was a true nitrocellulose powder, composed of soluble and insoluble nitrocellulose, phenyl amidazobense, and volatiles similar to French smokeless powders. [...] Unlike Cordite, Riflelite was a flake powder, and contained no <b>nitroglycerine.</b> [...] Excessive wear of the shallow Lee–Metford rifling with all smokeless powders then available caused ordnance authorities to institute a new type of barrel rifling designed by the RSAF, Enfield, to increase barrel life; the rifle was referred to thereafter as the Lee–Enfield. [...] After extensive testing, the Committee on Explosives selected Cordite for use in the Mark II [...]303 British service cartridge.|$|E

2500|$|British and German {{propellant}} charges {{differed in}} packaging, handling, and chemistry. The British propellant was of two types, MK1 and MD. The Mark 1 cordite had a formula of 37% nitrocellulose, 58% <b>nitroglycerine,</b> and 5% petroleum jelly. It {{was a good}} propellant but burned hot and caused an erosion problem in gun barrels. The petroleum jelly served as both a lubricant and a stabiliser. Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear, its formula being 65% nitrocellulose, 30% <b>nitroglycerine,</b> and 5% petroleum jelly. While cordite MD solved the gun-barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties, which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature, and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate. Cordite MD also shed micro-dust particles of nitrocellulose and iron pyrite. [...] While cordite propellant was manageable, it required a vigilant gunnery officer, strict cordite lot control, and frequent testing of the cordite lots in the ships' magazines.|$|E
2500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} project required excavation of [...] of rock. On March 16, 1853, [...] "Wilson's Patented Stone-Cutting Machine" [...] (a tunnel boring machine) was used; it failed after excavating [...] of rock. Tunnel builders resorted to hand digging, and later used the Burleigh Rock Drill, {{one of the}} first pneumatic drills.

2500|$|One {{experiment}} was mounting a [...] "flying hose" [...] on an LCA as a mine-clearing line charge device for clearing mines and obstacles on beaches. The LCA was {{fitted with a}} coil of hose, attached to a rocket. The rocket would carry the hose onto the beach, the crew would pump <b>nitroglycerine</b> into the hose, and then attach an explosive charge to the near end and throw it overboard. Fortunately, this system was never used operationally. The same concept was employed by the 79th Armoured Division (called [...] "Congers"), using Universal Carriers. The nitroglycerin supply for the unit using them accidentally ignited - causing great damage and loss of life.|$|E

His family {{subsequently}} moved to Painesville, Ohio, but returned to Cleveland in 1949, following his father's death. Ellison frequently ran away from home, taking an array of odd jobs—including, by age 18, [...] "tuna fisherman {{off the coast of}} Galveston, itinerant crop-picker down in New Orleans, hired gun for a wealthy neurotic, <b>nitroglycerine</b> truck driver in North Carolina, short-order cook, cab driver, lithographer, book salesman, floorwalker in a department store, door-to-door brush salesman, and as a youngster, an actor in several productions at the Cleveland Play House".|$|E
2500|$|This {{meant that}} about 75 times the {{propellant}} would immediately ignite {{when exposed to}} flash, {{as compared to the}} U.S. powder. British ships had inadequate protection against these flash fires. German propellant (RP C/12, handled in brass cartridge cases) was less vulnerable and less volatile in composition. [...] German propellants were not that different in composition from cordite—with one major exception: centralite. This was symmetrical Diethyl Diphenyl Urea, which served as a stabiliser that was superior to the petroleum jelly used in British practice. It stored better and burned but did not explode. Stored and used in brass cases, it proved much less sensitive to flash. RP C/12 was composed of 64.13% nitrocellulose, 29.77% <b>nitroglycerine,</b> 5.75% centralite, 0.25% magnesium oxide and 0.10% graphite.|$|E

[...] "It existed, it {{has always}} existed", said the French {{reporter}} and author, Pierre Chany, who followed 49 Tours {{before his death in}} 1996. The exhaustion of six-day races on the track was countered by the riders' soigneurs (the French word for [...] "carer"), helpers akin to seconds in boxing. Among the treatments they supplied was <b>nitroglycerine,</b> a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing. Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs.

2500|$|Yousef was {{assisted}} by Iraqi bomb maker Abdul Rahman Yasin, who helped assemble the complex [...] bomb, {{which was made}} of a urea nitrate main charge with aluminum, magnesium and ferric oxide particles surrounding the explosive. The charge used <b>nitroglycerine,</b> ammonium nitrate dynamite, smokeless powder and fuse as booster explosives. Three tanks of bottled hydrogen were also placed in a circular configuration around the main charge, to enhance the fireball and afterburn of the solid metal particles. The use of compressed gas cylinders {{in this type of}} attack closely resembles the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing 10 years earlier. Both of these attacks used compressed gas cylinders to create fuel-air and thermobaric bombs that release more energy than conventional high explosives. According to testimony in the bomb trial, only once before the 1993 attack had the FBI recorded a bomb that used urea nitrate.|$|E
