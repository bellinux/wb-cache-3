With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E

You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up.

[...] San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman claimed [...] "The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, {{it looks as if}} Gilligan's bold vision for Breaking Bad, now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project.

2500|$|Donald Winnicott, {{who was a}} {{pediatrician}} and child psychoanalyst, had an immense influence on Bowlby's work and career. Bowlby and Winnicott had several similarities within their professional work as {{they were the first}} to explain the importance of social interactions at an early age. Both Bowlby and Winnicott argued that humans come into the world with a predisposition to be sensitive to social interactions and to need these interactions {{in order to have a}} healthy development. However, although Bowlby and Winnicott's ideas were similar, they took vastly different approaches when dealing with their research. For example, Bowlby was interested in how a child's environment is internalized and affects the child's development, while Winnicott was more interested in [...] "the way the inner world engages with and thereby is affected by external events". Despite their differences in approaching their research interests, Bowlby explained in an interview that his research for the World Health Organization influenced policies regarding child care; however, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> have been possible without the help of Winnicott.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel infrastructure supporting automatic updates for dynamic con-tent browsing on mobile devices. We employ {{a pair of}} proxies, located on the mobile client and on a fully-connected edge server, to minimize the battery consumption caused by wireless data transfers {{to and from the}} mobile device. The client specifies her inter-est in changes to specific parts of pages by highlighting portions of already loaded web pages in her browser. The edge proxy aggregates updates as one batch to be sent to the client. Our approach is fully implemented using two wireless networking technologies, 802. 11 and GPRS. Furthermore, we leverage SMS to implement and evaluate a hybrid approach. Our results show that our proxy system saves data transfers to and from the mobile device by an order of magnitude and battery consumption by up to a factor of 4. 5, compared to the common client-initiated continuous polling approach. ii Acknowledgements First and foremost, I would like to thank my research supervisor, Professor Cristiana Amza.

Another subregion of the PFC, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is interconnected with the OFC. The mPFC and OFC {{have been shown to be}} reciprocally responsive to a variety of influences, in terms of dendritic morphology. It was hypothesized that social experiences are necessary for the proper development of the OFC, and that, because of the interconnectivity, the mPFC would also be sensitive to social experience.
