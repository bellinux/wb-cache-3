Like other disciplines, the profession has developed different theories derived from sometimes diverse philosophical beliefs and paradigms or worldviews to help nurses direct their activities to accomplish specific goals.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{nursing care}} is {{characterized}} by seeking, planning and satisfying needs of a healthy or an ill person. All this is performed {{by means of the}} <b>nursing</b> care <b>process.</b> The <b>nursing</b> care <b>process</b> is considered the basic scientific method of advanced nursing care leading to solution of problems. It has already become an inherent form of individual care planning. Thanks to the <b>nursing</b> care <b>process</b> a <b>nurse</b> has a holistic view of a patient and is able to provide quality care. Nursing care is provided in compliance with the <b>nursing</b> care <b>process</b> principles with regard to the specifics of geriatric care in senior homes. A senior home nurse takes into consideration the specifics of the individual phases of <b>nursing</b> care <b>process</b> in seniors. Senior homes provide residential services to people with lower self-sufficiency particularly caused by higher age and to those who need regular care in the field of self-sufficiency and personal care. Unfavourable social situation does not allow these people to live in their domestic environment. Complex care provided in senior homes substitutes for domestic environment. Seniors are also given health care provided by general nurses. The aim of the thesis was to examine <b>nursing</b> care <b>process</b> application in a senior home and the importance of the <b>nursing</b> care <b>process</b> {{from the point of view}} of senior home nurses. The following research questions were set: Which <b>nursing</b> care <b>process</b> phases are applied by nurses taking care about seniors in the senior home? How do senior home nurses feel the importance of <b>nursing</b> care <b>process?</b> Qualitative research by means of in-depth interview and questioning of nurses in a selected senior home in South Bohemia was chosen for collection of necessary information. The interviews were recorded and subsequently literally transcribed. The transcribed interviews were deeply analyzed by means of paper and pencil method by open coding. Four categories were created from the data analysis: <b>Nursing</b> care <b>process,</b> <b>Nursing</b> care <b>process</b> in practice, <b>Nursing</b> care <b>process</b> phases and Compilation of nursing care diagnosis and maintenance of nursing care documentation. Subcategories, where the core data are coded, are assigned to the individual categories, everything is illustrated by clear diagrams of the individual categories. The research shows that nurses have general knowledge of <b>nursing</b> care <b>process.</b> They were able to define <b>nursing</b> care <b>process,</b> to name its phases and to express their attitude to this method. They actively apply the process, but they say it is demanding for them from time and administration point of view. The fact that the knowledge of nursing care diagnosis is very poor among nurses is surprising.

40|$|Psychiatric {{nurses are}} {{increasingly}} {{being involved in the}} provision of care for outpatients with bipolar disorder. The establishment of a body of knowledge for the nursing of these patients is vital for the development of integrated evidence-based treatment. The literature for the period January 1980 to January 2006 is reviewed. A sensitive literature search included not only the nursing care based on research results but also nursing care based on experiences acquired by practising nurses. The results show that formal research on the nursing of patients with a bipolar disorder is remarkably limited. Three quantitative studies were identified in five articles and six qualitative studies addressing a broad range of topics. The remainder of articles meeting the inclusion criteria contained mostly descriptive reports. An overview is presented of the <b>nursing</b> <b>processes</b> used during the euthymic stage of a bipolar disorder and during an acute episode of (hypo) mania. No specific <b>nursing</b> <b>processes</b> for acute episodes of bipolar depression are described in the literature.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Through {{a review}} of the literature, to {{identify}} and describe (1) empirical studies of inpatient nursing care quality that evaluate links between <b>nursing</b> care <b>processes</b> and health-related patient outcomes, (2) <b>nursing</b> care <b>processes</b> for which process-outcome links have been established, and (3) important <b>nursing</b> care <b>processes</b> that have not yet been evaluated. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Published empirical studies of inpatient nursing care quality that evaluated links between <b>processes</b> of <b>nursing</b> care and health-related patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN/DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: This literature review used a five-step article search and review method. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 257 data-based studies of nursing care quality identified, 135 investigated a process-outcome link but only 17 met study inclusion criteria. The literature provides evidence that the quality of <b>nursing</b> care <b>processes</b> affects health-related patient outcomes during and after hospitalization. Gaps in the literature that evaluates nursing quality are identified. CONCLUSIONS: Although some <b>nursing</b> care <b>processes</b> affect health-related patient outcomes, the full extent of nursing process-outcome links is relatively understudied. Further evaluation of the interrelationships between <b>nursing</b> care <b>processes</b> and outcomes is critical...|$|R

For data collection was conducted a group interview with 24 nurses working in health units of a municipality in south central Paraná, Brazil. Data were analyzed in the light of interdependence between the structural, particular and singular dimensions contained in the Theory of Nursing Praxis Intervention in Collective Health. RESULTS The situations interfering with improper use were the lack of knowledge about the origin and purpose of terminology, lack of training, and non-mandatory use. CONCLUSION Although the nursing terminology is used as an instrument in the <b>nursing</b> work <b>process</b> in collective health, it requires training to be recognized as a classification system.
