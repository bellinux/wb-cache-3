50|$|<b>Norfenefrine</b> (INN) or meta-octopamine (3-octopamine), {{also known}} as 3,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine, is an {{adrenergic}} agent used as a sympathomimetic drug which is marketed in Europe, Japan, and Mexico. Along with its structural isomer p-octopamine and the tyramines, <b>norfenefrine</b> is a naturally occurring, endogenous trace amine and plays a role as a minor neurotransmitter in the brain.|$|E
40|$|The study {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the effect of endogenous insulin release on lipolysis in subcutaneous adipose tissue after adrenergic stimulation in obese subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). In 14 obese female T 2 D subjects, or 14 obese non-T 2 D controls, glycerol concentration was measured in response to the α 1, 2,ß-agonist norepinephrine, the α 1 -agonist <b>norfenefrine</b> and the ß 2 -agonist terbutaline (each 10 - 4 M), using the microdialysis technique. After 60 minutes of stimulation, an intravenous glucose load (0. 5 g/kg lean body mass) was given. Local blood flow was monitored by means of the ethanol technique. Norepinephrine and <b>norfenefrine</b> induced a four and three fold rise in glycerol dialysate concentration (p< 0. 001, each), with a similar pattern in adipose tissue. Following agonist stimulation and glucose infusion, endogenous insulin release inhibited lipolysis in the presence of norepinephrine, which was more rapid and pronounced in healthy obese controls than in T 2 D subjects (p = 0. 024 obese vs T 2 D subjects). Insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis in the presence of <b>norfenefrine</b> was similar in all study participants. In the presence of terbutaline the lipolysis rate increased two fold until the effect of endogenous insulin (p< 0. 001). A similar insulin-induced decrease in lipolysis was observed for each of the <b>norfenefrine</b> groups and the terbutaline groups, respectively. Adipose tissue blood flow remained unchanged after the iv-glucose load. Both norepinephrine and <b>norfenefrine</b> diminished blood flow slightly, but insulin reversed this response (p< 0. 001 over the entire time). Terbutaline alone and terbutaline plus increased endogenous insulin augmented local blood flow (p< 0. 001 over the entire time). In conclusion, a difference in insulin-induced inhibition of lipolysis was observed in obese T 2 D subjects compared to obese healthy controls following modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity and is assumed to be due to ß 1 -adrenoceptor mediated stimulation by norepinephrine...|$|E

40|$|Chiral separations of FITC-labeled basic {{drugs on}} {{multichannel}} microfluidic chips with LIF detector were investigated. A preliminary screening procedure for seven neutral CDs was performed under optimized conditions for chiral separations of three FITC-labeled drugs (baclofen, <b>norfenefrine,</b> and tocainide) on a mono-channel microfluidic chip. According {{to the results}} of screening, FITC-baclofen and FITC-norfenefrine as well as two chiral selectors including gamma-CD and dimethyl-beta-CD (DM-beta-CD) were selected as models to perform chiral separations on a two-channel chip. FITC-baclofen enantiomers were separated completely by gamma-CD in one channel, while resolution of FITC-norfenefrine enantiomers was achieved by DM-beta-CD in the other channel in the same run. Furthermore, the feasibility of using one chiral selector to separate multiple chiral samples was studied on a four-channel chip. These results show that multichannel chip has a potential for chiral high-throughput screening...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-six {{substituted}} N-benzamidomethyl and 3 N-(diphenylacetamido) methyl amines were prepd. by coupling I groups (R 1 = H or MeO; R 2 = H, Me MeO, EtO, PrO, or Cl; R 3 = H, MeO, or Cl) and Ph 2 CHCONHCH 2 groups, resp., to the N atom of phenylethylamine, amphetamine, phenylethanolamine, norephedrine, ephedrine, <b>norfenefrine,</b> and noradrenaline. Tests on {{the isolated}} guinea pig heart {{showed that the}} desired sepn. of coronary-dilating and pos. inotropic properties was not achieved {{by any of the}} compds. Six compds., including N-(3 '-methoxybenzamidomethyl) -D-norephedrine-HCl [59630 - 62 - 5], had combined pos. inotropic and coronary circulation-promoting effects; none was as active as the ref. compd., oxyfedrine [15687 - 41 - 9]. Five N-benzamidomethyl-beta -phenylalkanolamines, synthesized in the hope of obtaining long-acting pressor effects in vivo, showed no activity in this regard. The compds. were synthesized by reaction of Ph 2 CHCONHCH 2 Cl or the N-chloromethyl analogs of I with the catechol amines in the presence of Et 3 N as H+ acceptor...|$|E
30|$|In animal models, {{when given}} at the early stage, vasopressors were shown {{to be capable of}} {{restoring}} a quasi-normal hemodynamic status by mobilizing nonconstraint venous blood volume and thus normalizing arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and preload parameters, such as pulse pressure variations [18]. However, the consequences of such a masked hypovolemia are far from insignificant. In an experimental hemorrhage model associated with endotoxin injection, Hinder et al. investigated the effects of <b>norfenefrine,</b> a pure vasopressor [19]. These authors demonstrated that <b>norfenefrine</b> infusion, {{even in the absence of}} concomitant fluid loading, resulted in normalized filling pressures. This masked hypovolemia was associated with disseminated cardiac cell necrosis and severe acute renal dysfunction. This adverse effect is likely to be dose-dependent as reported by Poloujadoff et al. [20]. In this study, norepinephrine in combination with saline infusion in uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock in rats was associated with improved survival. But irrespective to the threshold of lower MAP (40 mm Hg versus 80 mmHg), the highest dose of norepinephrine was associated with increased mortality rate. These recent findings confirm those obtained in older studies, suggesting the deleterious effects of vasopressor use in experimental hemorrhage models, due to the worsening of tissue hypoperfusion [21]. Of note in all of these experimental models, the duration of shock was brief and vasopressor agents were used alone, most often without fluid challenge [18, 19] at the early shock stage when arterial vasodilatation was not yet present. However, in a model of normovolemic hemorrhage in which pigs received hemodilution until death, maintaining MAP > 60 mmHg by norepinephrine infusion allowed for the exchange of a significantly higher volume of blood [22]. Using the pig model associating uncontrolled hemorrhage (splenic laceration) and cranial trauma, which is closer to the condition of a polytrauma patient, Alspaugh et al. have shown that early and isolated administration of phenylephrine was associated with a higher survival rate than with crystalloid fluid resuscitation alone, although the cardiac output was decreased in the phenylephrine group [23]. Of note, the splenic laceration resulted in large variability in hemorrhage volume and hemodynamic response of the individual animal. Using a similar model, Feinstein et al. compared crystalloid administration alone versus crystalloid + phenylephrine or vasopressin [24]. Vasopressor support limited the volume of perfused solutions, decreased pulmonary lesions, and reduced elevations of intracranial pressure. Recently, these observations have been confirmed using a similar model of cerebral lesions and hemorrhage, associating fluid infusion and vasopressin administration [25]. As the studies in head-injured patients showed that norepinephrine does not alter intracranial pressure [26, 27], this protective effect of vasopressor infusion on intracranial pressure is likely to be dependent on the reduction of fluid loading rather than on a direct effect of the vasoconstrictive drug. Conversely in a model of uncontrolled hemorrhage induced by a penetrating liver trauma without brain injury, in comparison with hypertonic hydroxyethyl starch alone, the addition of norepinephrine did not show beneficial effect on cerebral perfusion pressure or brain tissue oxygenation [28]. These last studies underline the potential usefulness of vasopressor support in conditions where rapid blood pressure restoration is required (cranial trauma), as well as the effects of volume-sparing measures on pulmonary lesions and cerebral edema, and point out the need for initial fluid loading. Nonetheless, as a decrease in cardiac output and unfavorable metabolic effects (hyperlactatemia) were frequently observed in experimental studies associating fluid infusion and vasopressor support [29], the conditions for using a vasopressor agent along with fluid infusion must be better defined in terms of vasopressor agent and timing of infusion.|$|E
