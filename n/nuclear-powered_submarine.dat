50|$|The November class attack {{submarines}} were considerably noisier than diesel submarines and {{the early}} American <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>submarines,</b> despite the streamlined torpedo-like hull, limited number of holes in the hull, special low-noise variable-pitch propellers, vibration dampening of main equipment, and antisonar coating of the hull (used {{for the first time}} on <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>submarines).</b> Soviet reactors were superior to American ones in compactness and power-to-weight ratio, but the vibrations of Soviet reactors were much more pronounced. Novembers detected submarine targets during active service (for example, there were 42 detections in 1965 when regular cruises of Soviet <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>submarines</b> began). The Soviet hydroacoustic equipment on the Novembers was not intended for submarine hunting, and had relatively limited capabilities.|$|R

25|$|Lord Mountbatten of Burma {{nevertheless}} {{continued with}} development, and by 1962 a new Dreadnought became Britain's first <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>submarine</b> and in 1968 the first ballistic missile submarine Resolution was commissioned, {{armed with the}} Polaris missile. The Royal Navy later became wholly responsible {{for the maintenance of}} the UK's nuclear deterrent. Even so, the Labour government announced in 1966 that Britain would not mount major operations without the help of allies, and that the existing carrier force would be maintained into the 1970s; Christopher Mayhew and Sir David Luce resigned in protest, but to no avail. Britain withdrew from the east of Suez, cancelling its planned CVA-01 large carrier, and other than Polaris focused on its NATO responsibilities of anti-submarine warfare, defending US Navy carrier groups in the GIUK gap.|$|E
25|$|Nautilus was {{powered by}} the Submarine Thermal Reactor (STR), later redesignated the S2W reactor, a {{pressurized}} water reactor produced for the US Navy by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, operated by Westinghouse, developed the basic reactor plant design used in Nautilus after being given the assignment on 31 December 1947 to design {{a nuclear power plant}} for a submarine. Nuclear power had the crucial advantage in submarine propulsion because it is a zero-emission process that consumes no air. This design is the basis for nearly all of the US <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>submarine</b> and surface combat ships, and was adapted by other countries for naval nuclear propulsion. The first actual prototype (for Nautilus) was constructed and tested by the Argonne National Laboratory in 1953 at the S1W facility, part of the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho.|$|E

50|$|Radar was a prime tool in World War II for {{locating}} surfaced submarines. After {{development of}} the snorkel, and then of <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>submarines,</b> submarines rarely surfaced outside their home port, rendering direct radar detection largely useless.

25|$|Ebersole {{entered the}} U.S. Navy in July 1948 and trained in undersea medicine. As a future {{submarine}} doctor, Ebersole received extensive nuclear training. From 1949 to 1959, Ebersole {{was associated with}} nuclear submarines and had special training in nuclear physics at Duke University and at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Ebersole was commissioned in the U.S. Navy and served on the USS Nautilus (SSN-571) and the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), the first two nuclear submarines. Ebersole was selected by Admiral Rickover as the medical officer for the USS Nautilus, the first <b>nuclear-powered</b> <b>submarine</b> and served under commanding officer Commander Eugene Parks Wilkinson. Ebersole {{was a member of}} the launching crew for the USS Nautilus. He went on to serve as medical officer aboard the USS Seawolf (SSN-575), the second nuclear submarine for the U.S. Navy. Ebersole was the first person to serve on more than one nuclear powered vessel.|$|E
