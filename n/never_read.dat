5|$|In February and March 1936, Berkman {{underwent}} {{a pair of}} prostate gland operations. Recuperating in Nice and cared for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman's sixty-seventh birthday in Saint-Tropez in June. She wrote in sadness, but he <b>never</b> <b>read</b> the letter; she received a call {{in the middle of}} the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826, {{and soon}} {{thereafter}} his parents acquired a farm {{of their own}} to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother {{died when he was}} eight; Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (n√©e du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, Kruger's only education was three months under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father. In adulthood Kruger would claim to have <b>never</b> <b>read</b> any book apart from the Bible.|$|E

5|$|The voters {{returned}} Sherman {{to office}} for a third term in 1858. After a brief special session in March 1859, the 36th Congress adjourned, and Sherman and his wife went on vacation to Europe. When they returned that December, the situation {{was similar to that}} of four years earlier: no party had an absolute majority. Republicans held 109 seats, Democrats 101, and Know Nothings 27. Again, sectional tension had increased while Congress was in recess, this time due to John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The election for Speaker of the House promised to be contentious. This time, Sherman was among the leading candidates, receiving the second-largest number of votes on the first ballot, with no candidate receiving a majority. The election for Speaker was sidetracked immediately by a furor over an anti-slavery book, The Impending Crisis of the South, written by Hinton Rowan Helper and endorsed by many Republican members. Southerners accused Sherman of having endorsed the book, while he protested that he only endorsed its use as a campaign tool and had <b>never</b> <b>read</b> it. After two months of balloting, no decision had been reached. After their attempts to adopt a plurality rule failed, Sherman accepted that he could not be elected, and withdrew. Republicans then shifted their support to William Pennington, who was elected on the forty-fourth ballot.|$|E

This means they are unaware of potential restrictions such as limited hunt times, park open/close times, off-limit areas, and suggested parking locations.|$|E
25|$|Hankey {{tried to}} {{institute}} weekly breakfasts between Lloyd George and Robertson, but these had failed as Lloyd George liked to sit talking {{for a long}} time after breakfast. Although he cultivated a myth that he <b>never</b> <b>read,</b> Lloyd George was in fact a very early riser, who would have already have completed much of the day's paperwork before breakfast, and therefore preferred to do business at breakfast meetings rather than in the evening. Austen Chamberlain found the practice equally irritating.|$|E
60|$|At present such {{teaching}} is very unpopular. It {{does not exist}} in schools; but every adult who derives his knowledge of public affairs from the newspapers can take in, at the cost of an extra halfpenny, two papers of opposite politics. Yet the ordinary man so dislikes having his mind unsettled, as he calls it, that he angrily refuses to allow a paper which dissents from his views to be brought into his house. Even at his club he resents seeing it, and excludes it if it happens to run counter to the opinions of all the members. The result is that his opinions are not worth considering. A churchman who <b>never</b> <b>reads</b> The Freethinker very soon has no more real religion than the atheist who <b>never</b> <b>reads</b> The Church Times. The attitude is the same in both cases: they want to hear nothing good of their enemies; consequently they remain enemies and suffer from bad blood all their lives; whereas men who know their opponents and understand their case, quite commonly respect and like them, and always learn something from them.|$|R

25|$|The {{anaesthetic}} {{qualities of}} chloroform were first described in 1842 in a thesis by Dr Robert Mortimer Glover {{which won the}} Harveian Medal for that year. Glover also undertook practical experiments on dogs to prove his theories. Glover further refined his theories and presented them in the thesis for his doctorate at Edinburgh University {{in the summer of}} 1847. James Y.

25|$|Much {{interest}} in »òƒÉineanu's work was sparked during the interwar period, shortly {{before and after}} the scholar's death, when new generations of critics came to reclaim his work as an important contribution to the field of science. Outside of Romania and France, »òƒÉineanu's contribution of Rabelais left an observable trace in Finnegans Wake, a 1939 modernist novel by Irish novelist James Joyce: while Joyce's text holds transparent allusions to Rabelais' writings, the writer himself claimed to have <b>never</b> <b>read</b> the originals, and to have instead relied solely on a scientific study (in turn identified by research Claude Jacquet as La Langue de Rabelais).|$|E
25|$|While Ford's {{articles}} were denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the articles explicitly condemned pogroms and violence against Jews, but blamed the Jews for provoking incidents of mass violence.

Friends and business associates have said they warned Ford about the contents of the Independent and that he probably <b>never</b> <b>read</b> the articles (he claimed he only read the headlines). However, court testimony in a libel suit, brought by one of the targets of the newspaper, alleged that Ford did know about the contents of the Independent in advance of publication.|$|E

Math was taught in a different way, with teachers using considerable board work and <b>never</b> <b>reading</b> out loud.|$|R

In 1992, for an unrelated court case, Wilson testified that he had <b>never</b> <b>read</b> the book.

25|$|Additionally, {{the writing}} of {{characters}} in vertical columns, from top to bottom, is {{for the most part}} carried over from the bamboo books to oracle bone inscriptions. In some instances lines are written horizontally so as to match the text to divinatory cracks, or columns of text rotate 90 degrees in mid-stream, but these are exceptions to the normal pattern of writing, and inscriptions were <b>never</b> <b>read</b> bottom to top. The vertical columns of text in Chinese writing are traditionally ordered from right to left; this pattern is found on bronze inscriptions from the Shang dynasty onward. Oracle bone inscriptions, however, are often arranged so that the columns begin near the centerline of the shell or bone, and move toward the edge, such that the two sides are ordered in mirror-image fashion.|$|E
25|$|Originally, WXP {{planned for}} The Fellowship {{to be an}} RPG, but they soon came to feel this might {{alienate}} potential players, and as they wanted to attract {{as many people as}} possible to the title, including people who had <b>never</b> <b>read</b> the books, they decided to develop the game as a third-person action-adventure instead. At the time, Frodo was the only controllable character, with the other members of the fellowship featuring as NPCs, although the player was to have the choice as to which character(s) to fight alongside at each point in the game. The developers were also working closely with Tolkien Enterprises to ensure any action sequences or enemies that moved beyond the immediate events of the novel kept with the general tone of the narrative and were true to the spirit of Tolkien's legendarium.|$|E
