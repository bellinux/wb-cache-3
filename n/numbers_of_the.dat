The lowland breeding common house martin has greatly benefited from forest clearance, creating the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation which has given it {{an abundance of}} safe man-made nest sites, although widespread declines in its numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970. This is due to factors including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites. Despite this, the huge geographical range and large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common house martin mean that its global status is secure.|$|E

5|$|Despite reservations, Hitler {{remained}} {{committed to}} the offensive.

30|$|Another remark is {{that when}} the sensor density is greater, the shift between the storage space for our {{solution}} and those of others becomes greater. For example, when considering the 1 -coverage and 2 -coverage densities, the key storage space for DynTunKey is closer to <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other protocols. However, when <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> k becomes greater, the key storage space is larger. In fact, as said previously, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> created and stored keys in DynTunKey is dynamic and depends not only on <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensors but also is established for only the sensors that have to report their detections. Then, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keys is adapted to <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> events that occurs in the monitored area.

5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, the nights in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E

5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one.

This unique factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.|$|E
