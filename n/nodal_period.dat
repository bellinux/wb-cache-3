50|$|The Moon's maximum {{and minimum}} {{declination}} also vary because {{the plane of}} the Moon's orbit around the Earth is inclined by about 5.14° to the ecliptic ({{the plane of the}} Earth's orbit around the Sun), and the direction of lunar orbit inclination gradually changes over an 18.6-year cycle, alternately adding to or subtracting from the 23.5° tilt of the Earth's axis. As a consequence, the maximum declination of the Moon varies from roughly (23.5° − 5° =) 18.5° to (23.5° + 5° =) 28.5°. As a result, at minor lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the <b>nodal</b> <b>period</b> from +18.5° to −18.5°, which is a total movement of 37°. Then, 9.3 years later, during the major lunar standstill, the Moon will change its declination during the <b>nodal</b> <b>period</b> from +28.5° to −28.5°, which is a total movement of 57°, which is enough to take its culmination from high in the sky to low on the horizon in just two weeks (half an orbit).|$|E

40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{effects of}} intravenous sotalol hydrochloride (0. 4 mg/kg) were assessed in 24 patients, including 13 with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, undergoing routine electrophysiological study. Fifteen to 30 minutes after sotalol administration {{there was a}} significant increase in sinus cycle length and in sinus node recovery time. There was a small increase in the AH interval, but the HV interval was unchanged. The QT and JT intervals, measured during sinus rhythm, were both increased. The atrial, ventricular, and atrioventricular <b>nodal</b> effective refractory <b>periods</b> were all prolonged, as was the atrioventricular <b>nodal</b> functional refractory <b>period.</b> In 13 patients with ventricular pre-excitation there was an increase of the accessory pathway anterograde and retrograde effective refractory periods.

40|$|Introduction: Despite {{extensive}} {{studies that}} have been performed on the effects of Crataegus monogyna in cardiovascular diseases, only few investigations have addressed the antiarrhythmic properties of this plant. Aims of the present study were: 1) To determine the protective role of methanolic extract of C. monogyna on the rate-dependent model and the concealed conduction of the AV node. 2) To explore the role of Na+-K+ ATPase in the protective role of C. monogyna Methods: Male New Zealand rabbits (1. 5 - 2 kg) were used in all experiments. Stimulation protocols were used to measure basic and rate-dependent AV nodal properties (recovery, atrial fibrilation and zone of concealment) in two groups (N= 14). In the first group, all the stimulation protocols were performed before and after the administration of different concentrations of C. monogyna extract (n= 7), while in the second group (n= 7), all stimulation protocols were carried out in the presence of ouabaine (0. 05 μM) and the plant extract. Results: Basic and rate-dependent properties of the AV node were inhibited after the addition of the extract of C. monogyna to Kerebs Henselite solution. At the maximum concentration of C. monogyna (30 mg/l), WBCL cycle length was significantly increased from 156. 5 ± 3. 4 to 173 ± 5. 8 ms and the <b>nodal</b> functional refractory <b>period</b> was prolonged from 164. 4 ± 4. 1 to 182. 7 ± 3. 8 ms (P< 0. 05). Significant decreases of ventricular rhythm were recorded in both selective concentrations of the plant extract. The depressant electrophysiological effect of C. monogyna on the AV node was not abolished by ouabaine, a selective inhibitor of Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme. Conclusion: The results showed a potential anti-arrhythmic and protective effect for C. monogyna. The effect of the plant extract in increasing <b>nodal</b> refractory <b>period</b> and widening of the concealment zone might be the major mechanisms involved. The protective role of C. monogyna was not related to the Na+-K+ ATPase activity...|$|R

This is the reason that a draconic month or <b>nodal</b> <b>period</b> (the period of time that the Moon takes to return to the same node in its orbit) is shorter than the sidereal month.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} closed-form {{solutions for}} the problem of long-term satellite relative motion {{in the presence of}} J 2 perturbations, and introduces a design methodology for long-term passive distance-bounded relative motion. There are two key ingredients of closed-form solutions. One is the model of relative motion; the other is the Hamiltonian model and its canonical solution of the J 2 -perturbed absolute motion. The model of relative motion makes no assumptions on the eccentricity of the reference orbit or on the magnitude of the relative distances. Besides, the relative motion model is concise with straightforward physical insight, and consistent with the Hamiltonian model. The Hamiltonian model takes into account the secular, long-periodic and short-periodic effects of the J 2 perturbation. It also remains separable in terms of spherical coordinates to ensure the application of the Hamilton–Jacobi theory to derive the canonical solution. When deriving the canonical solution, pseudo-circular and pseudo-elliptical orbits are treated separately and Carlson’s method is employed to calculate elliptic integrals, which takes advantage of the symmetry of the integrand. These symmetry properties hold physical insights of the J 2 -perturbed absolute motion. To design the long-term distance-bounded relative motion, the <b>nodal</b> <b>period</b> and the drift of right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) per <b>nodal</b> <b>period</b> are, respectively, matched non-instantaneously. Even though the <b>nodal</b> <b>period</b> and the drift of RAAN per <b>nodal</b> <b>period</b> can be obtained via the canonical solution, action-angle variables are used to obtain the frequency of the system without finding the complete solution to the perturbed orbital motion.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the design and station keeping of repeat-groundtrack orbits for Sun-synchronous satellite.

40|$|Context. 65 UMa {{belongs to}} rather {{small group of}} stellar systems of higher multiplicity, whose inner and outer orbits are well-known. Methods: Photometric, spectroscopic, and {{interferometric}} data were analyzed, revealing the basic physical properties of the system 65 UMa. A disentangling technique is used to perform the spectra decomposition. This combined approach allows us to study the long-term period changes in the system, identifying the period variation due to the motion on the visual orbit, {{in addition to a}} short-term modulation. Results: We find that the system contains one more component, hence 65 UMa is a sextuple hierarchical system. The most inner pair of components consists of an eclipsing binary orbiting around a barycenter on a circular orbit, both components being almost identical of spectral type about A 7. This pair orbits on an eccentric orbit around a barycenter, and the third component orbits with a period of about 640 days. This motion is reflected in the period variation in the minima times of the eclipsing pair, {{as well as in the}} radial velocities of the primary, secondary, and tertiary components. Moreover, this system orbits around a barycenter with the distant component resolved interferometrically, whose period is of about 118 years. Two more distant components (4 " and 63 ") are also probably gravitationally bound to the system. The <b>nodal</b> <b>period</b> of the eclipsing-pair orbit is on the order of only a few centuries, which makes this system even more interesting for a future prospective detection of changing the depths of minima. Conclusions: We identify a unique solution of the system 65 UMa, decomposing the individual components and even shifting the system to higher multiplicity. The study of this kind of multiple can help us to understand the origin of stellar systems. Besides 65 UMa, only another 11 sextuple systems have been studied.

However, previous investigations have not considered the possibility that respiration might influence HRV at lower frequencies. We hypothesized that Cheyne-Stokes respiration with central sleep apnea (CSR-CSA) would entrain HRV at very low frequency (VLF) in AF by modulating atrioventricular (AV) <b>nodal</b> refractory <b>period</b> and concealed conduction. Power spectral analysis of RR-intervals and respiration during sleep were performed in 13 {{subjects with}} AF and CSR-CSA. As anticipated, no modulation of HRV was detected at HF during regular breathing. In contrast, VLF HRV was entrained by CSR-CSA (coherence between respiration and HRV of 0. 69 ± 0. 22 at VLF during CSR-CSA vs 0. 20 ± 0. 19 at HF during regular breathing, p < 0. 001). Comparison of RR-intervals during CSR-CSA demonstrated a shorter AV node refractory period during hyperpnea than apnea (minimum RR of 684 ± 126 vs 735 ± 147 msec, p < 0. 001) and...|$|R
40|$|Session 01 - Exoplanets: {{abstract}} no. 01. 07 The {{orbit of}} the circumbinary planet Kepler- 16 b is significantly non-Keplerian {{because of the}} large secondary-to-primary mass ratio (0. 29) and orbital eccentricity (0. 15) of the binary, as well as the proximity of the planet to the binary (orbital period ratio 5. 6). We present an analytic theory which models the motion of the planet (treated as a test particle) by the superposition of the circular motion of a guiding center, the forced oscillations due to the non-axisymmetric components of the binary's potential, the epicyclic motion, and the vertical motion. In this analytic theory, the periapse and ascending node of the planet precess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions, and the largest forced oscillation term corresponds to a forced eccentricity of 0. 035. The <b>nodal</b> precession <b>period</b> (42 years) found in direct numerical orbit integration is in excellent agreement with the analytic theory, while the periapse precession period (49 years) and forced eccentricity (0. 038) are slightly larger than the analytic values. The comparison with direct numerical orbit integration also shows that the planet's orbit has a nonzero epicyclic (or free) eccentricity of 0. 027. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
