40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis is {{an application of}} the methodology in studies by Beaver and one by Dascher {{to an analysis of}} the financially troubled Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. There three previous studies used financial ratios in attempting to predict failure. All three studies were performed with firms that had already failed. their results demonstrate that there is a significant difference in financial ratios of failed and non-failed firms. This difference is particularly obvious when observing the <b>non-liquid</b> <b>asset</b> ratios. This thesis attempts to determine Lockheed's solvency in 1971, when it claimed to be facing bankruptcy. The conclusion is that failure in 1971 was, indeed, quite probable. In addition, Lockheed's ratios are analyzed during 197101972, as the firm has stated that it faces a new crisis, though not nearly of the proportion of the 1971 disaster. These last two years will serve {{as a starting point for}} future ratio analyses of Lockheed. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The key to {{understanding}} this financial crisis are the financial innovation and moral hazard concepts. Financial innovation consists of turning some <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets</b> into liquid assets, tradable on the free market. Moral hazard refers to someone’s willingness to take excessive risks just because they know someone else will come and save them from the possible negative consequences...|$|R
50|$|A maximum liquid wealth policy {{restricts the}} amount of liquid wealth an {{individual}} is permitted to maintain, while giving them unrestricted access to <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> That is to say, an individual may earn {{as much as they}} like during a given time period, but all earnings must be re-invested (spent) within an equivalent time period; all earnings not re-invested within this time period would be seized.|$|R
25|$|Any <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets</b> are {{generally}} {{sold by the}} DCO at a public auction. Items secured by a prior pledge or mortgage are sold only at a price sufficient to cover {{the amount of the}} mortgage, unless the creditor holding the security has requested the seizure and liquidation himself. If the proceeds of the liquidation do not cover the debt(s) at issue as well as the cost of the proceedings, the creditors receive a certificate of unpaid debts (Verlustschein / acte de défaut de biens) that allows them to re-initiate execution proceedings at a later time.|$|R
50|$|As of 2016, the {{remaining}} <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets</b> {{of the league}} sit in a warehouse in Jacksonville, Florida, with an estimated value of $100,000. The ownership lost or settled most of the lawsuits against them in 2014. The league still owes approximately $1,000,000 to the estate of Dennis Green; under a court ruling, the league itself is liable for Green's salary, as the owners had not personally guaranteed it. Hambrecht has also allegedly not paid the 78 players who sued him for back pay, even as the players won a $2.4 million judgment against Hambrecht.|$|R

The site also allows users to trade in <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> The platform is not subject to the regulatory supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA); however it is subject to authorization in Europe.|$|R
50|$|It {{was shown}} that {{short-term}} commercial lending oftentimes did not mature or liquidate at maturity due to changing business cycles. Growing opposition began to showcase {{the need for}} an improved banking system that could avoid forced liquidation of this short-term paper that came about more or less periodically. It proposed that banks, rather than relying on the liquidity of these assets in a crisis, should be able to shift these earning assets to another institution with a better cash position thereby creating the reserves needed. This ability to shift assets provides liquidity to otherwise <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{investigation of the}} behavioral life-cycle savings model. This model posits that self-control problems causes individuals to depart substantially from rational behavior. I show that this model can explain how the consumption of individuals at or near retirement vary with changes in different types of financial assets. Specifically, consumption spending is sensitive to changes in income and in liquid assets, but not very sensitive {{to changes in the}} value of other types of assets such as houses and social security (even though the value of <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets</b> is relatively large for most of the households in the sample). In general, the evidence presented here favors the Behavioral Life-Cycle Model over the conventional life-cycle model even when liquidit...|$|R
40|$|Securitization {{means the}} change of <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets</b> into securities. This topic has become more popular, mainly due to the U. S. {{subprime}} mortgage crisis. In this article, an analysis is given of the current situation in financial markets and the changes, which were implemented from {{the first days of}} subprime crisis. Also mentioned is the impact the crisis has had on securitization development. Part of the article is devoted to the situation on the Polish financial market. It is quite a new market and it is susceptible to such crises. The Article presents the part played by securitization in the Polish financial market and the circumstances for its growth in the near future. It also covers the latest information related to financial market regulations, which could have direct or indirect impact on the quantity and value of securitization transactions...|$|R
50|$|The {{value of}} {{furniture}} and household items is calculated using a standard formula {{based on the}} appraised value of the estate's liquid and <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets,</b> then the usufruct's value to the surviving spouse is subtracted, and finally the remaining balance is divided among the children {{on the death of}} the surviving spouse. This simplifies handling household items since the surviving spouse is free to maintain, replace or dispose of them as he/she wishes during his/her lifetime, with the monetary value of the items going to the children. Title to assets does not pass, and the usufruct disappears on death or {{at the end of a}} term of years. A usufruct is distinct from a trust or similar settlement. French law breaks with Roman law by construing a usufruct as not a servitude but rather a possessory interest.|$|R
40|$|Cash flow {{management}} {{is a significant}} issue {{in the management of}} a building or construction firm. This paper steps back from the well researched area of poor cash management and its relationship with failure, to focus on the funds which are generated through operations, and the positive benefits which can follow in a well managed organization. A stochastic model is developed which illustrates how an average of 16 % of turnover can be available for reinvestment. This is sufficient to allow investment in <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets,</b> provided that this is managed carefully and precautions are taken against a severe reduction in turnover. This level of funds is sufficient to encourage firms to enter the industry with the motivation of generating funds, rather than a desire to build. This has implications for large clients and for government when dealing with the industry. Cash Farming, Liquidity, Net Cash Flow, Stochastic Modelling, Monte Carlo,...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} network {{model of the}} interbank market in which {{optimizing}} risk averse banks lend {{to each other and}} invest in <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> Market clearing takes place through a t 2 tonnement process which yields the equilibrium price, while traded quantities are determined by means of a matching algorithm. We compare three alternative matching algorithms: maximum entropy, closest matching and random matching. Contagion occurs through liquidity hoarding, interbank interlinkages and fire sale externalities. The resulting network configurations exhibits a core-periphery structure, dis-assortative behavior and low clustering coefficient. We measure systemic importance by means of network centrality and input-output metrics and the contribution of systemic risk by means of Shapley values. Within this framework we analyze the effects of prudential policies on the stability/efficiency trade-off. Liquidity requirements unequivocally decrease systemic risk but at the cost of lower efficiency (measured by aggregate investment in non-liquid assets); equity requirements tend to reduce risk (hence increase stability) without reducing significantly overall investment...|$|R
50|$|Following the Panic of 1837 {{and years}} and poor {{economic}} conditions, all New Orleans banks had been suspended. The new system proposed that the charters of old banks could be renewed but new banks could not be created. This is a sharp contrast to New Yorks system of Free Banking. The most important feature of the Forstall System was that newly rechartered banks were required to maintain specie reserve requirement equal to one third of their note and deposit liabilities. The other two thirds was {{to be in the}} form of ninety-day paper. The combination of specie and ninety-day paper ensured a safe ratio of quick to <b>non-liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> This was the first system under which reserves be counted against notes as well as deposit liabilities. Banks were also required to publish their balance sheets in a uniform comparative report published weekly. The intent of this aspect of the law was to allow banks to track their individual position and assess the overall state of the local money market.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{euro area}} non-financial corporations (NFC) money demand, both from a macro and a microeconomic point of view. At a macro level, money holdings are modelled {{as a function}} of real gross added value, the price level, the long-term interest rate on bank lending to non-financial corporations, the own rate of return on M 3 and the real capital stock of the NFC sector. The results indicate that NFCs 2 ̆ 019 money holdings adjust quickly when deviations from their long-run level are registered, and that the large increase observed recently in NFCs 2 ̆ 019 money holdings has been driven by changes in their fundamentals and hence they stand in line with their long-run equilibrium level. The disaggregated analysis also shows that cash holdings are linked to balance-sheet ratios (such as <b>non-liquid</b> short term <b>assets,</b> tangible assets or indebtedness) and other variables such as the firm 2 ̆ 019 cash flow, its volatility or the size of the firm, which cannot be taken into account in the macro analysis. Likewise, results indicate that the main drivers of the increase in NFC cash holdings in the last years have been cyclical factors, captured by gross-added value and the cash-flow respectively. Variations in the opportunity cost of holding money, have also contributed to explain M 3 developments but more modestly than {{at the end of the}} nineties, when its increase contributed negatively to cash accumulation...|$|R
