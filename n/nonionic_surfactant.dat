40|$|Different {{bacterial}} strains able {{to attack}} polyoxyethylene-type <b>nonionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> were isolated by enrichment procedure {{from the surface}} waters of the Arno River. Alkylphenol polyethoxylates and alkyl polyethoxylates, as well as polyethylene glycols, were degraded and assimilated by bacterial strains in axenic cultures. Degradative routes of polyethyleneoxide chains were investigated by matching each bacterial isolate with several types of <b>nonionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> and polyethers and by the identification of their degradation products isolated during aerobic digestion experiments. In accordance with previous reports, the first attack led to the shortening of the poly(oxyethylene) chains of the <b>nonionic</b> <b>surfactants.</b> It {{was found that the}} strains able to degrade PEG segments of <b>nonionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> possess enzymatic systems unable to degrade free PEGs, whereas those degrading the latter substrates cannot degrade PEG segments coupled to hydrophobic moieties...|$|R

40|$|Static extraction, {{supercritical}} fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and Soxhlet extraction were compared for simultaneous extraction of di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and <b>nonionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> from house dust.

One portion of the extracts was used for analysis of <b>nonionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> with LC–MS and another portion was used for DEHP analysis with GC–MS. The extraction yield of DEHP was comparable for all the methods whereas SFE and PLE were the most efficient extraction techniques for the <b>nonionic</b> <b>surfactants.</b> The PLE extraction was found most suitable as a routine method for simultaneous extraction of both types of compounds and was used in a field study of floor dust from 15 Danish schools. The mean concentration of DEHP in the school dust samples was ~ 4 times higher than observed in other studies of dust from homes in different countries.

5000|$|The {{cloud point}} of a <b>nonionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> or glycol {{solution}} is the temperature at which the mixture starts to phase-separate, and two phases appear, thus becoming cloudy.
