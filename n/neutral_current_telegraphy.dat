According to this correspondence, two types of hadronic <b>neutral</b> <b>currents</b> are obtained. One is U-spin invariant and the other allows the transition between charmed and ordinary hadrons. On the other hand, space-time structures of both hadronic and leptonic <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> are assumed to be expressed as any combinations of vector and axial-vector.

40|$|The <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> can {{significantly}} harm {{the operation of}} a system, increase the losses of distribution transformers, and reduce the energy efficiency of a system. These negative effects of the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> highlight the importance and necessity of investigating <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> control strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for controlling the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> caused by a linear unbalanced load in three-phase four-wire distribution transformers. The scheme, {{which is based on}} the static var compensator (SVC) technology, aims to: (i) control the <b>neutral</b> <b>current,</b> and (ii) reduce distribution transformer losses. It takes into account the effects of unbalanced fundamental currents and the SVC's compensating capability. Combining optimisation theory with a sequential quadratic programming method, we derive the optimal solution for the current control scenario we studied in this work. Simulation results show that our <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> control scheme {{can significantly}} reduce the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> and distribution transformer losses. We also present some interesting observations on the SVC's capability and its significant impact on the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> and energy efficiency of a system.

40|$|Abstract The {{problem of}} <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> {{compensation}} {{has to be}} addressed in Wind Energy integrated weak micro-grids. This study analyses two types of techniques possible for implementation of <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> compensation by drawing a comparative research of their application on the same wind energy conversion system. The hybrid micro-grid considered in the study comprises a synchronous diesel generator and an inverter-based wind generator. The results and analysis are conducted by time-domain simu-lations using MATLAB/Simulink software. The use of electronic power converters that also act as an active <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> compensator or a zig-zag transformer con-nected with the load mitigates the problem of <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> compensation to a large extent. The voltage unbalance factor is also significantly reduced due to <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> compensation and power quality is enhanced. The results provide the actual operational limits possible under the set of given constraints...|$|R
40|$|When {{the voltage}} source is not {{balanced}} for three-phase four-wire circuits, instantaneous {{compensation for the}} instantaneous reactive power does not eliminate the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> on the source side. In fact, when the zero-phase voltage of the source exists, none of the present compensation strategies can guarantee the instantaneous elimination of the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> in three-phase four-wire systems. Two approaches are distinguished in this paper for instantaneous compensation. The first eliminates the instantaneous reactive <b>current,</b> thus <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> can still flow. The second eliminates the instantaneous pseudo-reactive current, so that the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> component is compensated. In the latter case, a new control strategy is designed to avoid instantaneous power flowing through the compensator. It provides flexibility in compensating for the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> in a three-phase four-wire system including the zero-sequence voltage.

The PV VSI is designed to control active power at unity power factor (p. f) with additional improvement in the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> controller using the load generated <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> as a direct reference. As, inherently, most of the three-phase four-wire LV distribution networks exhibit voltage unbalance characteristics due to divergent load connection types such as single- and three-phase loads, the independent control over <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC) becomes imperative especially for decentralized controllers. The improved performance of the <b>neutral</b> <b>current</b> controller both at customer's installation and at the distribution transformer (DT) terminal is investigated by implementing the designed PV-VSI with actual Australian (Energex) LV network model in PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.
