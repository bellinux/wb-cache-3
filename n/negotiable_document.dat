40|$|The {{legal nature}} {{of the bill of}} lading as a <b>negotiable</b> <b>document</b> of title has allowed it to provide the basis of a system in which bankers provide credit for the {{financing}} of international sales contracts on the strength of the security afforded by the goods represented in the bill. The sea waybill has appeared as a substitute for the bill of lading and, despite its nature as a nonnegotiable document, it can be employed in a manner which allows it to provide collateral security to banks. Multimodal transport documents which may be issued in negotiable or non-negotiable form assume the same legal role as the bill oflading or sea waybill respectively. The inclusion of specific articles in the 1993 Revision of the UCP relating to non-negotiable sea waybills and multimodal transport documents affirms their acceptability to banks financing international sales contracts under documentary letters of credit.

40|$|It is contended in {{this thesis}} that the {{introduction}} of a legal regime with a rateless structure, subject only to market forces and a rebuttable statutory presumption as to where the rate line of conscience should be drawn, can provide a solution if the rate charged by pawnbrokers is to be regulated. The thesis also shows that a uniform pawn ticket issued as a <b>negotiable</b> <b>document</b> of title, and transferable by special indorsement, can provide a solution to problems caused by current activities related to pawn ticket transactions. After having identified the legal issues requiring attention in the introductory chapter, and after a short historical review of the development of institutional pawnshops and the nature of usury law, the thesis takes a comparative approach to the question, examining the legal protection available to consumer users of pawnshops in France, the Netherlands, Germany, England, USA, Australia, Norway, Denmark and Finland, in order to cast the divergent interests into bold relief and suggest how those interests can be reconciled. The thesis will then concentrate on the competing policy arguments for and against usury control. The parties’ needs addressed and the methods utilized by legislation to meet such needs are identified and evaluated. The material differences distinguishing pawn tickets from other documents and instruments relating to personal property are next highlighted, and legislation with possible application to pawn tickets canvassed. The inadequacies of existing law are analysed in detail, and certain assumptions regarding the applicability of existing law are challenged. The thesis goes on to consider the question, drawing on historical and comparative experience, whether the law could be developed to control the exercise of pawn ticket functions. The findings of the study are then summarized and a series of recommendations made...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} {{situation}} and potential success in legal practice of one major invention in the maritime industry, namely, the electronic bill of lading by taking into consideration developments of the relevant regulatory frameworks through time by some few important institutions involved including CMI (Comité Maritime International), Bolero (Bills of Lading Electronic Registry Organisation) and UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law). The thesis focuses on analysing effectiveness of the legal attempts of these actors in supporting the electronic bill to be accepted as fully legally enforceable as in the paper-based case. In doing so, {{emphasis is placed on}} the question of how fundamental legal requirements of the traditional bill can also be met by this paperless replacement. The thesis argues that the trendy bill concerned shall be regarded as the electronic equivalent of the paper bill since, based on some of the recent guidelines and provisions offered, it certainly satisfies such traditional requirements. That is, the electronic bill of lading is, too, a legal document that can be signed and capable of performing all basic traditional functions which include being a receipt for the goods, being evidence of terms in a contract of carriage and, more sophisticatedly, being a <b>negotiable</b> <b>document</b> of title. The thesis points out that the CMI model fails to stay attractive for long as it is associated with a number of problems, while the Bolero system that follows, though imperfect, appears to be a better alternative for the contracting parties wishing to use the bill of lading in electronic form. UNCITRAL not only provides essential legal guidelines like Model Laws on Electronic Commerce and on Electronic Signatures, but also is developing Draft Convention on the Carriage of Goods [Wholly or Partly] [By Sea] purporting in part to build a thorough framework governing and help promoting the use of the electronic bill of lading. This great prospect expected by many to be a dream legal solution for the electronic bill has, however, some room for improvement as suggested in the thesis...|$|E

By {{the end of}} 1959, the first cheques had been printed using MICR. The ABA adopted MICR as its standard because machines could read MICR accurately, and MICR could be printed using existing technology. In addition, MICR remained machine readable, even through overstamping, marking, mutilation and more.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{preliminary}} {{survey of the}} money market in Calcutta during the early nineteenth century, focusing particularly {{on the role of}} salt bills. Salt bills, known as chars and rowanas, were issued by the government, from which the holder was able to claim the quantity of salt specified in the bills at government salt warehouses. Since the government, the sole supplier of salt, guaranteed that salt bills were redeemable for salt, salt bills became one of the major <b>negotiable</b> <b>documents</b> in the money market, especially among native bankers and merchants. In the late 1820 s, when forged salt bills became a serious problem in the market, the government tried to remove any uncertainty about salt bills. However, the government's assurances did not work well, and the role of salt bills in the money market had declined rapidly by the mid- 1830 s. ...|$|R

So the prediction of stocks index {{is very important for}} stockholders to earn the highest return from their investment. The changes of stock market influence by several factors such as political, economical and social factors and maybe, using the classic methods for stock market prediction result in exact results. since, the intelligent method have this capability that consider the complex effects of above factors in the analysis, so we can use them in stock index prediction. Therefore, we can use the artificial neural network for predicting and the genetic algorithm for optimizing the input variable in the neural network. This research has studied the efficiency of compound model, artificial neural network and genetic algorithm for predicting the stock index of Tehran <b>negotiable</b> <b>documents</b> bourse. For this reason, the economical data such as open market price of foreign exchange, bubble of coin price, the price of each ounce of gold in international market and the price of OPEK oil basket as inputs of compound model and total index of bource that compared with outputs of compound model, and have collected from 23 st of September in 2010 until 18 th of March in 2013 daily.
