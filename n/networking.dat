5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded <b>networking.</b> Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs almost {{ten times as}} fast in terms of floating point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber flywheel power storage can keep the <b>networking</b> and storage infrastructure running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators fire up, taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. They can provide power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the <b>networking</b> and storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{redesign}} of the <b>networking</b> architecture, IPv6 has been incorporated into the operating system, {{and a number of}} performance improvements have been introduced, such as TCP window scaling. Prior versions of Windows typically needed third-party wireless <b>networking</b> software to work properly; this is no longer the case with Windows Vista, as it includes comprehensive wireless <b>networking</b> support.|$|E
25|$|Boxee {{can also}} export a user's media {{activity}} feed to other social <b>networking</b> {{services such as}} FriendFeed, Twitter, and Tumblr. The list of connections to such supported third-party social <b>networking</b> services is currently small, and this feature is one-way only, (it is for example not yet possible to monitor Twitter feeds from within Boxee), but this type of third-party integration {{is different from the}} way content sources are treated. Through FriendFeed, Twitter, and Tumblr it is then possible from those third-party social <b>networking</b> services for a user to choose to post the Boxee activity feed to social <b>networking</b> sites such as Facebook, (currently through FriendFeed, Twitter, and Tumblr apps for Facebook).|$|E
25|$|Radisys {{supports}} two markets: communications <b>networking</b> {{and commercial}} systems. The latter makes products {{for use in}} the testing, medical imaging, defense, and industrial automation fields. For example, end-products that Radisys' is a supplier to original equipment manufacturers include items such as MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment, logic analyzers, and items used in semiconductor manufacturing.

25|$|Other {{services}} provided by the kernel such as <b>networking</b> are implemented in user-space programs referred to as servers. Servers allow the operating system to be modified by simply starting and stopping programs. For a machine without <b>networking</b> support, for instance, the <b>networking</b> server is not started. The task of {{moving in and out}} of the kernel to move data between the various applications and servers creates overhead which is detrimental to the efficiency of micro kernels in comparison with monolithic kernels.|$|E

25|$|UTP {{cable is}} also the most common cable used in {{computer}} <b>networking.</b> Modern Ethernet, the most common data <b>networking</b> standard, can use UTP cables. Twisted pair cabling is often used in data networks for short and medium length connections because of its relatively lower costs compared to optical fiber and coaxial cable.|$|E

25|$|As social <b>networking</b> {{sites have}} risen in {{popularity}} {{over the past}} years, people have been spending an excessive amount {{of time on the}} Internet in general and social <b>networking</b> sites in specific. This has led researchers to debate the establishment of Internet addiction as an actual clinical disorder.|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{and social}} <b>networking</b> leaks {{are one of}} the issues facing {{traditional}} advertising. Video and print ads are often leaked to the world via the Internet earlier than they are scheduled to premiere.

25|$|Research has {{provided}} us with mixed results {{as to whether or}} not a person's involvement in social <b>networking</b> can affect their feelings of loneliness. Studies have indicated that how a person chooses to use social <b>networking</b> can change their feelings of loneliness in either a negative or positive way. Some companies with mobile workers have encouraged their workers to use social <b>networking</b> to feel connected, educators are using it to keep connected with their students and individuals are benefiting from social <b>networking</b> to keep connect with already close relationships that they've developed under circumstances that would otherwise make it difficult to do so. Each social <b>networking</b> user is able to create a community that centers around a personal identity they choose to create online. In his book Digital Identities: Creating and Communicating the Online Self, Rob Cover argues that social networking's foundation in Web 2.0, high-speed <b>networking</b> shifts online representation to one which is both visual and relational to other people, complexifying the identity process for younger people and creating new forms of anxiety. In 2016, news reports stated that excessive usage of SNS sites may be associated with an increase in the rates of depression, to almost triple the rate for non-SNS users. Experts worldwide have said that 2030 people who use SNS more have higher levels of depression than those who use SNS less.|$|E
25|$|From 1973 to 1974, Cerf's <b>networking</b> {{research}} group at Stanford worked out {{details of the}} idea, resulting in the first TCP specification.
