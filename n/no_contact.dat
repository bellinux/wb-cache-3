5|$|Following his resignation, Overton had <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the}} military. This {{continued}} {{for several decades}} until Overton reconnected with fellow West Point graduate Lieutenant General Charles G. Cleveland, and he discovered the Air Force had established Air Force Review Boards Agency to review incidents and determine if individuals had been unfairly denied medals. In the meantime, Overton became a successful businessman, owning and operating several companies.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1943, Haruna again left Truk {{as part of}} an {{even larger}} force—five battleships, three fleet carriers, eight heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and {{numerous}} destroyers—in response to American raids on Wake Island. When <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> was made the force returned to Truk on 26 October 1943. On 16 December 1943, she arrived at Sasebo for refits and inland-sea training.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1943, Kongō again left Truk {{as part of}} {{a larger}} task force {{consisting}} of five battleships, three fleet carriers, eight heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and numerous destroyers.

5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he {{is believed to have}} had little interest in anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The format {{remained}} largely unchanged from previous seasons. HouseGuests were incarcerated in the Big Brother House with <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> {{to and from}} the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests took part in several compulsory challenges that determined who would win food, luxuries and power in the House. The winner of the Head of Household competition was immune from nominations and was instructed to nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. After a HouseGuest became Head of Household he or she was ineligible {{to take part in the}} next Head of Household competition.|$|E
5|$|With his {{division}} disintegrating and the Germans advancing—German troops captured Kilkis by 23:00 {{and entered}} Thessaloniki at 8:00 in the morning—Maj. Gen.

50|$|Planned {{ignoring}} is {{a strategy}} where a person gives no outward sign of recognizing a behavior, such as <b>no</b> eye <b>contact,</b> <b>no</b> verbal response and no physical response to the person seeking attention. The desired consequence of attention-seeking behavior is receiving attention in some form (positive or negative) from another person; when attention-seeking behavior <b>no</b> longer <b>contacts</b> attention, it will eventually cease.|$|R
5|$|As the Dorniers passed Sheerness, the {{anti-aircraft}} defences opened fire {{to protect the}} naval yard at Chatham, Kent. Along the south bank of the Thames Estuary 15 gun positions fired six 4.5in of 3.7in heavy shells. The German bombers opened up a little, to spread out. The cloud over the target ruined the German bomb run, and some bombers began the return trip with their loads still on board. While crossing the coast over Deal, Kent, three attacked the Royal Marines barracks there. They continued back across the Channel, having made <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> with enemy fighters.|$|E
5|$|At Kalai the {{battalion}} {{moved into the}} Kamandran Mission where they received intelligence reports of a force of about 200 Japanese occupying a position at Gogbulo creek. Fighting patrols were sent out, but <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> was made, although evidence of occupation was found indicating that the Japanese were moving back to a defensive position {{to the north of}} Mavelo river. Before they could launch an assault, however, {{the battalion}} was relieved by the 19th Battalion and on 28 February the 19th crossed the Mavelo. Following this the Japanese withdrew back towards the mountains around the Waitavalo and Tol Plantations, and in early March an attempt was made to force a crossing on the Wulwut river. After initially being turned back by intense Japanese mortar and machine-gun fire, the 19th made a successful second attempt, forcing the Japanese back further towards Mount Sugi and Bacon Hill.|$|E
5|$|Guest and Knowles were {{summoned to}} the Defence Department and told to stop recruiting. The Administration had decided to raise a {{regiment}} in Rhodesia, and Guest joined the Salisbury battalion of the 1st Rhodesian Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant. The battalion was sent to South Africa to assist in suppressing the 1914 Maritz Rebellion by Boers opposed to fighting for Britain. It was not, however, deployed against the Rebellion and when it ended the battalion was sent, with the Imperial Light Horse, to reinforce the South African troops in the South-West Africa Campaign in German South-West Africa, present-day Namibia. They landed at Lambert's Bay on Christmas morning 1914, but made <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> with the enemy until they were sent to Swakopmund.|$|E
50|$|On station by 30 April, she patrolled on {{the surface}} with <b>no</b> <b>contacts,</b> through 2 June. On the morning of 3 June, word of the bombing of Dutch Harbor was received. Aerial contacts, both {{friendly}} and enemy became frequent; but the submarine was not attacked.|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} the {{southern}} Sudan had almost <b>no</b> <b>contacts</b> with the northern Sudan, {{until the beginning of}} Egyptian rule(also known as Turkish Sudan or Turkiyah) in the north in the early 1820s and the subsequent expansion of the slave trade into the south.|$|R
5000|$|... 10 May 1944: VB-142 {{was ordered}} to Hato Field, Curaçao, for work with VS-37 in patrolling the {{immediate}} area surrounding the islands. Operational control over the squadron was exercised by FAW-11. <b>No</b> <b>contacts</b> were made during this period, and no vessels or convoys were attacked.|$|R
5|$|In late September, the Italian fleet, {{including}} Fiume, made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta, {{but it made}} <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the}} British ships. Fiume was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto {{on the night of}} 1112 November, but she was not attacked in the raid. Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day, in an engagement that lasted for about an hour. Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance. The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by Fiume or her sister Pola.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September he was {{formally}} appointed as unit adjutant, swiftly {{followed by a}} temporary promotion to captain. He formally {{changed his name to}} Wilder-Neligan in October, and remained at Anzac until November, after which the battalion was evacuated to Egypt. During its time in Egypt, the 9th Battalion was stationed for a period on the front line in the desert near the Suez Canal. On one occasion, an Ottoman patrol was seen, and the adventurous Wilder-Neligan asked to be allowed to take out a patrol on camels to cut them off. With certain restrictions, this was permitted, but <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> with the enemy occurred. In March 1916, he relinquished his post of adjutant, and was substantively promoted to captain before the battalion left Alexandria for France and the Western Front {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{all work}} units were {{continuously}} beaten by {{the guards and}} often shot or hanged at the gallows. Only the strongest men were selected from new arrivals daily to obtain the necessary replacements. There were other work details which had <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> with the transports: the Holzfällerkommando ("woodcutter unit") cut and chopped firewood, and the Tarnungskommando ("disguise unit") camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 Wohnlager residential compound contained barracks for about 700 Sonderkommandos which, when combined with the 300 Totenjuden living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.|$|E

5|$|Operation Pamphlet, {{also called}} Convoy Pamphlet, was a World War II convoy {{operation}} conducted during January and February 1943 {{to transport the}} Australian Army's 9th Division home from Egypt. The convoy involved five transports, which were protected from Japanese warships during their trip across the Indian Ocean and along the Australian coastline by several Allied naval task forces. The 9th Division boarded the ships during late January 1943, and the convoy operation began on 4 February. <b>No</b> <b>contact</b> was made between Allied and Japanese ships, and the 9th Division arrived in Australian ports during late February with no losses from enemy action.|$|E
5|$|The ship saw {{significant}} service {{during the}} First Balkan War of 1912–13. At {{the start of}} the war, Asar-i Tevfik was suffering from boiler trouble, which necessitated repairs that lasted until 9 November. She was then sent to support the Ottoman troops defending the Çatalca Line against Bulgarian troops. She took up a position off Tekirdağ to provide gunfire support. After the Bulgarians occupied the town, she bombarded their positions, but the attack had little effect. The ship was then moved to Büyükçekmece, where she joined the rest of the fleet. They had <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> with Bulgarian forces during this period.|$|E
5|$|While {{covering}} another convoy to Malta on 12October, she {{was damaged}} by near misses from SM.79s based in Sicily. The damage to her aviation fuel system {{was not immediately}} apparent and she covered another convoy later that month. While returning to Alexandria, her aircraft attacked Maltezana seaplane base on Rhodes on 27October. Four of her Swordfish from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing Ground for a night attack on Tobruk harbour. The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250-pound bombs, while the 12 other Swordfish laid mines. On 28October, Eagle {{and the rest of}} the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece, but <b>no</b> <b>contact</b> was made.|$|E
50|$|Tarpon {{began her}} third patrol on 28 March and ended at Pearl Harbor on 17 May with <b>no</b> <b>contacts</b> except a {{hospital}} ship. Her next mission, which took her north of Oahu for defense during the Battle of Midway, lasted only ten days, from 30 May to 9 June; but the submarine <b>contacted</b> <b>no</b> enemy shipping. She was then routed back to San Francisco for an overhaul which was completed on 30 September.|$|R
