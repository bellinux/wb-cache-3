5|$|Bonfiglioli often bought {{material}} from writers without an established reputation; he did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> special effort to acquire stories from well-known names.

Despite breaking their transfer record twice (on Xherdan Shaqiri and then Giannelli Imbula), in 2015–16, Stoke did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> progression and finished in ninth position for a third season running.

5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>any</b> sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E

5|$|Never Say Never Again had {{its origins}} in the early 1960s {{following}} {{the controversy over the}} 1961 Thunderball novel, which led to Kevin McClory becoming producer of the Eon Productions film of the same name.
