5|$|During the 1990s, {{the company}} {{was the subject of}} {{controversy}} for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African-American customers and female employees. In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented <b>non-discrimination</b> policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's <b>non-discrimination</b> policy in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{the largest}} M.D. {{organization}} in the U.S., the American Medical Association, adopted a fee <b>non-discrimination</b> policy discouraging differential pricing based on attendance of an M.D. or D.O. medical school.|$|E
5|$|Kuwait {{interprets the}} <b>non-discrimination</b> clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within its {{constitution}} and laws, and reserves {{the right to}} social security to apply only to Kuwaitis. It also reserves the right to forbid strikes.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{ensures that}} all {{citizens}} and companies from signatory countries receive equal {{rights of access}} and residence. Norway may not discriminate—based on nationality—the rights to fish, hunt and conduct mining, trade, industry and maritime activity. However, these activities may be limited by non-discriminatory legislation. Thus Norway is permitted to place regulations and prohibitions on basis of other objective criteria, or ban certain activities altogether or in certain geographic areas. The <b>non-discrimination</b> clause also does not ban nationality discrimination elsewhere than in economic activity. Specifically, research and scientific activities do not fall under the <b>non-discrimination</b> clause.|$|E
5|$|Bangladesh {{interprets the}} {{self-determination}} clause in Article 1 as applying {{in the historical}} context of colonialism. It also reserves the right to interpret the labour rights in Articles 7 and 8 and the <b>non-discrimination</b> clauses of Articles 2 and 3 {{within the context of}} its constitution and domestic law.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Cracker Barrel paid a $2million {{settlement}} {{to end a}} lawsuit alleging race and sexual harassment at three Illinois restaurants. Cracker Barrel stores subsequently began displaying a sign in the front foyer explaining the company's <b>non-discrimination</b> policy, and added to its website and menu the policy and details {{on how to make}} a complaint.|$|E
5|$|Spafford {{supported}} {{many of the}} movement's causes such {{as equal}} pay for equal work and <b>non-discrimination</b> in hiring practices when both individuals were equally qualified. She was not {{a supporter of the}} ERA, but rather believed that the same results could be achieved through work at the local and state levels.|$|E
5|$|McLeod is openly lesbian. She {{came out}} {{publicly}} during a CBC interview following {{the controversy surrounding}} the 2014 Sochi Olympics and Russia's gay propaganda laws. She was {{among a group of}} athletes who called for a change {{in the language of the}} Olympic Charter and host-city contract to include <b>non-discrimination</b> of sexual orientation. She also served on the Canadian Athletes' Commission as the LGBT representative.|$|E
5|$|Ryan opposes {{same-sex}} marriage, {{had previously}} supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed {{the repeal of}} the don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against a bill that would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment <b>Non-Discrimination</b> Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{was signed}} on 9 February 1920 and came into effect on 14 August 1925. The treaty defines Svalbard as all islands, islets and skerries from 74° to 81° north latitude, and from 10° to 35° east longitude. It secures full Norwegian {{sovereignty}} over the archipelago, but contains several restrictions: peaceful {{use of the}} islands, the <b>non-discrimination</b> of citizens and companies of signatory countries, the obligation to protect the natural environment and limitations in taxation. The treaty has 39 signatories.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the <b>non-discrimination</b> policy is the Mining Code of 7 August 1925. It is {{uncertain}} if the code is internationally binding, or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E
5|$|McGovern has {{a pro-choice}} record on abortion. He {{voted against the}} Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in October 2003 and the Unborn Victims of Violence Act in February 2004. He {{supports}} stem cell research, having {{voted in favor of}} the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act in 2005, 2007, and 2009. He voted for the Employment <b>Non-Discrimination</b> Act of 2007, which would have prevented employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation. He voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have constitutionally outlawed same-sex marriage, in 2004 and 2006, and co-sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act of 2009, which would allow the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Equality {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and <b>non-discrimination,</b> and Articles 17–18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as equal protection of the law to all persons within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E
5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment <b>Non-Discrimination</b> Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
5|$|The PTC's {{response}} to the strike was anemic and was interpreted by some contemporary observers and later historians as tacitly supporting the strike. Arthur Mitten, chairman of the company's Industrial Relations Division, stopped by the Luzerne carbarn and asked the workers to return to work. Subsequently, he suggested that WMC temporarily suspend the <b>non-discrimination</b> order, and even brought a pile of freshly printed fliers with a suspension announcement to the WMC offices. However, the WMC officials refused to approve suspension of the FEPC order and Mitten's suspension fliers were not distributed. On the morning of August 1, PTC officials immediately shut down the high-speed lines, even before the strike had spread, and instructed the company supervisors to stop selling tickets. The PTC left its carbarns open, which allowed the strikers to use the carbarns as rallying points and coordinating centers for their activities. The company also cancelled the regularly scheduled meeting of its executive committee, where the {{response to}} the strike could have been discussed, and refused to join the TWU in a radio broadcast urging the strikers to return to work.|$|E
5|$|The drive {{towards a}} boycott {{was fueled by}} {{the large number of}} African nations which became {{independent}} in the late 1950s and early 1960s. To prevent the new nations from overwhelming the ISFs, Brundage proposed that the federations adopt weighted voting systems to allow earlier members to wield disproportionate influence, which some did. By 1962, with the suspension of South Africa from FIFA (the association football governing body), Brundage had come around to the position that South Africa's racist policies were inconsistent with the ideals of the Olympic movement. At the 1963 IOC session in Baden-Baden (moved there from Nairobi when Kenyan officials refused to issue visas to South African representatives), the IOC voted to suspend South Africa from the Olympics unless its NOC and government adopted <b>non-discrimination</b> policies regarding Olympic selection. This did not come to pass, and South Africa did not participate in 1964. In 1968, Brundage and the IOC invited a South African team (supposedly to be multiracial) to the Mexico City Games, but under a threatened boycott and with evidence of minimal South African compliance, withdrew it.|$|E

25|$|On February 2, 2005, Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights also {{suggested}} that the Identity Cards Act 2006 might contravene Article 8 of the European Convention (the right to respect for private life) and Article 14 (the right to <b>non-discrimination).</b>|$|E
25|$|The General Law of Education (LGE) promulgated in 2009, {{included}} {{the principles of}} <b>non-discrimination</b> and respect to diversity.

25|$|The Czech {{legislation}} {{finds its}} constitutional {{basis in the}} principles of equality and <b>non-discrimination</b> contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms. From there, we can trace two basic lines of protection against hate-motivated incidents: one passes through criminal law, the other through civil law.|$|E
25|$|National Breast Cancer Coalition: This large {{umbrella}} organization played key roles in several prominent pieces of American legislation, {{such as the}} creation of the United States Department of Defense's Breast Cancer Research Program, genetic <b>non-discrimination</b> laws, and the patients' bill of rights.

25|$|This {{issue was}} settled decisively in 1993 (i.e., {{two years before}} {{directive}} 93/98/EC became effective) by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in {{what became known as}} the Phil Collins decision. In that case, Phil Collins sued a German phonogram distributor who was marketing records of a concert Collins had given in the U.S. German law of that time granted German performers full neighbouring rights, and in particular the right to prohibit the distribution of recordings made without their consent, regardless of the place the performance had occurred. At the same time, German law granted the same right to foreign performers only for their performances that had occurred in Germany. The ECJ decided on October 20, 1993 that this was a violation of the <b>non-discrimination</b> clause of article 7 of the EC treaty. It also clarified that the <b>non-discrimination</b> clause was indeed applicable to copyright.|$|E
25|$|In Chile, the {{relationship}} between suppliers of goods or services and consumers is regulated by Law No. 19,496 on the Protection of the Rights of Consumers. Article 3 states that are basic rights of the consumer, among others, the right to <b>non-discrimination.</b> The anti-discrimination law enacted in 2012 defines discrimination and includes protection against it on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.|$|E
25|$|In a September 2007 Republican primary presidential debate, Paul {{answered}} yes to {{the question}} of whether he would veto the Employment <b>Non-Discrimination</b> Act, which would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation by employers with at least 15 employees. This is consistent with his views of opposing any private sector anti-discrimination laws and his belief in freedom of association.|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{definition}} of linguistic rights {{is the right}} of individuals to use their language {{with other members of}} their linguistic group, regardless of the status of their language. They evolve from general human rights, in particular: <b>non-discrimination,</b> freedom of expression, right to private life, and the right of members of a linguistic minority to use their language with other members of their community.|$|E
