50|$|The <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> are genes {{encoding}} enzymes {{involved in}} the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen into a form of nitrogen available to living organisms.

The <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> are found in both free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and in symbiotic bacteria associated with various plants.

5000|$|Cyanobacteria are {{photosynthetic}} prokaryotes {{that have}} existed on Earth {{for an estimated}} 2.7 billion years. The ability of cyanobacteria to produce oxygen initiated {{the transition from a}} planet consisting of high levels of carbon dioxide and little oxygen, to what has been called the Great Oxygenation Event where large amounts of oxygen gas were produced. Cyanobacteria have colonized a wide diversity of habitats, including fresh and salt water ecosystems, and most land environments. Phylogenetically, Synechocystis branches off later in the cyanobacterial evolutionary tree, further from the ancestral root (Gloeobacter violaceus). Synechocystis, which is non-diazotrophic, is closely related to another model organism, Cyanothece ATCC 51442, which is a diazotroph. Thus, it has been proposed that Synechocystis originally possessed the ability to fix nitrogen gas, but lost the genes required for a fully functioning nitrogen fixation (<b>nif)</b> <b>gene</b> cluster.|$|E
50|$|Biosynthesis of FeMoco is a {{complicated}} process that requires several <b>Nif</b> <b>gene</b> products, specifically those of nifS, nifQ, nifB, nifE, nifN, nifV, nifH, nifD, and nifK (expressed as the proteins NifS, NifU, etc.). FeMoco assembly is proposed to be initiated by NifS and NifU which mobilize Fe and sulfide into small Fe-S fragments. These fragments are transferred to the NifB scaffold and arranged into a Fe7MoS9C cluster before transfer to the NifEN protein (encoded by nifE and nifN) and rearranged before delivery to the MoFe protein. Several other factors participate in the biosynthesis. For example, NifV is the homocitrate synthase that supplies homocitrate to FeMoco. NifV, a protein factor, is proposed {{to be involved in}} the storage and/or mobilization of Mo. Fe protein is the electron donor for MoFe protein6. These biosynthetic factors have been elucidated and characterized with the exact functions and sequence confirmed by biochemical, spectroscopic, and structural analyses.|$|E

The transconjugant strains were placed into three groups based on their plasmid profiles and symbiotic properties. The first group harbored a plasmid similar in size to pJB 5 JI (130 megadaltons) and lacked a plasmid corresponding to pRtT 37 a. These strains formed effective nodules on peas but were unable to nodulate clover and lacked the R. trifolii <b>nif</b> <b>genes.</b> This suggests that genes essential for clover nodulation as well as the R. trifolii <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> are located on pRtT 37 a and have been deleted. The second group harbored hybrid plasmids formed from pRtT 37 a and pJB 5 JI which ranged in size from 140 to ca. 250 megadaltons.

50|$|In most bacteria, {{regulation}} of <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> transcription {{is done by}} the nitrogen sensitive NifA protein.

NifL inhibits NifA activity resulting in the inhibition of nitrogenase formation. NifL is regulated by the products of glnD and glnK.

These {{results indicate that the}} regulation of <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> transcription by fixed nitrogen is different from the regulation by oxygen. Under anaerobic conditions, <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> transcription in both R. capsulata and Klebsiella pneumoniae is specifically prevented by inhibitors of DNA gyrase [DNA topoisomerase type II (ATP-hydrolyzing), EC 5. 99. 1. 3].

L. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 2077 - 2081]. In view of these results, we suggest that the control of <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> transcription in response to oxygen is determined by the action of DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase I.
