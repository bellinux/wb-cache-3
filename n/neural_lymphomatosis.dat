The microscopical findings which were observed in all the present cases may be summarized as follows : Hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissue a. "Abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissue b. "Immaturation" c. "Maturation"[d. Lymphatic tissue outside the question] In the first place, the authors will explain the terms used. "Abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissue This is hyperplasia of the lymphatic tissues in which the principal cellular element was composed of large-pale-nuclear cells repeatedly called in the preceding descriptions. The cells was not identical with lymphoblasts, and the authors consider that the cells may be appropriately called germ cells in the lymphatic tissues. The cells of this kind have frequently been called lymphoid cells in the literature (v. discussion). "Immaturation" and "Maturation" Both terms indicate such histological features as the abnormally hyperplastic lymphatic tissues were composed of large-pale-nuclear cells and had a neoplastic character. In "maturation", it is characteristic that the hyperplastic tissues show histological features suggestive of the lymph follicles (v. discussion). Next, the authors illustrate the findings in the three groups. In group 1 (Chart 1) which includes 123 cases, 6 were cases of "abnormal hyperplasia" of the lymphatic tissues, which were only in the chicken stage. Two cases of "immaturation" and one of "maturation" were detected only in the adult stage. In the final experimental phase, no abnormal cases were detected. In general, the same tendency could be also observed in groups 2 and 3 (Charts 2 and 3). From all of the cases illustrated, also, one case of <b>neural</b> <b>lymphomatosis</b> from the December cases of group 1,one case of erythroblastosis from the June cases in the terminal phase of the experiment in group 2,and two cases of <b>neural</b> <b>lymphomatosis</b> from the October cases of group 3 were also detected. Other than these, there were no remarkable infectious diseases in cases which died or were killed by reason of accidents...|$|E
