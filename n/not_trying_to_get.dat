25|$|Radcliffe has {{advocated}} {{a system where}} first time offenders are banned {{for four years and}} any future offense for life. However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson learned. When Marion Jones admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.|$|E

[...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. <b>Not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E

In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what if I need that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not see any of the movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E

The alkali dust cut through our lips, it persecuted our eyes, it ate through the delicate membranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleeding--and truly and seriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared, and left the desert trip nothing but a harsh reality--a thirsty, sweltering, longing, hateful reality! ...|$|E
