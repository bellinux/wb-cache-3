Ozone itself is a greenhouse gas, causing warming, and reductions in biomass and carbon sequestration caused by ozone provide a further indirect warming effect.

How to reduce <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emission {{is important to}} protect the environment. At the present work, a reduction mechanism based on a detailed chemical reaction kinetics mechanism, Gri_Mech 3. 0 was adopted to analyze <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> formation in a CH 4 /air laminar premixed and turbulent diffusion flames, a two dimensional turbulent diffusion flame was simulated with the EDC model. Parameters were obtained, including flame temperature, burning velocity and mass fraction of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides.</b> The results of laminar premixed flame show that <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> emission mainly comes from the thermal and prompt NO mechanisms. A large amount of free radicals O, H and OH produced by combustion processes provide reactants for the reactions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> formation.

40|$|The use of lean <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> traps is an {{attractive}} solution for reducing the tailpipe emissions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> in vehicles with diesel engines. During the operation, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> are stored on the surfaces of lean <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> traps, and regeneration of lean <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> traps is required for proper operation. In this paper, two in-cylinder combustion strategies for regeneration of lean <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> traps were assessed for a high-speed direct-injection diesel engine. In particular, a delayed and extended main strategy and a premixed compression ignition strategy were studied through experiments and simulations. The experimental {{data were collected from}} a 1. 5 l diesel engine to analyze its combustion, exhaust temperature, fuel consumption, and emission characteristics resulting from either the delayed and extended main strategy or the premixed compression ignition strategy. The results indicated that the premixed compression ignition strategy offered a better fuel economy and lower soot and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> emissions, while the delayed and extended main strategy offered a hotter exhaust temperature and higher production rates of reductant species. In addition, a one-dimensional numerical lean <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> trap model was designed and validated to study the efficiency of the surface adsorbents on lean <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> traps for each of these two strategies in terms of a reduction in the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> emissions. The simulation results revealed that both strategies can reach a lean <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> trap efficiency rate of 100 % when the exhaust gas recirculation rate was equal to 30 % but that the lean <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> trap efficiency rate drops when lower exhaust gas recirculation rates were applied. Overall, the results indicated that the premixed compression ignition strategy performed better than the delayed and extended main strategy in terms of the fuel economy and lower tailpipe emissions...|$|R

40|$|The {{removal of}} trace gases from the {{troposphere}} is, in most cases, initialized by reactions with hydroxyl radicals, and {{the products of}} these reactions are eventually deposited on the Earth's surface. The concentration of these hydroxyl radicals is therefore a measure of atmospheric self-cleansing. In theory, hydroxyl-radical concentrations can be enhanced by the recycling {{of some of the}} reaction products. The only known efficient recycling process involves <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> and leads to production of ozone, yet observations in regions with high hydrocarbon and low <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> concentrations show substantially elevated hydroxyl-radical concentrations, up to ten times higher than expected. If we normalize observed hydroxyl-radical concentrations to the maximum achievable in model calculations with variable <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> concentrations, this photochemical coordinate system uncovers a common feature in almost all of these observations: even in the presence of inadequate amounts of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides,</b> hydroxyl-radical concentrations are enhanced to the theoretical maximum obtainable at very much higher <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> concentrations.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} cost savings which {{would result from}} a combined control of emissions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> and ammonia for the cost-effective achievement of nitrogen deposition targets in Europe. Based on the Regional Acidification Information and Simulation (RAINS) model, a framework has been constructed for a simultaneous optimization of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> and ammonia emission reductions using nitrogen depositions from both pollutants as side constraints. The paper first demonstrates that the same nitrogen deposition resulting from the currently committed reductions of emissions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> (without measures for ammonia emissions) can be achieved at only 55 % of the costs if measures for ammonia reduction would also be applied. The analysis shows that no large scale substitutions of reductions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> by ammonia measures occur. The cost savings mainly result from replacing the most expensive (and ineffective) <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> abatement at a few places in Europe with inexpensive ammonia control measures. Consequently, the total level of emissions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> is hardly {{higher than in the}} reference case, but substantial ammonia reductions are implemented lowering total cost.
