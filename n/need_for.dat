Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining.

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{difference}} in <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity among healthy women, women with physical limitations, and Korean immigrant women in the U. S., and a significant association between <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity and other sociodemographic and contextual variables. MethodsHealthy Korean women (n = 53), women with physical limitations (n = 51), and Korean immigrant women in the U. S. (n = 54) were recruited using a convenience sampling method. The settings included cultural centers in Seoul, S University Hospital in Seoul, Korea, and Korean ethnic churches in California. Data on sociodemographic characteristics and <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity were collected using questionnaires. Group difference in <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity and difference in <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity according to sociodemographic and contextual variables were determined. ResultsThere were significant differences in 11 <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity among the three groups (p <. 05). The <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity were significantly different (p <. 05) according to the categories of needs; affiliation, accomplishment and autonomy needs among the three groups. The <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity were significantly different (p <. 05) according to sociodemographic and contextual variables. ConclusionThree groups of women had different <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity, and their <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> physical activity were influenced by multiple factors reflecting their daily lives in immigration transition and health/illness transition...|$|R

40|$|Background Schizophrenia as {{a chronic}} mental {{disorder}} {{not only has}} far-reaching consequences for patients, but also for their family members or other informal caregivers. In this study, we investigated whether <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> care of patients with schizophrenia are related to (negative) consequences for their informal caregivers. Method A total of 287 patients with schizophrenia and their informal caregivers participated in the EPSILON study of schizophrenia in five European countries. Caregiver consequences were measured by the Involvement Evaluation Questionnaire (IEQ) and <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> care by the Camberwell Assessment of Need (CAN). Results Total number of <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> care as well as specific areas of <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> care of patients appeared be only weak predictors of caregiver consequences in terms of explained variance.
