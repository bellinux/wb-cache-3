5|$|Belgian plans did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the {{garrison}} {{of the fort}} and the attached defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and {{the garrison}} ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link up with other Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Commission: In {{a report}} on de facto couples {{presented}} to the Justice Minister in May 2006, the Irish Human Rights Commission evaluated international standards in dealing with unmarried couples, and assessed the changes needed in Irish law from a human rights perspective.

The IHRC has also released {{a report on}} the civil partnership scheme in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, {{under the door}} of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do <b>not</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> it {{to be used by}} regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves and to provide a connection to the Jamaica subway yard. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full capacity of the line south of 63rd Street to be used. Plans include provisions for an extension north under Second Avenue past 125th Street to the Bronx, and an extension south to Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, all twelve T2000 {{units were}} taken out of service, before {{the last of the}} much older T1300. Kollektivtransportproduksjon, the {{successor}} of Oslo Sporveier, stated that procuring spare parts was becoming nearly impossible and that the small size of the series forced high maintenance costs. The initial orders for MX3000 trains did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so they can run for 15 more years at NOK50 million. Alternatively, the city council has been recommended by Kollektivtransportproduksjon to purchase 15 new MX3000 three-car trains for NOK250 million.|$|E

5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did <b>not</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that every one of the traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E

The newly formed party Bulgaria without Censorship was among the main organizers of the citizen gatherings.|$|E
