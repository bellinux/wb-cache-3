500|$|A melancholy love song, its lyrics {{depict a}} woman torn between love and ambition. [...] "West Coast" [...] {{also serves as}} a {{dedication}} to Del Rey's California hometown, and elicits imagery from its titular location. In the song, she sings about leaving a lover for the Californian promise of fame, and emphasizes on a gulf between a sweetly uncomplicated romance and a boozily dysfunctional relationship. Similarly to her previous works, the lyrics are both specific and vague, and complement the track's [...] "dreamlike" [...] sonics. [...] "West Coast" [...] sets up a disunity between form and content, and though a love song, its sound is more reminiscent to that of a breakup song. It was also noted that the lyrics depict a vivid picture of teenage summer memories and forgotten romance. Comparing the track's lyrical content to that of Sonic Youth's [...] "Superstar" [...] (1994), Grantland's Molly Lambert analyzed: [...] "While Born to Die–era Lana often displayed a preening 'please <b>notice</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Producer!' energy, the Lana of 'West Coast' sounds like a starlet struggling not to become disaffected with show business after feeling her way through a few too many casting-couch sessions, still hoping that big break might be on the horizon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cuzzoni's {{arrival in}} the English capital was keenly {{anticipated}} in the press. Though the [...] "London Journal" [...] for 27 October 1722 reported that [...] "Mrs. Cotsona , an extraordinary Italian Lady, ... is expected daily", she apparently found time to marry Pietro Giuseppe Sandoni during her journey, and did not make her debut in London until 12 January 1723, creating the role of Teofane in Handel's Ottone at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. To an aria in her role, [...] "Falsa immagine", there is attached a famous story, vividly illustrating both her character {{and that of the}} composer. The part not having been originally intended for her (but perhaps for Maddalena Salvai), at rehearsal she refused to sing this, her first aria. According to the historian John Mainwaring, Handel replied: [...] "Oh! Madame I know well that you are a real she-devil, but I hereby give you <b>notice,</b> <b>me,</b> that I am Beelzebub, the Chief of Devils." [...] Mainwaring continued: [...] "With this, he took her up by the waist, and, if she made any more words, swore that he would fling her out of the window." [...] According to Burney, her singing of this aria [...] "fixed her reputation as an expressive and pathetic singer", and her success was such that the price of half-guinea opera tickets reportedly shot up to four guineas. By the time of her benefit concert only two months later, some noblemen were believed to be giving her fifty guineas a ticket. Her salary was also large: £2000 a season. Her appearance was no recommendation: Burney described her as [...] "short and squat, with a doughy cross face, but fine complexion; ... not a good actress; dressed ill and was silly and fantastical." ...|$|E
60|$|LIZA. I'm no preacher: I don't notice {{things like}} that. I notice that you don't <b>notice</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>noticed</b> <b>me,</b> and I became {{conscious}} that I {{was staring at}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{remember}} it, Mr. Dare; ye're {{the first}} gentleman ever <b>noticed</b> <b>me,</b> and I'm much obliged, {{even if you}} hadn't given me a cent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> talking to him," [...] Kermode replied curtly. [...] "Bring the horse along to Mrs. Jasper's {{as soon as}} you're ready." ...|$|R
60|$|He didn't <b>notice</b> <b>me,</b> {{and yet he}} smiled. I'd {{rather have}} seen him gnash his teeth than smile so.|$|E
60|$|Presently I met another old {{soldier in}} a similar manner. He, too, did not <b>notice</b> <b>me</b> whilst I was passing.|$|E
6000|$|At this M. Nioche {{decided to}} change his attitude. He stooped {{and picked up the}} pug, lifted it to his face and wiped his eyes on its little soft back. [...] "I'm afraid to speak to you," [...] he {{presently}} said, looking over the puppy's shoulder. [...] "I hoped you wouldn't <b>notice</b> <b>me.</b> I should have moved away, but I was afraid that if I moved you would <b>notice</b> <b>me.</b> So I sat very still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You've seen me before, you know,' he said, {{grinning}} slightly. 'Perhaps {{you never}} <b>noticed</b> <b>me.</b> Oh, I'm quite nice looking, {{in a quiet}} way, you know. What--?' ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as Miss Rachel {{left him}} {{eyes to see}} with, Mr. Franklin <b>noticed</b> <b>me.</b> His {{variable}} humour, shifting about everything, had shifted about the Indians already.|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{a quarter}} of an hour ago. I was {{fortunately}} at home. Without speaking to <b>me,</b> without <b>noticing</b> <b>me,</b> she walked upstairs like a person in a dream." ...|$|R
6000|$|JAYSON--[Testily.] I {{have to be}} at the bank, too--and {{you don't}} <b>notice</b> <b>me</b> sleeping. Tell me about Curt. You just left him, didn't you? ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first he}} did not <b>notice</b> <b>me,</b> but he {{advanced}} to my new acquaintance, and gave him, to my astonishment, something very like a blow.|$|E
60|$|I {{began to}} sidle out. They didn't <b>notice</b> <b>me.</b> They {{had moved to}} a settee, and Edwin seemed to be telling his father a funny story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, sisters," [...] said I. The {{two were}} so much {{astonished}} {{that they did not}} return my greeting, and for a few moments scarcely <b>noticed</b> <b>me.</b> Then Sylvia turned.|$|R
60|$|Several times I {{imagined}} {{that a couple}} of the village young men <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> very closely, but I paid no attention and went on my way, never dreaming of what was in store for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Clear out, then," [...] hissed the skipper. [...] "Go {{and send}} the mate to me. Don't hurry. And if anybody <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> come aboard and should ask you who I am, say I'm a pal of yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' petulantly {{returned}} the boy. 'What am I {{that he should}} <b>notice</b> <b>me?</b> It is M. de Ribaumont whom I follow, not him or his cause.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, good evening, Jack! Did {{you finally}} <b>notice</b> <b>me?...</b> I've been riding Pronto, {{the first time}} since he was hurt. Had a lovely ride--up through Sage Valley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been so bad, sir, that I don't think he'd {{speak to}} me, or <b>notice</b> <b>me,</b> or do {{anything}} for me. And he has got a wife, too." ...|$|E
60|$|I obeyed, and had she <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> closely {{she would}} have seen that I was shivering; for her strange {{appearance}} and the total lack of affection in her manner, had filled me with something approaching to horror.|$|R
6000|$|... "Prayers, Miss Colebrook," [...] {{she said}} in her sourest manner. She paused, and <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> {{standing}} under the window. [...] "Prayers, Mr. Lefrank," [...] she added, with a look of devout pity, directed exclusively to my address.|$|R
6000|$|Winifred looked puzzled. [...] "Well," [...] she persisted, [...] "he {{certainly}} bought them, and a fur cap, too. I was in {{the store}} when he did it, though I don't think he <b>noticed</b> <b>me.</b> They were lovely mittens--such a pretty brown fur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mind me," [...] {{she murmured}} behind her handkerchief. [...] "It's very foolish, I know. I was nervous--worried, I suppose; I'll be {{better in a}} moment. Don't <b>notice</b> <b>me,</b> please." ...|$|E
60|$|She did not <b>notice</b> <b>me</b> in {{the shadow}} which the trees cast on the bank. She stood with her arms folded in her cloak, {{looking down at the}} darkening river.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I understand.... I {{tried to}} get to the rear. The pain was terrible. No one seemed to <b>notice</b> <b>me.</b> At last I fell, and--then I slept. I thought it was the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} mind," [...] Agnes said. [...] "When I first went out it seemed dreadful, but when I found that nobody <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> I {{began to be}} {{accustomed}} to it, and as your daughter is dressed as a boy too I shall not mind it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{the brother}} of the lady--you know Mrs Fyne, she knew mother--who was so kind to me. I was staying in the country, in a cottage, with Mr and Mrs Fyne. It was there that we met. He came on a visit. He <b>noticed</b> <b>me.</b> I--well--we are married now." ...|$|R
50|$|Revolving {{the prayer}} wheel with her hands, {{she said her}} prayers with the utmost sincerity. The sound of her prayers came {{from the bottom of}} her heart.  Deeply moved by her sincerity, I turned on the recorder.  She <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> and gently pressed my head to the {{sacrificial}} altar as a blessing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want them}} to <b>notice</b> <b>me,</b> Philip," [...] she murmured. [...] "I {{want you to look}} just for a moment as though you thought me {{the only person in the}} world--as you did once, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is his fit? He travels {{fifty miles}} a week to see the brute, and he pretends not to <b>notice</b> <b>me</b> when he sees me on the road; and I'm as unhappy as he is. Make him take the dog back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because it is {{well that}} you should know it. I {{did not like to}} deceive you, even by secrecy. You will not be hurt. You need not <b>notice</b> <b>me</b> any longer. I shall be lost to you, and that will be all." ...|$|E
60|$|No {{sooner had}} this foolish thought entered my mind than I {{prepared}} to act upon it. We were {{now on the}} corner of Fulton Street, and to cross here was all but impossible. My uncle and Mr. Banker were still in hot dispute, and for an instant neither of them <b>noticed</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I had started, on {{entering}} the room, at the skeleton, and I started once {{more at the}} dog. The old servant <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> each time with a sardonic grin. [...] "Don't be afraid," [...] he said; [...] "one is as dead as the other." [...] With these words, he left me to wash my hands.|$|R
6000|$|To my utter astonishment--for I {{was not yet}} {{accustomed}} to {{the action of the}} Watch [...] "all smiles ceased', (as Browning says) on the four pretty faces, and they all got out pieces of needle-work, and sat down. No one <b>noticed</b> <b>me</b> in the least, as I quietly took a chair and sat down to watch them.|$|R
