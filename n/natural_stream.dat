The new method predicts the longitudinal dispersion coefficient, where more than 90 % calculated values range from 0. 5 to 2 times the observed values. The advantage of the new method {{is that it is}} capable of accurately predicting the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in single-channel <b>natural</b> <b>streams</b> without using detailed dye concentration test data.

25|$|Stream {{channelization}} is {{the process}} of engineering straighter, wider, and deeper stream channels, usually for improved navigation, wetland drainage, and/or faster transport of flood waters downstream. Levees are often constructed in conjunction with channelization to protect human development and agricultural fields from flooding. Riparian vegetation can be directly removed or damaged during and after the channelization process. In addition, channelization and levee construction modify the natural hydrology of a stream system. As water flows through a <b>natural</b> <b>stream,</b> meanders are created when faster flowing water erodes outer banks and slower flowing water deposits sediment on inner banks. Many riparian plant species depend on these areas of new sediment deposition for germination and establishment of seedlings. Channel straightening and levee construction eliminate these areas of deposition, creating unfavorable conditions for riparian vegetation recruitment.|$|E

60|$|It was {{but three}} days after the first meeting between the two cousins, that they were to be seen one evening walking {{together}} {{along the banks of the}} Lurwell, a little river which at Loring sometimes takes the appearance of a canal, and sometimes of a <b>natural</b> <b>stream.</b> But it is commercial, having connection with the Kennet and Avon navigation; and long, slow, ponderous barges, with heavy, dirty, sleepy bargemen, and rickety, ill-used barge-horses, are common in the neighbourhood.

60|$|The little harbour opened {{from the}} sea between towering cliffs, and behind a lonely rock, pierced with many caves and blow-holes through which the sea in storm time sent its thunderous voice, {{together}} with a fountain of drifting spume. Hence, it wound westwards in a serpentine course, guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left and right. These were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and held together with great beams bound with iron bands. Thence, it flowed up the rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old cut out its way amongst the hills. This stream was deep at first, with here and there, where it widened, patches of broken rock exposed at low water, full of holes where crabs and lobsters were to {{be found at the}} ebb of the tide. From amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts, used for warping in the little coasting vessels which frequented the port. Higher up, the stream still flowed deeply, for the tide ran far inland, but always calmly for all the force of the wildest storm was broken below. Some quarter mile inland the stream was deep at high water, but at low tide there were at each side patches of the same broken rock as lower down, through the chinks of which the sweet water of the <b>natural</b> <b>stream</b> trickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed away. Here, too, rose mooring posts for the fishermen's boats. At either side of the river was a row of cottages down almost on the level of high tide. They were pretty cottages, strongly and snugly built, with trim narrow gardens in front, full of old-fashioned plants, flowering currants, coloured primroses, wallflower, and stonecrop. Over the fronts of many of them climbed clematis and wisteria. The window sides and door posts of all were as white as snow, and the little pathway to each was paved with light coloured stones. At some of the doors were tiny porches, whilst at others were rustic seats cut from tree trunks or from old barrels; in nearly every case the window ledges were filled with boxes or pots of flowers or foliage plants.|$|E

60|$|The {{death of}} Antony and Cleopatra {{is a subject}} which has been treated by the {{greatest}} wits of our nation, after Shakespeare; and by all so variously, that their example has given me the confidence to try myself in this bow of Ulysses amongst the crowd of shooters; and, withal, to take my own measures, in aiming at the mark. I doubt not but the same motive has prevailed {{with all of us}} in this attempt; I mean the excellency of the moral: For the chief persons represented, were famous patterns of unlawful love; and their end accordingly was unfortunate. All reasonable men have long since concluded, that the hero of the poem ought not to be a character of perfect virtue, for then he could not, without injustice, be made unhappy; nor yet altogether wicked, because he could not then be pitied. I have therefore steered the middle course; and have drawn the character of Antony as favourably as Plutarch, Appian, and Dion Cassius would give me leave; the like I have observed in Cleopatra. That which is wanting to work up the pity to a greater heighth, was not afforded me by the story; for the crimes of love, which they both committed, were not occasioned by any necessity, or fatal ignorance, but were wholly voluntary; since our passions are, or ought to be, within our power. The fabric of the play is regular enough, as to the inferior parts of it; and the unities of time, place, and action, more exactly observed, than perhaps the English theatre requires. Particularly, the action is so much one, that it is the only of the kind without episode, or underplot; every scene in the tragedy conducing to the main design, and every act concluding with a turn of it. The greatest error in the contrivance seems to be in the person of Octavia; for, though I might use the privilege of a poet, to introduce her into Alexandria, yet I had not enough considered, that the compassion she moved to herself and children, was destructive to that which I reserved for Antony and Cleopatra; whose mutual love being founded upon vice, must lessen the favour of the audience to them, when virtue and innocence were oppressed by it. And, though I justified Antony in some measure, by making Octavia's departure to proceed wholly from herself; yet the force of the first machine still remained; and the dividing of pity, like the cutting of a river into many channels, abated the strength of the <b>natural</b> <b>stream.</b> But this is an objection which none of my critics have urged against me; and therefore I might have let it pass, if I could have resolved to have been partial to myself. The faults my enemies have found, are rather cavils concerning little and not essential decencies; which a master of the ceremonies may decide betwixt us. The French poets, I confess, are strict observers of these punctilios: They would not, for example, have suffered Cleopatra and Octavia to have met; or, if they had met, there must have only passed betwixt them some cold civilities, but no eagerness of repartee, for fear of offending against the greatness of their characters, and the modesty of their sex. This objection I foresaw, {{and at the same time}} contemned; for I judged it both natural and probable, that Octavia, proud of her new-gained conquest, would search out Cleopatra to triumph over her; and that Cleopatra thus attacked, was not of a spirit to shun the encounter: And it is not unlikely, that two exasperated rivals should use such satire as I have put into their mouths; for, after all, though the one were a Roman, and the other a queen, they were both women. It is true, some actions, though natural, are not fit to be represented; and broad obscenities in words, ought in good manners to be avoided: expressions therefore are a modest clothing of our thoughts, as breeches and petticoats are of our bodies. If I have kept myself within the bounds of modesty, all beyond it is but nicety and affectation; which is no more but modesty depraved into a vice. They betray themselves, who are too quick of apprehension in such cases, and leave all reasonable men to imagine worse of them, than of the poet.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} on the Canterbury Plains in New Zealand has lead to {{the degradation}} of <b>natural</b> <b>streams</b> and rivers through lowering of water quality and significant reduction of surface flows {{from the use of}} ground and surface water resources. However, this same agricultural expansion has {{led to the development of}} a network of permanently flowing open water races to supply stock water to farms across the Canterbury Plains. Stock water races form an extensive network, with approximately 6, 500 km of races. Initially I surveyed 62 water races and compared habitat characteristics, water quality, benthic invertebrate and fish communities with nearby <b>natural</b> <b>streams.</b> Races are characterised physically by straight, narrow and shallow channels, and small, uniform substrate. Water races are more turbid than <b>natural</b> <b>streams,</b> and can have high summer temperatures. The benthic macroinvertebrate communities of water races contained a range of taxa, including some not found in <b>natural</b> <b>streams,</b> but communities were less diverse than communities in <b>natural</b> <b>streams,</b> and tended to be dominated by a limited set of generalist taxa. A longitudinal study of three water races showed gradients in physical characteristics of races, including a downstream decrease in channel width, water depth, current velocity and substrate size. However, few strong longitudinal changes to community structure were found, as the generalist taxa commonly occurring in water races were able to tolerate conditions throughout the race network. To test if macroinvertebrate communities were limited by the homogeneous habitat of water races, I conducted a substrate manipulation experiment, where large cobbles and small boulders were added to reaches in five water races. Despite an increase in substrate and current heterogeneity, there were few significant changes to the macroinvertebrate communities over the four months of the manipulation. This outcome does not eliminate low habitat heterogeneity as a limiting factor for water race communities. Rather, the benthic invertebrate community throughout the water race network is a product of the homogeneous habitat, which limits the availability of colonists of taxa that would benefit from increased habitat diversity. A survey of the fish assemblages of water races found races had a depauperate fish community. Only two species were commonly found in water races, and the average species richness of races was 1. 5. By contrast <b>natural</b> <b>streams</b> had a higher diversity of fish species (mean 4 three species), and contained representatives of a greater number of species that are typical of streams and rivers on the Canterbury Plains. My research has shown that stock water races provide an important source of aquatic biodiversity on the plains, both in addition to <b>natural</b> <b>streams</b> and in their own right. However, the biodiversity value of stock water races could be improved with enhancement of in-stream habitat...|$|R
40|$|AbstractJuvenile north-temperate and Arctic fishes {{are faced}} with {{trade-offs}} between energy allocation to growth and energy storage (primarily lipids) prior to over-wintering. We determined classical morphometric (fork length, body weight and condition factor) and biochemical (whole body triglycerides, muscle RNA/DNA ratio, muscle proteins) measures of growth and condition in individual young-of-the-year (YOY) Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). Grayling were collected just prior to over-wintering in late August (approximately 50 days after swim-up) from two <b>natural</b> <b>streams</b> and five locations within a 3. 4 km long artificial stream constructed as a fish habitat compensation project and diversion channel for the diamond mining industry in Northwest Territories, Canada (64 ° 45 ′N). Fork lengths, body weights and whole body triglyceride levels in grayling collected from all sites along the artificial stream were significantly lower than fish collected {{from one of the}} <b>natural</b> <b>streams.</b> Condition factor (weight-at-length) was not different among grayling collected from <b>natural</b> and artificial <b>streams.</b> Muscle proteins were lower in grayling collected from four sites along the artificial stream compared to the <b>natural</b> <b>streams.</b> In contrast, muscle RNA/DNA ratios were greater in grayling collected from two sites in the artificial <b>stream</b> compared to <b>natural</b> <b>streams.</b> There were no consistent differences in any variable among grayling collected at the five artificial stream sites or among grayling collected from the two <b>natural</b> <b>streams.</b> The higher RNA/DNA ratios and lower fork lengths, whole body triglycerides and muscle proteins in grayling inhabiting the artificial stream are consistent with energy still being primarily allocated to growth in these fish at this late stage of summer. Individuals that are both larger and possess greater energy storage in the form of triglycerides are more likely to survive the long over-wintering period at this latitude. Our results suggest that YOY grayling using the artificial stream as nursery habitat will likely face increased over-winter mortality, thus raising concerns over the use of fish presence, spawning and rearing as criteria for the initial success of artificial streams as habitat compensation measures in Arctic tundra regions. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the potential consequences of reduced size and energy storage in juvenile fishes in order to assess the viability of stream fish habitat compensation and restoration projects associated with industrial development in Arctic tundra regions...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the restoration of}} physical habitats and its influence on macroinvertebrate community structure in 18 Danish lowland streams comprising six restored streams, six streams with little physical alteration and six channelized streams. We hypothesized that physical habitats and macroinvertebrate communities of restored streams would resemble those of <b>natural</b> <b>streams,</b> while those of the channelized streams would differ from both restored and near-natural streams. Physical habitats were surveyed for substrate composition, depth, width and current velocity. Macroinvertebrates were sampled along 100 m reaches in each stream, in edge habitats and in riffle/run habitats located {{in the center of}} the stream. Restoration significantly altered the physical conditions and affected the interactions between stream habitat heterogeneity and macroinvertebrate diversity. The substrate in the restored streams was dominated by pebble, whereas the substrate in the channelized and <b>natural</b> <b>streams</b> was dominated by sand. In the <b>natural</b> <b>streams</b> a relationship was identified between slope and pebble/gravel coverage, indicating a coupling of energy and substrate characteristics. Such a relationship did not occur in the channelized or in the restored streams where placement of large amounts of pebble/gravel distorted the natural relationship. The analyses revealed, a direct link between substrate heterogeneity and macroinvertebrate diversity in the <b>natural</b> <b>streams.</b> A similar relationship was not found in either the channelized or the restored streams, which we attribute to a de-coupling of the natural relationship between benthic community diversity and physical habitat diversity. Our study results suggest that restoration schemes should aim at restoring the natural physical structural complexity in the streams and at the same time enhance the possibility of re-generating the natural geomorphological processes sustaining the habitats in streams and rivers. Documentation of restoration efforts should be intensified with continuous monitoring of geomorphological and ecological changes including surveys of reference river systems...|$|R
