5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{plays a role}} {{in various}} mythologies and {{creation}} myths of Native American folklore. It is variously credited for having brought fire to humanity, releasing the bison into the world, and of having slain monsters by petrifying them. The Maidu creation myth has the coyote introducing work, suffering, and death to the world. Zuni folklore has the coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachinas. Some tribes, such as the Chinook, Maidu, Paiute, Pawnee, Tohono O'odham, and Ute portray the coyote as the companion of the creator. In the Paiute creation myth, the coyote was created by the wolf as a companion, and the two created land by piling soil on the water-covered world. A Tohono O'odham flood myth has the coyote helping Montezuma survive a global deluge that destroys humanity. After the Great Mystery creates humanity, the coyote and Montezuma teach people how to live. The Crow creation myth portrays Old Man Coyote as the creator. In Navajo mythology, the coyote was present in the First World with First Man and First Woman, though a different version has it being created in the Fourth World. The Navajo coyote brings death into the world, explaining that without death, too many people would exist, thus <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> plant corn.|$|E

Collisions were frequent, and the Syracusans could easily ram the Athenian ships head-on, without the Athenians {{being able to}} move to ram them broadside, as they preferred. Javelin throwers and archers shot from each ship, but the Syracusans deflected Athenian grappling hooks by covering their decks with animal hides.|$|E

60|$|The castle was new {{building}} of white stone, lately erected at an enormous cost {{by one of}} the first architects of the day. It was an immense pile, and seemed to cover ground enough for a moderate-sized town. But, nevertheless, report said that when it was completed, the noble owner found that he had <b>no</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> live in; and that, on this account, when disposed to study his own comfort, he resided in a house of perhaps one-tenth the size, built by his grandfather in another county.|$|R

25|$|The {{slim and}} compact {{fuselage}} {{of the aircraft}} was quite cramped, wide enough only for a single person. The navigator sat behind the pilot and access in the cockpit required folding down the seats. Once in place, the crew had almost <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> move and were typically uncomfortable during long missions. Aircrews referred to the Hampden by various nicknames due to this, such as Flying Suitcase, Panhandle, and Flying Tadpole.|$|E

Overlapping figures entirely fill the image space, allowing <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> depict a background.

When the Cup <b>no</b> longer had <b>room</b> <b>to</b> record the winners on it, the Cup was {{mounted on a}} wooden shield to which plaques were attached. In the centenary year of the {{competition}} after the 1976 final, the governors of Methodist College presented a new shield, as the original had <b>no</b> more <b>room</b> <b>to</b> record the winners.

Commercial {{development}} of adjacent property such as Sam's Club, Taco Bell, Sports Authority, and Jiffy Lube was allowed in 1992. The future direction of this airport {{is always in}} question because of its location on prime property {{in the middle of}} the city of Concord with <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> grow, and noise concerns.

25|$|The Confederates {{prepared}} a road block and an ambush {{at a point}} between Lake Aegeri and the Morgarten Pass where the narrow path led between the steep slope and a swamp. When the Austrian army entered the ambush, the Confederates attacked from above with rocks, logs and halberds. The knights had <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> defend themselves and suffered a crushing defeat, while the foot soldiers in the rear fled {{back to the city}} of Zug. About 1,500 Habsburg soldiers were killed in the attack.|$|E
25|$|The carving is so {{deep that}} the forms are almost {{completely}} offset from the background resulting in three, or even four, layers of various figures and forms. What is more, overlapping figures fill the image space entirely, allowing <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> depict a background. Thus, the sense of space has been eliminated, giving rise to chaos {{and a sense of}} weary, open-ended victory. The effect of movement in the scene is evident and, unlike many battle sarcophagi which have more tranquil scenes on the side panels, the battle events continue {{all the way around the}} sarcophagus. The perspective constructed is also notable, although certainly not linear.|$|E

25|$|Reforms made {{by local}} {{government}} {{in the first years}} of the 21st century established the administrative region of the Lisbon metropolitan area. Lisbon's metro system was expanded with the addition of several new stations, among them the transportation hub of Gare do Oriente, designed by the Spanish neofuturistic architect, Santiago Calatrava, and finished in time for the Expo '98 world's fair on land east of the city centre in Parque das NaÃ§Ãµes (Park of Nations). The station has since reached a ridership of 75 million passengers per year. Lisbon's international airport is located in the city centre, but with <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> expand, may soon have problems meeting demand.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarians {{crossed the}} river and {{immediately}} attacked the Bohemians, followed by the Swabians under Burchard. Confusing the defenders with a rain of arrows, they plundered the baggage train and made many captives. As Otto received word of the attack, he ordered Conrad to relieve his rear units with a counter-attack. Upon the successful completion of his mission, Conrad returned to the main forces and the King launched an immediate assault. Despite a volley of arrows, Otto's army smashed into the Hungarian lines {{and was able to}} fight them in hand-to-hand combat, giving the traditionally nomadic warriors <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> use their preferred shoot-and-run tactics; the Hungarians suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat in disorder.|$|E
25|$|This {{left the}} receiver, time base {{system and the}} display inside the {{aircraft}} cabin. There was ample room for this in the Beaufighter where the radar operator sat {{at the back of}} the fuselage. In the Mosquito, the radar operator sat to the right and slightly behind the pilot. The main entry door was located on the left side of the fuselage, just in front of the radar operator. With the radar installed, this left almost <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> reach the door, so the time base circuitry was mounted on rails that allowed it to be slid up and forward, out of the way of the door. Among the parts inside the aircraft were the Type 73 display and the TR.3152 Lucero.|$|E

500|$|Scenes at {{the movie}} theater were filmed in a {{recently}} closed theater in Dunbarâ€“Southlands, British Columbia. The location featured the [...] "architectural and design characteristics of a small-town cinema situated within an appropriate neighbourhood". The movie that is being shown in the Ohio theatre which is attacked is Die Hard with a Vengeance, whose storyline of a mission by terrorists involving American banks is broadly mirrored in this episode's plot. The faux corpses were created by make-up artist Toby Lindala; when he {{brought them to the}} set, however, there was <b>no</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> store them, and so he kept them temporarily in the craft services room. A Canadian government money depository filled in for the First Sovereign Bank of Pennsylvania that is robbed in the episode. The production staff assembled more than 15,000dollar bills of various denominationsâ€”which valued somewhere near $40,000â€”for use during the scenes at said bank. Production initially had to stop due to the fact that, during the filming of the scene that involved the money, there was only one police guard on duty. Fearful that an actual armed robbery might have been attempted, back-up was called in and filming continued as planned.|$|E
500|$|Under Georgia law, appeals {{of death}} penalty cases had {{to be based on}} errors of law, not a reevaluation of the {{evidence}} presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, [...] "I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put on this case, I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I {{do not have to be}} convinced. The jury was convinced.
