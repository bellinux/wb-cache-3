5|$|British Army Captain Walker goes missing {{during an}} {{expedition}} and is believed dead ("Overture"). His widow, Mrs. Walker, {{gives birth to}} their son, Tommy ("It's a Boy"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see or hear the incident and must <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E
5|$|When Kosseff asks Charlie {{about the}} incident, {{he insists that}} he was not in his grandmother's room, and that it was a boy named Michael. Maggie is terrified at the claim, {{explaining}} to the agents that Michael was Charlie’s stillborn twin, about whom she and Steve agreed to <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> Charlie. Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the spirits of the twins, but Steve refused. Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized. Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie, by pretending to be Charlie, to take him home. Scully sees them leaving, and checks on Charlie. They find the nurse and Charlie still in the hospital room. Mulder, now convinced that Michael's spirit is behind the killings, sends Scully to the Holvey residence to stop him.|$|E
25|$|The play {{is still}} disputed by those involved, {{particularly}} by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who insist the Raiders should have won. Tatum {{said that the}} ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating {{that he could not}} honestly say if the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he knows exactly what happened that day but will <b>never</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|E

60|$|The Scot {{is always}} believed, yet he <b>never</b> <b>tells</b> {{anything}} but lies; whereas the captain is never believed, although he <b>never</b> <b>tells</b> a lie, {{so far as}} I can judge. If he should say his uncle was a male person, he would probably say {{it in such a}} way that nobody would believe it; at the same time the Scot could claim that he had a female uncle and not stir a doubt in anybody's mind. My own luck has been curious all my literary life; I <b>never</b> could <b>tell</b> a lie that anybody would doubt, nor a truth that anybody would believe.|$|R
25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{passed on}} the first cheque for $9,700 to Epstein, who was impressed, but after innocently asking how much out of the amount Byrne was owed, was told, [...] "Nothing Brian, that's your 10%". Byrne {{then went on to}} {{describe}} the massive amount of interest he was getting from companies across the USA. Epstein was horrified, realising he had made an appalling error by accepting such a small percentage, and decided he could <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> The Beatles. He immediately instructed Jacobs to re-negotiate the contract with Byrne, which was finally achieved seven months later, in August 1964, which raised the royalty to 49%.|$|E
500|$|While Michael angrily {{announces that}} {{he can no longer}} be friends with his staff and that he will <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> another joke again, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) goads Michael into {{breaking}} his vow immediately, to the approval of Packer. Michael's attitude suddenly changes when he realizes that he is not in trouble, and that the lawyer's job is to protect him. After Packer tells a crude joke at the expense of Phyllis, Michael defends her, telling the entire office that he finds Phyllis attractive and that the only thing he worries about when he's near her [...] "is getting a boner".|$|E

[...] Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives and finds himself [...] "totally blocked". [...] Art talks about the book with his psychiatrist Paul Pavel, a Czech Holocaust survivor. [...] Pavel suggests that, as those who perished in the camps can <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> their stories, [...] "maybe it's better {{not to have any}} more stories". [...] Art replies with a quote from Samuel Beckett: [...] "Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness", but then realizes, [...] "on the other hand, he said it".|$|E
500|$|McCain {{traveled}} {{on a campaign}} bus called the Straight Talk Express, whose name capitalized on {{his reputation as a}} political maverick who would speak his mind. In visits to towns he gave a ten-minute talk focused on campaign reform issues, then announced he would stay until he answered every question that everyone had. He pledged that [...] "I will <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> you a lie." [...] He conducted 114 of these town hall meetings, speaking in every town in New Hampshire in an example of [...] "retail politics" [...] that overcame Bush's familiar name. [...] His growing number of supporters became known as [...] "McCainiacs".|$|E
500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E

500|$|A large {{proportion}} of the character's scenes take place on the set of Walford's launderette, where Pauline works as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in EastEnders. Here, Pauline is frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Dot Cotton. The two characters share one of the soap's most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together are often used to provide humour. Particular emphasis is placed on their differences, which lead to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 sees them [...] "buried alive" [...] underneath a collapsed fairground ride, {{in the midst of a}} cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot are most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality Paul O'Grady as a [...] "fabulous double-act": [...] "Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> anybody else." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her time}} in EastEnders, many of Dot's scenes have been set in Walford's launderette, where the {{character}} has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of {{her time in}} EastEnders. Here, Dot was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Pauline Fowler, played by Wendy Richard from 1985–2006. Author Christine Geraghty has discussed the working environment the women inhabited, indicating that because {{the owner of the}} launderette is barely present, the [...] "working relationship hinges on the friendships (or otherwise) of the women who work in it". As with Ethel, Dot and Pauline's friendship was often used for comedic purposes; emphasis was placed on their differences, leading to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 saw them [...] "buried alive" [...] underneath a collapsed fairground ride, {{in the midst of a}} cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot were most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette.

[...] On the episode marking the screen death of Pauline on 25 December 2006, Dot remarks to Pauline, “You’re the only real friend I’ve got", in a scene that Tim Teeman of The Times has described as [...] "one of the most moving scenes in a soap [...] ".|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Her Slave" [...] is {{a heroin}} anecdote with lyrics narrated by a subjugate lover. Music critic Greg Kot cites [...] "Turn On the Water" [...] {{as an example}} of when [...] "the twisted narrator is the victim" [...] and [...] "cast adrift" [...] in Dulli's lyrics. Inspired by a {{paranoid}} breakup, [...] "Conjure Me" [...] is told from the perspective of an aggressive predator and obscure object of desire. On [...] "Kiss the Floor", the narrator recounts stealing a girl's virginity and avoiding her brothers. [...] "This Is My Confession" [...] has a theme of absolution. The lyrics depicts it as an empty sexual experience: [...] "Shove my head against the door, crawl inside and kiss the floor / Waiting for the sun again, drink it, smoke it, stick it in." [...] "The Temple" [...] is a cover of the song of the same name from the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Dulli became a fan of the rock opera as a child when his babysitter played it. [...] "Let Me Lie to You" [...] has lyrics expressing passive cruelty and subtle manipulation. [...] "Tonight" [...] depicts a peaceful night as the backdrop for the narrator's corrupt one-track mind: [...] "Follow me down to the bushes, dear / No one will know, we'll disappear / I'll hold your hand, we'll <b>never</b> <b>tell</b> / Our private little trip to hell". The album's hidden track [...] "Miles Iz Ded" [...] is about seduction and alcohol, with a last call sensibility and despairing tone.|$|E
