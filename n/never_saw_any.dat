He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.|$|E
5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>any</b> of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E

Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>any</b> embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E

To solve this, Young offered the government the services of the Nauvoo Legion, the Mormon militia organization. After discussing his offer with Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Lincoln accepted the formation of a thirty-man cavalry company for ninety days; this was later expanded into a 106-man company. Although the company made several efforts to track down the culprits of the raids, it <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>any</b> military action.|$|E

25|$|In the frugal {{years that}} {{followed}} {{the end of the}} war, Allhallows, like Leysdown-on-Sea, began to experience lean times as passenger numbers fell. Allhallows with its single Charringtons pub, concrete road, two small refreshment stands (closed in winter) and block of four small shops (which <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>any</b> real use and were eventually bricked up) was no match for Brighton, the attractions of which could be enjoyed by rail for an extra 1s 9d when compared to the price of an Allhallows ticket (then 5s 9d). In an attempt to stem losses, the new operator, British Railways (Southern Region) (BR), misguidedly tried out an ACV lightweight diesel railcar in late 1953, its noise and general lack of comfort probably serving however to drive away more passengers.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{initially}} had no distribution deals {{set up for}} the film. [...] Clarke's brother – a {{sales manager}} at an Amarillo, Texas, television station – put him into contact with the owner of several local drive-in theaters. Clarke agreed to premiere his film in Amarillo, and it played on a double bill with the Roger Corman film Attack of the Crab Monsters, under the alternate title The Sun Demon, on August 29, 1958. Peterson and Clarke appeared at the premiere, and, after the film, performed an interview together. While the audience was distracted, Clarke changed into his costume and made an appearance as the Sun Demon. After this success, Clarke declined a distribution deal with American International Pictures and instead chose a competitor, Miller-Consolidated Pictures, who distributed it across the US and UK. [...] Clarke made additional appearances as the Sun Demon. However, 18 months after the company started distributing the film, it went bankrupt. Because of this, Clarke <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>any</b> income from the deal.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Square Enix {{announced}} plans for World of Mana, {{a new series of}} titles in the Mana franchise, whose titles would span more video game genres than the original series. Koichi Ishii, the creator of the Mana series, decided even before he worked on 2002's Final Fantasy XI about creating new Mana games, but first wanted to create a goal for the new series, and eventually decided to make it about exploring how to add [...] "the feeling of touch" [...] to a game. After he saw the game Half-Life 2 at E3 in 2003, he felt that its physics engine was the one he needed. World of Mana went on to comprise four new games in addition to the remake of Final Fantasy Adventure; Koichi Ishii served as director or producer for all of them as he had for the previous games in the series. In 2006, a Mana installment for the Wii was considered but did not enter development. In April 2007, a month after the release of the final game of the World of Mana, Ishii left Square Enix to lead his own development company, named Grezzo; no further games in the series have been announced since. Three of the new games of World of Mana sparked soundtrack releases, with each composed by a different artist or group of artists: Children of Mana, released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS, Dawn of Mana, released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, and Heroes of Mana, released for the Nintendo DS in 2007. The music of Dawn of Mana also formed the basis of a promotional album included with preorders of the game in Japan, while the music of Yoko Shimomura for Seiken Densetsu: Friends of Mana, a 2006 multiplayer role-playing game for Japanese mobile phones <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>any</b> album releases.|$|E

500|$|The {{extent to}} which money or {{patronage}} affected {{the outcome of the}} election is unclear. Congressman Burton stated, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>any</b> evidence of the use of money in Columbus and don't believe that any money was used corruptly." [...] In an interview after Hanna's death, James Rudolph Garfield, son of the late president and floor leader of the Hanna forces in the Ohio Senate, recalled that the senator [...] "had been asked to shut his eyes to some things. But he declined to do it." [...] However, Garfield also noted, [...] "I have never been sure as to what some of the men who called themselves Senator Hanna's friends really did do." [...] Croly believed that Hanna did not personally authorize bribes of legislators, but concedes that Hanna's supporters [...] "may have been willing to spend money in Mr. Hanna's interest and without his knowledge." [...] The biographer suggested, [...] "If Mr. Hanna had himself planned to purchase the vote of John C. Otis, it is reasonable to believe that the business would have been better managed." [...] Horner believes it impossible to ascertain if corruption took place, but if Hanna bribed legislators, it was because it was a common practice on both sides. He notes of Hanna, [...] "his career as a senator continued, but accusations of wrongdoing remain a part of his legacy well over a century later." [...] Public dismay at what was seen as a corrupt means of choosing federal lawmakers was {{a major factor in the}} ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which took the privilege of electing senators out of state legislators' hands and gave it to the people.|$|E

It applied to the municipality, but no public funds were granted. Gamvik Airport opened on 29 August. Also at Kjøllefjord, [...] from Mehamn, locals decided to build their own airport.

However, she never went to sea again, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1964.

2500|$|A final {{attempt was}} made to {{progress}} a Delta 2 derivative into production came during the late 1950s for the new German Air Force of West Germany. Running against a competing American bid with the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter, Fairey joined forces with Rolls-Royce and Dassault in a collaborative effort to produce a delta wing aircraft capable of reaching Mach 2 to meet the German demand for fighter aircraft. The proposal would have seen Dassault produce the wings, Fairey manufacture the fuselage, and Rolls-Royce provide the engine, which was intended to be a Rolls-Royce Spey engine with reheat; Belgium also {{played a role in the}} programme. However, the American lobby proved to be too strong, in part due to the subsequently uncovered Lockheed bribery scandals that had influenced German decision makers, and the F-104G was selected instead. This was the end for the FD2 as a fighter concept; the concept <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>any</b> use as a production aircraft; Wood summarised the state of affairs as [...] "the harvest was left to France to gather".|$|E
