For fire safety consideration, computer simulation was performed on liquid jet fire with various injection conditions, based on LES and mixture-fraction combustion model. In liquid jet fire simulation, it is suggested that D*/δx reach 18 or more. With increasing, the fire length and lift-off height decreases as injection angle increases. Maximum centerline temperature is not dependent on injection angle. Large injection pressure causes the fire length and lift-off height to rise, and also leads maximum centerline temperature to drop slightly.

40|$|The thrust {{characteristic}} {{and efficiency}} of synthetic jet underwater is easily affected by the geometrical parameters. In this paper, the influence of nozzle geometrical parameters on the thrust of synthetic jet underwater is investigated through numerical method. The geometrical parameters studied include nozzle diameter and <b>nozzle</b> <b>height.</b> The numerical method is validated using the experiment data. A mathematical model of the thrust is established. This model decomposes the thrust into three parts. By adjusting the weights of these parts, the dynamic characteristic of the thrust can be rebuilt. Using this method, the mechanism behind the thrust variation with nozzle geometrical parameters is analyzed. The variation of the thrust with the nozzle diameter is induced by the increase of the acceleration force and the decrease of the pressure force. When the nozzle diameter is small, the thrust is velocity dominated. While when diameter is large, the thrust is acceleration dominated. The thrust variation with <b>nozzle</b> <b>height</b> has two different patterns. The pressure force dominates the first pattern of thrust variation.

A 1 / 2 ' nozzle running at a fixed nozzle pressure ratio of 1. 05 {{was used in the}} experimental phase (giving an nozzle exit Reynolds number of 90 xlO'), the nozzle to ground plane separation being varied between 2 and 10 nozzle diameters. Measurements were performed in the free and wall jets using single and cross-wire hot-wire anemometry techniques and pitot pressure probes in order to detemine mean velocity and normal and shear stress distributions. Some analysis is also presentedo f earlier measurementso n high pressurer atio impinging jets. <b>Nozzle</b> <b>height</b> was found to effect the initial thickness of the wall jet leaving the impingement region, increasing nozzle to ground plane separation increasing the wall jet thickness, although this separation distance did not seem to affect {{the rate at which the}} wall jet grew. <b>Nozzle</b> <b>height</b> was also found to have a large effect on the peak level of turbulence found in the wall jet up to a radial distan ce from the jet axial centre line of 4. 5 nozzle diameters, after which the profiles become self-similar. Lowering the nozzle tended to increase the peak level measured in all the turbulent stresses within this development region. The production of turbulent kinetic energy in the wall jet, which is an indication of the amount of work done against the mean flow by the turbulent flow was found to increase dramatically with decreasing <b>nozzle</b> <b>height.</b> This was attributed to greater shearing of the flow at lower nozzle heights due to a thinner wall jet leaving the impingement region. A moving impingement surface was found to cause separation of the wall jet inner boundary layer on the 'approach' side leading to very rapid decay of peak velocity. The point of separation was found to occur at radial positions in the region of 7. 0 to 8. 0 nozzle diameters, this reducing slightly for lower nozzle heights. A parametric investigation was performed using the k-e turbulence model and the PHOENICS CFD code. It was found that due to inadequacies in the model, it failed to predict accurately the growth of the wall jet, both in terms of its initial thickness and the rate of growth.

Two different configurations {{of the incoming}} flow are considered: a boundary layer flow and a plane wall jet flow, {{in order to examine}} the wall jet outer layer effect on the {{heat transfer}}. This layer is an important additional turbulence source in the wall jet flow. Reynolds number and turbulence intensity effects were investigated in the boundary layer incoming flow case. The cavity depth to <b>nozzle</b> <b>height</b> ratio effect was examined in the wall jet incoming flow case. The numerical approach is based on k-ω standard turbulence model. This study reveals that the heat transfer is very sensitive to the incoming flow characteristics. The turbulence intensity increase accelerates the reattachment of the shear layer at the cavity floor and enhances the heat transfer. The reattachment phenomenon seems to be less affected by the Reynolds number. However, an increase in this parameter ameliorates the heat transfer. It was also observed a heat transfer enhancement in the wall jet incoming flow case as compared to that of a boundary layer.

40|$|A viscous thread {{falling from}} a nozzle onto a surface {{exhibits}} the famous rope-coiling effect, {{in which the}} thread buckles to form loops. If the surface {{is replaced by a}} belt moving with speed U, the rotational symmetry of the buckling instability is broken and a wealth of interesting states are observed [See S. Chiu-Webster and J. R. Lister, J. Fluid Mech., 569, 89 (2006) ]. We experimentally studied this "fluid mechanical sewing machine" in a new, more precise apparatus. As U is reduced, the steady catenary thread bifurcates into a meandering state in which the thread displacements are only transverse to the motion of the belt. We measured the amplitude and frequency ω of the meandering close to the bifurcation. For smaller U, single-frequency meandering bifurcates to a two-frequency "figure eight" state, which contains a significant 2 ω component and parallel as well as transverse displacements. This eventually reverts to single-frequency coiling at still smaller U. More complex, highly hysteretic states with additional frequencies are observed for larger <b>nozzle</b> <b>heights.</b> We propose to understand this zoology in terms of the generic amplitude equations appropriate for resonant interactions between two oscillatory modes with frequencies ω and 2 ω. The form of the amplitude equations captures both the axisymmetry of the U= 0 coiling state and the symmetry-breaking effects induced by the moving belt.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effects of the}} variation of two factors of the working condition, the trajectory angle and the <b>nozzle</b> <b>height</b> from the ground, on the water distribution radial curve of a sprinkler, a mathematical model, able to elaborate with a very good accuracy the size spectrum of droplets generated by a nozzle starting from experimental water distribution radial curves, was used and applied in reversed form. In a previous paper, 37 dimensional droplet spectra were obtained, generated by four sprinklers under varying conditions of operating pressure and nozzle size, but with a single value of trajectory angle and a single value of the <b>nozzle</b> <b>height</b> from the ground level. The application of the mathematical model to the 37 dimensional spectra of the droplets has led to new water distribution radial curves on varying the trajectory angle and the <b>nozzle</b> <b>height.</b> The evaluation of these curves, along with original and experimental ones, has been made using the uniformity of distribution, by means of Christiansen's coefficient CU. Increasing values of pressure and nozzle size provide the best CU. This is applied to all heights of the nozzle from the ground and to almost all trajectory angle values. In all cases, different nozzle heights do not show significant differences in CU values. This also occurred in the comparison of three different trajectory angles, unless the larger diameter and lower height of the nozzle where the CU coefficient gets worse with decreasing the trajectory. The evaluation of the new water distribution radial curves was also made in relation to the produced radius of throw R (m), and it was found that R is positively influenced by all the variables involved. Considering this relationship, two monomial type equations (one for nozzle discharge up to 120 dm 3 /min and radius of throw less than 30 m and one for nozzle discharge above 120 dm 3 /min and higher throw radii) were found that can predict R compared to the discharge of the nozzle, the operating pressure, the trajectory angle, and the height of the nozzle from the ground level. The comparison between the calculated and actual values of R shows a relative error, for all sprinklers and all operating conditions, respectively equal to 6. 9 % in the first case and 4. 1 % in the second case...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work investigates {{particle}} {{growth in}} a counter-current swirl detergent dryer, operating {{with a single}} nozzle, at a range of <b>nozzle</b> <b>heights,</b> air drying temperatures, TA, and superficial air velocities, UA, which were selected to enhance or inhibit particle aggregation in the dryer. The growth kinetics are discussed paying {{special attention to the}} impact of the cycle of deposition and re-entrainment of material from the wall deposits. All cases lead to substantial aggregation and mono-modal product size distributions. The operation at low UA and high TA, (i. e. low momentum) does not inhibit growth as one would expect from a lower particle concentration and faster heat and mass transfer, conditions which would lead to less particle collisions resulting in growth. In contrast, generation of aggregated particles > 850 μm is promoted, suggesting that a change in the erosion behavior of particles from the wall due to a reduction in energy of particle impacts. As a result of lower stresses, erosion is suppressed and clusters remain at the wall for longer, what allows them to sinter and be re-entrained at larger sizes. In contrast, increasing the momentum of the continuous phase by operation at low TA and high UA inhibits particle growth, particularly in the production of the largest sizes > 850 μm. In this case the rate and energy of impacts to the wall increases, this leads to higher disruptive stresses on the wall deposits, thus, reducing the size of the clusters re-entrained. In summary, this work describes aggregation mechanisms in swirl detergent dryers operated with single nozzles, suggesting that, contrary to expectations, wearing of deposits rather than air-borne contacts may be a key contributor to the enhancement or inhibition of growth...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to examine slot film cooling effectiveness and the interaction between the cooling film and an incident planar shock wave in turbulent hypersonic flow. The experimental studies were conducted in the 48 -inch shock tunnel at Calspan at a freestream Mach number of close to 6. 4 and at a Reynolds number of 35 x 10 (exp 6) based on the length of the model at the injection point. The Mach 2. 3 planar wall jet was generated from 40 transverse <b>nozzles</b> (with <b>heights</b> of both 0. 080 inch and 0. 120 inch), producing a film that extended the full width of the model. The nozzles were operated at pressures and velocities close to matching the freestream, as well as at conditions where the nozzle flows were over- and under-expanded. A two-dimensional shock generator was used to generate oblique shocks that deflected the flow through total turnings of 11, 16, and 21 degrees; the flows impinged downstream of the nozzle exits. Detailed measurements of heat transfer and pressure were made both ahead and downstream of the injection station, with the greatest concentration of measurements in the regions of shock-wave/boundary layer interaction. The major objectives of these experimental studies were to explore the effectiveness of film cooling in the presence of regions of shock-wave/boundary layer interaction and, more specifically, to determine how boundary layer separation and the large recompression heating rates were modified by film cooling. Detailed distributions of heat transfer and pressure were obtained in the incident shock/wall-jet interaction region for a series of shock strengths and impingement positions for each of the two <b>nozzle</b> <b>heights.</b> Measurements were also made {{to examine the effects of}} nozzle lip thickness on cooling effectiveness. The major conclusion from these studies was that the effect of the cooling film could be readily dispersed by relatively weak incident shocks, so the peak heating in the recompression region was not significantly reduced by even the largest levels of film cooling. For the case studies in the absence of film cooling, the interaction regions were unseparated. However, adding film cooling resulted in regions of boundary layer separation induced in the film cooling layer [...] the size of which regions first increased and then decreased with increased film cooling. Surprisingly, the size of the separated regions and the magnitude of the recompression heating were not strongly influenced by the thickness of the cooling film, nor by the point of shock impingement relative to the exit plane of the nozzles. The lip thickness was found to have little effect on cooling effectiveness. Measurements with and in the absence of shock interaction were compared with the results of earlier experimental studies and correlated in terms of the major parameters controlling these flows...|$|R

Measurements were made with nozzle pressure ratios of between 1. 05 and 4, nozzle height-to-diameter ratios of between 2. 4 and 8. 4, nozzle splay angles of between 15 degrees and a nozzle spacing-to-diameter ratio of seven. The effect of varying these parameters on the fountain velocity decay, spreading rate and momentum flux ratio are discussed. Mean fountain upwash velocity profiles {{were found to be}} self-similar for all test conditions. A distinct frequency of fountain oscillation was identified but only at a <b>nozzle</b> <b>height</b> of 4. 4 diameters.

40|$|This thesis work {{aimed at}} {{increasing}} the knowledge regarding phenomena occurring when gas is injected using a top-blown lance on to a bath. All results {{are based on}} physical modeling studies carried out both using low and high gas flow rates and nozzle diameters ranging from 0. 8 mm to 3. 0 mm. At the low gas flow rates, the penetration depth in the bath was studied. The experiments focused on studying the effect of <b>nozzle</b> diameter, lance <b>height</b> and gas flow rate on the penetration depth. It {{was found that the}} penetration depth increases with decreasing nozzle diameter, decreasing lance height and with increasing gas flow rate. The results were also compared with previous work. More specifically, it was studied how the previous published empirical relationships fitted the current experimental data. It was found that the relationships of Banks [1], Davenport [2], Chatterjee [3] and Qian [4] agreed well with the experimental data of this investigation for nozzle diameters of 2. 0 mm and 3. 0 mm. However, for smaller nozzle diameters there were considerable deviations. Therefore, a new correlation heuristically derived from energy conservation consideration was suggested and showed better agreement for small nozzle diameters. The experiments carried out at higher gas flow rates focused on the study of swirl motion. The effects of <b>nozzle</b> diameter, lance <b>height,</b> gas flow rate and aspect ratio on the swirl motion were investigated. The amplitude and period of the swirl as well as the starting time and the damping time of the swirl were determined. The amplitude was found to increase with an increased nozzle diameter and gas flow rate, while the period had a constant value of about 0. 5 s for all nozzle diameters, gas flow rates and lance heights. The starting time for the swirl motion was found to decrease with an increased gas flow, while the damping time was found to be independent of gas flow rate, <b>nozzle</b> diameter, lance <b>height</b> and ratio of depth to diameter.

The results show that when the nozzle spacing and injection pressure are given, the heat transfer coefficient increases first and then decreases with the injection height increase, and the cooling uniformity is better; when the injection pressure is given, the injection height increases with the nozzle spacing increase under the maximum heat exchanger capability; when the nozzle spacing is given, the injection height increases with the injection pressure under the maximum heat exchanger capability; for the nozzle arrangement in the paper, there is a relationship between the injection <b>height</b> and <b>nozzle</b> spacing when the heat transfer is uniform, H ≈ 8 S.

40|$|Quantitative {{determination}} of evaporation and drift losses from impact sprinklers {{were carried out}} under various operating and climatic conditions. The {{results show that the}} losses increased with increase in riser height and wind speed and decreased with increase in nozzle size and relative humidity. Also, the results demonstrate the effects of riser <b>height</b> and <b>nozzle</b> size on the water distribution patterns. The evaporation and drift losses model indicated that spray losses from sprinklers are most directly related to the riser <b>height,</b> <b>nozzle</b> size and wind speed, in descending order...|$|R
