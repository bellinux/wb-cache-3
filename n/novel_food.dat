500|$|The grey jay readily capitalizes on <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> sources, {{including}} {{taking advantage}} of man-made sources of food. To the frustration of trappers using baits to catch fur-bearing animals or early travelers trying to protect their winter food supplies, and {{to the delight of}} campers, bold grey jays are known to approach humans for treats and to steal from unattended food stores. Grey jays do not change their feeding behavior if watched by people; if they are able to link humans with food, they will not forget. A nesting female that had become accustomed to being fed by humans was reportedly able to be enticed to leave the nest during incubation and brooding. This behaviour has inspired a number of nicknames for the grey jay, including [...] "lumberjack", [...] "meat-bird", [...] "venison-hawk", [...] "moose-bird", and [...] "gorby", the last two popular in Maine in the northeastern United States. The origin of [...] "gorby", also spelt [...] "gorbey", is unclear but possibly derived from gorb, which in Scots or Irish means [...] "glutton" [...] or [...] "greedy (animal)" [...] or in Scots or northern English [...] "fledgling bird".|$|E

The ways that the <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation has functioned to govern new foods placed on the European market is considered, and a number of important trends are described. A historical account of EU policy regarding <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> is presented, including an analysis of the changes to <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation and an analysis of data drawn from the European Commission’s own records of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> applications is conducted. The ways <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation has functioned to govern new foods placed on the European market is revealed. A number of important trends in full applications are explored, along with substantial equivalence applications and unapproved foods that are placed on the market. This data is used to analyze the empirical legitimacy of the recent amendments to EU <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> governance which will come into force in 2018, suggesting that change was needed, and supports the centralizing approach taken by the Commission. However, the analysis identifies potential risks and uncertainties in recent amendments to EU <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> governance and considers the challenges of Brexit to the <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> regime...|$|R
40|$|European Union Regulation 258 / 97 defines <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> as food {{products}} and food ingredients {{that have not}} been consumed to a significant degree in the European Union before May 1997. However, there are new foods that for some reason are not considered as <b>novel</b> <b>foods,</b> though we think that safety of these products is not always a priori established. We defined a `grey area¿ which consists of such foods, and the present paper intends to raise awareness of this `grey area¿ of unidentified <b>novel</b> <b>foods.</b> The grey area of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> is divided into two categories: (1) {{food products}} or ingredients for which the current Regulation leaves too much space for different interpretations and (2) food products or ingredients that are not novel according to the current Regulation, because the current Regulation contains gaps. These categories are illustrated by means of products already on the market in The Netherlands.

40|$|This review {{identifies}} and {{explores the}} current issues around {{different types of}} <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> and allergy concerns. An important issue relates to the observation that risk estimates associated with <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> may differ depending on whether more emphasis is placed by the individual {{on the results of}} technical risk assessment or on an individual's perceptions of risk associated with different hazards. Consumer perceptions of benefits associated with <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> also vary. Perceptions of what constitutes both risk and benefit appear to be important determinants of consumer acceptability of particular products. One conclusion that can be made is that <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> have the potential to contribute to food allergy management, but that consumer acceptance is likely to differ according to the preferences of individual consumers. It is concluded that some <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> may result in improvements on {{the quality of life of}} food allergic patients, whereas others may result in the development of further socio-economic problem...|$|R
60|$|I speak {{therefore}} of good novels only; and {{our modern}} literature is particularly rich in types of such. Well read, indeed, these books have serious use, being {{nothing less than}} treatises on moral anatomy and chemistry; studies of human nature in the elements of it. But I attach little weight to this function: they are hardly ever read with earnestness enough to permit them to fulfil it. The utmost they usually do is to enlarge somewhat the charity of a kind reader, or the bitterness of a malicious one; for each will gather, from the <b>novel,</b> <b>food</b> for her own disposition. Those who are naturally proud and envious will learn from Thackeray to despise humanity; those who are naturally gentle, to pity it; those who are naturally shallow, to laugh at it. So, also, {{there might be a}} serviceable power in novels to bring before us, in vividness, a human truth which we had before dimly conceived; but the temptation to picturesqueness of statement is so great, that often the best writers of fiction cannot resist it; and our views are rendered so violent and one-sided, that their vitality is rather a harm than good.|$|E

40|$|In the European Union <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> {{are defined}} by the <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation as food {{products}} and food ingredients {{that have not been}} consumed to a significant degree in the European Union before May 1997. However, there are new foods for some reason not considered as <b>novel</b> <b>foods,</b> although it may not be excluded that they differ from conventional foods {{to such an extent that}} an assessment of their safety prior to their entry to the market would be called for. Previously, we reported that this ‘grey area’ of <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> exists and comprises: (1) food products or ingredients for which the current <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation leaves too much space for different interpretations and (2) food products or ingredients that are not novel according to the current <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation, because it contains gaps. This paper focuses on how to handle these interpretation differences and gaps and provides recommendations to improve these pitfalls of the current <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation. To this end, we propose criteria with clear boundaries as part of an assessment tool to reduce the uncertainties in interpretation with respect to consumption to a significant degree in the European Union, which take into account the commercial availability, length, extent and frequency of use of the particular food/ingredient. In addition, biological relevant boundaries for the criteria regarding changes in the nutritional value, metabolism (better all aspects of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), and levels of undesirable substances are proposed for significant changes in the composition of foods due to changes in the production process. In addition, criteria are proposed to cover ambiguities and gaps in the <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation dealing with food products and food ingredients obtained from 1) animals on a new feeding regime, 2) new varieties of organisms, 3) other growth stages of crops. Finally, a criterion that takes into account the total ingredient intake rather than single product intake is added to deal with the risk of overexposure to substances. Taken together, the proposed boundaries and criteria may contribute to diminishing the interpretation issues regarding the <b>Novel</b> <b>Foods</b> Regulation and thus to reducing the extent of the grey area of <b>novel</b> <b>foods.</b> - See more at: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Fear, a key {{aspect of}} {{temperament}} with {{important implications for}} both animal welfare and production, may be manifest in responses to novelty. Herbivores typically prefer the familiar to the novel, and they generally regard anything novel with caution (i. e., they are reluctant to eat <b>novel</b> <b>foods).</b> We hypothesized animals differ in their fearfulness towards food and non-food items due to individuality which is influenced by genetics and contrasting environmental experiences. We further hypothesized fear of unknown foods and environments are correlated. Our objective {{was to determine if}} sheep differ in their fear responses and {{whether or not there is}} a link between general fearfulness and response to separation – as measured by the open field test (OFT) and stress induced hyperthermia (SIH) – and the readiness to eat new foods. We assessed reluctance to eat <b>novel</b> <b>foods,</b> open field behavior, and SIH in two groups of sheep (Group 1 : Rambouillet–Columbia–Finn–Targhee crossbreds; Group 2 : composite Suffolk) raised under contrasting environmental conditions. Lambs in Group 1 showed lower number of bleats and higher SIH than lambs in Group 2. When offered <b>novel</b> <b>foods,</b> lambs in Group 1 were more reluctant to eat them than lambs in Group 2. There was a negative relationship between number of bleats in OFT and reluctance to eat <b>novel</b> <b>foods.</b> Thus, reluctance to eat <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> and response to separation in the OFT behavior differed among animals and a correlation was found between these behaviors. Our results suggest that reluctance to ingest new foods is influenced by sociality. Individuals less responsive to social isolation (lower number of bleats) may be less cautious at accepting <b>novel</b> <b>foods</b> than individuals more responsive to social isolation. Such variability implies some individuals may be more adept at consuming diverse diets in diverse locations whereas others may be more adept at consuming single foods at fixed locations...|$|R

50|$|Exposing {{someone to}} a new food {{increases}} the chances of liking that food item.

It can take as many as 15 tries of a <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> item before a child accepts it. There also appears to be a critical period for lowering later food neophobia in children during the weaning process. The variety of solid foods first exposed to children can lower later food refusal. Some researchers believe that even the food variety of a nursing mother and the consequent variety of flavors in her breastmilk can lead to greater acceptance of <b>novel</b> <b>food</b> items later on in life.
