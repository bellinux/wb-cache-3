5|$|On 9 September, Suwito {{informed}} a British diplomat {{that the}} Strait would be closed for naval exercises {{and that it}} would be appreciated if British warships steered clear of the area in the interim. To Britain, this seemed an escalation of the Crisis, as if the task force sailed through they might have to fight the Indonesian Navy directly, though in fact Indonesia was lessening its resolve to refuse the task force passage through the Strait, and hoped to keep the British from attempting to force their way through via more indirect means. This was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the British interpreted it, however, and the announcement triggered a new round of debates over the forced passage. Thorneycroft reviewed the plan with the Foreign Office, Ministry of Defence, and the Commonwealth Relations Office, most of whom told him to consider the opinions of the commanders on site. After remembering the influential Lord Head's endorsement of Begg's views, Thorneycroft was swayed, and decided that the two destroyers should proceed through the Strait without the Victorious, using the aircraft of that vessel and the Centaur for cover. Though worried about the psychological effect of the non-passage of the carrier, he was reminded that Britain had not informed Jakarta that the ship would return that way in the first place.|$|E
25|$|For Wesley, {{good works}} were {{the fruit of}} one's {{salvation}}, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which that salvation was earned. Faith and good works {{go hand in hand}} in Methodist theology: a living tree naturally and inevitably bears fruit. Wesleyan theology rejects the doctrine of eternal security, believing that salvation can be rejected. Wesley emphasized that believers must continue to grow in their relationship with Christ, through the process of Sanctification.|$|E
25|$|Presence-at-hand is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{things in}} the world are usually encountered, and it is only {{revealed}} as a deficient or secondary mode, e.g., when a hammer breaks it loses its usefulness and appears as merely there, present-at-hand. When a thing is revealed as present-at-hand, it stands apart from any useful set of equipment but soon loses this mode of being present-at-hand and becomes something, for example, that which must be repaired or replaced.|$|E

25|$|In Guernsey in 1940, the Germans proposed, {{instead of}} letters, {{to record a}} message to be {{transmitted}} by them over a radio so that people in Britain could listen. The message recorded by Ambrose Sherwill was broadcast and caused controversy as it mentioned the exemplary conduct of the German soldiers and how the population was being well looked after. This was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Churchill wished the Germans to be perceived, but would have provided comfort to islanders in Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Cruel Sea {{was formed}} in late 1987 in Sydney by Jim Elliot on drums and Dan Rumour (aka Daniel Atkins) on guitar. By late 1988, Ken Gormly had joined on bass guitar and James Cruickshank on {{keyboards}} and guitars. In 1989, the band invited vocalist Tex Perkins, {{also a member of}} Beasts of Bourbon, to join them on-stage. The group signed with Red Eye Records and released their debut album, Down Below, in December. Their second album, This Is <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> Home was issued in December 1991.|$|E
25|$|Despite its name, Section IV also {{contains}} provisions referring to barristers. Before {{the passing of}} the act there was no contractual relationship between a barrister and the instructing solicitor, or between a barrister and his client. This made it very difficult to obtain damages or recover money if there was a problem. A barrister was paid only as a matter of honour—there was no contract requiring that he be paid for his services, and no way of gaining his fee if he was <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>way</b> that the legal profession got around this was by making it an act of professional misconduct for a solicitor not to pay the fees of a barrister in a case.|$|E

25|$|If {{the goal}} of shorter-term therapy is for {{patients}} {{to understand that they}} are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who and what they are as human beings, what they truly are like and what they truly contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but is a process of slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It is a process of experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.|$|E
25|$|The {{seventh and}} eighth stage did not change this difference. In the ninth stage the race was decided, as Heusghem lost ten minutes to Scieur. From that moment {{it was easy for}} Scieur to control the race, and the other cyclists could only ride for stage victories. In the tenth stage, Scieur {{punctured}} on the climb to Allos. It was an unwritten rule that cyclists would not attack when opponents were repairing their bicycle, but Heusghem was desperate and broke this rule. Scieur was angry, and after he completed his repair he caught back Heusghem. He then told Heusghem that this was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> professional cyclists behaved, dropped Heusghem, and crossed the finish line first, and even added another six minutes to his lead.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} between Holly and Sebastian {{for the center}} ring develops into a romantic triangle as well, with both Sebastian and Brad vying for Holly as the aerialists' acts become increasingly daring and dangerous. Sebastian ignores his former lovers on the show: Angel, who performs in the elephant act; and Phyllis, who does a double turn as an iron jaw artist and a vocalist, starring in a South Seas spectacular built around her talent as a singer. The duel ends when, {{in response to a}} challenge from Holly, Sebastian removes his safety net and suffers serious injuries in a fall when a trick goes wrong. Buttons tends to him; and when the show's doctor expresses admiration for the way he dealt with the injuries, the clown explains, a little nervously, that he used to be a pharmacist's mate. Holly finally has the center ring and star billing – but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she wanted it. Brad is unable to comfort her because she is in love with Sebastian.|$|E

25|$|In {{selective}} schools, various languages may {{be offered}} as electives {{like in a}} SPFL program, {{as well as other}} subjects such as computer programming and literary writing like in STEM schools or Laboratory High Schools. Chinese schools have language and cultural electives. International Schools offers electives or subjects like writing, culture, history, language, art, or a special subject unique to the school. Preparatory schools like technical vocational schools or schools with TVL Program usually add some business, entrepreneurship, and accountancy courses. Special science high schools like those of PSHS System (administered by DOST) and RSHS System (administered by DepEd) have biology, chemistry, and physics at every level and or exclusive and advanced science and math subjects as well as subjects in technology, pre-engineering, and research. These science schools are more exclusive and with higher standards compared to general high school's STEM Program. PSHS or RSHS students may transfer to a STEM program school but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> around. PSHS students may also transfer to a RSHS and vice versa only for incoming sophomore year. Both PSHS and RSHS students must maintain an average grade especially in their advanced sciences and math subjects on a quarterly basis or else will lose the chance of continuing education in these schools, therefore, will make students transfer to a STEM Program school or a general high school. This systems makes sure the quality and exclusiveness of science high schools. In special government-run art school such as Philippine High School for the Arts, which is administered by the Cultural Center of the Philippines in coordination with Department of Education, and as well as the National Commission for Culture and the Arts offers a much specialized and exclusive curricular program than general high school's SPA Program. Like the PSHS and RSHS to STEM schools system, students from PHSA should maintain grades in their art field of specialization or will transfer to an SPA school or a general high school. But SPA students can enroll in PHSA only for incoming sophomores passing exclusive test, auditions, and interviews, and not from general high schools but from SPA school only. Both schools of Philippine Science High School System and the Philippine High School for the Arts are administered by government agencies apart from DepEd but still is in coordination with it. These schools offers scholarship for students with high aptitude and talents in science fields or the art fields granting those who passes rigorous and exclusive tests with many special benefits like free board and lodging, free books, a monthly stipend, and classes taught by experts, masters, and active practitioners of their respective fields among others.|$|E

Henry scored, and though their performance noticeably improved in the second half, the game ended in a draw.

He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and ATM fees. In September 2010, Brown opposed a Senate bill creating a $30 billion government fund aimed at encouraging lending to small businesses. The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, stating: [...] "Banks making lending decisions with government funds is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to get our economy moving again." ...|$|E
