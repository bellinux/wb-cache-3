5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> threat to Suharto.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the White House Hanukkah Party, Obama's White House Passover Seder was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> event. The {{guest list}} {{did not include}} rabbinical figures, Jewish lobbyists, members of Congress, or Israeli representatives. The guest list of {{approximately}} 20 remained basically the same each year. Attendees included {{the president and his}} family, members of the president's and first lady's staff and their families, and friends of the Obamas, with a mix of Jews and non-Jews.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E

Caesar had dined at Lepidus' house the night before his murder. One of the ringleaders of the conspiracy, Gaius Cassius Longinus, had argued for the killing of Lepidus and Mark Antony as well, but Marcus Junius Brutus had overruled him, saying the action was an execution and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> coup.|$|E
