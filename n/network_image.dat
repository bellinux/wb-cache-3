50|$|Cyclades is the Synnefo {{component}} that implements the Compute, <b>Network,</b> <b>Image</b> and Volume services. It exposes the associated OpenStack REST APIs: OpenStack Compute, Network, Glance and soon also Cinder. Cyclades {{is the part}} which manages multiple Ganeti clusters at the backend. Cyclades issues commands to a Ganeti cluster using Ganeti’s Remote API (RAPI). The administrator can expand the infrastructure dynamically by adding new Ganeti clusters to reach datacenter scale. Cyclades knows nothing about low-level VM management operations, e.g., handling of VM creations, migrations among physical nodes, and handling of node downtimes; the design {{and implementation of the}} end-user API is orthogonal to VM handling at the backend.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, Antenna TV {{did not run}} a split-screen credit {{sequence}} at {{the conclusion}} of its programs. However, this policy changed in April 2015, when such a sequence (modeled in the style which many cable channels - including sister network WGN America - have used since the late 2000s, in which the show's normal credit sequence is downscaled to {{the left side of the}} screen as the opening teaser or title sequence of the next program - which is identified in a graphic framing both - starts simultaneously) began to be used on some programs aired in the daytime, gradually expanding to other dayparts through that summer. Programs airing as part of Antenna TV's weeknight prime time schedule (from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern) were not affected until September 2015, when a variant split-screen sequence that incorporated program and <b>network</b> <b>image</b> promotions was introduced during that daypart. Now this practice is used on all Antenna TV programs except Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Johnny Carson. The network originally didn't display an on-screen logo bug during its programs but now does, affiliates can add their own bug during Antenna TV programming, with many that do displaying modified versions of logos that the affiliate station has used as part of their main branding in the past (for example, WPHL-TV in Philadelphia uses a variant of the logo it used from 1976 to 1987, under the brand [...] "Channel 17, The Great Entertainer").|$|E

40|$|The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Standard {{specifies}} a non-proprietary data interchange protocol, {{digital image}} format, and file structure for biomedical images and image-related information. The fundamental {{concepts of the}} DICOM message protocol, services, and information objects are reviewed as background {{for a detailed discussion}} of the functionality of DICOM; the innovations and limitations of the Standard; and the impact of various DICOM features on information system users. DICOM addresses five general application areas: (1) <b>network</b> <b>image</b> management, (2) <b>network</b> <b>image</b> interpretation management, (3) network print management, (4) imaging procedure management, (5) off-line storage media management. DICOM is a complete specification of the elements required to achieve a practical level of automatic interoperability between biomedical imaging computer systems—from application layer to bit-stream encoding. The Standard is being extended and expanded in modular fashion to support new applications and incorporate new technology. An interface to other Information Systems provides for shared management of patient, procedure, and results information related to images. A Conformance Statement template enables a knowledgeable user to determine if interoperability between two implementations is possible. Knowledge of DICOM's benefits and realistic understanding of its limitations enable one to use the Standard effectively as the basis for a long term implementation strategy for image management and communications systems...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{unmanned}} air vehicle (UAV) images {{acquired by}} a non-metric digital camera {{to establish an}} <b>image</b> <b>network</b> is difficult in cases without accurate camera model parameters. Although an <b>image</b> <b>network</b> can be generated by continuously calculating camera model parameters during data processing as an incremental structure from motion (SfM) methods, the process is time consuming. In this study, low-cost global position system (GPS) information is employed in <b>image</b> <b>network</b> generation to decrease computational expenses. Each image is considered as reference, and its neighbor images are determined based on GPS coordinates during processing. The reference image and its neighbor images constitute an image group, {{which is used to}} generate a free <b>network</b> through <b>image</b> matching and relative orientation. Data are then transformed from the free network coordinate system of each group into the GPS coordinate system by using the GPS coordinates of each image. After the exterior elements of each image are determined in the GPS coordinate system, the initial <b>image</b> <b>network</b> is established. Finally, self-calibration bundle adjustment constrained by GPS coordinates is conducted to refine the <b>image</b> <b>network.</b> The proposed method is validated on three fields. Results confirm that the method can achieve good <b>image</b> <b>network</b> when accurate camera model parameters are unavailable...|$|R
