5|$|Lucy {{returns and}} Chris rejects her offer of being father to her child when Nate confesses {{he does not}} want children; however, Chris changes his mind when Nate {{supports}} him. Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning that they have had a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E

25|$|Atwater: But Reagan did {{not have}} to do a {{southern}} strategy for two reasons. Number one, race was not a dominant issue. And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

25|$|Renaissance's {{performance}} was deemed {{as one of}} the worst seen by Sir Alan (at the time), who felt no one had proper knowledge of running a profitable business after it was revealed that their expenses were three times that of Alpha, despite their income being greater. Although Lee and Michael repeatedly voiced concerns early in the task about the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about profit margins, both Ian and Kevin paid little heed to this. Michael was later heavily criticised for deciding on the prices without any knowledge of the team's costs, but defended himself against this by pointing out that Ian had consistently refused to give him this information, and that the team would have otherwise missed the deadline for printing their menus.|$|E
25|$|In the {{dedication}} page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel {{was shaped by}} a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input on the manuscript was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for ourselves.|$|E

500|$|As Thakkar {{explained}} in a 2016 interview to The Times of India, the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System was developed {{in an era of}} 56K modems: [...] "They wanted any artist to view any number of shots, back-to-back, from part of the film, in high resolution, at 24 fps, with high quality audio, with speed-change control, from any phase of production from any department (story, editing, animation, modeling, layout, lighting, vfx, etc.)..." [...] As per Thakkar, it was a technology that allowed technicians and artists in multiple locations to simultaneously work on films in real time; one of the main provisions was useful transparency, enabling artists and technicians to seamlessly do their work without any <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the technology. Apart from the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System, Thakkar says he additionally headed DreamWorks' [...] "high performance particle system rendering software" [...] and [...] "colour management system and software".|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "Incredible" [...] {{starts off}} like a love song but reveals itself to be a plea to someone to start over, while {{changing}} its composition from the interlude. According to MTV, the shift in the structure reflected Madonna's own confusion about how she felt about her lover in the song. [...] "Can't get my head around it", she sang. [...] "I, I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it." [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featuring West, has a 70s R meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West. Williams has commented that Madonna's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before. That is reflected in songs like [...] "Spanish Lesson" [...] where she sings the line [...] "If you do your homework/ Baby I will give you more". It also has influences of Spanish music.

Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I know what I {{want it to be}} melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made in a way that Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would be surprised at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision. Robert found this to be a strength within the band. [...] "People always have this misconception that a band all <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> alike... so many different ways of looking at songs and [...] put together, and that's really the beauty of a great band".|$|E

At Berdella's home, Bryson was knocked unconscious with an iron bar, then bound to Berdella's bed, where he was subjected to similar methods of abuse and torture endured by previous victims, although in Bryson's case, Berdella repeatedly swabbed his eyes with ammonia, before exclaiming to him: [...] "The only things you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about are you, me, and this house." ...|$|E

40|$|For a dynamic, {{evolving}} multiagent auction, we {{have developed}} an adaptive agent bidding strategy (called the p-strategy) based on stochastic modeling. The p-strategy {{takes into account the}} dynamics and resulting uncertainties of the auction process using stochastic modeling, and avoids the shortcomings of stochastic modeling by adaptively deciding when to use the model and when not to. Our experiments show that the p-strategy outperforms other candidate bidding strategies in a continuous double auction regardless of the status of the auction and the demography of the agent population. 1.
