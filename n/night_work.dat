25|$|The {{first annual}} conference, {{referred}} to as the International Labour Conference (ILC), began on 29 October 1919 at the Pan American Union Building in Washington, D.C. and adopted the first six International Labour Conventions, which dealt with hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, <b>night</b> <b>work</b> for women, minimum age, and <b>night</b> <b>work</b> for young persons in industry. The prominent French socialist Albert Thomas became its first director-general.|$|E
25|$|State {{legislation}} 1912–1918: 36 states {{adopted the}} principle of workmen's compensation for all industrial accidents.

25|$|Liberals were latecomers to the {{movement}} for equal rights for women. Generally, they agreed with Eleanor Roosevelt, that women needed special protections, especially regarding hours of work, <b>night</b> <b>work,</b> and physically heavy work. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) had first been proposed in the 1920s by Alice Paul, and appealed primarily to middle-class career women. At the Democratic National Convention in 1960, a proposal to endorse the ERA was rejected after it met explicit opposition from liberal groups including labor unions, AFL-CIO, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), American Federation of Teachers, American Nurses Association, the Women's Division of the Methodist Church, and the National Councils of Jewish, Catholic, and Negro Women.|$|E

25|$|Sheldon {{called the}} {{officers}} sacked by Falkenhayn scapegoats; {{the survivors of}} the attacks of 1 July had to hang on until reserves arrived, who lost many casualties when sent to the most threatened areas. On the French front, a German regimental commander explained that the loss of Curlu, was caused by the regiment not being sent forward until the destructive bombardment had begun, that there was not enough material to build defences and that the accommodation of the troops was changed frequently. <b>Night</b> <b>work</b> became essential and a lack of rest reduced the efficiency of the troops, separation of the battalions of the regiment in the week before 1 July disrupted internal administration and the machine-gun detachments and infantry companies were attached to other units, which made it impossible to command the regiment as a tactical unit.|$|E
500|$|<b>Night</b> <b>Work,</b> the band's third studio album, was {{released}} in 2010. The first single released from <b>Night</b> <b>Work</b> was [...] "Fire with Fire", which Babydaddy and Shears wrote in collaboration with Stuart Price. Price co-wrote eight other songs for the album, including the singles [...] "Any Which Way" [...] and [...] "Invisible Light". American singer Santigold co-wrote and provided backing vocals to the song [...] "Running Out". Scissor Sisters' fourth studio album Magic Hour followed in 2012. The album's lead single, [...] "Only the Horses", was co-written by Babydaddy, Shears, Alex Ridha and Amanda Ghost.

500|$|Scissor Sisters are an American {{band that}} formed in New York City in 2001.

They have released four studio albums: Scissor Sisters (2004), Ta-Dah (2006), <b>Night</b> <b>Work</b> (2010) and Magic Hour (2012).

Singles from the album included [...] "Laura", [...] "Take Your Mama", [...] "Mary" [...] and [...] "Filthy/Gorgeous". Scissor Sisters earned the group five awards, including three BRIT Awards (Best International Group, Best International Breakthrough Act, and Best International Album), a Bambi Prize (Shooting Star), and a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Music Artist.

500|$|While Weinberg did {{not forget}} the breakup and long separation, he viewed it as [...] "at {{the same time the}} most horrifying {{experience}} I've ever been through and the most liberating." [...] In any case, he immediately felt comfortable playing with Springsteen once more: [...] "Right from the first downbeat of the first rehearsal, it was there again." [...] His drumming for the E Street Band was more relaxed and mature than before, showing more confidence and finesse, and his hands and fingers were in better shape for having done the daily Late <b>Night</b> <b>work.</b> When the tour concluded with ten shows at New York's Madison Square Garden, on several days Weinberg taped the Conan show at Rockefeller Center in the late afternoon, put his hands in ice and changed from his suit into jeans and a vest, and played with Springsteen at night. The experience of doing both left him [...] "professionally speaking, as alive as I've ever felt." [...] Of his position on the drum platform behind Springsteen, he says, [...] "I have the best seat in the house." [...] His energy level was no less, as he could be seen jumping a foot off his seat during some songs. His daughter Ali joined the band on keyboards several times during the tour.|$|E
500|$|Soon, Minogue {{began working}} on her {{eleventh}} studio album Aphrodite. The initial recording sessions began in April 2009 when Minogue met with British singer-songwriter Nerina Pallot, with whom she readied the track [...] "Better than Today". Its live instrumentation, along {{with the fact that}} X had been burdened by contributions from too many producers, prompted Minogue's record label Parlophone to decide on a more natural and less convoluted production style for Aphrodite. Later sessions with Pallot proved to be less successful, as her suggested songs were [...] "rapidly supplemented with tracks from a wide range" [...] of contributors. Minogue felt her sessions with Pallot did not yield any dance-pop tracks; fearing that she was [...] "going down the same road, doing the rounds of all the pop dynamos but lacking any cohesive quality," [...] she approached her close friend Jake Shears, male lead singer of American pop group Scissor Sisters, for advice. Shears encouraged her to work with Stuart Price, a Grammy award-winning British electronic music producer who had collaborated with Scissor Sisters on their third studio album <b>Night</b> <b>Work</b> (2010). Miles Leonard, chairman of Parlophone, enlisted Price as the executive producer of the album. He had previously served as the executive producer of American recording artist Madonna's tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), and international news agency Reuters regarded him as [...] "one of the most in-demand pop producers". In an interview with a writer for Popjustice, Price revealed that he got involved in the production of Aphrodite after he met Minogue for a writing session in October 2009.|$|E

As an opening act, they joined Lady Gaga for select dates on her third leg of The Monster Ball Tour in early 2011.|$|E

2500|$|To conceal {{themselves}} {{as much as}} possible, party members left extra supplies in the trench, and only ventured out at night. [...] The teams scrambled to work as quickly and silently as possible, as such stressful <b>night</b> <b>work</b> and physical labour promoted fatigue and little time to sleep. Also, returning to one's trench {{in the middle of}} the night proved tricky, as workers often got lost on their way back. Finally, wiring parties were always wary of the enemy's parties, as they performed the same task each night.|$|E
2500|$|An {{effort was}} made to secure {{experienced}} pilots and observers from older squadrons, but this proved impractical.

[...] These men had to be trained in <b>night</b> <b>work</b> before they could begin operations over the lines. [...] This obstacle in conjunction with bad night weather, was responsible for the slow start of the squadron.

[...] Therefore, workers {{are not allowed to}} work at night and then hire themselves out during the day, because they will already be weak from their <b>night</b> <b>work.</b> Similarly, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch taught that one is not allowed to work one's animal by night and then hire it out during the day.
