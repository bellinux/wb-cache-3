Conventional implementations of this class of device driver only allow a single process to access the device, which means that all other processes are blocked in the meantime.

The SocketCAN concept on the other hand uses the model of network devices, which allows multiple applications to access one CAN device simultaneously.

50|$|In the United States, Sprint PCS was {{the first}} company to build and operate a PCS network, {{launching}} service in November 1995 under the Sprint Spectrum brand in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Sprint originally built out the network using GSM radio interface equipment. Sprint PCS later selected CDMA as the radio interface for its nationwide network and built out a parallel CDMA network in the Baltimore-Washington area, launching service in 1997. Sprint operated the two <b>networks</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel</b> until finishing a migration of its area customers to the CDMA network. After completing the customer migration, Sprint PCS sold the GSM radio interface network equipment to Omnipoint Communications in January 2000. Omnipoint was later purchased by VoiceStream Wireless which subsequently became T-Mobile USA. Sprint's original GSM network still forms the backbone of T-Mobile's wireless network in the Baltimore-Washington area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The rapid {{increase}} and proliferation of mobile wireless technologies {{has led to}} the rise of new problems that fall under the umbrella of challenged networks, namely, intermittent network connectivity. This diversity in wireless devices, along with their convergence, has granted users access to multiple heterogeneous <b>networks</b> available <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> owadays, a user generally expects to be connected in all places at all times. To better meet this expectation, we propose a system that takes advantage of intermittent connection opportunities while exploiting other <b>networks</b> available <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> We build our system over the parallel networks architecture, Paraets, which suggests using parallel heterogeneous networks simultaneously as data and control channels. Our system adopts the Data Bundling System for Intermittent Connections (DBS-IC), previously proposed as a stand-alone architecture for intermittent connectivity, and integrates it with the Paraets architecture. We evaluate our system by fully implementing a Paraets-enabled version of DBS-IC and thoroughly testing it over emulated network conditions representing multiple <b>networks</b> available <b>in</b> <b>parallel.</b> Characteristics of these networks are adopted based on real-life data on 802. 11, 3 G cell, and satellite networks.
