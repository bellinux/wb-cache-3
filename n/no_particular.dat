5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{continued}} to crop up. Many Chinese Malayan youths {{drafted into the}} army to stave off communist attacks fled the country; most participants were English- and not Chinese-educated. To the Malays, this indicated that the Chinese had <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> loyalty towards Malaya and justified ketuanan Melayu, heightening similar perceptions caused by the apparent racial dichotomy between those in fierce opposition to the communists and those supporting the MCP.|$|E

5|$|The Church of St Nicholas lies in {{the centre}} of Sapareva Banya. Its {{architecture}} is rather simple, with a single nave, a single apse and no narthex present. The church follows the Byzantine cross-in-square design, with unusually short arms of equal size. The dome has twelve sides and is of <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> height, though it is rather large for the church's size. The apse is situated on the church's eastern side; its shape is semicircular and it features a window. The entrance {{is located on the}} west wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders {{such as the}} Strangers and the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke out between the Pilgrims and the Strangers over the celebration of Christmas, a day of <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline. They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E

5|$|Whatever {{the basis}} for Manetho's choice to end the Fifth Dynasty with Unas, Egyptians living at the time {{probably}} perceived <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> change from one dynasty to the next. The administration of the state shows no evidence of disturbances, with many officials continuing their careers from Unas' onto Teti's reign. These include the viziers Mehu, Kagemni and Nikau-Isesi and the overseer of the province of Edfu Isi. Given that the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom might not have conceived of dynasties, {{the distinction between the}} Fifth and Sixth Dynasties might be illusory.|$|E
5|$|Certain African {{cultural}} groups, {{such as the}} Yoruba and the Igbo of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The {{procedure is}} also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the Sudan, Zaire, Uganda and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, {{or it may be}} interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals. It is not clear how many deaths and injuries result from traditional circumcisions which occur outside of hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmins still {{recite the}} Rig Veda at {{religious}} ceremonies, prayers and other occasions. These ceremonies include birth, wedding, initiation ceremonies, {{as well as}} death rituals. Other ceremonies for different occasions in Hindu life include Vastushanti which is performed before a family formally establishes residence in a new house, Satyanarayana Puja, originating in Bengal in the 19th century, is a ceremony performed before commencing any new endeavour or for <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> reason. Invoking {{the name of the}} family's gotra and the kula daivat are important aspects of these ceremonies. Like most other Hindu communities, Deshasthas have a shrine called a devaghar in their house with idols, symbols, and pictures of various deities. Ritual reading of religious texts called pothi is also popular.|$|E

5|$|He {{was said}} to have been {{discovered}} by Ipswich Town scout Jim Rodgers (his goals at schoolboy level meant that he was already well known to all the football scouts in Northern Ireland), who was told by manager Bobby Robson to wait until Whiteside grew older. Instead, it was Manchester United's 80-year-old Ulster scout Bob Bishop, who previously unearthed Belfast-born George Best and Sammy McIlroy for the club, who first offered him a trial at an English club. Whiteside's family were Manchester United supporters, though the youngster himself held <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> allegiance. He found that he had been offered schoolboy terms at the club during a school trip to the United States; on the trip, he and his classmates met President Jimmy Carter at the Oval Office, a rare and extraordinary occasion for children from a disadvantaged background.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws for which there is <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E
5|$|The Guise {{brothers}} {{set about}} persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, {{though she had}} <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre, the First Prince of the Blood, and then, with more success, to his brother, Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé, who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force. When the Guises heard of the plot, they moved the court to the fortified Château of Amboise. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the château. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many {{of them on the}} spot, including the commander, La Renaudie. Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.|$|E

5|$|The cup was {{probably}} made in Alexandria, Egypt. It was {{once thought to}} {{date back to the}} Hellenistic period, c. 250 BC, but is now regarded as dating to the 1st century AD. Its supposed connection with the Ptolemies dates back to a description in 1644 by historian Jean Tristan de Saint-Amant; he argued that the vase was made for the funeral processions of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who ruled the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt from 285 until 246 BC. Scholar E. Babelon argued that the cup had been made in Egypt during the general time of the Ptolemies, a much looser range stretching from 305 to 30 BC. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> evidence for this, and other scholars, such as John Henry Middleton or Martin Conway, suggest that the cup was carved later, during the first or second centuries AD by Romans. Dating the cup has been problematic largely because similar pieces are rare, making comparison difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in <b>no</b> <b>particular</b> order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then {{committed}} suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
