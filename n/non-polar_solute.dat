Recently, much effort has been directed towards the use of organized media to modify reaftivity as compared to that in isotropic liquids. Judicious selection of a given organized system for a given application requires sufficient understanding of {{the properties of the}} organized media themselves and those of the substrate interactions therein. The multimolecular aggregation of hydrophobic solutes in water could prove to be of immense value to the organic chemist. The aggregation of simple olefinic systems in water would enable photocycloaddition to compete efficiently with the various other modes of dacay of the short-lived excited state. Investigations of a few systems (dimerization of coumarins, stilbenes and alkylcinnamates) in our laboratory have been successful and they bring to light the significance of the hydrophobic effect. One of the most accepted manifestations of the hydiophobic interactions is probably the formation of micellar aggregates in aqueous solutions. Micelles provide a unique interface between aqueous and non-aqueous phases at which the <b>non-polar</b> <b>solute</b> can orient itself. While intermolecular orientation at micellar interfaces can provide selectivity in dimerization reactions, intramolecular orientation can be utilized to bring about selectivity in unimolecular photo-transformations. Such examples are presented...|$|E

Because of its topicality, there has recently been growing interest in the mechanism of hydrophobic aggregation, and in the physics on which it is based. In this study we use a simple yet powerful mixture model for water, an adapted two-state Muller-Lee-Graziano model, to describe the energy levels of water molecules as a function of their proximity to <b>non-polar</b> <b>solute</b> molecules. The model is shown to provide an appropriate description of many-body interactions between the hydrophobic solute particles. The solubility and aggregation of hydrophobic substances is studied by evaluating detailed Monte Carlo simulations {{in the vicinity of the}} first-order aggregation phase transition. A closed-loop coexistence curve is found, which is consistent with a mean-field calculation carried out for the same system. In addition, the destabilizing effect of a chaotropic substance in the solution is studied by suitable modification of the MLG model. These findings suggest that a simple model for the hydrophobic interaction may contain the primary physical processes involved in hydrophobic aggregation and in the chaotropic effect.

Hence, <b>non-polar</b> <b>solutes</b> {{tend not to}} be soluble in polar solvents because these solvent-solvent binding interactions must be overcome first.

40|$|Electric field {{produced}} {{inside a}} solute by a uniformly polarized liquid is strongly affected by dipolar polarization {{of the liquid}} at the interface. We show, by numerical simulations, that the electric "cavity" field inside a hydrated <b>non-polar</b> <b>solute</b> does not follow the predictions of standard Maxwell's electrostatics of dielectrics. Instead, the field inside the solute tends, with increasing solute size, to the limit predicted by the Lorentz virtual cavity. The standard paradigm fails because of its reliance on the surface charge density at the dielectric interface determined by the boundary conditions of the Maxwell dielectric. The interface of a polar liquid instead carries a preferential in-plane orientation of the surface dipoles thus producing virtually no surface charge. The resulting boundary conditions for electrostatic problems differ from the traditional recipes, affecting the microscopic and macroscopic fields based on them. We show that relatively small differences in cavity fields propagate into {{significant differences in the}} dielectric constant of an ideal mixture. The slope of the dielectric increment of the mixture versus the solute concentration depends strongly on which polarization scenario at the interface is realized. A much steeper slope found in the case of Lorentz polarization also implies a higher free energy penalty for polarizing such mixtures. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. (Chemical Engineering) Increasing {{pressure}} on industry from {{national and international}} communities for more environmentally friendly operations has generated a drive towards the use of ‘green’ absorbents in the removal of volatile organic compounds from contaminated air streams. The objective of this work {{was to investigate the}} use of ester solvents, especially biodiesel esters, as suitable ‘green’ scrubbing solvents for the absorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from gaseous waste streams. The objective was accomplished by investigating the nature of molecular interactions between ester solvents and various families of VOC solvents, and by studying the effect of temperature on absorption, through the analysis of infinite dilution activity coefficients. Activity coefficients were computed with a Microsoft Excel generated spread sheet using Modified UNIFAC Dortmund (1987) as a thermodynamic predictive model. Results show that non-polar solutes are more soluble in long chain ester solvents whilst polar solutes absorb easier in short chain ester solvents. The solubility of non-polar solutes decreases with increasing ester solvent unsaturation, whilst the opposite is true for polar solutes in esters. Short chain length non-polar solutes are more soluble than long chain length non-polar solutes in ester solvents, whilst the opposite trend occurs for polar solutes in ester solvents. An increase in branching of polar solutes results in the solute behaving more like a <b>non-polar</b> <b>solute.</b> Unfortunately UNIFAC models fail to account for functional group proximity effects, which may result in inaccurate results for systems involving highly branched solutes. However given that {{the purpose of this study}} was only to establish trends for generating an understanding of molecular interactions between the solutes and the solvent, it was acceptable to assume that these inaccuracies would be minor for the intended purpose. It was found that activity coefficients of ester/ solute interactions generally tend towards ideality with increasing temperature with the exception of alkanes and the nitrogen based VOCs, as well as tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran, methacrolein and organic acid/ unsaturated ester interactions. In the case of the alkanes, tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran, high-temperature absorption is preferred whilst for methacrolein lower temperature absorption is preferred. It was concluded that ester solvents,especially biodiesel esters, are well suited for the removal of non-polar to moderately polar VOC solutes from waste gas streams due to the favourably low activity coefficients obtained for these ester/ solute interactions. The results presented in this report are comprehensive and can assist in making informed decisions in using biodiesel as a scrubbing solvent...|$|E

Although <b>non-polar</b> <b>solutes</b> in water have been widely studied, much less work has focused on water in non-polar solvents. In this study we calculate the solubility of water in different alkanes (methane to dodecane) at ambient conditions where the water content in alkanes is very low so that the non-polar water-alkane interactions determine solubility.  Only the alkane-rich phase is simulated since the fugacity of water in the water rich phase is calculated from an accurate equation of state. Using the SPC/E model for water and TraPPE model for alkanes along with Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules for the cross parameters produces a water solubility that is an order of magnitude lower than the experimental value.

40|$|ABSTRACT Free {{energies}} of pairwise hydro-phobic association are simulated in aqueous solu-tions of urea at concentrations ranging from 08 M. Consistent {{with the expectation}} that hydrophobic interactions are weakened by urea, the association of relatively large nonpolar solutes is destabilized by urea. However, the association of two small methane-sized nonpolar solutes in water has the opposite tendency of being slightly strengthened by the addition of urea. Such size effects and the dependence of urea-induced stability changes on the conguration of nonpolar solutes are not pre-dicted by solvent accessible surface area approaches based on energetic parameters derived from bulk-phase solubilities of model compounds. Thus, to understand hydrophobic interactions in proteins, it is not sufcient to rely solely on transfer experiment data that effectively characterize a single nonpolar solute in an aqueous environment but not the sol-vent-mediated interactions among two or more <b>non-polar</b> <b>solutes.</b> We nd that the m-values for the rate of change of two-methane association free energy with respect to urea concentration is a dramatically nonmonotonic function of the spatial separation between the two methanes, with a distance-depen-dent prole similar to the corresponding two-methane heat capacity of association in pure water. Our results rationalize the persistence of residual hydrophobic contacts in some proteins at high urea concentrations and explain why the heat capacity signature (CP) of a compact denatured state can be similar to CP values calculated by assuming an open random-coil-like unfolded state.

By fitting a three term expression to isotherm plots of solute surface concentration vs. the concentration in the bulk solvent the two distribution constants {{as well as the}} maximum sorption capacity are determined. Isotherms for hydrocarbon-modified silica are determined for various solvents and solutes. Interpretation of sorption behavior is presented in terms of values determined for sorption capacity and the distribution coefficients. The isotherm model parameters are shown to correlate to the chromatographic retention parameter, k'. Sorption capacity is proposed as a more meaningful representation of the chromatographic phase ratio. Reversed-phase chromatographic retention and efficiency are shown to be affected by ion modifiers as well as the temperature history of a system when a totally aqueous mobile phase is used. The dynamic nature of the octylsilane modified surface is discussed in terms of changes which are induced by cations exchanged on the silica surface and imbibed organic solvent in the bonded hydrocarbon chain previously used to condition the surface.

30|$|The {{solubility}} of {{the target}} analyte in various solvents is governed by two independent parameters (which may, or may not, work together): the enthalpy of mixing (ΔH) and the entropy of mixing (ΔS). The solubilization of the analyte in the solvent is therefore favored when the dissolution process gives off energy (i.e., ΔH) and/or when the dissolution process increases entropy (ΔS). Since these two properties are interdependent, a favorable change in one may (or may not) offset an unfavorable change in the other. How the analyte molecule chemically interacts with the selected solvent will dictate whether the change in enthalpy is positive or negative, whether the change in entropy is positive or negative, and whether their combined sum yields a favorable Gibbs free energy of dissolution. The overall sum of these two terms {{is defined by the}} total relative contribution of all intermolecular forces that occur between the analyte and solvent molecules: Electrostatic, London forces, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic bonding. Consequently, the development of any solvent based extraction process must comprise a choice of solvent (or co-solvent mixture) that yields a set of chemical interactions between the analyte and solvent molecules that is more favorable than the chemical interactions between (i) the solvent molecules themselves (i.e., self association), and (ii) the analyte with the matrix it was already associated with. As a general rule analytes that strongly self associate dissolve best in strongly associated solvents, while analytes that weakly associate dissolve best in weakly associated solvents. In other words, polar solutes will dissolve in similarly polar solvents and <b>non-polar</b> <b>solutes</b> will dissolve better in similarly non-polar solvents [107].|$|R

Similar measurements carried out with a non-polar and a dipolar solute in an ionic liquid and a conventional solvent reveal that even in ionic liquids, apart from the viscosity of the medium, the important parameters, which govern the solute rotation are the solvent-size and free volume in case of <b>non-polar</b> <b>solutes,</b> whereas for charged and dipolar solutes, it is the solute-solvent interaction strength. Photoisomerization studies dealing with a pair of carbocyanine derivatives have shed light on the influence of solvent viscosity and specific interactions on the rates of photoisomerization.

However, when the isomerization rates are compared with a conventional isoviscous solvent, it has been noticed that the rates of isomerization are solely governed by viscosity of the medium in case of the positively charged cyanine derivative. In contrast, photoisomerization rates of the negatively charged cyanine derivative are significantly faster in a conventional isoviscous solvent compared to the ionic liquid due to the specific interactions between the solute and the former, which lower the barrier height for isomerization. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Research of ionic liquids (ILs) {{is one of}} {{the most}} rapidly growing fields in the past years, much of which has the {{ultimate}} aim of large scale industrial application [1]. Due to their unique properties such as negligible vapor pressure at room temperature, stable liquid phase over a wide temperature range and stability at high temperatures, ionic liquids created interest to use them in synthesis and extraction processes for the reduction of the amount of volatile organic solvents (VOSs) used in industry. So, it is very important to know how they interact with different solutes. Activity coefficients at infinite dilution of a solute i (γi∞) can be used to quantify the volatility of the solute as well as to provide information on the intermolecular energy between solvent and solute [2, 3]. Values of γi∞ are also important for evaluating the potential uses of ILs in liquid-liquid extraction and extractive distillation. Since ILs have a negligible vapor pressure, the gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) using the ionic liquid as stationary phase, is the most suitable method for measuring activity coefficients at infinite dilution γi∞. In our work, The activity coefficients at infinite dilution, γi∞, for both polar and <b>non-polar</b> <b>solutes</b> in the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate [EMIM][FAP] (CAS No. : 377739 - 43 - 0, Fig. 1 ） and 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate [EMIM][TCB] (CAS-No. : 742099 - 80 - 5, Fig. 2) have been determined by gas-liquid chromatography at different temperatures (from 303 K to 363 K).

The RA phase was characterised and shown to solve problems with difficult matrix effects in humic-containing surface water samples. Other pre-column materials, e. g. reversed-phase C 18, mono-functional C 18, extraction disk mixture of C 18 and styrene- divinylbenzene (PS-DVB) and LiChrolut EN, a polymeric sorbent specially designed for environmental analysis, were investigated and compared for their selectivity and stability, respectively. Comparisons were made with respect to selectivity and efficiency for the SPE columns separately and in combination with analytical columns. Recovery data and matrix dependencies were studied at concentration levels ranging between 0. 1 - 10 μg/l. The RA pre-columns showed superior stability in complex environmental matrices, such as reference humic water and river water, due to the restriction of macromolecules. Retention properties with the RA alkyl-diol-silica were not sufficient for the most polar metabolites.

The first chapter describes spectroscopic investigations of the solvent perturbations around solute molecules. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) {{has been used to}} deconvolve a set of Raman spectra with varying solute concentrations to bulk solvent spectrum and the solute-correlated spectrum. As an illustration of the method, we have extracted the solute-correlated spectra of Acetonitrile and cyclo-Hexane in 1, 2 -Dichloroethane which reveal changes of gauche/trans equilibrium in the solvation-shell around these polar and <b>non-polar</b> <b>solutes.</b> Perturbations of water around small organic solutes and ionic salts have also been studied. The results reveal a larger contribution to the perturbation comes from polar groups of the organic solutes. Results for aqueous nitrile and alcohol solutions with different hydrocarbon chain lengths suggest that water molecules around non polar groups are relatively unperturbed. This observation is supported by the calculated number of perturbed water molecules per solute which are much smaller than the total number of water molecules in the solvent-shell, as revealed by Molecular Dynamics and Neutron diffraction. Water perturbation around alkali halide salts are dominated by water around the anions, as also indicated by previous studies. Our results confirm the weaker hydrogen bonding as the size of the anion increases, virtually no perturbation from water around cations, and the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of perturbed water OH band decreases as the anion size increases. The observed number of perturbed water molecules per anion are in general agreement with previously reported estimates. Polarized Raman studies have also been conducted. The second chapter describes studies which demonstrate a surface enhanced resonance Raman scatteritn (SERRS) based method for reliably quantifing the concentrations with isotopically substituted Rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G) dyes. We have successfully used Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis to simultaneously quantify two and three dyes which have very similar spectral signatures, in the nanomolar range.

There is a specific focus on exploring and expanding our knowledge of hydrophobic interactions and the dewetting phenomenon. ^ First, partial molar volume simulations, performed over the entire ambient fluid temperature range, are used to investigate the volume changes associated with the hydration of idealized hydrophobic (hard sphere) particles of varying size. This provides insight into relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as the pressure derivative of the particle chemical potential. The results are used to develop a revised Cavity Equation of State (C-EOS) to better predict the partial molar volume of cavities from 0. 2 to at least 1 nm in size. ^ Second, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of solutes of varying size and polarity in water are implemented to determine and quantify several thermodynamic features of hydration. Simulations of solute-water interaction energies and hydration free energies are used to infer energy and entropy changes in response to solute attractive forces. Evaluation {{of the range of}} applicability and eventual break down of first and second order perturbation theory is discussed. Of particular interest are simulations of nanometer-sized solutes, as the behavior of water is expected to be quite different on that scale. Quantifying these interaction and free energies provides a first look at these distinctive thermodynamic features. ^ Finally, electric field strength calculations are performed on aqueous solutions of small molecules for comparison with experimental Raman spectra to elucidate spectral features that are obtained experimentally using Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR). Specifically, simulations have focused on confirming the assignment of a relatively sharp peak, found at ∼ 3660 cm- 1, to a dangling OH bond. Furthermore, simulations confirm that the strength of the hydrogen bonding around small organic solutes is shown to be slightly weaker than those of pure water. Finally, vibrational frequency simulations are investigated over the ambient fluid temperature range to evaluate effect of increasing temperature on the dangling OH and strength of H-bonds in the hydration shell around n-alkanes. ...|$|R

The temperature at which the divergence takes place is about 0. 5 to 1. 0 K higher than the transition temperature T_AN >.

2500|$|A popular aphorism {{used for}} {{predicting}} solubility is [...] "like dissolves like" [...] also {{expressed in the}} Latin language as [...] "Similia similibus solventur". This statement indicates that a solute will dissolve best in a solvent that has a similar chemical structure to itself. This view is simplistic, {{but it is a}} useful rule of thumb. The overall solvation capacity of a solvent depends primarily on its polarity. For example, a very polar (hydrophilic) solute such as urea is very soluble in highly polar water, less soluble in fairly polar methanol, and practically insoluble in non-polar solvents such as benzene. In contrast, a <b>non-polar</b> or lipophilic <b>solute</b> such as naphthalene is insoluble in water, fairly soluble in methanol, and highly soluble in non-polar benzene.|$|R
40|$|Membrane fouling, {{which is}} {{mainly caused by}} {{adsorption}} of <b>non-polar</b> <b>solutes</b> and hydrophobic particles, {{is directly related to}} hydrophobicity of the membrane, and thus membranes are often modified to improve their hydrophilicity. Membranes are modified via various techniques to improve their performance of which the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles in polymeric membranes has shown great potential. The effort to improve the membrane performance is still an ongoing progress and current trend in the field of membrane research is to develop new membrane materials and structures specifically to reduce fouling effects and to improve their function. A new two-dimensional zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) with leaf-shaped morphology (ZIF-L) was incorporated into polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membranes to investigate how the ZIF nanoflakes affect membrane properties. The modified UF membrane with 0. 5 % ZIF-L loading showed around 75 % increase in water flux while retaining its solute rejection. Also, the same membrane showed almost twice the fouling resistance with more than 80 % water flux recovery. The improvement was due to the combined effect of the more negative zeta potential of the modified membrane, increased hydrophilicity and reduced surface roughness. While studying the stability of ZIF-L in organic solvent for the preparation of PES membrane, a new phase transformation of a zinc- 2 -methylimidazole-based ZIF was discovered, from ZIF-L to ZIF- 8. The potential of the ZIF phase transformation in various solvents and also in solid phase were studied. Results indicated that the phase transformation occurs in the solid phase via the geometric contraction model (R 2), a kinetic model new to ZIF. This work demonstrates the first topotactic phase transformation in porous ZIFs, from a 2 D layered structure to a 3 D structure, and provides a new insight into metal–organic framework crystallization mechanisms. Additionally, nanoporous titania nanoparticles synthesized via hydrothermal reaction was doped into polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafiltration membranes at a low concentration to improve nanoparticles dispersion in dope solution. All modified membranes showed narrower pore size distribution as TiO 2 loading was increased. The composite membrane with 0. 5 % TiO 2 nanoparticles loading showed ~ 20 % increase in water flux and improvement in solute rejection (rejection of 100 kDa PEG from ~ 90 % to ~ 92 %). In addition, the same membrane showed improved fouling resistance (fouling rate of 0. 58 kPa/ min compared to 0. 70 kPa/ min of control membrane) with about 79 % water flux recovery due to increased hydrophilicity, reduced surface free energy and reduced pore size. Beyond optimum loading of TiO 2, the improvement was less significant due to the effect of agglomeration. Modification of the substrates’ properties {{is one of the most}} effective methods to improve the performance in forward osmosis (FO) process. A new Zn 2 GeO 4 nanowire-modified PES ultrafiltration substrate with increased surface porosity and high water flux was used as a substrate for the fabrication of thin film composite (TFC) FO membrane, by coating a thin layer of polyamide on top of the substrate. The composite TFC membrane showed ~ 45 % increase in water permeability and NaCl salt rejection of 80 % under RO mode. In FO mode, the ratio of water flux to reverse solute flux was improved...|$|R
40|$|Research of ionic liquids (ILs) {{is one of}} {{the most}} rapidly growing fields in the past years, much of which has the {{ultimate}} aim of large scale industrial application [1]. Due to their unique properties such as negligible vapor pressure at room temperature, stable liquid phase over a wide temperature range and stability at high temperatures, ionic liquids created interest to use them in the separations of gas mixtures and extraction processes. So, it is very important to know the solubility of the gases and liquid solutes in the IL phase. Gas chromatography has been considered to be a particularly convenient technique for the determination of the solubility of gases in nonvolatile liquids based on Henry’s law constants for a certain range of temperatures. Activity coefficients at infinite dilution of a solute i (γi∞) can be used to quantify the volatility of the solute as well as to provide information on the intermolecular energy between solvent and solute [2, 3]. Values of γi∞ are also important for evaluating the potential uses of ILs in liquid-liquid extraction and extractive distillation. In our work, The activity coefficients at infinite dilution, γi∞, for both polar and <b>non-polar</b> liquid <b>solutes</b> in the ionic liquid 1 -hydroxyethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([HOEMIM][PF 6]) and 1 -hydroxyethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium perfluorobutanesulfonate ([HOEMIM][CF 3 (CF 2) 3 SO 3]) have been determined by gas-liquid chromatography at different temperatures (from 303 K to 353 K). And the solubilities of O 2 and CO 2 in the ionic liquids: [HOEMIM][PF 6], [HOEMIM][CF 3 (CF 2) 3 SO 3], 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate [EMIM][FAP], 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate [EMIM][TCB], 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(oxalato) borate [BMIM][BOB], 1 -hexyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium bis(oxalato) borate [HMIM][BOB], N-alkylpyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([CnPY][NTf 2], n = 2, 4, 5) and [N 1123][RNHC 3 SO 3] (R= H, Bu) were studied by gas chromatography at T = 303 K, 313 K and 323 K. The partial molar excess enthalpies at infinite dilution HiE,∞ of the liquid solutes in the ionic liquids [HOEMIM][PF 6] and [HOEMIM][CF 3 (CF 2) 3 SO 3] were also calculated from the temperature dependence of the γi∞ values. The selectivities for the hexane/benzene and cyclohexane/benzene separation problems were calculated from experimental infinite dilution activity coefficient values and compared to the other ionic liquids, taken from the recent literature. 中国科学院大连化学物理研究...|$|R
