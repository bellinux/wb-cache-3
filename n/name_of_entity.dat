Users need to browse web pages for further information desired. Several sites also displays a lot of images that resulted in long waiting times, big internet traffic consumption, heavy and impressed when accessed via mobile phone. Based on these problems, then application named Chit Chat Cinema was built. This application is an implementation of the Question Answering System where users simply enter question by using Indonesian language and it will give an appropriate answer. Questions that can be recognized is the title of movie based on a particular actor, now playing movie, coming soon movie, duration, actor's name whose played by particular movie title, genre, and synopsis. Web service that located on server created using NodeJS and MySQL database. Question processing methods are tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and rule-based named entity recognition. Process model is sequential linear. From 260 questions were tested, there are 208 questions can answered correctly. The system gives wrong answer if question use unknown pattern, contain words that aren’t recognized, and the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>entity</b> is an Indonesian loan word...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ontology mapping {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tasks for on-tology interoperability and its main aim is to find semantic relationships between entities (i. e. concept, attribute, and relation) of two ontologies. However, most of the current methods only consider one to one (1 : 1) mappings. In this paper we propose a new approach (CHM: Concept Hi-erarchy based Mapping approach) which can find simple (1 : 1) mappings and complex (m: 1 or 1 :m) mappings simultaneously. First, we propose a new method to represent the concept names of entities. This method is based on the hierarchical structure of an ontology such that each con-cept <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>entity</b> in the ontology is included in a set. The parent-child relationship in the hierarchical structure of an ontology is then extended as a set-inclusion relationship between the sets for the parent and the child. Second, we compute the similarities between entities based on the new representation of entities in ontologies. Third, after generating the mapping candidates, we select the best mapping result for each source entity. We design a new algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for se-lecting the mapping results. Finally, we obtain simple (1 : 1) and complex (m: 1 or 1 :m) mappings. Our experimental results and comparisons with related work indicate that utilizing this method in dealing with ontology mapping is a promising way to improve the overall mapping results. ...|$|E

First, we analyze Japanese named enti-ties which appear in Mainichi Newspaper articles published in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2005. This analysis reveals that the number <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> types and the number <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> tokens are almost steady over time and that 70 ∼ 80 % <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> types in a certain year occur in the articles published either in its succeeding year or in its preceding year. These facts lead that 20 ∼ 30 % <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entity</b> types are replaced with new ones every year.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Named {{entities}} play {{an important}} role in Information Extraction. They represent unitary namable information within text. In this work, we focus on groups <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entities</b> <b>of</b> the same type which we try to extract from HTML lists. Instead of starting from a class and identifying the corresponding named entities, we want to explore a new paradigm which consists in identifying sets <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entities</b> without any knowledge on the class. A clear advantage of the approach is that it is applicable to all named entities (no matter what class), which makes it domain independent. We use HTML lists to collect candidate sets <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entities.</b> Human assessors assessed a randomly selected sample of HTML lists. 8, 25 % of these HTML lists are lists <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entities</b> <b>of</b> the same class. If our estimation is validated at large scale, it is possible to expect at least 890 million of such lists <b>of</b> <b>named</b> <b>entities</b> only in the indexed Web. Moreover, we propose an appropriate classifier which shows promising results. RÉSUMÉ. Les entités nommées jouent un rôle important en extraction d’information.

Further, we describe how to make use of both types of synonyms to increase the retrieval effectiveness, i. e., query expansion with time-independent synonyms for an ordinary search, and query expansion with time-dependent synonyms for a search wrt. temporal criteria.
