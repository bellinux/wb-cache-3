50|$|The Constitution of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> was proclaimed on 29 March 1955 by Order-in-Council for the Kingdom. Together {{with the}} Island Regulation of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> it formed the {{constitutional}} {{basis for the}} <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> Because the Constitution depended on the Island Regulation, which gave fairly large autonomy to the different island territories, and the Island Regulation was older than the Constitution, many scholars describe the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> as a federal arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The new {{constitution}} was only deemed an interim arrangement, as negotiations for a Charter for the Kingdom were already under way. On 15 December 1954 the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles,</b> Suriname and the Netherlands acceded as equal partners to an overarching Kingdom of the Netherlands, {{established by the}} Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. With this move, the United Nations deemed decolonization of the territory complete and removed the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> from the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.Aruba seceded from the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> on 1 January 1986, {{paving the way for}} a series of referenda among the remaining islands {{on the future of the}} <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> Whereas the ruling parties campaigned for the dissolution of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles,</b> the people voted for a restructuring of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> The coalition campaigning for this option became the Party for the Restructured Antilles, which ruled the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> for much of the time until its dissolution on 10 October 2010.|$|R

This sparked a new referendum cycle across the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> At the same time, a commission composed of representatives from the Netherlands and all the islands of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> investigated {{the future of the}} <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles.</b> In its 2004 report, the commission advised a revision of the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands in order to dissolve the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles,</b> so that Curaçao and Sint Maarten would become countries of their own within the Kingdom, while Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba would become [...] "Kingdom islands." ...|$|R

Despite the fact that Aruban calls for secession from the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> originated in the 1930s, the governments of the Netherlands and the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> did everything in their power to keep the six islands together. The Netherlands did this so as {{to make sure that the}} <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> could become independent as soon as possible, a call that became increasingly louder in the Netherlands after the Willemstad riots of 1969 in Curaçao. The government of the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> feared that the whole <b>Netherlands</b> <b>Antilles</b> would disintegrate if one of the islands seceded; Antillean Prime Minister Juancho Evertsz once famously remarked that [...] "six minus one equals zero".|$|R
