Although {{the high-end}} technical market has not traditionally been an area of strength for Apple, {{the company has been}} positioning itself as a leader in <b>non-linear</b> <b>digital</b> <b>editing</b> for high-definition video, which demands storage and memory far in excess of a general desktop machine. Additionally, the codecs used in these applications are generally processor intensive and highly threadable, which Apple's ProRes white paper describes as scaling almost linearly with additional processor cores. Apple's previous machine aimed at this market, the Power Mac G5, has up to two dual-core processors (marketed as [...] "Quad-Core"), but lacks the storage expansion capabilities of the newer design.|$|E

50|$|The term {{telecine}} refers both to a film-to-tape transferring machine, {{as well as}} {{the process}} by which film is transferred to tape (or directly to a digital file). The telecine process is frequently used by filmmakers to transfer production footage to video, which can then be captured by various <b>non-linear</b> <b>digital</b> <b>editing</b> systems (e.g., Final Cut Pro, Avid, etc.).|$|E

40|$|This thesis, {{in support}} of the {{enclosed}} documentary film. Your Mother, Your Mother, Your Mother, Your Father, aims to examine the production and editing process in documentary making in the context of <b>digital</b> <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing.</b> I have built a discussion around the application of <b>digital</b> <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> in terms of style, artistic integrity and informed consent. The first chapter deals with notions of developing a documentary story, its angle and spin. The second chapter examines the dilemma of ethical practice in making a documentary in reaction to market values, and subjectivity being a significant element of journalist 2 ̆ 7 s conscience. The third chapter discusses the process of the documentary film 2 ̆ 7 s editing. The thesis attempts to make transparent the thinking processes involved in making the film. The thinking was initially around what would be compelling for audiences and later became an inner, personal and subjective thinking process as the filmmaker became involved in relationship with the consenting subjects in the fikn...|$|R
50|$|When George Lucas {{recruited}} {{people from}} NYIT in 1979 {{to start the}} Computer Division, the group was set to develop digital optical printing, <b>digital</b> audio, <b>digital</b> <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> and computer graphics. Where computer graphics were concerned, the quality was just not good enough due to technological limitations at the time. The team then decided {{to solve the problem}} by starting a hardware project, building what they would call the Pixar Image Computer, a machine with more computational power that was able to produce images with higher resolution.|$|R
5000|$|WRTV {{has brought}} forth several {{technological}} innovations over the years; {{it was the}} first television station in Indiana to record local programming on videotape and to use mini-cams for newsgathering purposes. Channel 6 was also the first in the state to use microwave relays (years prior to the use of satellite transmissions for newsgathering) to provide live remote footage from the field ("Insta-Cam"), the first to use a mobile satellite uplink vehicle (NewStar 6) to provide live video from remote locations, the first to convert to <b>non-linear</b> <b>digital</b> <b>editing</b> for news content, the first to use digital news cameras and the first to provide VODcasting. In 1988, the station debuted a half-hour 5:00 p.m. newscast, becoming the first station in the market to carry an early evening news program in that timeslot. In the mid-1990s, the station launched a 24-hour cable news channel NewsChannel 64, which later evolved into [...] "6 News 24/7" [...] and began to be carried on digital subchannel 6.2 by the late 2000s.|$|E
5000|$|Apple {{stated that}} an Intel-based {{replacement}} for the PowerPC-based Power Mac G5 machines had been expected for some time before the Mac Pro was formally announced on August 7, 2006 at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The iMac, Mac Mini, MacBook, and MacBook Pro had moved to an Intel-based architecture starting in January 2006, leaving the Power Mac G5 as the only machine in the Mac lineup still based on the PowerPC processor architecture Apple had used since 1993. Apple had dropped the term [...] "Power" [...] from the other machines in their lineup, and started using [...] "Pro" [...] on their higher-end laptop offerings. As such, the name [...] "Mac Pro" [...] was widely used before the machine was announced.The Mac Pro is in the Unix workstation market. Although the high-end technical market has not traditionally been an area of strength for Apple, {{the company has been}} positioning itself as a leader in <b>non-linear</b> <b>digital</b> <b>editing</b> for high-definition video, which demands storage and memory far in excess of a general desktop machine.

40|$|Two {{graphical}} {{user interfaces}} to a Video-on-Demand system are described. Each interface allows a user to compose and submit queries to a metadata database for execution, thus helping the user find video data. The first interface is a full-function WYSIWYG interface implemented in Tcl/Tk. The second interface uses the World Wide Web to support {{a subset of the}} queries allowed by the first interface. Both interfaces support complex queries to a variety of indexes that contain bibliographic, structural, content-based, keyword, and representational information.

50|$|Reverse {{telecine}} {{is crucial}} when acquiring film material into a <b>digital</b> <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> system such as Lightworks, Sony Vegas Pro, Avid, or Final Cut Pro, since these machines produce negative cut lists which refer to specific frames {{in the original}} film material. When video from a telecine is ingested into these systems, the operator usually has available a “telecine trace,” {{in the form of}} a text file, which gives the correspondence between the video material and film original. Alternatively, the video transfer may include telecine sequence markers “burned in” to the video image along with other identifying information such as time code.|$|R
50|$|As in most <b>digital</b> <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> applications, the Browser {{is not an}} {{interface}} to the computer's file-system. It is {{an entirely}} virtual space in which references to clips (aliases) are placed for easy access, and arranged in folders called 'bins'. Since they are only references to clips {{that are on the}} media drive of the computer, moving or deleting a source file on the media hard drive destroys the link between the entry in the Browser and the actual media. This results in a 'media offline' situation, and the media must be 'reconnected'. Final Cut Pro can search for the media itself, or the user can do this manually. If multiple clips are offline at the same time, Final Cut can reconnect all the offline media clips that are in the relative directory path as the first offline media clips that is reconnected.|$|R
40|$|This autoethnographic study {{examines}} {{the influences of}} recent digital technology upon the practice and philosophy of documentary filmmaking. To {{assess the impact of}} new digital methodology on the film production process, The Musicians, a wholly-digital, 55 -minute documentary film, was produced as an example. This music-based subject was chosen to specifically demonstrate the potential advantages of lightweight digital equipment and its extended recording capacity in orchestral documentation. The capability of <b>non-linear</b> <b>digital</b> <b>editing</b> to process large amounts of imagery, together with its ability to manage multiple image and audio streams concurrently, was also examined. This exegesis also reviews the impact of recently-emerged digital multimedia and multi-platform formats on perceptions of the more standard linear documentary format, all of which have been incorporated into a single documentary category by some researchers. For a traditional documentary such as The Musicians to be categorised with open-ended, multimedia constructions seems somewhat anomalous...|$|E
5000|$|... iMovie '08 (Version 7.0) was {{released}} in August 2007 {{as a part of}} the iLife '08 suite. iMovie '08 was a complete redesign and rewrite of iMovie. It had much better HD output, and more formats to convert to. This was limited, however, by an undocumented restriction on supported codecs. iPhoto uses the QuickTime library and can create thumbnails for all QuickTime supported formats, but most of these cannot be used by iMovie '08. Some of the formats that iMovie '08 is able to import will not be recognized when they are added to an iPhoto library. Though Motion JPEG-encoded AVI files do appear to be recognized, this was the most common format used by digital cameras. The tile-based editing interface was also promoted as something unique and groundbreaking, even though it is functionally identical to the interface of the Toaster Flyer <b>non-linear</b> <b>digital</b> video <b>editing</b> systems released for Amiga computers by NewTek, Inc. in 1993. A new feature called [...] "skimming" [...] for quickly previewing video in the library at a user controlled speed was added, and so was a feature that allows the user to highlight parts of video clips just like highlighting text. iMovie 08 also had the ability to add more than two layers of background sound, including multiple music, narration and sound effects; previous versions could play multiple tracks but could display only two extra audio tracks. It included more exportation formats, including iPhone-sized video. It also supported non-tape-based HD video, such as AVCHD and footage from DVD and HDD camcorders. iMovie '08 also has the ability to export movies to the YouTube video sharing website.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{technologies}} {{used to make}} films have changed completely during the 90 -year life of sound film, the film making workflow has remained strangely unaffected. We still make films {{as if they are}} shot on film that has to be developed and printed by a lab, mechanically cut and spliced by a film editor and sound edited on mag tape. The transition to digital cameras and sound recorders and <b>digital</b> <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> machines and audio work-stations, has had very little impact on the working practices of the film industry. This article proposes to change that. The transition in to a non-linear workflow would enable everyone involved in film post-production to collaborate in a more dynamic and creative way. By allowing more time for the sound editor and picture editor to experiment with sound in the editing process, more informed choices can be made in this critical phase. It would also enable the sound editors to have creative collaborations not only with the editor and the director, but also with the composer...|$|R
