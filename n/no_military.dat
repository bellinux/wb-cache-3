5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served <b>no</b> <b>military</b> purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the ADF had <b>no</b> <b>military</b> {{units on}} {{operational}} deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF {{made its first}} operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji {{in response to the}} 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E
5|$|Most of the F-FDTL's {{weapons and}} other {{equipment}} have been provided by foreign donors, and {{this is likely to}} remain the case in the future.

Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|Octavian also {{demanded that}} the decree should be {{rescinded}} which declared Antony a public enemy. When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions.

Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading Caesarian.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on Daley's military record. The only book-length {{biography of}} Daley {{makes no mention}} of military service. A 1995 profile in the Chicago Sun-Times stated that Daley served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 1961 to 1967, while a 1996 profile in People Magazine cited 1960 to 1964. A civilian website for Marines and their families found <b>no</b> <b>military</b> record for Daley.|$|E

5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{specifies}} that <b>no</b> <b>military</b> installations {{are permitted}} on the archipelago.

5|$|The {{country was}} bombed by the Allies on 27 June 1944, {{killing at least}} 35. The Sammarinese {{government}} declared {{the same day that}} <b>no</b> <b>military</b> installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter. In early July, it announced that prominent signs had been put up at the border crossings by the German command, to instruct German units not to enter the territory, and again reiterated its complete neutrality.|$|E
5|$|After Abraham Lincoln's {{election}} as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union {{to form a}} new government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, one of the last federal outposts in the South, beginning the Civil War. Although he had <b>no</b> <b>military</b> training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.|$|E

5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had <b>no</b> <b>military</b> purpose.|$|E
5|$|As abandoned, Utah {{cleared her}} berth. There was no further attempt to refloat her; unlike the battleships sunk at Battleship Row, she had <b>no</b> <b>military</b> value. She was {{formally}} placed {{out of commission}} on 5 September 1944, and then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November. Utah received one battle star for her brief service during World War II. Her rusting hulk remains in Pearl Harbor, partially above water; the men killed when Utah sank were never removed from the wreck, and as such, she is considered a war grave.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on the island. Flat Holm was re-armed with four 4.5-inch guns and associated searchlights for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two 40mm Bofors guns. A GL (Gun Laying) Mk II radar station was also placed in {{the centre of the}} island. The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff, Barry, and Flat Holm. These works were abandoned after the war and the island has had <b>no</b> <b>military</b> use since. Flat Holm's helipad still remains, however, at the centre of the island.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving <b>no</b> <b>military</b> command. He could have maintained contact with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} at Alkozai and Balandi, Bales handed himself over into ISAF custody.

A patrol was dispatched to find the missing soldier, but did not find him before he returned to base after the killings. He was reportedly taken into custody without incident. There were <b>no</b> <b>military</b> operations being conducted in the area {{at the time of the}} shootings.|$|E
5|$|Historian R. E. Smith {{notes that}} there was a need to raise {{additional}} legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps with little or <b>no</b> <b>military</b> experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} this goal, the ADF was {{restructured}} {{to increase its}} ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing {{the capabilities of the}} RAN and RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the ADF had <b>no</b> <b>military</b> units on operational deployment outside Australia. However, in 1987 the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain {{and as a result}} the coastal defences {{received}} little attention; surveys reported multiple problems with Tilbury Fort including flooding caused by the estuary tides, and ferry passengers and animals making their way uninvited into the fort. In 1642 civil war broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Tilbury was controlled by Parliament, who placed the Tilbury and Gravesend forts under the command of a military governor, using them to control traffic entering London and to search for spies; it saw <b>no</b> <b>military</b> action during the war. Tilbury remained in use during the interregnum, having a garrison of three officers and sixty-six men in 1651.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{under the}} novel {{conditions}} of attrition warfare, war pigeons in their traditional role as pigeon post saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote {{found its way}} to the Battle of Verdun, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the Battle of the Somme. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had <b>no</b> <b>military</b> value and further experiments were not justified.|$|E
