Once charged, it generated a magnetic field for roughly an 8-hour period. Overall, the ring weighed 450 kilograms and levitated 1.6 meters above a superconducting ring. [...] The ring produced roughly a 5-tesla field. [...] This superconductor was encased inside a liquid helium, which kept the electromagnet below 10 kelvins.
