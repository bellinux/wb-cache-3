500|$|In September 1972, Vulović {{expressed}} {{willingness to}} resume {{working as a}} flight attendant. The airline apparently felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. Vulović was celebrated as a national hero and decorated by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. The Serbian folk singer Miroslav Ilić recorded a song in her honour, titled Vesna stjuardesa ("Vesna the Stewardess"). She continued to fly regularly and stated that fellow passengers were surprised to see her on flights. [...] "People always want to sit <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the plane," [...] she remarked.|$|E
6000|$|... "And only once, I think," [...] {{said the}} young girl, {{slightly}} coloring. [...] "He {{happened to be}} sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> deck, and I believe he spoke only out of politeness. At least, he seemed very quiet and reserved, and talked on general topics, and I thought very intelligently. I--should have thought--I mean," [...] she continued hesitatingly--"I thought he was an educated gentleman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was searched, and the {{handkerchief}} was discovered on me. The {{woman who had}} stood <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>on</b> finding herself threatened with discovery, had no doubt contrived to slip the stolen handkerchief into my pocket. Only an accomplished thief could have escaped detection in that way without my knowledge. It was useless, {{in the face of}} the facts, to declare my innocence. I had no character to appeal to. My friend tried to speak for me; but what was she? Only a lost woman like myself. My landlady's evidence in favor of my honesty produced no effect; it was against her that she let lodgings to people in my position. I was prosecuted, and found guilty. The tale of my disgrace is now complete, Mr. Holmcroft. No matter whether I was innocent or not, the shame of it remains--I have been imprisoned for theft.|$|E

"As for {{property}} deteriorating {{on account of}} our advent into that neighborhood, I know it cannot be so, because {{all of us are}} paying higher rentals than the white occupants who immediately preceded us, and there is no better criterion of value than the rent a property brings. I have lived now for several months with white people <b>next</b> door <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> either hand, and we have never had the slightest difficulty. I do not try to associate with them socially any more than they with me, and I am sure none of us have any such desire, nor will any attempt be made on my part." ...|$|R

There are people that tell me that it’s pointless to cheer from the sidelines because the cyclists can’t hear you, but this image alone begs to differ. [URL]...|$|R
6000|$|By and by {{the gentleman}} comes-to a little, and passing his hand gloomily across his forehead, reseats himself in his former chair. There is a long silence, {{and this time the}} lady begins. ‘I appealed to Mr. Jenkins, who sat <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the sofa in the drawing-room during tea—’ ‘Morgan, you mean,’ {{interrupts}} the gentleman. ‘I do not mean anything of the kind,’ answers the lady. ‘Now, by all that is aggravating and impossible to bear,’ cries the gentleman, clenching his hands and looking upwards in agony, ‘she is going to insist upon it that Morgan is Jenkins!’ ‘Do you take me for a perfect fool?’ exclaims the lady; ‘do you suppose I don’t know the one from the other? Do you suppose I don’t know that the man in the blue coat was Mr. Jenkins?’ ‘Jenkins in a blue coat!’ cries the gentleman with a groan; ‘Jenkins in a blue coat! a man who would suffer death rather than wear anything but brown!’ ‘Do you dare to charge me with telling an untruth?’ demands the lady, bursting into tears. ‘I charge you, ma’am,’ retorts the gentleman, starting up, ‘with being a monster of contradiction, a monster of aggravation, a—a—a—Jenkins in a blue coat!—what have I done that I should be doomed to hear such statements!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|I here {{recall a}} lady who sat <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the coach that took me from Minehead to Lynton. The lady resided at Lynton, and finding that I was visiting the place for the first time, she {{proceeded}} to describe its attractions with fluent enthusiasm. When {{we arrived at the}} town, and were moving very slowly into it, my companion turned and examined my face, waiting to hear the expressions of rapturous admiration that would fall from my lips. Said I, [...] "There is one thing you can boast of in Lynton. So far as I know, it is the only town in the country where, sitting in your own room with the windows open, you can listen to the song of the wood wren." [...] Her face fell. She had never heard of the wood wren, and when I pointed to the tree from which the sound came and she listened and heard, she turned away, evidently too disgusted to say anything. She had been wasting her eloquence on an unworthy subject--one who was without appreciation for the sublime and beautiful in nature. The wild romantic Lynn, tumbling with noise and foam over its rough stony bed, the vast wooded hills, the piled-up black rocks (covered in places with beautiful red and blue lettered advertisements), had been passed by in silence--nothing had stirred me but the chirping of a miserable little bird, which, for all that she knew or cared, might be a sparrow! When we got down from the coach a couple of minutes later, she walked away without even saying good-bye.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the first}} fire of the regulars, I thought, and so stated to Ebenezer Munroe ...who stood <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the left, {{that they had}} fired nothing but powder; but on the second firing, Munroe stated they had fired {{something}} more than powder, for he had received a wound in his arm; and now, said he, to use his own words, ''''I'll give them the guts of my gun.'''' We then both took aim at {{the main body of}} British troops the smoke preventing our seeing anything but the heads of some of their horses and discharged our pieces.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dear {{attractive}} woman number 2, {{only once in}} my life have I responded to a person the way I've responded to you, but I've forgotten when it was or {{even if it was}} in fact me that responded. I may not know much, but I know that the wind sings your name endlessly, although with a slight lisp that makes it difficult to understand if I'm standing near an air conditioner. I know that your hair sits atop your head as though it could sit nowhere else. I know that your figure would make a sculptor cast aside his tools, injuring his assistant who was looking out the window instead of paying attention. I know that your lips are as full as that sexy French model that I desperately want to fuck. I know that if for an instant I could have you lie <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> or <b>on</b> top of <b>me,</b> or sit <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> or stand over me and shake, then I would be the happiest man in my pants. I know all of this, and yet you do not know me. Change your life; accept my love. Or, at least let <b>me</b> pay you <b>to</b> accept it." ...|$|R
60|$|The smooth, moon-like, expressionless virgin face, rather {{pale and}} touching, rather frightened, of the girl-child. A perfect face from a mediaeval picture. It moves one strangely. Why? It is so unconscious, {{as we are}} conscious. Like a little muted animal it sits there, in distress. She {{is going to be}} sick. She goes into the {{corridor}} and is sick--very sick, leaning her head like a sick dog on the window-ledge. Jupiter towers above her--not unkind, and apparently feeling no repugnance. The physical convulsion of the girl does not affect him as it affects us. He looks on unmoved, merely venturing to remark that she had eaten too much before coming on to the train. An obviously true remark. After which he comes and talks a few common-places <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> By and by the girl-child creeps in again and {{sits on the edge of}} the seat facing Juno. But no, says Juno, if she is sick she will be sick over me. So Jupiter accommodatingly changes places with the girl-child, who is thus <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> She sits <b>on</b> the edge of the seat with folded little red hands, her face pale and expressionless. Beautiful the thin line of her nut-brown eyebrows, the dark lashes of the silent, pellucid dark eyes. Silent, motionless, like a sick animal.|$|R
5000|$|After {{releasing}} another live album, Ilse went on {{and started}} working on new material. The single <b>Next</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me</b> was released in July, 2010 and reached a #9-spot. Her first EP <b>Next</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me,</b> was released at August 27, 2010. The album only included eight tracks, Ilse explaining that [...] "...she wanted to release new material more often, but due to a heavy touring schedule and contractual obligations didn't {{have the time to}} record a whole album". Second single Beautiful Distraction charted at #18 and third single Carousel peaked at #32. In early 2011, <b>Next</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me</b> has been certified 2x Platinum.|$|R

50|$|Following {{theological}} {{studies and}} ordination, {{he went to}} Paris, where he met Bloom. As {{he said in the}} Foley interview:It was a class on Plato taught by a Dominican very well known in those days named Festugiere. It was a lousy course, quite frankly. Bloom sat <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> my left and would make little comments to me on the text, comments which I found more interesting than Festugiere's. Those teachers, outstanding as their reputation may have been, were no great shakes.At first I was a little bit shocked by Bloom's remarks. I had an innate reverence for famous people, and these were extremely well-known scholars, and it offended me to hear these things said about them.|$|E

5000|$|The Armenian {{entry for}} the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 was {{internally}} {{selected by the}} AMPTV. On 25 September 2015, the broadcaster released a teaser video indicating that an artist had been selected and that their name would be announced on 13 October 2015.
