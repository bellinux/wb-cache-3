25|$|Ethane {{forms the}} {{simplest}} case {{for studying the}} conformation of alkanes, as {{there is only one}} C–C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C–C bond, one will see the so-called <b>Newman</b> <b>projection.</b> The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation.|$|E

The groups on the right hand side of a Fischer projection are equivalent to those below {{the plane of the}} ring in Haworth projections.

40|$|AbstractConformational {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the significant subjects in the organic chemistry curriculum. Since this subject may be intricate for some beginner students, a concrete model (an activity) has been devised to explain the conformational concepts with an intriguing and simple method. This model is based on geometric shapes (particularly triangles) in which the revolution of each shape on its axis at the centroid (around its vertices and edges) simulates the rotation about a single bond in a molecule. If we take edges as lower energy (more stable) and vertices as higher energy (less stable), this revolution gives a graph almost identical to the actual conformational energy diagram of that molecule. These shapes can also incorporate into the <b>Newman</b> <b>projections</b> to form a tangible representation of these notations. Most of the participants, who got familiar with these newly modified <b>Newman</b> <b>projections,</b> found them beneficial in enhancing the students’ perception of the basic conformational properties of the molecules. Furthermore, searching for a relevant shape to match the right molecule serves as an activity that in addition to being enjoyable can encourage the students to get engaged with the topic. This model is applicable to a large variety of molecules such as the hydrocarbon, aldehyde and ketone molecules, which can also generalize to more functional groups and compounds...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Newman</b> <b>projection</b> and the {{sawhorse}} projection {{are used}} to depict specific conformers or to distinguish vicinal stereochemistry. In both cases, two specific carbon atoms and their connecting bond are the center of attention. The only difference is a slightly different perspective: the <b>Newman</b> <b>projection</b> looking straight down the bond of interest, the sawhorse projection {{looking at the same}} bond but from a somewhat oblique vantage point. In the <b>Newman</b> <b>projection,</b> a circle is used to represent a plane perpendicular to the bond, distinguishing the substituents on the front carbon from the substituents on the back carbon.

50|$|Several {{other methods}} for {{depicting}} chemical structures are also {{commonly used in}} organic chemistry (though less frequently than skeletal formulae). For example, conformational structures look similar to skeletal formulae and are used to depict the approximate positions of the atoms in a molecule, as a perspective drawing. Other types of representations, e.g., <b>Newman</b> <b>projections,</b> Haworth projections and Fischer projections, also look somewhat similar to skeletal formulae. However, {{there are differences in}} the conventions used, and the reader needs to be aware of them {{in order to understand the}} structural details that are encoded in these depictions.|$|R
40|$|AbstractStudents’ {{understanding}} of molecular structure {{through the use}} of two dimensional diagrammatic representations is essential for chemistry learning. However, several researches suggest that students exhibit difficulties in achieving representational competence with molecular diagrams. This study is focused on three forms of diagrammatic representations: <b>Newman</b> <b>projections</b> (NP), Fisher projections (FP) and Dash-Wedge diagrams (DW). Three computer based diagram matching tests were designed, developed and implemented to 33 undergraduates from our chemistry department. Students’ visuospatial skills and prior chemistry knowledge were also assessed. The findings of this pilot study were derived from the analysis of participants’ performance (scores and response times) in the matching diagrams tests, the spatial tests and the Chemistry test. Statistical analysis was performed in order to investigate the relationships between the examined cognitive factors and students’ performance in matching diagrams...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two parts. In a Part A the role of computational chemistry in organic chemistry and particularly in synthesis planning is reviewed. The relevance of stereochemistry and of {{the implementation of a}} sophisticated module for the perception of the molecules stereochemical features in systems designed to assist the synthetic chemist is highlighted. Particular reference is made to LHASA (Logic and Heuristics Applied ti Synthetic Analysis) and to its perception module whose development is described. The implementation of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) system for the identification and specification of stereogenic units is described in detail. The new stereochemistry perception module introduces a significant extension in LHASA capacity for the identification, classification and specification of parochial, chiral and pseudo asymmetric centres, as well as stereogenic double bonds. The CIP system is also reviewed and criticized and some modifications are proposed to overcome its omissions and ambiguities. In part B role of computers in education and particularly in chemical education reviewed. An interactive drill and practice program for students with a basic knowledge stereochemistry, Tetrahedron, is descried. The aims of this program are the development and test of the ability to interpret common two-dimensional diagrams (perspective and Fisher formulas and <b>Newman</b> <b>projections)</b> and to apply the methodology for the specification of stereogenic centres and double bondsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

5000|$|Melvin Spencer Newman (March 10, 1908 [...] - [...] May 30, 1993) was an American chemist, Ohio State University professor, {{best known}} for inventing the <b>Newman</b> <b>projection.</b>|$|E
50|$|This <b>Newman</b> <b>projection</b> {{illustrates}} the Cornforth and Felkin transition state that places the EWG anti- to the incoming nucleophile, {{regardless of its}} steric bulk relative to RS and RL.|$|E
50|$|Such a {{conformation}} {{exists in}} any open chain single chemical bond connecting two sp3-hybridised atoms, and is normally a conformational energy minimum. For some molecules {{such as those}} of n-butane, there can be special versions of staggered conformations called gauche and anti; see first <b>Newman</b> <b>projection</b> diagram in Conformational isomerism.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Newman</b> <b>projection,</b> {{useful in}} alkane stereochemistry, visualizes {{chemical}} conformations of a carbon-carbon chemical bond {{from front to}} back, with the front carbon represented by a dot and the back carbon as a circle (see below). The front carbon atom is called proximal, while the back atom is called distal. This type of representation is useful for assessing the torsional angle between bonds.|$|E
50|$|In {{the example}} of ethane in <b>Newman</b> <b>projection</b> it shows that {{rotation}} around the carbon-carbon bond is not entirely free but that an energy barrier exists. The ethane molecule in the eclipsed conformation is said to suffer from torsional strain and by a rotation around the carbon carbon bond to the staggered conformation around 12.5 kJ/mol of torsional energy is released.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the example}} of {{staggered}} ethane in <b>Newman</b> <b>projection,</b> a hydrogen atom on one carbon atom has a 60° torsional angle or torsion angle [...] {{with respect to the}} nearest hydrogen atom on the other carbon so that steric hindrance is minimised. The staggered conformation is more stable by 12.5 kJ/mol than the eclipsed conformation, which is the energy maximum for ethane. In the eclipsed conformation the torsional angle is minimised.|$|E
50|$|In the {{reaction}} mechanism proposed by Takai, chromium(II) is oxidized to chromium(III) when replacing both halogen atoms. The geminal carbodianion complex thus formed reacts with the aldehyde in a 1,2-addition {{along one of}} the carbon to chromium bonds {{and in the next}} step both chromium bearing groups engage in an elimination reaction. In <b>newman</b> <b>projection</b> it can be seen how the steric bulks of chromium groups and the steric bulks of the alkyl and halogen groups drive this reaction towards anti elimination.|$|E
50|$|The {{preference}} {{for the formation of}} the threo isomer {{can be explained by the}} rule stated above by having the active nucleophile in this reaction attacking the carbonyl group from the least hindered side (see <b>Newman</b> <b>projection</b> A) when the carbonyl is positioned in a staggered formation with the methyl group and the hydrogen atom, which are the two smallest substituents creating a minimum of steric hindrance, in a gauche orientation and phenyl as the most bulky group in the anti conformation.|$|E
50|$|Determining the axial {{stereochemistry}} of biaryl atropisomers can {{be accomplished}} {{through the use of}} a <b>Newman</b> <b>projection</b> along the axis of hindered rotation. The ortho, and in some cases meta substituents are first assigned priority based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rules. Starting with the substituent of highest priority in the closest ring and moving along the shortest path to the substituent of highest priority in the other ring, the absolute configuration is assigned P for clockwise and M for counterclockwise. In the example shown, A has priority over B.|$|E
50|$|Anti-periplanar is a {{term used}} in organic {{chemistry}} to describe the A-B-C-D bond angle in a molecule. In this conformer, the dihedral angle of the A-B bond and the C-D bond is between +150° and -150° (see Figures 1 and 2). Anti-periplanar is often used in textbooks to mean strictly anti-coplanar, with an A-B C-D dihehedral angle of 180° (see Figure 3). In a <b>Newman</b> <b>projection,</b> the molecule {{will be in a}} staggered arrangement with the anti-periplanar functional groups pointing up and down, 180° away from each other (see Figure 4). Figure 5 shows 2-chloro-2,3-dimethylbutane in a sawhorse projection with chlorine and a hydrogen anti-periplanar to each other.|$|E

50|$|In the {{reduction}} of cyclohexanones, the hydride source can attack axially to produce an equatorial alcohol, or equatorially to produce an axial alcohol. In axial attack (shown in red), the hydride encounters 1,3-diaxial strain. In equatorial attack (shown in blue), the hydride avoids the 1,3-diaxial interaction, but the substrate undergoes unfavorable torsional strain when the newly formed alcohol and added hydrogen atom eclipse {{each other in the}} reaction intermediate (as shown in the <b>Newman</b> <b>projection</b> for the axial alcohol).Large reducing agents, such as LiBH(Me2CHCHMe)3, are hindered by the 1,3-axial interactions and therefore attack equatorially. Small reducing agents, such as NaBH4, preferentially attack axially {{in order to avoid the}} eclipsing interactions, because the 1,3-diaxial interaction for small molecules is minimal; stereoelectronic reasons have also been cited for small reducing agents' axial preference. Making the substrate bulkier (and increasing 1,3-axial interactions), however, decreases the prevalence of axial attacks, even for small hydride donors.|$|E
5000|$|Cram’s rule {{explains}} the stereoselectivity {{by considering the}} transition state depicted in figure 3. In the transition state the oxygen lone pair is able {{to interact with the}} boron centre whilst the allyl group is able to add to the carbon end of the carbonyl group. The steric demand of this transition state is minimized by the α-carbon configuration holding the largest group away from (trans to) the congested carbonyl group and the allylmetal group approaching past the smallest group on the α-carbon centre. In the example below (Figure [...] "An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to α-chiral aldehyde"), (R)-2-methylbutanal (1) reacts with the allylboron reagent (2) with two possible diastereomers of which the (R, R)-isomer is the major product. The Cram model of this reaction is shown with the carbonyl group placed trans to the ethyl group (the large group) and the allyl boron approaching past the hydrogen (the small group). The structure is shown in <b>Newman</b> <b>projection.</b> In this case the nucleophilic addition reaction happens at the face where the hydrogen (the small group) is, producing the (R, R)-isomer as the major product.|$|E

He was a member of Zeta Beta Tau.After postdoctoral stays at Yale, Columbia University and Harvard University, he began his independent career as an instructor at The Ohio State University, where he would remain {{for the rest of his}} life. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1940 and to full professor in 1944.He was a member of Sigma Xi, Phi Lambda Upsilon, Alpha Epsilon Delta, American Chemical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1956. Newman received numerous awards, including the American Chemical Society (ACS) Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry in 1961, the Morley Medal given by the Cleveland, Ohio section of the ACS in 1969, the Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal by Yale in 1975, an honorary doctorate by the University of New Orleans in 1975, the Columbus section of the ACS award in 1976, and the Joseph Sullivant Medal by Ohio State University in 1976.
