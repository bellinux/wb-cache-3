5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
500|$|Aval Appadithan was {{the debut}} film for both Nallusamy and M. N. Gnanashekaran, who jointly handled the film's cinematography. Vanna Nilavan co-wrote the {{screenplay}} with Somasundareshwar and Rudhraiya. The film was co-produced by Ragamanjari, {{in association with}} the students of the M.G.R. Government Film and Television Training Institute. Sripriya, who played Manju, was initially unsure about acting in the film due to her busy schedule at that time, and only agreed to do it on Haasan's insistence. According to Rajeshwar, the characterisation of Manju was inspired from a woman he met and who had similar radical beliefs. In [...] (2012), Rajinikanth recalled, [...] "if Kamal had said, “Don’t cast Rajini”, <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken me [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{thing about}} 9/11 is that it's {{kind of like}} an artwork in its own right. It was wicked, but it was devised in this way {{for this kind of}} impact. It was devised visually... You've got to hand it to them on some level because they've {{achieved}} something which <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ever have thought possible, especially to a country as big as America. So on one level they kind of need congratulating, which a lot of people shy away from, which is a very dangerous thing." ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course we}} did. This was exciting. <b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> {{suspected}} Davenport of seeing ghosts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{a gift of}} him," [...] said Julia. [...] "And {{for that}} matter, I think {{we could have done}} without the monster very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|In <b>nobody's</b> {{difficult}}ies, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{found it}} very difficult to answer; very difficult indeed to smile, and say 'Who?' ...|$|R
2500|$|The judge, Charleston County chief {{magistrate}} James [...] "Skip" [...] Gosnell, Jr., caused controversy at {{the bond}} hearing with his statement that, alongside the dead {{victims and their}} families, [...] "there are victims on this young man's {{side of the family}} [...] <b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ever thrown them into the whirlwind of events that they are being thrown into." [...] In 2005, the South Carolina Supreme Court reprimanded Gosnell for using a racial slur while on the bench in 2003. Gosnell set a $1 million bond for the weapons possession charge and no bail on the nine counts of murder.|$|E
2500|$|On September 9, 1925, a white mob in Detroit {{attempted}} {{to drive a}} black family {{out of the home}} they had purchased in a white neighborhood. During the struggle, a white man was killed, and the eleven black men in the house were later arrested and charged with murder. Dr. Ossian Sweet and three members of his family were brought to trial, and after an initial deadlock, Darrow argued to the all-white jury: [...] "I insist that there is nothing but prejudice in this case; that if it was reversed and eleven white men had shot and killed a black man while protecting their home and their lives against a mob of blacks, <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> dreamed of having them indicted. They would have been given medals instead...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Bankston, {{senior staff}} {{attorney}} specializing in privacy law with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (an international digital rights advocacy and legal organization), said: [...] "I've {{never heard of}} anything this egregious. <b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> imagined that schools would peer into students private homes, and even bedrooms, without any kind of justification. [...] He continued: [...] "This is utterly shocking, and a blatant violation of [...] constitutional rights. The school district would have no more right to [...] than to install secret listening devices in the textbooks that they issued students." [...] He suggested that students tape over the lens of their laptop's camera. [...] Parry Aftab, an internet privacy lawyer {{and executive director of}} WiredSafety.org, said the district committed a clear violation of several laws including the Fourth Amendment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{thought it}} was no use to go on in this way,' said Gilbert, with a cough: 'it was the old thing over again, and <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> believe I <b>had</b> {{anything}} the matter with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course he}} knows that. But loving {{is not done}} by months, or method, or rule, or <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> invented such a phrase as [...] "falling in love." [...] He does not want his love to be {{observed}} just yet, on the very account you mention; but conceal it as he may from himself and us, it exists definitely--and very intensely, I assure you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did," [...] said Aunt Beatrice weakly. Margaret's sudden attack fairly startled {{the truth}} out of her. [...] "It is very silly of me, I know, but I {{did want to}} go. I didn't care about a new dress. I'd have been quite willing to wear my grey silk, and I could have fixed the sleeves. What {{difference}} <b>would</b> it <b>have</b> made? <b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> noticed me, but Bella thought it wouldn't do." ...|$|R
2500|$|Former Head of the Maritime Section at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Craig Murray, a vocal {{critic of}} the current British government, has written that an agreed Iran/Iraq {{maritime}} boundary, as shown on the British government provided map, does not exist. [...] "There is no agreed maritime boundary between Iraq and Iran in the Persian Gulf. Until the current mad propaganda exercise of the last week, <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> found that in the least a controversial statement." [...] Murray noted that the Algiers Agreement required reviews every ten years {{of the position of}} the border within the Shatt al-Arab as the thalweg of the river shifts, but these had not been carried out, making even the internal waters border open to dispute. Murray was concerned that the map, notably unfavourable to Iran, could only harden the Iranian position delaying the return of the captives. He stressed that, equally, Iran could not say definitively that the UK crew had been in its waters.|$|E
60|$|MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes, I know--but {{if he had}} n't {{acted like}} this <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> suffered.|$|E
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{suspected}} him of it. He hadn't what {{is generally}} termed a singing face, by any means.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think they're {{starting}} the sledge. If {{there had been}} <b>nobody</b> about, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked to come down with the peat. You can't imagine how exciting it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{will need}} to be clever if he is to steal that!' they cried, with a chuckle. And when next the king came to see his horses they began to speak of Pinkel and his marvellous cunning, and how he had {{contrived}} to steal the lantern and the goat, which <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can give}} it to Farquhar, or keep it and hide it," [...] said the man. [...] "I guess the last <b>would</b> be wisest. <b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> figure you <b>had</b> the thing, and I can't give it to Lucy, because Nevis would sure get after her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought so, to see {{her sitting}} upright, with her arms folded; but she had {{wonderful}} self-command.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} cannot. But he stole in in my absence and robbed me. Why didn't he win you away before, when <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been grieved?--when <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been set tale-bearing. Now the people sneer at me--the very hills and sky seem {{to laugh at}} me till I blush shamefully for my folly. I have lost my respect, my good name, my standing--lost it, never to get it again. Go and marry your man--go on!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{believe a}} word you say,' {{retorted}} Mrs. Crowley. 'I believe you never married {{for the simple}} reason that <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> you.' ...|$|E
60|$|If those ladies {{had stayed}} all day, {{and if all}} the wasps in Missouri had come and climbed up Jim's legs, <b>nobody</b> there <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> known it but Jim and the wasps and me. There he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sat until the ladies left.|$|R
6000|$|Her first {{feelings}} had undoubtedly been {{those of}} passionate grief {{at the loss}} of him; her second thoughts were concern at her own position as the daughter of an earl. 'Oh, why, why, my unfortunate husband, did you die in my chamber at this hour!' she said piteously to the corpse. 'Why not have died in your own cottage if you <b>would</b> die! Then <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> known of our imprudent union, and no syllable <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been breathed of how I mismated myself for love of you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she said, sharply now, [...] "I feel horribly mean. He {{stayed there}} {{through the winter}} when they had {{scarcely}} anything to eat, and bought that stock when <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it or believed in the Dayspring. Then he risked his life to save the Canopus, {{and when he came}} down, worn out and ill, I had only hard words for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Devine laughed. [...] "I didn't see his face; but if he's the man I {{took him}} for, <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} to meet him here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite necessary. We {{looked so}} mean and draggled that <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> voted for us, only that poor Mr. Carbottle looked meaner and more draggled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{they say}} now;--but {{if they had}} {{said that she was}} not, <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought it wrong then for me to marry Mr. Thwaite." ...|$|E
40|$|Minimal Art seemed harmless: {{just a few}} hard-edged, greyish {{pieces of}} metal laid on the ground, some bricks aligned a certain way, heaps of logs. Minimal Art looked {{unnecessarily}} stubborn and a bit stupid, but <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> thought it could do any harm. Perhaps it didn’t. And in the end Minimal Art is not our business, at least not directly. But eventually the sad rhetoric of Minimal Art turned into the grimly asocial monumentality of Minimalist architecture. The silence of the monkeys became {{the silence of the}} monks...|$|R
60|$|Bertie {{did not see}} {{the bottle}} go off; but the mate opportunely {{discharging}} a stick of real dynamite aft where it <b>would</b> harm <b>nobody,</b> Bertie <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sworn in any admiralty court to a nigger blown to flinders. The flight of the twenty-five recruits had actually cost the Arla forty pounds, and, since they had taken to the bush, there was no hope of recovering them. The skipper and his mate proceeded to drown their sorrow in cold tea.|$|R
60|$|Then a light {{dawned on}} Dick {{and he sat}} down, feeling limp. He was abstemious, and a large dose of strong spirit <b>would,</b> no doubt, <b>have</b> unsteadied him. His companions would notice this, but with the obstinacy that often marks a half-drunk man he <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>have</b> insisted on trying to cross the pipe. Then a slip or hesitation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> precipitated him upon the unfinished ironwork below, and since an obvious explanation of his fall had been supplied, <b>nobody's</b> suspicions <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been aroused. The subtlety of the plot was unnerving. Somebody who knew all about him had chosen the moment well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma, won't {{you speak}} for us?" [...] implored Sydney. [...] "I did behave so well when he went! <b>Nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> guessed we hadn't been married fifty years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{thought you}} had no right who saw your face." [...] He replied by asking her {{to make room for}} him, and talking of the play.|$|E
60|$|Marilla's {{state of}} single blessedness {{had never been}} a sore point with her, so she {{answered}} amiably, with an exchange of significant looks with Anne, that she supposed it was because <b>nobody</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So if {{the whole}} thing had broken down, sir,' {{concluded}} Pancks, 'at the very last, say {{the day before the}} other day when I showed you our papers in the Prison yard, or say that very day, <b>nobody</b> but ourselves <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been cruelly disappointed, or a penny the worse.' ...|$|R
50|$|This {{doctrine}} is a 17th-century innovation, {{although it is}} now applied retrospectively for centuries. It cannot be applied perfectly; for example, the eighth Baron De La Warr had three surviving sons; the first died without children, the second left two daughters, and the third left a son. In modern law, the title <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fallen into abeyance between the two daughters of the second son, and <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been able to claim it even if the abeyance were settled; however, in 1597, the grandson of the third son (whose father had been re-created Baron De La Warr in 1570) claimed the title and its precedence.|$|R
25|$|Arthur's father {{insists that}} Arthur {{has to get}} the play {{published}} so that Arthur, Dana, and their mother can profit immensely from it. He wants Arthur to claim the quarto was found by Sil in an attic in the 1950s, and to verify that <b>nobody</b> else <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a claim to the text (namely, the estates of the printer and publisher, William White and Cuthbert Burby). A.E.H. Phillips reveals that he is dying, and, with Dana and Petra's encouragement, Arthur agrees {{to carry out this}} last request in spite of his lifelong distrust of his father.|$|R
