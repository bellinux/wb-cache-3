40|$|Courts {{frequently}} withhold {{remedies for}} meritorious assertions of constitutional right. The practice is often unobjectionable. Indeed, it is a systemic necessity if constitutional law {{is to remain}} vibrant. Without it, judges surely would be less inclined to engage in constitutional innovation. But just as surely, the practice is not available {{for all types of}} constitutional claim. For instance, the subject of a criminal indictment is always entitled to dismissal of the charges if the statute authorizing the prosecution is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has experimented with various approaches to withholding constitutional remedies. The Warren Court embraced the practice of issuing non-retroactive constitutional rulings as it recognized new criminal constitutional rights. But the Burger and Rehnquist Courts rejected <b>non-retroactivity.</b> Instead, they enforced forfeiture rules and significantly broadened the reach of remedy-limiting doctrines such as qualified immunity, harmless error, and exceptions to the exclusionary rule. The Roberts Court has continued in the same vein. Unfortunately, however, the Court’s shift away from <b>non-retroactivity</b> has been unaccompanied by any trans-substantive account of when and how courts may withhold constitutional remedies. As a consequence, influential commentators have charged the Court with inconsistency; they say that it is incoherent to discard <b>non-retroactivity</b> while expanding doctrines that accomplish the same thing. These commentators have called for a revival of <b>non-retroactivity</b> doctrine to enable more constitutional innovation. This paper argues against reviving <b>non-retroactivity</b> doctrine and proposes a functional framework for evaluating when and how courts may withhold constitutional remedies. The proposal differentiates between substitutionary remedies addressed to wholly concluded constitutional wrongs, which courts sometimes may withhold, and specific remedies addressed to ongoing violations, which are obligatory. The proposal rationalizes the Court’s recent remedial practices in constitutional adjudication, permits a context-specific balancing of remedial interests in cases where such a balancing is appropriate, and accounts for separation-of-powers and federalism concerns. It thus provides concrete guidance on when courts may withhold constitutional remedies and when they may not. It also respects Article III limits on judicial power — limits that <b>non-retroactivity</b> doctrines exceed...|$|E
40|$|On 18 November 2010, the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) {{held that}} legal reforms adopted by Senegal in 2007 to {{incorporate}} international crimes {{into the national}} Penal Code to enable its domestic courts to prosecute Hissene Habre for, among others, crimes against humanity committed in Chad twenty years before, violated the principle of legality, specifically the principle against <b>non-retroactivity</b> of criminal law.

The article examines ECHR cases on <b>non-retroactivity,</b> and traces their development in transitional cases back to the ‘Berlin Wall cases’. Two main arguments are made: first it was not necessary to release the applicants in the Maktouf case, even though they won in Strasbourg, be- cause they only challenged their sentence rather than their guilt; and second, that the case can be situated in a complex transitional milieu where states, like Bosnia & Herzegovina, may ask for – but only occasionally receive – a form of ‘transitional relativism’...|$|E
40|$|Post-New Deal constitutionalism is {{in search}} of a theory that justifies {{judicial}} intervention on behalf of individual rights while simultaneously avoiding the charge of 2 ̆ 2 Lochnerism. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 The dominant historical view dismisses post-bellum substantive due process as an anomalous development in the American constitutional tradition. Under this approach, Lochner represents unbounded protection for economic rights that permitted the judiciary to read laissez faire, pro-business policy preferences into the constitutional text. Today 2 ̆ 7 s revisionists have mounted a substantial challenge to the dismissive views of traditionalists. Indeed, some claim Lochner reached the right result, but for the wrong reason. The revisionists characterize substantive due process as a genuine, albeit unsuccessful, attempt to apply constitutional protections for property and contract in light of the economic, social and political situation in the late nineteenth century. The revisionist account of Lochnerism is likely to replace the dominant historical view and to transform a central understanding of the American constitutional tradition. In particular, this view of Lochnerism will likely influence the analysis of constitutional protection of economic rights. This Article will demonstrate that both sides have overlooked a key element in the progression of economic rights protection from the early nineteenth century through the Lochner era to the present day: the changing conception of the principle of <b>non-retroactivity.</b> This oversight may not be surprising in one sense, for the modem view-traceable to the Lochner era itself-is that the principle of nonretroactivity is simply a mask for substantive review. But it was not always so. The principle of <b>non-retroactivity,</b> heavily dependent upon the notion of vested rights, was the primary organizing idea in the constitutional economic rights protection that preceded the Lochner era of substantive due process...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Crimean Tatars started to express more robustly their {{requests}} {{for the international}} recognition of the 1944 Mass Deportation as the crime of genocide. While it can be said, even prima facie, that the 1944 Deportation falls under {{the scope of the}} current definition of crimes against humanity, making a similar kind of claim with the same immediateness is unlikely in terms of the crime of genocide owing to the narrowly constructed legal definition. Moreover, the principle of <b>non-retroactivity</b> of laws poses a further challenge in the consideration of both genocide and crimes against humanity. This paper will try to answer two interconnected questions: Is it a legally plausible case to characterize the 1944 Deportation as genocide or crimes against humanity? And, are there any differences between the legal characterization of 1944 Deportation as genocide or crimes against humanity in terms of their possible consequences...|$|E
30|$|On this matter, {{according}} to the most accredited literature, it may be stated that the rule of law in quality democracies envisages security as one of its most valued political products. It is a product, however, that takes on qualitative value in democracies when it is accompanied by certain elements pertaining mainly to both the correlation between action to prevent/repress crime and efficacy of the structures and sanctions in place against illegality, and to other conditions that may be clearly identified in the definition of rule of law proposed by Morlino (2003 : 232 – 233). He specifies that the concept of rule of law may not be limited to the “operativeness of any legal system”. In effect, very few doubt that “the principle of superiority of the law […], a certain, albeit limited, ability to have the laws respected by the authorities in charge of this, the characteristics of <b>non-retroactivity,</b> generality, stability and clarity are minimal elements for the existence of any civil order”.|$|E
40|$|International {{courts and}} tribunals are fond of paying lips service {{to the fact that}} Articles 31 - 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) reflect {{customary}} international law. This allows them to draw inspiration from the text of the VCLT even in cases where a treaty that is being interpreted was concluded either before 1980 (the date of entry into force of the VCLT), or between parties that are not parties to the VCLT. This fiction may be useful for relatively recent treaties but the question is whether it can hold water in situations where the treaties being interpreted are from the early 20 th, 19 th century or even earlier. The present Chapter examines, whether the customary rules of interpretation can indeed be considered to have remained relatively unchanged through the ages, as was briefly suggested in Kasikili/Sedudu, or whether international {{courts and tribunals}} sometimes when interpreting old treaties apply the wrong rules of interpretation in clear contravention of the <b>non-retroactivity</b> principle...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{obstacles}} to the domestic enforcement of international decisions is represented by the presence of a constitutional impediment. Indeed, most national constitutions, though open to international law, can prevent the implementation of an international decision, insofar as the latter conflicts with the basic principles of the constitutional order. This article argues that in such cases it is necessary to preserve a space where the State continues to retain full sovereignty and whose protection acts as an unbreakable “counter-limit” to the limitations deriving from the international legal order (“counter-limits” doctrine). Yet recent judicial and legislative practice in Italy concerning the implementation of the ICJ decision in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State seem to overlook the need to preserve this “space”. As a consequence, certain fundamental constitutional guarantees, such as the right of access to justice, the rule of res judicata and the principle of <b>non-retroactivity</b> of the law, have inescapably ended up being compromised...|$|E

The aim of this paper was to analyze the weaknesses of the existing international, European and national legislation and, on the basis of those, to construe a comprehensive EU legal response. The results were twofold. First, the grounds on which the EU should apply the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime to the illegal antiquities‘ traffic were made evident.

Doing the hard, detailed work of comparative law is necessary {{if we are to}} give up on the unfortunate tendency to make overly broad, unsupported claims that wide varieties of human rights have passed into customary international law. The traditional use of only interstate practice in determining rules of customary international law is insufficient where the rules concern relationships between states and individuals, especially their own nationals. This, however, is the essence of human rights law. Comparative law techniques allow, and are necessary to, determining the scope and content of human rights guarantees across different states and legal systems. Only through use of these techniques can we determine state practice on human rights, and the reasons that the rights are protected (opinion juris) — i. e., which rights are protected by customary international law. This piece uses one example, the determination that <b>non-retroactivity</b> of crimes and punishments has passed into customary international law, and shows which version of that principle has become the rule of customary international law. This sort of research may sometimes lead to unwelcome conclusions that, in fact, some rights have not yet become customary international law, or have become customary only in weak or incomplete forms...|$|E

The former had since 1. July 2006 replaced the Czech Private International Law Act 1963 before being itself replaced by the latter, starting from 18. December 2009. With regard to <b>non-retroactivity,</b> both regulations will be in practice used alongside one another for a while, including the old Czech Private International Law Act 1963, but only in areas outside the material scope of both the Rome Convention and the Rome I Regulation. The thesis deals with major aspects of both regulations connected with choice of law, limitations thereof, and rules {{in the absence of}} a choice of law. Current conflict-of- laws rules rest on four main principles: 1) autonomy of the parties to choose the applicable law; 2) a unified system of conflict rules {{in the absence of a}} choice of law; 3) limitations for the protection of the weaker party or public policy; 4) ECJ's power of binding interpretations of both regulations to ensure uniform application.

40|$|In {{the eyes}} of legal scholars, {{alternative}} dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms often show to poor advantage when compared to their judicial counterparts, particularly on procedural fairness grounds. Owen Fiss famously argued against the negotiated settlement of certain important disputes related to fundamental rights, and Deborah Hensler notably criticized the use of mediation {{on the grounds that}} it might not appear fair to some disputants because it did not promote a resolution based on public norms. Critics have suggested that a judicially-based dispute resolution system that comports with the rule of law may be fundamentally at odds with non-judicial, and therefore less formal, dispute resolution mechanisms such as arbitration, mediation, and negotiation. But other scholars have responded by suggesting that the rule of law is less in tension with ADR than critics imagine, because they both aim to serve the same goal-the pursuit of justice. This difference of opinion is aided and abetted by the fluidity of the definition of the term 2 ̆ 2 rule of law 2 ̆ 2 itself, which scholars have variously defined to include tenets as distinct as <b>non-retroactivity,</b> generality, certainty, protection of individual rights, and lack of discretion by government actors.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{analyzes the}} {{provisions in the}} Italian legal system concerning corporate liability for administrative infringements depending on crimes, provided for by Legislative Decree 231 / 2001, {{from the perspective of}} the phenomenon of historical pollution. The work deals with the problem of verifying whether and to what extent past pollution—caused before the entry into force of Legislative Decree 231 / 2001 —with persistent and current effects, may result in corporate liability which is substantially criminal, as is the one outlined in the Decree. By trying to highlight the main issues raised by historical pollution in this matter, and the critical aspects related to the regulation provided for by the above-mentioned Decree, the analysis is carried out at three levels: (i) the introduction in 2011 of environmental crimes in the Decree through Article 25 -undecies, and the problems that have accompanied this belated intervention; (ii) the interference between the general principles of criminal law and the theme of historical pollution, with reference to the principles of legality and <b>non-retroactivity</b> and to the offenses in environmental matters which may be relevant in relation to cases of historical pollution—with due regard to the moment of the commission of the crime (tempus commissi delicti); (iii) the issues raised by some provisions of the Decree with respect to the object of the present research (sites remediation, sanctions and confiscation of profit, statute of limitation).

Whaling, the Court protected prisoner expectations at sentencing regarding the length of time to be spent in custody, and declared the retroactive application of a more restrictive parole scheme to be constitutionally invalid. Simultaneously, however, the Court endorsed a view that prison officials and legislators are largely free to alter the conditions of confinement over the course of sentence administration. While the fitness of a sentence is significantly impacted by prison conditions, Whaling suggests {{that this is not a}} topic for sentencing judges to address or constitutional principles like <b>non-retroactivity</b> to protect. In Mission Institution v. Khela, the Court emphasizes the importance of prisoner access to habeas corpus as a vehicle to challenge the liberty-depriving decisions of prison officials. Simultaneously, however, the Court holds that reasonableness is the standard of review for at least some parts of the decision challenged in habeas corpus. The implications of importing a deferential administrative law standard into the constitutional vehicle of habeas corpus remain unclear at this stage. At the very least, the decision marks a shift away from the historical distinctiveness of the writ of habeas corpus, and implies that the decisions of prison employees should attract deference even in cases in which constitutional rights are engaged...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} evaluation of universal jurisdiction over torture offenses. By doing so, it focuses on European states, in particular Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, all of which show a particular openness to prosecute torture offences {{on the basis of}} universal jurisdiction. It is demonstrated that Belgium, France and the United Kingdom have complied with the obligation set out in article 5 (2) of the UN Torture Convention to establish universal jurisdiction over torture offences in their domestic legislation. They were, moreover, the first countries to conduct torture trials on this ground. However, 30 years after the signature of the Convention, such trials rarely occur because European prosecutors and courts face both practical and legal problems. I argue that some controversies have been solved, especially those relating to the <b>non-retroactivity</b> of the implemented legislation, the prohibition of amnesties, as well as the legality of the proceedings {{in the absence of the}} offender and of the operation of a principle of subsidiarity. The latter principle would give primacy jurisdiction at least to the territorial state that wants and is able to prosecute. However, the controversies relating to the legality of the universal jurisdiction over the torture of citizens of non States Parties, the ne bis in idem prohibition, the broad immunities and the establishment of efficient legislation and cooperation between states are far from being settled. I argue that the cooperation between states at the regional and international level is needed to solve the legal and practical issues about universal jurisdiction over torture, and to stop its differentiated applications. The forum state is also responsible to provide prosecution and police services with a suitable working context that has clear and efficient legislation and guidelines about universal jurisdiction over torture. Indeed, successful prosecution primarily devolve to these criminal practitioners' motivation...|$|E

While several restitution claims pertaining to Nazi-confiscated art have been resolved, other cases {{relating to the}} appropriation of cultural materials during war, foreign or colonial occupation, theft, or {{as a consequence of}} illicit trafficking have proliferated. Despite these challenges and recent developments in international law, international treaty law and current State practice in resolving restitution disputes primarily focus on arguments associated with State interests and property rights, and thus do little to accommodate the interests of the various stakeholders involved in restitution disputes. Moreover, because of major legal obstacles claimants face in restitution cases (namely the <b>non-retroactivity</b> of international treaty law, the protection of the bona fide purchaser and provisions on the lapse of time), a purely legal approach is not a viable option in many restitution disputes. Therefore, this dissertation introduces an approach that aims at taking into account the interests of the various stakeholders in the resolution of these disputes. In a second step, complementary and alternative mechanisms in the resolution of restitution disputes are examined in order to accommodate these different interests. The utilization of this interest-oriented approach will allow restitution disputes to be resolved in a more sustainable and cooperative manner; moreover, ethical and historical considerations can also be more adequately addressed than in a purely legal approach. It will be demonstrated that within the scope of the ‘common interest’ in the protection of cultural heritage, other issues can be identified as being of common concern, including: physical and cultural preservation, access, integrity, and cooperation. Since these aspects form part of the ‘common interest’, they are valid not only for the protection of cultural heritage in war and peace, but must also be taken into account in the resolution of restitution disputes. Consequently, these common interests form new general principles in international cultural heritage law...|$|E
