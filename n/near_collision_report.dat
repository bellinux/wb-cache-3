40|$|Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) will be {{the basis}} of the future {{surveillance}} system in the US as well as many other countries. One way to create incentives for users to equip with the required ADS-B avionics is to create and implement ADS-B applications that are of high value to the operators. One such application is the airborne traffic alerting application named Traffic Situation Awareness with Alerting (TSAA) 6. As a first step in the development of this application, an analysis of ten years of NTSB mid-air <b>collision</b> <b>reports</b> was conducted to identify areas of high mid-air collision risk. Similarly, ten years worth of ASRS and NMACS <b>near</b> mid-air <b>collision</b> <b>reports</b> were also analyzed. The airport environment is where most mid-air collisions occurred (59 % of NTSB reports) and most <b>near</b> mid-air <b>collisions</b> were <b>reported</b> (64 % of ASRS reports and 47 % of NMACS reports). As such, most benefit from traffic alerting can be gained from alerts in the airport environment. Encounters between Part 121 aircraft and General Aviation were most often reported between a cruising General Aviation aircraft and a Part 121 aircraft transitioning through that same altitude. GA/Part 121 encounters make up 14 % NMACS as well as ASRS reports...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{threat of}} midair {{collisions}} {{is one of}} the most serious problems facing the air traffic control system and has been studied by many researchers. The gas model {{is one of the}} models which describe the expected frequency of midair collisions. In this paper, the gas model which has been used, so far, to deal only with simple cases is extended to a generalized form, and some special types of collision models, such as the overtaking model, are deduced from this generalized model. The effects of the probability distributions of aircraft direction and altitude on the frequency of collisions are also analyzed. The results in this paper can be applied to evaluate the frequency of conflicts as well as that of collisions. In this paper, an aircraft is represented as a circular cylinder, and a collision is described as an overlap of two cylinders. If the size of the cylinder is expanded to the volume of the protected airspace of an aircraft, an overlap of two cylinders means a conflict. Therefore, with a slight modification, the results can be used to analyze the frequency of conflicts. This flexibility gives the models of this paper an important potential for application to a future air traffic control system. The FAA is currently developing a new type of air traffic control system called AERA (automated en route air traffic control). AERA is expected to reduce the workload of human controllers and expand the capacity of airspace using new computer systems and better communication links. When this system is fully implemented, aircraft will be able to fly under fewer restrictions. However, if many aircraft are flying on random routes, the frequency of potential conflicts the computer system should handle becomes high. Therefore, the frequency of potential conflicts under various circumstances should be calculated in order to estimate the computer workload before full implementation of the system. The models developed in this paper may be helpful in this evaluation. The consequences of actual collisions are, of course, grave. Fortunately, the average number of such collisions per year has remained relatively small. According to an FAA Report (Report of the FAA Task Force on Aircraft Separation Assurance, Jan. 1979), the average number of midair <b>collisions</b> <b>reported</b> to NTSB from 1974 through 1978 was 33 per year. Most midair collisions have occurred between small general aviation aircraft operating under VFR. However, the report also states that there were 227 <b>near</b> midair <b>collision</b> <b>reports</b> in 1975 alone, and that air carriers were involved in 68 of these cases. (According to the <b>report,</b> a <b>near</b> midair <b>collision</b> is an incident which would probably have resulted in a collision if no action had been taken by either pilot. Closest proximity of less than 500 ft would usually be required for a <b>near</b> midair <b>collision</b> <b>report.)</b> Although the number of conflicts is not available in the report, it is clearly far greater than the number of <b>near</b> midair <b>collisions</b> considering the difference of airspace volumes involved. The outline of this thesis is as follows. In Chapter 2, we present an overview of two aircraft collision models, the Reich model and the gas model, which have been the most important ones in this field. In Chapter 3, we develop some extensions of the gas model including a generalized two-dimensional gas model, an overtaking model and a three dimensional gas model. In Chapter 4, we develop an aircraft collision model which does not assume the uniformity of aircraft distribution. The conclusions of this thesis are summarized in Chapter 5. Also issued as an M.

40|$|Due to the {{frequency}} of <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> with other road users, many Australian’s perceive that cycling on the public road network is unsafe; {{this is a significant}} barrier to the uptake of cycling for transport (Fishman, Washington, & Haworth, 2012). <b>Near</b> <b>collisions</b> need to be better understood to identify appropriate countermeasures, improve cycling safety, and encourage cycling participation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the sequence of behaviours and factors involved in cyclists’ <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> with other road users. Twenty cyclists rode a pre-defined urban route whilst providing concurrent think aloud verbal protocols and being filmed by a researcher travelling behind. Three researchers identified <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> from the video footage, with a <b>near</b> <b>collision</b> defined as any conflict between moving road users or situation of very close proximity (Johnson et al., 2010). The data were then analysed to identify: 1) the type of conflict; and 2) the sequence of behaviours and contributory factors involved using a sequential model of crashes/near crashes (Guo et al., 2010) and an adapted version of Stanton and Salmon’s (2009) taxonomy of driver error causal factors. The majority of <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> occurred as cyclists approached or negotiated an intersection, as car drivers attempted to overtake the cyclist, and car drivers had to swerve or break to avoid a <b>collision.</b> All <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> involved contributing factors relating to road layout; the majority also involved factors related to driver behaviour and the road rules.

This paper presents the first third-party analysis of Skein, with an extensive study {{of its main}} component: the block cipher Threefish. We notably investigate <b>near</b> <b>collisions,</b> distinguishers, impossible differentials, key recovery using related-key differential and boomerang attacks. In particular, we present <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> on up to 17 rounds, an impossible differential on 21 rounds, a related-key boomerang distinguisher on 34 rounds, a known-related-key boomerang distinguisher on 35 rounds, and key recovery attacks on up to 32 rounds, out of 72 in total for Threefish- 512. None of our attacks directly extends to the full Skein hash. However, the pseudorandomness of Threefish is required to validate the security proofs on Skein, and our results conclude that at least 36 rounds of Threefish seem required for optimal security guarantees. ...|$|R

40|$|Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) will be {{the basis}} of the future {{surveillance}} system in the US. To achieve benefit from ADS-B, aircraft have to be equipped with ADS-B avionics across all stakeholders. General Aviation (GA) comprises over 96 % of the active aircraft fleet in the US but average yearly utilization for GA aircraft is 21 times lower than that of commercial aircraft. Since many benefits from ADS-B depend on aircraft utilization, concern exists that ADS-B does not provide enough user benefit to GA, possibly resulting in delayed acceptance and aircraft equipage with ADS-B avionics. One way of providing user benefits and thus increasing incentives for GA users to equip with ADS-B is to create and implement ADS-B applications that are of high value to those operators. ADS-B Surveillance in non-RADAR airspace and ADS-B based Traffic Situation Awareness (TSA) are identified as two applications that are expected to provide significant benefit to GA. Both applications are evaluated and possible barriers to the delivery of benefit are identified. In order to identify where TSA would be most beneficial, ten years' worth of NTSB mid-air <b>collision</b> <b>reports</b> were reviewed. Ten years of ASRS and NMACS <b>near</b> mid-air <b>collision</b> (MAC) <b>reports</b> were also reviewed. The analysis revealed that aircraft are most likely to encounter each other in the airport vicinity - specifically in the pattern (59 % of MACs). Current Traffic Awareness systems are not reliable in that environment due to insufficient surveillance data quality. Surveillance data from ADS-B, however, has much higher resolution. Therefore, ADS-B based traffic alerting systems are expected to be capable of providing reliable alerting in such environments and would thus pose a significant incentive for GA to equip with ADS-B. An analysis of the current availability of low altitude surveillance over the continental United States was conducted in order to identify where ADS-B Low Altitude Surveillance would be beneficial. Providing low altitude surveillance has the potential to improve efficiency during IFR conditions. 27 towered airports with RADAR floors of more than 500 ft have been identified. ADS-B surveillance in those locations would create a significant benefit locally. Non-towered airports without low altitude surveillance are more common (806 total). ADS-B surveillance to such airports has the potential to increase airport acceptance rates in Instrument Flight weather and thus providing benefit to GA. However, in addition to providing surveillance, additional ATC procedures need to be developed to take advantage of such ADS-B surveillance. The new procedures would allow ATC to remain in radio communication with aircraft operating at non-towered airports, preventing the application of inefficient procedural control. by Fabrice Kunzi.

40|$|Abstract. Side channel {{collision}} {{attacks are}} a powerful method to exploit side channel leakage.

This work introduces the notion of <b>near</b> <b>collisions</b> to exploit the fact that values depending on the same sub-key can have similar while not identical leakage.

The presented approach has several desirable features {{when compared to other}} state-of-the-art <b>collision</b> attacks: <b>Near</b> <b>collision</b> attacks are truly univariate. They have low requirements on the leakage functions, since they work well for leakages that are linear in the bits of the targeted intermediate state. They are applicable in the presence of masking countermeasures if there exist distinguishable leakages, {{as in the case of}} leakage squeezing.
