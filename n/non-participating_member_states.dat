40|$|This article {{examines}} the European Commission’s Proposal for a Council Directive implementing a financial transaction tax through the enhanced cooperation procedure published on February 14, 2013. It starts by providing a brief description {{and analysis of the}} Proposal and the accompanying Impact Assessment, focusing on the newly added features of the proposed tax and its potential impact on both participating and <b>non-participating</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Next, the {{article examines}} the Proposal from the perspective of public international law, discussing the controversial extraterritorial reach of the proposed tax. It is argued that doubts exist with respect to the compatibility of the “contagion effect” and the issuance principle with internationally recognised legal principles. The article then turns to EU law and considers the legal requirements imposed by the EU Treaties on the use of enhanced cooperation. Whilst raising some concerns in relation to the Proposal’s compliance with these requirements, the article concludes that the political and judicial controlling mechanisms in place appear weak and therefore the outcome of any potential political or judicial challenge remains uncertain. The importance of this debate {{is not limited to the}} financial transaction tax, but also extends to the use of enhanced cooperation in other areas of taxation and beyond...|$|E
40|$|The {{exploitation}} of patents as an asset, {{which may be}} traded by way of assignment, licensing or as security, has become increasingly important. In this regard, Art. 7 of the new EU Regulation No. 1257 / 2012 of 17 December 2012 on unitary patent protection provides that, {{as an object of}} property, a European patent with unitary effect shall be treated in its entirety and in all participating Member States as a national patent of the participating Member State in which that patent has unitary effect and in which the applicant had her/his residence or principal place of business or, by default, had a place of business on the date of filing the application for the European patent. In case the applicant had no such form of domicile in a participating Member State, German law applies (Art. 7 (3)). The result of Art. 7 is that, whereas unitary patents held by owners having some domicile in participating Member States typically will be subject to the national law of the patentee, firms from <b>non-participating</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> which do not have some form of domicile within the territory of enhanced cooperation, will never have their national law applied to unitary patents covering their inventive achievements. The author submits that Art. 7 is in conflict with both the purpose of the creation of unitary patent protection and with primary EU law...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the topic}} of {{differentiated}} integration in the European Union has become increasingly discussed in both political science research and politics in general. Whereas differentiated integration is viewed as necessary for deeper cooperation, recent findings suggest that it increases the gulf between participants and non-participants, {{making it difficult for}} non-participating countries to join in later negotiations. However, {{there is a lack of}} theoretical and empirical work regarding the relationship between different levels of participation in the EU and national policy outcomes. This article addresses this question by comparing the policy outcomes in fully participating, selectively participating (opting-in) and <b>non-participating</b> (opting-out) EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> relative to EU legislation. The findings show that selective participation (opting-in) increases state conformity with EU laws relative to no integration at all (opting-out), but it does not completely bridge the gap between fully integrated <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and non-participants. The results suggest that countries with flexible arrangements are generally less likely to implement EU laws than full participants, even when they choose to legally commit to the EU requirements. This finding raises some further questions about the rationale behind selective participation and its consequences for policy conformity, if its application expands to other policy areas and more <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in the future...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: This case {{looked at}} the cost benefit factor of e-Choupal model in rural India from {{socio-economic}} perspective since it is being projected {{as one of the}} models of rural empowerment. Questions were raised whether its growth both horizontally and vertically might be detrimental to sustainability of traditional agrarian economy. It also examined the role of ICT and government policies in this context. Approach: The study examined the above mentioned issues from the context of rural India. Empirical literature was referred to build a link between various rural issues and e-Choupal. Results: e-Choupal model may not be leading towards a holistic development since the individual income increase of participating members may be at the expense of <b>non-participating</b> <b>members</b> of the rural commune. Conclusion: The results indicated that the present modus operandi of e-Choupal may perhaps lead to further rural consolidation through corporatization rather than rural empowerment...|$|R
40|$|Due to modernization, individualization and de-institutionalization, {{there has}} been a long period of decline in church {{membership}} rates in the Netherlands. In this article based on both survey research and church administrations, several levels of involvement are explored within church membership. Nowadays, 40 % of the Dutch population is an initiated member of a Chris-tian church. Almost 30 % of the Dutch population considers themselves {{as a member of a}} church and almost 10 % attends church on a regular basis. The participating church members have, besides their religious socialization, social and intrinsic motives to belong to their church. For all other members, church involvement seems to be an inheritance of their parents and almost nothing more than that. This has strong implications for the future while we expect that these large groups of <b>non-participating</b> <b>members</b> will not pass their church involvement on to next generations. Therefore church membership rates on all levels of involvement are expected to drop further...|$|R

40|$|From the introduction]. My {{study will}} focus in {{particular}} on three claims {{made in the}} literature about <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. The first claim is that <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation was initially low and {{that much of the}} Court's constitutionalization of the Treaty occurred when <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were simply too inattentive to notice the magnitude of the Court's activity. The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase. This hypothesis is {{based on the belief that}} the supranationalism of the ECJ was accepted because of the intergovernmentalism of the Council. The data on <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation suggests, however, that none of these claims provide an accurate picture of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> interaction with the Court. While there has been an increase in participation over time, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have shown a high degree of participation in Article 177 cases from the outset. Further, trends in <b>member</b> <b>states</b> participation do not provide adequate empirical proof of a change in <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation from self-interest to a Community interest. Finally, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> do not appear to have changed their behavior toward the Court since the passage of the Single European Act...|$|R
