The age-long communal conflict was interjected by seven major wars including; 1845 - 1849, 1882 - 1909, 1946 - 1949, 1981, 1983, 1997 and 1998 - 2004. The study examined the nature and challenges of post conflict social and urban reconstructions in the two communities and advanced approaches for peace building in typical post war urban areas. It was observed {{that most of the}} physical reconstructions were carried out by the informal private sectors and <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> Naturally cities grow at the peripheries, but the post war expansion in the two communities was more in the core and the transition zone as people move away from perceived volatile areas. Though the immediate cause of the war was addressed, there were no direct initiatives for social reconstruction or peace building in the two communities. The paper suggests that definite social reconstructions must follow communal conflict resolution...|$|E

40|$|The {{origins of}} modern cooperativism {{can be found}} in the {{consumer}} cooperative. Many changes have taken place over time, some of which have been profound and rapid, affecting the way consumer cooperatives work and their very existence. They have evolved to give more complete service and keep their original purpose. The case of the Eroski cooperative is studied in depth. Eroski originated in the Basque Country and expanded its business activities to become one of the big distributors following a new model. A local <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>cooperative,</b> the Park Slope Food Coop in Brooklyn, is studied as an alternative to the former case. In both cases, consumers, their awareness and protection of their rights are of utmost importance. Received : 16. 06. 11 Accepted : 05. 07. 11 </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of an action {{research}} to explore the effectiveness of using cooperative learning strategies on students' academic achievement, their understanding of physics concepts and their motivation to learn in the physics classroom. The study involved a secondary four express physics class of 41 students in a <b>neighbourhood</b> school. Various <b>cooperative</b> learning structures were used to teach the topics on ‘Current Electricity' and ‘D. C. Circuits' over a period of about 8 weeks. During this period, teacher-crafted pre- and post-intervention tests were administered to the class. A questionnaire survey was used to examine students' motivation to learn and perceptions of their learning experiences before and after the treatment period. A class using traditional method of teaching was also involved in the study as a control. The effects of using cooperative learning on students' academic achievement and their motivation to learn were examined through the analysis {{of the results of the}} pre- and post-tests and students' perception surveys, while the extent of using cooperative learning on helping students achieve a better understanding of physics concepts was examined through the qualitative analysis of the students' journals. The results showed that the use of cooperative learning does increase students' academic achievement, helps students to achieve a better understanding of physics concepts and increases students' motivation to learn...|$|R
5000|$|CONVIVIR (an {{acronym for}} Servicios Especiales de Vigilancia y Seguridad Privada ("Special {{vigilance}} and private security services") that means [...] "Vivir en armonía" [...] in Spanish) {{was a national}} program of <b>cooperative</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> watch groups created by a February 11, 1994 decree of Colombia's Ministry of National Defense and a law passed in the Colombian Congress, in response to growing guerrilla activity. Authorized during the government of César Gaviria but mainly developed during the administration of Ernesto Samper Pizano (1994-1998), the CONVIVIR groups quickly became controversial as it was considered to represent something of {{a revival of the}} Law 48 of 1968. Members of some former paramilitary groups transitioned into CONVIVIR, where they were joined by newer recruits and victims of guerrilla aggression, while others, such as the ACCU, remained operating independently. The then governor of Antioquia, Álvaro Uribe Velez (who later became President of Colombia), whose father had been killed by the FARC during a kidnapping attempt in 1983, gained notoriety for his open support and promotion of the CONVIVIR at the time.Reports argued that some CONVIVIR groups achieved results in providing security to communities and intelligence coordination to military forces, but apparently numerous members committed abuses against civilians, without a serious oversight over their operations and organization. In 1998, HRW stated that [...] "we have received credible information that indicated that the CONVIVIR groups of the Middle Magdalena and of the southern Cesar regions were directed by known paramilitaries and had threatened to assassinate Colombians that were considered as guerrilla sympathizers or which rejected joining the cooperative groups".|$|R
40|$|Selv om der blev etableret visse fælles foranstaltninger i noget af det filantropiske byggeri, der skød frem i 1850 'erne og 60 'erne, hørte det egentlige kollektivhus det 20. århundrede til: En boligbebyggelse med selvstændige lejligheder, i nogle tilfælde for grupper med særlige boligbehov, med tilknyttede fællesfaciliteter for beboerne. I udgangspunktet centralkøkken med spisesal og restaurant, andre aflastende servicetilbud for den daglige husførelse, daginstitution, indkøbsmuligheder og senere tillige selskabslokaler, gæstehotel, hobbylokaler m. m. Abstract As one of {{the first}} places in Europe, {{cooperative}} housing was built on Frederiksberg in 1903 by a philanthropic building society under the management of principal Otte Fick. During the years 1916 - 1930, the Danish Welfare State's housing policy was established. In this connection, the municipality of Copenhagen stood behind the policy by subsidizing eight blocks of cooperative housing - in all 1, 125 flats - through a considerable amount of public funds. In Copenhagen itself and on Frederiksberg, non-profit housing associations as well as entrepreneurs supported this policy. While most of the cooperative housing had central kitchens with dining rooms, some had a number of common facilities such as day-care centres, domestic help and/or modern washers and dryers. Some of the cooperative housing also had a local grocery store for the residents and the surrounding <b>neighbourhood.</b> The <b>cooperative</b> housing was planned by some of the leading architects of that era and the majority of the flats had a room with a box bed, a small kitchen and an entrance hall; and all the flats had a toilet, a shower, and central heating. There was also a plan which encompassed flats facing out to corridors. The design of the cooperative housing included closed or open courtyards, L-shaped houses, or blocks of flats surrounded by small gardens. Furthermore, it was considered innovative to build residential properties intended for certain social groups that had specific housing requirements. On the housing market, it was particularly troublesome to acquire self-contained flats for single parents with children and elderly women - primarily people from the working class and the lower middle class. In 1930, the Danish capital, comprised of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, was on the forefront of housing development compared to the rest of Denmark and internationally. It would also create an important foundation for widespread building construction of cooperative housing in the future. However, this type of housing never really caught on in the ordinary construction business in the 20 th century. On the other hand, it succeeded in positioning itself as an essential means of housing especially for both handicapped and elderly people. <br /...|$|R
