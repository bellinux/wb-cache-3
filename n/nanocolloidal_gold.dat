40|$|The {{deposition}} of <b>nanocolloidal</b> <b>gold</b> particles {{under the influence}} of an externally applied electric field is studied in situ by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry. The variation of the relative coverage with time, as a function of applied potential, is determined using a principal component analysis. Calibration of the absolute coverage is done by means of ex situ electron microscopy. The results reveal that the deposition rate {{is directly related to the}} electrochemical current. A threshold potential exists for current and therewith also deposition to occur. The spatial distribution of nanoparticles deposited in an applied field exhibits a higher degree of order as compared to the random, irreversibly deposited nanocolloids at chemically functionalized surfaces. The experimental findings are discussed in terms of a simple electrochemical model. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{deposition}} kinetics of the irreversible adsorption of citrate-stabilized, <b>nanocolloidal</b> <b>gold</b> particles on Si/SiO 2 surfaces, derivatized with (aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), is {{investigated in}} situ using single wavelength optical reflectometry. A well-defined flow of colloids towards {{the surface is}} realized using a radial impinging jet cell geometry. The dynamics of the deposition process is at first mass transport limited. Surface blocking effects determine the adsorption kinetics in the final stage. The entire deposition process can be adequately {{described in terms of}} a generalized adsorption theory, which combines the effects of mass-transport and the actual adsorption onto the surface. The diffusion coefficient of the particles is calculated from the initial deposition rate. The obtained value corresponds well with data obtained from experiments described in literature and with the value calculated from the Stokesâ€“Einstein relation...|$|E
40|$|The thin island film theory {{developed}} by Bedeaux and Vlieger [Optical Properties of Surface (Imperial College Press (2002) ], {{is used to}} unambiguously analyze spectroscopic ellipsometry spectra of thin layers of <b>nanocolloidal</b> <b>gold</b> particles on silicon substrates covered by a natural oxide layer, for coverages up to 35 %. Due {{to the absence of}} isotropy in three dimensions, standard effective medium theories cannot be applied. Image dipole effects as well as the lateral distribution of colloids have {{to be taken into account}} as described by Bedeaux and Vlieger. Additonally we show that an effective image dipole has to be taken into account if colloidal particles are adsorbed on a substrate that is terminated with a thin SiO 2 layer with a thickness that is smaller than the radius of the gold nanoparticles (a = 6. 7 nm). The natural oxide layer on our Si subtrates is only a fraction of this...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{bottom-up}} colloidal route towards {{the manufacture of}} hierarchical substrates. Owing to the double length scale roughness, these super-structure arrays exhibit superhydrophobic wetting behaviour, characterized by large contact angles, limited hysteresis and small sliding angles. The assembly procedure of the <b>nanocolloidal</b> silica and <b>gold</b> particles is reviewed, {{as well as the}} chemical treatments required to obtain stable, reproducible substrate...|$|R
40|$|The {{deposition}} kinetics of the irreversible adsorption of citrate-stabilized, <b>nanocolloidal</b> <b>gold</b> particles on Si/SiO 2 surfaces, derivatized with (aminopropyl) triethoxysilane, is {{investigated in}} situ using single wavelength reflectometry. A well-defined flow of colloids {{toward the surface}} is realized using a radial impinging jet cell geometry. The saturation coverage after prolonged deposition can be analyzed in terms of random sequential adsorption and depends on the ionic strength of the solution, in good agreement with DLVO theory. Atomic force microscopy measurements indicate that for higher coverages, the formation of particle clusters {{gives rise to a}} deviation from DLVO behavior. After a short transition time, the dynamics of the deposition process is at first mass transport limited. Surface blocking effects determine the adsorption kinetics in the final stage. The entire deposition process can be adequately described in terms of a generalized adsorption theory, which combines the effects of mass transport and the actual adsorption onto the surface...|$|E
40|$|Spectroscopic {{ellipsometry}} and {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) {{experiments are}} employed to characterize <b>nanocolloidal</b> <b>gold</b> films, self-assembled at APTES-derivatized Si/SiO 2 surfaces. X-ray fluorescence measurements after deposition confirm that AFM provides a representative means to probe the absolute surface coverage. Optical properties of gold nanocrystal assemblies are investigated both ex situ after drying and in situ prior to evaporation of the solvent. Quantitative optical characterization of these highly inhomogeneous systems is not unambiquous. Conventional effective medium approximations are not applicable to these systems. To enable an accurate analysis, extinction measurements on colloidal suspensions are performed. The limited particle size {{in relation to the}} electron mean free path leads to a modification of the dielectric function at longer wavelengths. Ellipsometry spectra of the colloidal gold films are analyzed qualitatively using an optical invariant and principal component analyses. Quantitative results are obtained using a theory which treats the nanocrystals as polarizabilities at the Fresnel interface. Above approximately 20 %, the coverages determined from optical spectra are in agreement with what is found from AFM images. At lower coverages, the optical results seem to overestimate the actual nanocrystal density. The discrepancies are discussed in terms of image charge effects arising from the proximity of the substrate...|$|E
