5|$|Match Point is a 2005 British-Luxembourgish {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton. In the film, Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson.

It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York.
