25|$|Bromberg's most {{outstanding}} attribute was his facility with sensitive character roles; {{he could take}} a standard, undistinguished supporting part and make it unforgettably sympathetic. In Hollywood Cavalcade he portrays Don Ameche's friend who knows he will <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> girl; in Three Sons he is the lowly business associate who longs {{to be given a}} partnership; in Easy to Look At he is the once-great couturier now reduced to night watchman.|$|E

Within the first few minutes all the local heroes were out of the race.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, while {{sick with}} typhoid fever, he raved in his {{delirium}} that he wanted, above all else, to see the paintings in the Palazzo Pitti and the Uffizi in Florence. As Livorno's local museum housed only a sparse few paintings by the Italian Renaissance masters, the tales he {{had heard about the}} great works held in Florence intrigued him, and it was a source of considerable despair to him, in his sickened state, that he might <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance to view them in person. His mother promised that she would take him to Florence herself, the moment he was recovered. Not only did she fulfil this promise, but she also undertook to enroll him with the best painting master in Livorno, Guglielmo Micheli.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E

500|$|His {{language}} {{became more}} forceful; the Jesuit Father Peter Finlay {{was described by}} Yeats {{as a man of}} [...] "monstrous discourtesy", and he lamented that, [...] "It is one of the glories of the Church in which I was born that we have put our Bishops in their place in discussions requiring legislation". During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: [...] "If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> North... You will put a wedge {{in the midst of this}} nation". He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants, [...] "we are no petty people".|$|E

Peter Debruge of Variety said McAdams played [...] "the most competent—and human—of Marvel’s window-dressing girlfriends," [...] while Gregory Ellwood of Indiewire remarked: [...] "It {{goes without saying}} that McAdams will <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> credit she deserves for transforming the barely sketched out role of Strange’s former medical colleague Christine Palmer into a captivating three-dimensional character that feels like {{an integral part of the}} storyline even when she isn’t." [...] Also in 2016, McAdams narrated an audiobook version of L. M. Montgomery's novel Anne of Green Gables, released by Audible.|$|E
500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented. [...] "Usually when you say 'no,' they hold it against you for the rest of your career. I've experienced that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Michael Bloom of The Boston Phoenix {{wrote that}} Cheap at Half the Price [...] "will <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> hearing it deserves". He said that Frith {{was trying to}} shake off this [...] "progressive" [...] mould he had been cast in, and {{believed}} that the songs on the album should be judged on their own merit and not as [...] "rarefied art rock". One 1984 reviewer found the album [...] "a very enjoyable recording", and stated that Frith's music [...] "is changing the way many musicians look at the sounds that they take so seriously". The New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock described Cheap at Half the Price as Frith's response to punk, a low-tech approach to performing songs. It called the album a [...] "twisted pop" [...] record, {{saying that it is}} [...] "as uncompromising as everything else Frith recorded". François Couture in a review of Frith's 2002 album, Prints called Cheap at Half the Price [...] "the best tongue-in-cheek take at the New Wave".|$|E

500|$|Smythe also envisioned {{building}} a new shrine for his team. He described it as [...] "a place where people can go in evening clothes, {{if they want to}} come there for a party or dinner ... a place that people can be proud to bring their wives or girlfriends to". Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and Carlton Streets from the Eaton's department store chain for $350,000. Skeptics argued that Smythe would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> arena built, nor fill it, as the Depression was in full swing. [...] They referred to the arena plan as [...] "Smythe's Folly". [...] To help fund the arena, the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20% of their wages in shares in the arena. Just 4½ months after breaking ground, Maple Leaf Gardens opened on November 12, 1931. Many in the sold-out crowd of over 13,000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe's stated goal in building the arena. [...] In 1932, five years after Smythe's promise, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers.|$|E
500|$|When {{the series}} was {{canceled}} shortly {{after the release of}} , in which Carter dies, Meagan Damore of Comic Book Resources felt that [...] "for all intents and purposes" [...] Carter had [...] "effectively been phased out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and the universe had subsequently lost [...] "a wonderful role model and...inspiration" [...] to fans of the character and series. Damore lamented the fact that the second season's cliffhanger ending had been left unresolved, and that viewers would <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance to see Carter's [...] "happy ending", despite knowing she gets one, leaving the character's [...] "fate unfulfilled, languishing in the obscurity of 'what could have beens'". She also noted that Marvel had now lost [...] "the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events, {{not the least of which}} is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and added that despite making [...] "leaps and bounds for women in the MCU, the same [...] be said for people of color," [...] wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like Hazel Ying Lee, one of 38 Women Airforce Service Pilots who died in the line of duty, or Black women like Harriet Ida Pikens and Frances Wills, the first two Black members of the United States Naval Reserve.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E
