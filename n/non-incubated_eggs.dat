Here, we report the results of an experiment in which we examined how incubation and maternal preen oil affect the growth of avian eggshell microbes, using the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) as a model species. We compared the bacterial and fungal loads on the shell of <b>non-incubated</b> <b>eggs</b> and eggs incubated by females having free or blocked access to their preen gland. An increase of eggshell bacterial loads was observed in all conditions, but bacterial growth was higher on the shell of incubated eggs than on <b>non-incubated</b> <b>eggs.</b> We did not find any significant difference in eggshell bacterial growth for eggs incubated by females with free or blocked access to their preen gland. In addition, fungal growth during our experiment was not affected by incubation or the mother's preen oil. Our findings are in contrast with those of previous studies which showed that incubation limited or had no effect on eggshell bacterial growth. Differences in environmental conditions and/or species ecology may explain the difference between the results of our experiment and those of previous studies. Our study provides the first data on the effect of maternal preen oil on eggshell microorganisms, showing that preen oil does not limit eggshell microbial growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} methods {{for determining the}} sex of birds' eggs. It {{can be used for}} an early determination of the sex, in particular in poultry farming, and in this respect also with <b>non-incubated</b> <b>eggs.</b> In the method in accordance with the invention, electromagnetic radiation is emitted onto the blastodisk of an egg by a radiation source and, after a switching off of the radiation source, the decay behavior of the autofluorescence intensity excited by the electromagnetic radiation is detected by a detector at the irradiated region of the blastodisk with time resolution and spectral resolution for at least one wavelength of the autofluorescence. The fractal dimension DF is calculated using the determined measured intensity values and the value of the fractal dimension DF is compared with a species-specific and sex-specific limit value, wherein, when the limit value is exceeded, the respective egg is classified as female and, when it is not reached, the egg is classified as male...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitory {{effect of}} {{incubation}} on microbial growth has extensively {{been studied in}} wild bird populations using culture-based methods and conflicting results exist on whether incubation selectively affects the growth of microbes on the egg surface. In this study, we employed culture-independent methods, quantitative PCR and 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, to elucidate the effect of incubation on the bacterial abundance and bacterial community composition on the eggshells of the Eurasian Magpie (Pica pica). We found that total bacterial abundance increased and diversity decreased on incubated eggs while there were no changes on <b>non-incubated</b> <b>eggs.</b> Interestingly, Gram-positive Bacillus, which include mostly harmless species, became dominant and genus Pseudomonas, which include opportunistic avian egg pathogens, were significantly reduced after incubation. These results suggest that avian incubation in temperate regions may promote the growth of harmless (or benevolent) bacteria and suppress the growth of pathogenic bacterial taxa and consequently reduce the diversity of microbes on the egg surface. We hypothesize that this may occur due to difference in sensitivity to dehydration on the egg surface among microbes, combined {{with the introduction of}} Bacillus from bird feathers and due to the presenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} egg albumen {{has been widely}} documented. However, the changes of chemical nature and antimicrobial activity of egg albumen {{and the way it}} controls bacteria during incubation period were not well understood up to now. The purpose of the present investigation was to analyze the antimicrobial potential of egg albumen during early incubation stages (0 - 5 d). The changes of ovotransferrin and lysozyme content in egg albumen were quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that the concentration of ovotransferrin in egg albumen was increased closely with the time of incubation but that of lysozyme remained substantially unchanged and was very {{similar to that of the}} <b>non-incubated</b> <b>eggs.</b> The iron ion binding capacity and specific lysozyme activity of the egg albumen during early incubation stages was also investigated. The changes occurred in egg albumen during early incubation could influence the growth of Salmonella enteritidis. Very little difference was observed in the virulence response of Salmonella enteritidis to egg albumen collected at different incubation periods by using the expression of hilA gene as an indicator. Since the first few days of incubation are likely to place heavy demands on the immune capacities of the egg, due to the immunologically defenceless of developing embryo, the changes of antimicrobial activity in egg albumen shine a bright light on the innate immune mechanism of the fertilized egg during the early embryonic development...|$|E
