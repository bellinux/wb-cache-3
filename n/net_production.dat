A particularly compelling measure of humanity's cumulative impact is {{the fraction of}} the planet's <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> that we appropriate for our Net primary production-the net amount of solar energy converted to plant organic matter through photosynthesis-can be measured in units of elemental carbon and represents the primary food energy source for the world's ecosystems.

We then derive a spatial ba!mce sheet of <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> supply and demand for the world. We show that human appropriation of <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> varies spatially from almost zero to many times the local primary production.

40|$|The {{amount of}} Earth's {{vegetation}} or <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> required to support human activities is powerful measure of aggregate human {{impacts on the}} biosphere. Biophysical models applied to consumption statistics were used to estimate the annual amount of <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> {{in the form of}} elemental carbon required for food, fibre, and fuel-wood by the global population. The calculations were then compared to satellite-based estimates of Earth's average <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> to produce a geographically explicit balance sheet of <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> "supply" and "demand". Humans consume 20 % of Earth's <b>net</b> primary <b>production</b> (11. 5 petagrams carbon) annually and this percentage varies regionally from 6 % (South America) to over 70 % (Europe and Asia), and locally from near 0 % (central Australia) to over 30, 000 % (New York City, USA).

Upon release, After Earth was panned by film critics; its acting was criticized as melodramatic, and the writing and storytelling were also singled out for criticism.

25|$|Another notable {{feature of}} the MSR is the {{possibility}} of a thermal spectrum nuclear waste-burner. Conventionally only fast spectrum reactors have been considered viable for utilization or reduction of the spent nuclear stockpiles. The conceptual viability of a thermal waste-burner was first shown in a whitepaper by Seaborg Technologies spring 2015. Thermal waste-burning was achieved by replacing a fraction of the uranium in the spent nuclear fuel with thorium. The <b>net</b> <b>production</b> rate of transuranium element (e.g. plutonium and americium) is reduced below the consumption rate, thus reducing the magnitude of the nuclear storage problem. Without the nuclear proliferation concerns and other technical issues associated with a fast reactor.|$|E

40|$|We report {{rates of}} gross and <b>net</b> O 2 <b>production</b> {{measured}} in vitro during JGOFS cruises in the equatorial PaciÞc {{in spring and}} fall, 1992. We scale O 2 productivities to net and gross C production. We then compare the calculated rates with 14 C production and with new/export production measured by various techniques. 14 C productivities in samples incubated for 24 h are about 45 % of gross carbon production rates calculated from gross O 2 production. The di⁄erence is compatible with expected rates of the Mehler reaction, photorespiration, excretion, and community mitochondrial respiration. 14 C production rates are similar to <b>net</b> carbon <b>production</b> rates in {{the upper half of}} the euphotic zone. At lower irradiances, where <b>net</b> C <b>production</b> can be zero or less, 14 C productivities lie between <b>net</b> community <b>production</b> and gross primary <b>production.</b> <b>Net</b> carbon <b>production</b> rates in vitro are a factor of & 4 — 20 times greater than estimates from drifting sediment trap and tracer transport studies.

25|$|The Hadley Circulation can be {{considered}} as a heat engine. The Hadley circulation is identified with rising of warm and moist air in the equatorial region with the descent of colder air in the subtropics corresponding to a thermally driven direct circulation, with consequent <b>net</b> <b>production</b> of kinetic energy. The thermodynamic efficiency of the Hadley system, considered as a heat engine, has been relatively constant over the 1979~2010 period, averaging 2.6%. Over the same interval, the power generated by the Hadley regime has risen at an average rate of about 0.54 TW per yr; this reflects an increase in energy input to the system consistent with the observed trend in the tropical sea surface temperatures.|$|E
500|$|As per {{the report}} of {{agricultural}} statistics of 2014 published by the Central Statistical Office of Zambia, the major economic activity in the province was fishing. The chief artery of the province is the Samfya-Mansa-Mwansabombwe-Nchelenge highway, known as the Zambia Way. Though rich in natural resources, the province {{is one of the}} backward districts in the country. As of 2004, 79 per cent of the population was poor against a national average of 68. The total area of crops planted during the year 2014 in the province was [...] which constituted 3.06 per cent of the total area cultivated in Zambia. The <b>net</b> <b>production</b> stood at 150,029 metric tonnes, which formed 3.68 per cent of the total agricultural production in the country.

[...] They were allowed to keep a pig, a goat, some sheep and chickens on the land to help them provide for their families. This 'feudal system' was practiced upto 1900.

2500|$|The {{methods for}} {{measurement}} of primary production {{vary depending on}} whether gross vs <b>net</b> <b>production</b> is the desired measure, and whether terrestrial or aquatic systems are the focus. [...] Gross production is almost always harder to measure than net, because of respiration, which is a continuous and ongoing process that consumes some of the products of primary production (i.e. sugars) {{before they can be}} accurately measured. [...] Also, terrestrial ecosystems are generally more difficult because a substantial proportion of total productivity is shunted to below-ground organs and tissues, where it is logistically difficult to measure. [...] Shallow water aquatic systems can also face this problem.|$|E

50|$|Energy {{transfer}} between trophic {{levels is}} generally inefficient, such that <b>net</b> <b>production</b> at one trophic level is generally only 10% of the <b>net</b> <b>production</b> at the preceding trophic level (the Ten percent law, first formulated by Raymond Lindeman). Due to non-predatory death, egestion, and respiration, {{a significant amount}} of energy is lost to the environment instead of being absorbed for production by consumers. The figure approximates the fraction of energy available after each stage of energy loss in a typical ecosystem, although these fractions vary greatly from ecosystem to ecosystem and from trophic level to trophic level. The loss of energy by a factor of one half from each of the steps of non-predatory death, defecation, and respiration is typical of many living systems. Thus, the <b>net</b> <b>production</b> at one trophic level is approximately ten percent that of the trophic level before it.|$|E
