25|$|While at Yale, Horn {{also began}} her drawing practice, which she {{describes}} as “absolutely essential to me, although <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> viewer. My drawing was always about my relationship to it, not the audience’s.” Produced from the 1980s onwards, her drawings are collage-like blots of pigment applied to sometimes torn and (once again) diagrammatically pieced-together sheets of paper. Small markings – words and numbers – track the work’s progression built up with the recomposing of the image. In the 1990s, Horn's drawings grew in scale.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{also pointed}} to the {{dominance}} of Warren Thomson, who single-handedly chose the repertoire and all the jurors, {{many of whom are}} associated with the Australian Institute of Music (AIM), of which he was Artistic Director, Professional Development Programs. With assistance from others, he also auditioned all the entrants, and chose the 36 competitors. Alexei Yemtsov, a competitor at the 2000 competition, lived in Thomson's home and Thomson became his official guardian. That year, the minimum age was lowered from 18 to 17, although Thomson denied it {{had anything to do with}} Yemtsov's being only 17 at the time. The pianist Simon Tedeschi has said he [...] "has no intention of ever collaborating with Thomson and SIPCA ... The school of pianism with which he associates himself is <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> taste ... The trained-seal mentality makes for poor musicianship, and, ultimately, unhappy lives". Margaret Hair, AIM's former head of keyboard studies, said: [...] "There's a feeling among teachers that with Warren [...] in charge, Australian students have little chance of making the final cut. The most tragic outcome of his effect on the piano scene in this country is a sense of hopelessness that most students now feel".|$|E

2500|$|The Prince as {{he appears}} in The Sands of Time is {{generally}} {{seen as the}} most likable version of the character, with critics and fans praising his portrayal and development. The Prince's change into a darker character for Warrior Within received a notoriously mixed response, with fans and many critics seeing it as a change for the worst. Mechner was among them, commenting on Wired that he was [...] "not {{a fan of the}} artistic direction, or the violence that earned it an M rating. The story, character, dialog, voice acting, and visual style were <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> taste". Others praised the change, such as Heather Newman of Detroit Free Press, who praised the character's portrayal and design. Despite the mixed critic and fan reception, Ubisoft have defended the change as a legitimate evolution of the Prince's character. The Prince's return to a persona similar to that in The Sands of Time both pleased Mechner and was more favorably received by critics and fans. GameSpot's Bob Colayco enjoyed how the game seemed to self-reference the criticism in its portrayal of the character and his struggle with his Dark Prince persona. He praised the portrayal of this struggle, saying [...] "the internal strife in the schizophrenic prince's mind forms a compelling part of the storyline".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hold that}} Ludwig {{was murdered by}} his enemies while {{attempting}} to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864–1933), stated, [...] "Three years after the king's death I was made {{to swear an oath}} that I would never say certain things — <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife, not on my deathbed, and not to any priest … The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should happen to me in either peacetime or war." [...] Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes which were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, in order to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. [...] "As the king stepped up to his boat and put one foot in it, a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat." [...] However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey Loden coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12°C) of the lake during an escape attempt.|$|E
