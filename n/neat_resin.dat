Composite quasi-static delamination initiation toughness showed no clear trends with respect to temperature or loading rate, but toughness values were generally higher at higher temperatures. Composite fatigue delamination onset and crack propagation rates were strongly dependent on temperature, with delamination onset occurring at a lower number of cycles and crack propagation rates being higher for a given maximum applied strain energy release rate. The <b>neat</b> <b>resin</b> fracture mechanisms were a key factor in explaining the composite quasi-static and fatigue behavior, but no quantitative predictions of composite fracture behavior could be made since the crack tip mechanisms apparently changed...|$|E
40|$|Graphite/polyimide {{composite}} materials are attractive candidates {{for a wide}} range of aerospace applications. They have many of the virtues of graphite/epoxies, i. e., high specific strengths and stiffness, and also outstanding thermal/oxidative stability. Yet they are not widely used in the aerospace industry due to problems of procesability. By their nature, modern addition polyimide (PI) resins and prepregs are more complex than epoxies; the key to processing lies in characterizing and understanding the materials. Chemical and rheological characterizations are carried out on several addition polyimide resins and graphite reinforced prepregs, including those based on PMR- 15, LARC 160 (AP 22), LARC 160 (Curithane 103) and V 378 A. The use of a high range torque transducer with a Rheometrics mechanical spectrometer allows rheological data to be generated on prepreg materials as well as <b>neat</b> <b>resins.</b> The use of prepreg samples instead of <b>neat</b> <b>resins</b> eliminates the need for preimidization of the samples and the data correlates well with processing behavior found in the shop.

At room temperature, the "in situ " plane-strain energy release rate, GIc, of polysulfone was a factor of four lower than the <b>neat</b> <b>resin</b> GIc. By comparing the temperature dependencies of the composite GIc to the <b>neat</b> <b>resin</b> GIc, we concluded that the release of residual thermal strain energy did not contribute to the observed loss of tough-ness.

The work was based upon a TRW discovered family of polyimides currently licensed to and marketed by Ethyl Corporation as EYMYD(R) resins. The approach investigated to provide improved thermo-oxidative properties was to use halogenated derivatives of the diamine, 2, 2 -bis (4 -(4 -aminophenoxy) phenyl) hexafluoropropane (4 -BDAF).

The thermally induced Michael addition and polymerization reactions of the blended co-monomers were monitored using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at several heating rates to enable the kinetics of the processes to be investigated.

The morphology of the composites was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Image Analysis software. The dispersion and interfacial interaction between CaCO 3 and the polymer matrix were also investigated by SEM. The thermal properties of HDPE and its composites were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The crystallization process of the composites samples {{was found to be}} slightly different than that of the neat HDPE. Otherwise the presence of CaCO 3 did not have a considerable effect on the melting behavior of the composites.

40|$|Effect of thermo-oxidative aging on {{three-dimensional}} and four-directional braided carbon fiber/epoxy composite Wei Fan, Jia-lu Li and Dandan Guo An {{experimental study}} {{was performed to}} investigate the effect of high temperature exposure on flexural properties of the three-dimensional and four-directional braided carbon fiber/epoxy composite and the corresponding <b>neat</b> <b>resin.</b> For this purpose, samples were exposed to 90 C, 120 C, 150 C, and 180 C (below and above the glass transition tem-perature of the matrix resin) for various periods of time up to 13 days. The flexural properties combining with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), weight loss, scanning electron micro-scope (SEM), and optical microscope analyses were performed on the unaged and aged samples. The results revealed that the thermo-oxidative behavior of the braided composite was {{significantly different from the}} <b>neat</b> <b>resin.</b> The flexural strength of the <b>neat</b> <b>resin</b> decreased dramatically due to the oxidation degradation of the sample surface when the aging temperature was equal to its glass transition temperature. The extensive degradations of both the matrix and the fiber/ matrix interface, especially for the interface, were responsible for the significant decrease in flexural strength of the braided composite. The flexural strength retention rates of the braided composite were higher than that of the <b>neat</b> <b>resin</b> after exposure to 90 C, 120 C and 150 C because the integral structure of the braided composite can make the fiber bear flexural force together although the matrix resin and the fiber/matrix interface had a certain degree of damage after longtime thermo-oxidative aging...|$|E

A clear correlation is {{found between the}} two sets of data. With brittle resins, the interlaminar critical strain energy release rates are somewhat larger than the <b>neat</b> <b>resin</b> values due to a full transfer of the <b>neat</b> <b>resin</b> toughness to the composite and toughening mechanisms associated with crack growth.

The use of bisimide amine hardeners to cure epoxy resins causes a significant improvement in the char-forming characteristics of the cured resin. Compared to epoxy resins cured with a conventional amine, such as 4, 4 '-diaminodiphenylsulfone, the bisimide cured epoxies exhibit about a twofold improvement in the aerobic char yield at 800 C.

The highly polar tricationic protic ammonium carboxylate ionic liquid shows a high contact angle on the resin surface and distributes inside the epoxy matrix as spheres of around 50 µm in diameter, with a mean density of approximately 38 mm 2. The presence of the ionic liquid fluid phase inside the cavities has been determined by SEM observation of fracture surfaces and FTIR microscopy. The DCi phase reduces the residual curing enthalpy and the glass transition temperature, as determined by DSC, without significantly changing microhardness or electrical resistivity values.
