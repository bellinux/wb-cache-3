The insurance market changed in the 2002 - 2011 period. Those changes can be seen in various fields of commercial insurance. Data on the number of insurers, total premiums written, and the trends in claim payments and claim ratios were used to perform a market trend analysis. It should be emphasized that Poland experienced the results of the financial crisis in the insurance market later than Lithuania, which is visible in specific ratios under analysis. In Lithuania, in terms of <b>insurance</b> expenditures, <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> are definitely more popular, while in Poland life insurance plays the most important role.

40|$|Existing {{studies in}} the past have come to the result that {{insurance}} is a luxury good. Often it is those that have wealth to protect that can afford to protect their property. This leads to the assumption that one can differentiate between a 'rich' country and a 'developing' country by the amount of insurance penetration in the industry. Using national wealth statistics, this research undertakes a multiple regression analysis to assess the relationship between <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> penetration and national wealth. The reason for this choice of variable as opposed to income, is that individuals seek to protect ~ their assets thus mitigating the risk of loss or damage of these assets. This means that in order to purchase insurance, there needs to be the presence of wealth that needs protecting. The sample comprises of 45 countries at different stages of economic growth therefore, enabling a distinction to be made between developed and developing nations. The overall result of the study found that national wealth, government consumption and wealth distribution affect demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>products.</b> It was seen that an increase in wealth resulted in an increase in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> penetration, but at a decreasing rate, therefore showing a wealth elasticity of demand that is less than unity. Government consumption on the other hand, has a negative impact on <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand, hence assuming that it is as insurance substitute. For wealth distribution, the result was that there is a positive relationship between wealth inequality and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> penetration.

40|$|Insurance {{is defined}} as an {{economic}} device to reduce or eliminate risks, by transferring the risks from individuals to insurance companies. The development of the insurance market {{is important for the}} economy through protecting assets, capital mobilisation and promoting trade. Knowledge of consumer behavior in the insurance market is important in understanding customer needs and wants. Demand for insurance is driven by many factors across the world, chief among them demographic, social, cultural and institutional factors. While several studies have been conducted to explain demand for life insurance, very little has been done for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> Nevertheless, most of the studies to date have been concentrated in developed countries. This research investigates the demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> in Harare, the latter being a developing country set up. The aim of the study is to examine the determinants of demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> To achieve this, a cross-sectional survey was conducted on 120 respondents drawn from buyers of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> from six <b>insurance</b> companies in Harare. The data were collected through questionnaires and analysed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient and t-tests using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The major findings of the study indicate that income, age, education and legal compulsion variables are positively related to demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> Income was found to be the strongest predictor of the demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> There is no evidence from the survey on the positive influence of personal and cultural variables. The findings have important implications on policy formulation for both the regulatory authorities and insurance companies, particularly in influencing marketing strategies. â€...|$|R
40|$|Insurance {{sector in}} India was privatised to {{publicise}} <b>insurance</b> <b>products.</b> After privatisation of this industry in India {{in the year}} 2000, the next important step taken in the general insurance industry was the removal of tariffs on the <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> with effect from January 1, 2007. The introduction of the free price regime has provided an impetus to the non-life sector. Before the introduction of de-tariffication almost 70 % {{of the business of}} the non-life sector was driven by various tariffs prescribed by the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC). The TAC was established under the Insurance Act, 1938, to control and regulate the rates, terms, conditions of general insurance business. TAC has been playing a significant role to specify the tariffs for the product offered by the various insurers in India. Withdrawal of the administered price mechanism from January 1, 2007 has led insurers to design new and innovative suitable products to sustain in the competitive market. The public sector insurance companies enjoyed the monopoly status as a result they lacked flexibility and were not much concerned with profitability. This resulted in erosion of underwriting skills and income of the public sector insurance companies So, the present study is an attempt to examine the growth and performance of the public sector insurance companies operating in India in the competitive scenari...|$|R
40|$|Property and {{casualty}} actuaries are professional {{experts in}} the economic assessment of uncertain events related to <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> (e. g. fire, liability or motor insurance). For {{the construction of a}} fair and reasonable tariff associated with the risks in their portfolio, actuaries have many statistical techniques in their toolbox. In this paper tools for the pricing of multivariate risks are considered. Examples of situations where this problem occurs are numerous; e. g. workers’ compensation schemes where the insurer has information on accidents occurring ‘at work’ as well as ‘not at work’, policyholders having policies in multiple lines of business (e. g. flood, theft etc.) at the same company, or policyholders holding multiple contracts e. g. in a motor insurance context. The latter is the situation we will explore in this paper, using a data set from a European insurance company. The combination of a priori rating (through risk classification based on a priori measurable characteristics) and a posteriori rating is considered. A posteriori the claim experience of a policyholder is taken into account. In a multivariate context the pricing actuary should be able to use claim history from all business lines or risk components a policyholder is holding within the company. Intuitively, the number of claims a policyholder has reported on a particular business line or risk component reveals his general risk proneness and is as such relevant when pricing other lines or components. In contrast to the analytical approaches developed for multivariate experience rating in the literature, our approach is data-driven using Bayesian statistics. Empirical evidence has been found of positive dependence between different contracts belonging to the same policy holder, which is an intuitively appealing result. Focus is on applications of the multivariate Bayesian experience rating, as well as on graphical representations of the results...|$|R

40|$|Standard actuarial {{approaches}} for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> {{suggest that the}} premium {{is divided into three}} main components: the actuarial price, the safety loading, and the loading for expenses. The number of product-specific policies from different companies has increased significantly, and strong market competition has boosted the demand for a competitive premium in global insurance market. Thus, the actuarial premium could eventually be altered by an insurer's marketing and management department regarding the competitive environment. Thus in this thesis, considering the competition in insurance market, game theoretical approaches are applied to investigate the influence of competition on general insurance pricing. Firstly, a two-period deterministic N-player game is formulated to investigate the optimal pricing strategy by calculating the Nash equilibrium in an insurance market. Under that framework, each insurer is assumed to maximise its utility of wealth over the unit time interval. By analyzing the competition between each pair of insurers, the whole markets' competition is characterized through an aggregation. With the purpose of solving a game of N-players, the best-response potential game with non-linear aggregation is implemented. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is proved by finding a potential function of all insurers' payoff functions. A 12 -player insurance game illustrates the theoretical findings under the framework in which the best-response selection premium strategies always provide the global maximum value of the corresponding payoff function. Secondly, deterministic differential games are constructed with the purpose of studying the insurers' equilibrium premium in a competitive market. We apply an optimal control theory to determine the open-loop Nash equilibrium premium strategies. In this direction, two models are formulated and studied. The market power of each insurance company is characterized by a price sensitive parameter, and the business volume is affected by the solvency ratio. Considering the average market premiums, the first model studies an exponential relation between premium strategies and volume of business. The other model initially characterizes the competition between any selected pair of insurers, then aggregates all the paired competitions in the market. Numerical examples illustrate the premium dynamics, and show that premium cycles may exist in equilibrium. Thirdly, a multi-stage stochastic game will be constructed. Insurers are considered to be risk-averse, that is, insurers will to set risk-premiums on their products with the purpose of avoiding risk. Mean-variance Utility function will be adopted. The expenditures of insurance companies will be discussed separately as exposure related costs and non-exposure related costs. The expenditures of insurance companies will be discussed separately as exposure related costs and non-exposure-based costs. The exposure-based component is assumed to be stochastic.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{insurance}} market activity within financial development is gaining more attention in academia, as the sector experiences growth within emerging markets. This paper aims to understand which macro-economic and social variables impact the growth or {{decline of the}} <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> sector broadly across Africa, {{with a view to}} provide recommendations to drive increased penetration across the region. The study examines the explanatory factors of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand in Africa, using annual data from 1990 to 2013 on 28 countries.
