5|$|<b>Navigator</b> {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the <b>navigator</b> by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1940, two Ansons {{took off}} from the Forest Hill air base for a {{cross-country}} training exercise over southern New South Wales. Tail number N4876 was piloted by Leading Aircraftman Leonard Graham Fuller, 22, from Cootamundra, with Leading Aircraftman Ian Menzies Sinclair, 27, from Glen Innes, as <b>navigator.</b> Tail number L9162 was piloted by Leading Aircraftman Jack Inglis Hewson, 19, from Newcastle, with Leading Aircraftman Hugh Gavin Fraser, 27, from Melbourne, as <b>navigator.</b> Their planned route was expected to take them first to Corowa, then to Narrandera, and finally back to Forest Hill.|$|E

5|$|With Finney's help, Mau {{was awarded}} a special {{fellowship}} at the East-West Center. Mau returned to Honolulu in April 1975 to begin work with the Hawaii-based Polynesian Voyaging Society, eventually navigating the double-hulled canoe, Hōkūle‘a, from Hawaii to Tahiti on its maiden voyage in 1976. Mau trained and mentored Native Hawaiian <b>navigator</b> Nainoa Thompson, who would later become a master <b>navigator.</b> David Henry Lewis, a scholar of Polynesian navigation, documented Mau's work.|$|E
5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, <b>navigator</b> radar, <b>navigator</b> plotter and air {{electronics}} officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the <b>navigator</b> radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E

40|$|This study {{employed}} a novel method to dissociate {{the use of}} external visual information and internal spatial representations in human navigation. Using a goal-directed walking task and gaze-contingent displays, 14 participants with normal vision navigated within an immersive virtual forest during which each participant’s field of view (FOV) was restricted to 10, 20, or 40 deg in diameter. Participants were classified into two groups, good and poor <b>navigators,</b> based on a cluster analysis of their individual mean latencies, walk times, and path efficiencies in the 10 deg condition. Changes in performance measures across the three FOVs were calculated for the two groups. Significant interactions were found, with the overall performance of the poor <b>navigators</b> decreasing {{at a faster rate}} than the performance of the good <b>navigators.</b> Perceptual spans were also calculated for the two groups, and it was determined that the good <b>navigators</b> were able to complete the same task as effectively as the poor <b>navigators</b> with a smaller FOV. Collectively, these results support recent theories stating that good <b>navigators</b> rely on internal spatial representations {{to a greater extent than}} poor <b>navigators</b> do...|$|R

5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and <b>navigator.</b> The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The <b>navigator</b> went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, <b>navigator</b> and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|In 1953, The <b>Navigators</b> {{acquired}} {{its current}} headquarter location at Glen Eyrie through Billy Graham's {{sale of the}} then-vacant property to Trotman's organization. As {{a result of a}} well-organized fund raising effort despite an extremely tight deadline, friends of The <b>Navigators</b> provided the money needed to purchase the site. Today, The <b>Navigators</b> organizes and offers over 100 Christian conferences, retreats, and programs each year at Glen Eyrie.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Navigators</b> {{organization}} was cited {{in a lawsuit}} against the United States Air Force Academy by Michael Weinstein in 2005. The lawsuit alleged that Darren and Gina Lindblom, assigned to the Academy through The <b>Navigators,</b> were favored by the Air Force to the exclusion of other religious groups in violation of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. This lawsuit was dismissed. Additional lawsuits by Weinstein's organization, the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, have named The <b>Navigators</b> in similar complaints of alleged proselytizing in the military. In Korea, The <b>Navigators</b> sued six former members for libel in 2011. They all were acquitted.|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} investigation {{concluded that}} the flight, regarded as a controlled flight into terrain, was caused by pilot errors {{and that there was}} no fault with the aircraft. Contributing factors causing the accident were lack of a procedure for offset localizer approach for setting approach course on the HSIs. Thus, both HSIs were set incorrectly, which along with the course deviation indicator hinted that the plane was being blown to the left and needed to adjust course to the right. Because he was in a stressed situation, the <b>navigator</b> set the GPS in the wrong mode. He also did not have sufficient time to recheck his work, allowing mistakes to happen, and his work was not monitored by the pilots. As the <b>navigator</b> was overworked, it was inappropriate for the first officer to transfer the responsibility of lateral control to him.|$|E
