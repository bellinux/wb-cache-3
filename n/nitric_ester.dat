The vasodilator activities were determined through an in vitro vascular relaxation assay (organ bath) using PGF 2 -precontracted porcine pulmonary arteries.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the “one-drug-one-target” {{paradigm}} has been shelved and numerous multi-target drugs have been projected and synthesised. Such compounds share two (or more) desired pharmacodynamic properties ensured {{by the presence of}} overlapping or conjugation of pharmacophores. This strategy has {{led to the development of}} important multi-target drugs consisting of pharmacodynamic hybrids obtained by combining a “native” drug with a molecular moiety able to release nitric oxide (NO), with the aim to reduce possible side-effects or improve the therapeutic impact. My PhD work was focused on the design, characterisation and pharmacological evaluation of two main classes of cardiovascular new “hybrid-drug”: the nitrooxy-derivatives of anti-hypertensive drugs such as sartans and the nitrooxy-derivatives of a hypoglycaemic drug such as glibenclamide. The new class of NO-sartans was represented by several dual compounds in which the native drug Losartan or its active metabolite EXP 3174 are linked to a <b>nitric</b> <b>ester</b> by a series of different spacers conveniently designed in order to modulate the NO-release. These drugs underwent a deep pharmacological characterisation on animal models, through an in vitro evaluation of their vasorelaxing, AT 1 -antagonist, cardioprotective, anti-hypertrophic and anti-platelet properties. Moreover also an in vivo experimental protocol was carried out in order to compare the NO-sartan effect on blood pressure with those of well-known anti-hypertensive drugs. The two nitrooxy-derivatives of the active metabolite of glibenclamide, the 4 -trans-hydroxy derivative, underwent an in vitro pharmacological study on animal models focused to demonstrate an additional vasorelaxing NO-mediated effect conferred through the NO-donor moiety. At the same time, these new hybrid molecules were evaluated by an other in vitro experimental protocol on human islets aimed to verify the maintenance of the hypoglycaemic property through the evaluation of the insulinotropic response...|$|E
40|$|Neurodegenerative {{disorders}} such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), {{along with}} cardiovascular diseases and cancer, are the top causes of morbidity and they are estimated to affect more than 37 million of people worldwide by the year 2020. Therefore, it appears interesting to design and synthesise molecules {{for the treatment of}} AD. Moreover, it is a pharmacochemical challenge, since there is still enough uncertainty about the molecular pathogenesis of nerve cell death and {{there has not been a}} really effective intervention yet. However, there is a series of pathobiochemical changes in the demented brain, which could be used as a starting point for rational design of molecules for the particular condition. Thus, the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles intracellularly, amyloid plaques extracellularly, a serious cholinergic deficit, oxidative stress, inflammation, reduction of nerve growth factor, increased apolipoprotein E 4 and hypercholesterolemia are interrelated factors contributing to cell death in AD. Furthermore, the possible neuroprotective role of nitric oxide radical (•NO) in AD as well as the ability of NO-donors to delay the development of the disease are well established. Consequently, there are several targets for the medicinal treatment of cognition disorders and the potential of multifunctional therapeutic agents for the treatment of complex neurodegenerative diseases has already been considered. In this work, we describe the synthesis of derivatives of ibuprofen, a known non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which has also been found to affect amyloid pathology in the brain and its long-term use has been associated with reduced risk of neurodegeneration. Ibuprofen is connected, via an amide bond, with an L-proline moiety, expected to contribute to the nootropic properties, since structurally related amides or esters of proline have some nootropic action and proline dipeptides have been found to be about 2000 times more potent than piracetam. Proline carboxylic group has further been converted to amide with L-cysteine ethyl ester and cysteamine, known antioxidants with low general toxicity. In addition, the carboxylic group of the intermediate proline amide has been esterified with 3 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) pyridine and 2 -methoxy- 4 -methylphenol, expected to offer neurotrophic and/or neuroprotective activity. Moreover, in order to enlighten the contribution of pyridyl ring of the 3 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) pyridine moiety, the carboxylic group of the intermediate proline amide has been esterified with 3 -phenylpropan- 1 -ol while esterification with 2 -bromoethanol and further reaction with silver nitrate has led to the synthesis of a <b>nitric</b> <b>ester.</b> Its hydrolysis during the isolation process has offered the opportunity to estimate the importance of the nitrooxy group. In addition, ibuprofen has directly been esterified with 3 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) pyridine and 2 -methoxy- 4 -methylphenol in an attempt to investigate the contribution of the L-proline residue to the molecular activity. Finally, the L-proline amide with isobutyric acid has been prepared and esterified with 3 -(3 -hydroxypropyl) pyridine and 2 -methoxy- 4 -methylphenol, facilitating to determine the importance of the ibuprofen moiety. The structures of all synthesised compounds were identified by elemental analysis (C, H, N) and spectroscopically (IR, 1 H-NMR). ...|$|E

In the last years, the increasing performance of the gel-permeation chromatography enabled the determination of the molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution of nitrocellulose in different propellants.

The amount of the stabilizer depletes with time; remaining content of less than 0.5% (with initial 2% content) requires increased surveillance of the munition, with less than 0.2% warranting immediate disposal, as the depletion of the stabilizer may lead to autoignition of the propellant.|$|R

40|$|The {{possible}} nitrating entities for the esterification of alcohols by {{nitric acid}} in sulphuric and perchloric acids have been discussed, and {{the interpretation of}} nitration mechanisms by correlation with acidity functions considered. The nitric acid esterification of 2 : 4 -dinitrobenzyl alcohol has been investigated {{over a wide range}} of sulphuric acid, but the alcohol proved unsuitable for kinetic study. Results have been obtained for the equilibrium formation of the sulphuric and <b>nitric</b> <b>esters</b> of this alcohol in 75 % - 85 % H 2 S 04. Kinetic studies have been made on the nitric acid esterification of iso-amyl alcohol in H 2 SO 4 at 0 °c. and 25 °c. The results have been correlated with acidity functions, but a critical survey of the latter has shown that they are not completely reliable guides to reaction mechanisms. Rates of esterification have been obtained in perchloric acid, and considered in relation to the ionisation of nitrous acid to the nitrosonium ion N 0 + in this acid. Correlation of results indicate that the nitronium ion N 02 is the nitric acid esterifying agent in HC 1 O 4. Corresponding information on the ionisation of nitrous acid in H 2 S 04 supports the N 02 mechanism in sulphuric acid. A tri-aryl carbinol indicator has been measured at 7 °C. in H 2 S 04 to give some indication of the effect of temperature on the ionisation of such indicators. A tri-aryl carbinol indicator has also been measured in HC 104 at 25 °c. as there is at present no existing acidity scale in this acid corresponding to Jo in H 2 S 04. Equilibrium constants for the nitric acid esterification of iso-amyl alcohol have been obtained in H 2 S 04 and HC 104, and the rate constants for the hydrolysis calculated.

40|$|Chemical, thermal and {{mechanical}} stability are important {{parts in the}} quality and safety assessment of propellants and explosives. Decomposition reactions limit the safe use time, the socalled lifetime. With explosives consisting of <b>nitric</b> acid <b>esters,</b> stabilizer consumption and molar mass (molecular weight) decrease are very suitable methods to predict the safe of use time or the remaining safe lifetime. Kinetic models for stabilizer and molar mass decrease are presented and the prediction methods discussed. A new model for stabilizer depletion, a combination of of first and zero order reaction, describes the decrease very good and the prediction of the lifetime is improved. The Arrhenius parameters for stabilizer consumption and molar mass decrease of gun and rocket propellants are given. Propellants produced with crystalline explosives and polymeric binders are more stable against thermal stress, but they also decompose exothermally at elevated temperatures. Important safety paramet ers of these materials are (i) {{the temperature of the}} beginning of the exothermal decomposition, (ii) the following adiabatic self heating with the characteristic heat rate and (iii) the pressure rate if the substance decomposes with gas evolution.

40|$|In {{spite of}} many {{publications}} {{dealing with the}} thermal decomposition of the cyclic nitramines RDX and HMX, the decomposition behavior of nitroguanidine (nigu), especially in the low temperature range, has not been investigated fundamentally in the past. Because nitroguanidine is an important explosive component for triple base propellants, {{a better understanding of}} the thermal decomposition at low temperatures is of interest. For example, aging studies of triple base propellants exhibited a different decomposition behavior from single and double base propellants. Therefore nigu is supposed to influence the safe life time of propellants containing <b>nitric</b> acid <b>esters.</b> The investigations of the decomposition of nigu published in the past, have been performed at temperatures between 190 degree C and 240 degree C. The aim of this work was to study the decomposition behavior of nigu at temperatures as low as possible. In this connection, temperatures between 110 degree C and 240 degree C hav e been used. In this temperature range, nitroguanidines with different grain sizes have been investigated by measuring the weight loss and analyzing the decomposition gases by mass spectrometry. Also solid residues, like ammeline and melamine, remaining after the degradation tests were analyzed quantitatively by using high performance liquid chromatography. The formation of melamine and ammeline was found to depend strongly on the amount of the weight loss of nigu. The better stability behavior of triple base propellants is possibly due to the formation of NH sub 3 which is being formed in the decomposition process of nigu. Ammonia reacts with nitric oxides and behaves therefore similar as a stabilizer...|$|R
40|$|During {{the storage}} of <b>nitric</b> acid <b>ester</b> based {{propellants}} at elevated temperatures the splitting probability of the CO-NO sub 2 -bond is increased {{with the formation of}} nitric oxides and a degradation of the polymeric nitrocellulose. This reduces the values of the mean molar masses Mn, Mw an Mz and the stabilizer content. Therefore the chemical as well as the mechanical properties of the propellants are changed, normally worsened. In addition, decomposition gases are produced and heat is generated by exothermal reactions. Three double base rocket propellants and a single base gun propellant were used to find out stabilizer consumption, molar mass degradation and heat generation between 50 to 90 degree C and 40 to 110 degrees C respectively. Stabilizer depletion was measured by HPLC, molar mass degradation by GPC and heat generation by microcalorimetry using a Thermal Activity Monitor by Thermometric AB, Sweden. The conditioning times at different temperatures were determined with one of the rocket propellants and the influence of a long storage at 60 degree C, 2191 days, on the heat production was investigated. In addition, a correlated experiment between stabilizer consumption during prestorage and heat generation showed, that the heat production does not increase substantially until the stabilizer has been consumed almost completely. Both, molar mass degradation of the nitrocellulose and stabilizer consumption were investigated of one the double base rocket propellants. The experimental values of the molar mass Mw are described by a kinetic model base on statistical chain scission caused by the decomposition of chain segments.

40|$|Recently, {{methacrylic acid}} epoxide (MAE) has been {{proposed}} as a precursor to an important class of isoprene-derived compounds found in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) : 2 -methylglyceric acid (2 -MG) {{and a set of}} oligomers, <b>nitric</b> acid <b>esters,</b> and sulfuric acid esters related to 2 -MG. However, the specific chemical mechanisms by which MAE could form these compounds have not been previously studied with experimental methods. In order to determine the relevance of these processes to atmospheric aerosol, MAE and 2 -MG have been synthesized and a series of bulk solution-phase experiments aimed at studying the reactivity of MAE using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy have been performed. The present results indicate that the acid-catalyzed MAE reaction is more than 600 times slower than a similar reaction of an important isoprene-derived epoxide, but is still expected to be kinetically feasible in the atmosphere on more acidic SOA. The specific mechanism by which MAE leads to oligomers was identified, and the reactions of MAE with a number of atmospherically relevant nucleophiles were also investigated. Because the nucleophilic strengths of water, sulfate, alcohols (including 2 -MG), and acids (including MAE and 2 -MG) in their reactions with MAE were found to be of similar magnitudes, it is expected that a diverse variety of MAE + nucleophile product species may be formed on ambient SOA. Thus, the results indicate that epoxide chain reaction oligomerization will be limited by the presence of high concentrations of non-epoxide nucleophiles (such as water); {{this finding is consistent with}} previous environmental chamber investigations of the relative humidity dependence of 2 -MG-derived oligomerization processes and suggests that extensive oligomerization may not be likely on ambient SOA because of other competitive MAE reaction mechanisms...|$|R

Similar to insulin, ghrelin acutely stimulated increased production of NO in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) in primary culture (assessed using NO-specific fluorescent dye 4, 5 -diaminofluorescein) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Production of NO in response to ghrelin (100 nM, 10 min) in human aortic endothelial cells was blocked by pretreatment of cells with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl <b>ester</b> (<b>nitric</b> oxide synthase inhibitor), wortmannin [phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3 -kinase inhibitor], or (D-Lys 3) -GHRP- 6 (selective antagonist of ghrelin receptor GHSR- 1 a), as well as by knockdown of GHSR- 1 a using small-interfering (si) RNA (but not by mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor PD- 98059). Moreover, ghrelin stimulated increased phosphorylation of Akt (Ser 473) and eNOS (Akt phosphorylation site Ser 1179) that was inhibitable by knockdown of GHSR- 1 a using siRNA or by pretreatment of cells with wortmannin but not with PD- 98059. Ghrelin also stimulated phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in BAEC. However, unlike insulin, ghrelin did not stimulate MAP kinase-dependent secretion of the vasoconstrictor endothelin- 1 from BAEC. We conclude that ghrelin has novel vascular actions to acutely stimulate production of NO in endothelium using a signaling pathway that involves GHSR- 1 a, PI 3 -kinase, Akt, and eNOS.
