The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations. <b>National</b> <b>groups</b> opposing the recall included America Votes, believed to be financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, {{genocide}} {{does not}} necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of <b>national</b> <b>groups,</b> with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves. The objectives of such a plan would be the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of <b>national</b> <b>groups,</b> and the destruction of the personal security, liberty, health, dignity, and even the lives of the individuals belonging to such groups.|$|E

25|$|Soviet {{diplomatic}} efforts removed the extermination of political groups from the United Nations Convention on Genocide.

25|$|Among {{the causes}} for the Turkish {{campaign}} against the Greek-speaking christian population was a fear that they would aid the Ottoman Empire's enemies, and a belief among some Turks that to form a modern nation state {{it was necessary to}} purge from the territories of the state those <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> who could threaten the integrity of a modern Turkish nation state.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Through the {{development}} of a Values Questionnaire this study examined the relative importance of values in multinational settings. The Values studied were Respect, Power, Intelligence, Wealth, Skill, Health, Human Kindness, and Love. The person-centered approach was selected as a particular social science community for the focus of the study. Ninety-two attendees of person-centered workshops in Zinal, Switzerland and Marienburg, West Germany volunteered to participate in the study. Representing seventeen countries, the research participants rated the values on a nine-point scale of importance from unimportant to important. The rating was performed from a personal standpoint and from the perception of most members of one's <b>national</b> <b>group.</b> The hypotheses were (1) there will be {{a significant difference between the}} eight values in their importance rating, and (2) personal value importance differs significantly from <b>national</b> <b>group</b> value importance. The results indicated that the eight values were considered to be distinct and that personal value importance differed from <b>national</b> <b>group</b> value importance. In an analysis of variance, the differences between the values and the personal and <b>national</b> <b>group</b> ratings were significant at the. 001 level. A Newman-Keuls post hoc comparison identified the personal ratings with the highest importance placed on Love, Respect, Health, and Human Kindness; whereas, the <b>national</b> <b>group</b> ratings placed the highest importance on Wealth, Power, Skill, and Intelligence. The Values Questionnaire was able to assess levels of value importance in multinational settings. The problems of translation were minimal. The values measured were considered as separate entities and received different ratings from personal and <b>national</b> <b>group</b> perspectives. Specific differences that were identified within and between the personal and <b>national</b> <b>group</b> ratings are reflective of the values existing within the person-centered community...|$|R

25|$|The College of Cardinals was {{generally}} {{divided into two}} blocs: curial, pro-Jesuit (zelanti) and political, anti-Jesuit. The first one was formed by the Italian curial cardinals who opposed the secular influences on the Church. The second one included crown-cardinals of the Catholic courts. These two blocs were in no way homogenous. Zelanti were divided into moderate and radical factions. The anti-Jesuit bloc was divided into several <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> with different interests.|$|E

25|$|American {{immigration}} history {{can be viewed}} in four epochs: the colonial period, the mid-19th century, {{the start of the}} 20th century, and post-1965. Each period brought distinct <b>national</b> <b>groups,</b> races and ethnicities to the United States. During the 17th century, approximately 400,000 English people migrated to Colonial America. Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as indentured servants. The mid-19th century saw mainly an influx from northern Europe; the early 20th-century mainly from Southern and Eastern Europe; post-1965 mostly from Latin America and Asia.|$|E
25|$|Štúr's notions (an {{autonomous}} Slovak area, a Slovak Diet (assembly), Slovak schools, etc.) came {{to fruition}} simultaneously with the 1848 Revolution in Hungary, which {{dealt with the}} liberation of peasants from serfdom and other national and ethnic issues. Hungarian revolutionaries called for Hungary’s separation from Vienna, {{but at the same}} time, they wanted to see Hungary as one nation with one language and one educational system. But the desires of the Magyars for a centralized Hungarian state ran contrary to the wishes of other <b>national</b> <b>groups,</b> including the Slovaks. Slovak and Hungarian revolutionary claims ran counter to each other.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} {{the signing of the}} {{agreement}} with Britain, Aung San signed an agreement at the Panglong Conference on 12 February 1947 with leaders from other <b>national</b> <b>groups,</b> expressing solidarity and support for a united Burma. Karen representatives played a relatively minor role in the conference and, as subsequent rebellions revealed, remained alienated from the new state. U Aung Zan Wai, U Pe Khin, Major Aung, Sir Maung Gyi, Dr Sein Mya Maung, and Myoma U Than Kywe were among the negotiators of the historic Panglong Conference negotiated with Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947. These leaders unanimously decided to join the Union of Burma.|$|E

25|$|In Eastern Europe the General Jewish Labour Bund {{called for}} Jewish {{autonomy}} within Eastern Europe and promoted Yiddish as the Jewish national language. Like Zionism, the Bund {{was founded in}} 1897 {{and it was one}} of the largest socialist movements in Europe, however it did not grow as fast as Zionism. The Bund campaigned for Jewish autonomy and recognition of Jewish (non-territorial) national rights within a post-socialist Russia. Initially the Bund included Zionist Socialist parties but over time the leadership came to oppose Zionism and Orthodox Judaism. The socialist movement recognized various <b>national</b> <b>groups,</b> but the Jews were not one of them. The socialist movement was generally unwilling to combat worker anti-Semitism and often failed to publicly condemn pogroms.|$|E
25|$|By November 1938, Esterházy raised {{additional}} {{demands for}} extension of Hungarian minority rights. The autonomous Slovak government evaluated {{the situation in}} the annexed territory, then did the opposite – binding Hungarian minority rights to the level provided by Hungary which de facto meant their reduction. The applied principle of reciprocity blocked official registration of the SMP and the existence of several Hungarian institutions, as similar organizations were not permitted in Hungary. Moreover, the government banned usage of Hungarian national colors, singing the Hungarian national anthem, did not recognize equality of Hungarian <b>national</b> <b>groups</b> in Bratislava and cancelled a planned office of state secretary for Hungarian minority. The Hungarian government and Esterházy protested against the principle and criticized it as non-constructive.|$|E
