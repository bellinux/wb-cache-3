25|$|Mobilization, {{recruitment}} and logistics. From about 1700 to 1820, <b>no</b> <b>nation</b> on the Gold Coast of West Africa (region of modern-day Ghana) excelled the Ashanti {{in the scale}} of their military organization and activity. Wars of conquest made them the major power in the area, and they fought and won several major clashes against the British, before going down to defeat {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century. A small core of professional warriors was supplemented by peasant levies, volunteers and contingents from allied or tributary tribes. Grouped together under competent commanders such as Osei Tutu and Opoku Ware, such hosts began to expand the Ashanti empire in the 18th century on into the 19th, moving from deep inland to the edges of the Atlantic. One British source in 1820 estimated that the Ashanti could field a potential 80,000 troops, and of these, 40,000 could in theory, be outfitted with muskets or blunder-busses.|$|E

25|$|The invading {{nation is}} never {{specified}} in the books; in fact, <b>no</b> <b>nation</b> in the world meets the criteria {{laid out in the}} series, most likely by deliberate intent of the author. Likewise, no parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, or how well the war is going for the Australian military. However the invaders are described in the series as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations seeing the vast underdeveloped spaces of Australia as a way to tackle their overpopulation (Most likely Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines) and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Its important for context to note that at time the series was written starting around 1990 and peaking in 1995, 2000 and 2013 there was ever increasing waves of economic migrants and asylum seekers or 'boat people' attempting to reach Australia from neighbouring pacific countries leading to the controversial creation of foreign detention centres known as the Pacific Solution.|$|E

25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} {{evolved in}} the years between World War I and World War II. Flight decks were installed on several different types of ships to explore the possibilities of operating naval aircraft without the performance limitations of floatation devices required for seaplanes and flying boats. The most successful of these early aircraft carriers were built from battlecruisers. Battlecruisers typically had a speed of about , which was several knots faster {{than the speed of}} contemporary battleships. Additional speed was not necessary for maintaining station with the battle fleet, but enabled the carrier {{to catch up with the}} battle fleet after temporarily leaving formation to turn into the wind for launch or recovery of aircraft. The speed of the carrier during launch effectively decreased the takeoff distance for embarked aircraft, so faster carriers could operate heavier aircraft with greater range and superior combat capability. As such naval aircraft became operational, <b>no</b> <b>nation</b> could risk fielding less capable aircraft; so the speed of later purpose-designed aircraft carriers was set by the speed of the converted battle cruisers. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the displacement of purpose-designed aircraft carriers to 23,000 tons.|$|E
