5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, <b>Nigeria</b> {{accumulated}} a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the 1980s oil glut <b>Nigeria</b> struggled {{to keep up with}} its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the <b>Nigeria</b> authorities, in October 2005 <b>Nigeria</b> and its Paris Club creditors reached an agreement under which <b>Nigeria</b> repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. <b>Nigeria</b> used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. <b>Nigeria</b> made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30billion) owed to the Paris Club.|$|E

5|$|In May 2003, when <b>Nigeria</b> Airways had a Boeing 737-200 as its sole {{serviceable}} aircraft, {{the government}} {{decided not to}} pump more money into the overstaffed carrier but to liquidate it. The decision {{was based on the}} declining performance of the airline's last 15 years of operations and on the carrier's debts. The number of carried passengers had fallen from 2,1million in 1985 to just 10,000 {{in the first quarter of}} 2003, and it controlled just 6% and 1% of the domestic and the international markets, respectively.
