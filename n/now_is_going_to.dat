2500|$|Death is {{inevitable}} and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact {{in order to live}} passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, [...] "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend." [...] This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. [...] We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> decide which life was easier, whether it was the [...] life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death? ...|$|E

5000|$|On November 15, 1971 the New York Times {{reported}} that Blatchford {{had made the}} decision to rigoursly enforce a 1965 rule that staff and volunteer service in the Peace Corps be limited to five years. [...] About 10 per cent of the total Peace Corps administrative staff including 27 of the 55 country directors were affected by the decision. [...] A total of 93 of the Peace Corps' senior staff will be dismissed {{as a result of the}} rule. In a memorandum announcing his decision, Blatchford called on staff members with over five years service to [...] "relinquish their position so that others may serve." [...] "Only in the rarest instances involving senior policymakers who cannot be readily replaced, will there be any deviation from a strict adherence to the spirit of the five-year rule." [...] The move came under criticism from Sargent Shriver, the founding Director of the Peace Corps and originator of the [...] "Five Year Rule." [...] "The rule should have been enforced across the board from the start," [...] said Shriver. [...] "To do it abruptly <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> create major problems overseas. It's one hell of a job to find 27 competent overseas directors in the course of six months, and these people are the core of the program.|$|E

We live for these kinds of things. I was so excited about the scene, when it came to do it I didn't want to ruin it." [...] The storyline unfolded with Harry photographing his genitalia for his girlfriend Lily only for it to be synced with the family tablet and for Chris to find it. The cliffhanger of the episode then revolved around Chris confronting Harry with the line [...] "Please tell me that is not your penis!" [...] Due to the hilarity of the dialogue, the filming of the scene took 3 takes. Fleming explained the decision to include the 'dick pic', [...] "It is a comedy story, but like all good comedy there's a truth at the core of it, and it is social commentary, that story. Many teens are doing stuff like this, and many parents are worried about it." [...] The cliffhanger went viral and Fleming expressed apologies to Galvin for the dialogue, [...] "I think Michael <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have that line shouted at him across the street. ...

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 20 laps to go. Johnson was {{no match}} for Kenseth on old tires who passed him with ease for the lead. However, Joey Logano was hot on his tail in the closing laps. Kenseth blocked Logano's advance going into turn 3 with six laps to go. Coming to five to go, Kenseth ran into lap traffic and it allowed Logano to close in and Kenseth went up the track to block him again. Rounding turn 1, Logano turned him and send him spinning. This brought out the seventh caution of the race with five to go. After the race, Logano said that the incident was [...] "good hard racing. He raced me hard, so I raced him hard back. The fact that we’re the only team that can relax <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pay big dividends going into Martinsville. To make {{a lot of these guys}} nervous going into Talladega is part of the strategy." [...] Kenseth spoke on the incident saying that it's difficult [...] "to drive a car with the rear tires off the ground. I was moving around the best I could, Joey (Logano) was a lot tighter, a lot faster on the short run, but we were so much better on the long run. I could still kind of get up to the top and get a run and get around him. We caught those two lapped cars, ‘Crazy’ (spotter) told me I was clear and I was, I pulled up in front of him and he just lifted my tires off the ground and he wrecked us." ...|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins] 29 November 1944 Somewheres in Germany My beloved, I {{received}} 3 letters today, {{one from}} mother, one from my mother, and one V-mail from you, my darling, dated 6 November. Frankly, darling, I think air mail is faster. The weather was absolutely gorgeous today, {{and the air}} force took full advantage of the excellent weather much to our enjoyment. Today, I took advantage of the little comforts in the army to take a haircut and get one of those wonderful hot shower baths that I described in a past letter. Strange as it may seem when we came up there today we didn’t recognize the place. It seems that some enemy artillery got a few lucky shots on the place and bashed the front of the place in, but did not harm the showers, etc. The director of the mine where the showers are located said the biggest loss was the loss of all the records of production. But he said that that didn’t matter anyway. Darling, by the time the confusion resulting from the change of APO’s should be all cleared up. Golly, we have it easy here. Compared to the “dough-feet[. ”] Gee, {{my heart goes out to}} those guys who slosh around in the mud and go hungry many times because food can’t be brought to them. They are the fellows who deserve all the praise. On our way back from the shower house we passed a sign put up by our engineers, which read: “This place is lousy with mines[. ”] It was humorous but also deadly serious. It is no unusual sight to see many cattle blown up in fields that were mined by the Germans before they had to leave. As for me, I’m not sticking my nose out of anyplace that hasn’t been trod over before by someone else. I’ve got some more copies of “Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes” on hand which I shall send you first chance I get. Do you enjoy them? It is our principle medium of detailed news. We keep right up to the minute with radio newscasts, too. It burns my “gut” to read in the Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes where a Representative from N. Y. in England <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> investigate whether or not the need for shells is imperative. You’re darn right they are! Get this point over to people who are crying for reconversion. Tell them that it might take a little longer before they get all those bright new products for civilian use. Thus far I have been spared many of the horrors of war. As far as I’m concerned, I’m very happy and just as well do without them, it it’s O. K. with you. This evening we’re going to have another little snack—in fact Doc’s detachment is preparing french fried potatoes now. Mm! As it gets closer to Christmas, some of these guys are getting pretty homesick. You should see these Christmas songs bring water to the eyes—sometimes even to my eyes, too. After all, I remember the fun we had together last year this time. War can bring some pretty ludicrous situations into the picture. In a nearby town which was taken from the Nazis not so long ago (safe now), we saw some dough boys cleaning up (actually as well as literally) some of the stores in the town. Some of them were parading around in stove pipe hats and canes. Silly kids they were and they knew it, too. I saw one dough boy cramming civilian ties into his duffle bag. Why? I don’t think even he knew. Another amusing sight was to see GI’s painted the cars green O. D. and found them very comfortable. Naturally, when they move from a particular area they’re abandoned anyway. People do strange things under duress and tension. It seems that I haven’t approached that state yet. Precious, the 14 th of December marks the 2 ½ yr. Anniversary of wedded bliss. Had I known our marriage would turn out like this, it would have been the 5 ½ year anniversary, I assure you. Don’t think that it is absence alone that makes me feel this way. No, darling, I’m really and truly in love with my wife. Forever, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
