This regulation, manifestation of the principle of judicial opportunity, has been widely analyzed from a legal perspective, but little research has been done about its effective implementation in practice and about the costs and benefits derived from this ius puniendi's renunciation {{from the point of view}} of the purposes of punishment. With the overall aim of deepening the knowledge of this topic, the research we are doing aims to: 1) determine the prevalence of its application; 2) identify the profile of foreigners and offenses for which it is applied; and 3) identify which criteria are guiding the assessment of the court decision. Our hypothesis are that: i) there are some dysfunctions that hampered the application and also the knowledge of the exact <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorizations</b> granted and that ii) in practice, the assessment of costs and benefits that implies authorization in each case, is omitted. To achieve the first objective we are reviewing official statistics and judiciary/prosecutors instructions and conducting interviews with key stakeholders. To achieve the second and the third objectives, we are reviewing a sample of selected case files of trial courts of Madrid and Malaga, which also allows us to make comparisons between practices of both jurisdictions. The results obtained would allow us to develop good practices that could be useful for legal actors in the assessment of approval or denial the expulsion. Universidad de Málaga.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the concept, model, and policy-specific algorithms for inferring new access control decisions from previous ones. Our secondary and approximate authorization model (SAAM) defines {{the notions of}} primary vs. secondary and precise vs. approximate authorizations. Approximate authorization responses are inferred from cached primary responses, and therefore provide an alternative source of access control decisions {{in the event that}} the authorization server is unavailable or slow. The ability to compute approximate authorizations improves the reliability and performance of access control sub-systems and ultimately the application systems themselves. The operation of a system that employs SAAM depends on the type of access control policy it implements. We propose and analyze algorithms for computing secondary authorizations in the case of policies based on the Bell-LaPadula model. In this context, we define a dominance graph, and describe its construction and usage for generating secondary responses to authorization requests.

40|$|Administering and {{maintaining}} access control systems is a challenging task, especially in environments with complex and changing <b>authorization</b> requirements. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> logics {{have been proposed}} that aim at simplifying access control by factoring the <b>authorization</b> policy out <b>of</b> the hard-coded resource guard. However, many policies require the authorization state to be updated after a granted access request, for example to {{reflect the fact that}} a user has activated or deactivated a role. Current authorization languages cannot express such state modifications; these still have to be hard-coded into the resource guard. We present a logic for specifying policies where access requests can have effects on the authorization state. The logic is semantically defined by a mapping to Transaction Logic. Using this approach, updates to the state are factored out of the resource guard, thus enhancing maintainability and facilitating more expressive policies that take the history of access requests into account. We also present a sound and complete proof system for reasoning about sequences of access requests. This gives rise to a goal-oriented algorithm for finding minimal sequences that lead to a specified target authorization state...|$|R

The scenarios are characterized mainly by (a) the distribution of access control; (b) the indeterminacy of the access control model that is implemented; (c) the distributed storage of policies/organization guidelines/regional laws; (d) the lack of common representations of basic access-control elements such as subject (principle) IDs/resource IDs; and (e) the need to establish secure communication channels over unsecured public networks between security domains. In order to solve these problems, some novel concepts are raised, such as (a) a subject ID mapping service; (b) meta policy server (MPS); (c) reverse authorization; and (d) private reputation server.

40|$|Policy-based {{authorization}} {{systems are}} becoming more common as information systems become larger and more complex. In these systems, to authorize a requester to access a particular resource, the authorization system must verify that the policy authorizes the access. The overall authorization policy may consist <b>of</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> policy groups, where each group consists of policies defined by different entities. Each policy contains a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorization</b> rules. The access request is evaluated against these policies, which may produce conflicting authorization decisions. To resolve these conflicts and to reach a unique decision for the access request at the rule and policy level, rule and policy combination algorithms are used. In the current systems, these rule and policy combination algorithms are defined on a static basis during policy composition, which is not desirable in dynamic systems with fast changing environments. In this paper, we motivate the need for changing the rule and policy combination algorithms dynamically based on contextual information. We propose a framework that supports this functionality and also eliminates the need to recompose policies if the owner decides to change the combination algorithm. It provides a novel method to dynamically add and remove specialized policies, while retaining the clarity and modularity in the policies. The proposed framework also provides a mechanism to reduce the set of potential target matches, thereby increasing {{the efficiency of the}} evaluation mechanism.

The major problem of the UCON based authorization is the finer-grain the authorization, the higher overhead will be impacted to the system. This is because fine-grained authorization required very complex policies to define rules accurately. To evaluate complex policies is very time consuming as the system needs to check rules by rules in each policy for each resource in order to produce the access result, resulting in lower authorization performance. This limitation is crucial for large collaborative environment like grid where user and resource keep increasing year by year.
