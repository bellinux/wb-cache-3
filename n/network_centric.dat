The Indian Navy conducted large scale manoeuvres in all three dimensions (land, sea, air), across the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. Around 60 ships, including the aircraft carrier INS Viraat and submarines of the navy, and 75 aircraft, and assets from the Indian Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard participated in the TROPEX 2014, which concluded on 28 February 2014. This year's TROPEX was aimed at testing combat readiness of the naval units. It also focused on validating the Indian Navy's war fighting doctrine and integration of newly included capabilities in its 'Concept of Operations'.

40|$|Abstract – The {{telecommunications}} and Information Technol-ogy (IT) industry are converging {{into a single}} highly competitive market, where service diversity is the critical success factor. To provide diverse services, the telecommunications operator must evolve the traditional voice service <b>centric</b> <b>network</b> into a generic Service <b>Centric</b> <b>Network.</b> This transformation is aided by an ar-chitecture. An appropriate, but incomplete, architecture is the Service Delivery Platform (SDP). The SDP aims at abstracting network, service and management complexities. Our research focuses on overcoming the complexities of attaining a SDP, by building a framework based various levels of abstraction. This paper provides a motivation and requirements for such a frame-work. In the paper, we first discuss convergence and its implica-tions. We also uncover generic framework requirements based on these implications. Second, we define service <b>centric</b> <b>networks</b> and architectures. Third, we elaborate on the SDP and define additional framework requirements that overcome SDP specific complexities. Fourth, we discuss our research focus. Last, we conclude and discuss future work on the SDP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Graph comparisons, {{quantitative}} characterizations, computation of topological indices, clustering and partitioning {{are some}} of the major computations of graph that have yielded valuable results in various disciplines. Motivated by the potential benefits of graph theory application on biological data, we discuss the reconstruction and analysis of enzyme <b>centric</b> <b>network</b> of Arabidopsis thaliana using graph theory concepts. We had earlier constructed the metabolite network of Arabidopsis thaliana and witnessed the scale free and small world nature of the network. Compared to metabolites, the enzymes are more conserved in and across many pathways. So the aim of constructing the enzyme <b>centric</b> <b>network</b> is to see if the network follows similar network properties of the metabolite network and to look for additional details that a metabolite network cannot reveal. The enzyme flat file from KEGG FTP is used as the data set for the reconstruction of the enzyme <b>centric</b> <b>network.</b> We examined the network to find the relationship between topological connections among enzymes and their functions during evolution. The enzyme sequences of high degree and high betweenness enzymes belonged to ancient fold class and ancestry value showing evidence that they evolved very slowly...|$|R
40|$|The host-to-host IP model {{currently}} {{supporting the}} Internet does not suffice in supporting current-day content {{distribution in the}} form of content-sharing via peer-to-peer applications, real-time media streaming and social networks. Since the design of IP, the usage of the Internet has changed from a messaging and few-to-few information sharing system to a fewto-many content distribution system where many users request large amounts of overlapping information. Running a content distribution network over a host-to-host network appears to be very inefficient since every piece of content needs to travel the complete distribution-chain from generator to consumer every time it is requested. The result is that identical pieces of information will often redundantly travel the same links and routers. Information Centric Networking tries to solve this problem by proposing route-by-name instead of route-by-address mechanisms. This enables networks to be optimized for contentdistribution instead of connections and allows routers to cache often requested pieces of content in memory. In this thesis we will attempt to solve problems that arise at the introduction of a new globally routeable network, enabling clients and networks to be a full member (both consumer and generator) on a global Information <b>Centric</b> <b>Network.</b> The topics discussed vary from dynamic end-user configuration and generating globally unique names in order to share information on the Information <b>Centric</b> <b>Network,</b> via mapping techniques to decrease routing complexity, to proposing a transition mechanism that dynamically creates IP encapsulating tunnels between disconnected Information <b>Centric</b> <b>Networks.</b> In short, we discuss a multitude of problems which need to be addressed in order to assist the global implementation of an Information <b>Centric</b> <b>Network.</b> Network Architectures and Services (NAS) TelecommunicationsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
