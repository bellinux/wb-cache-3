50|$|The 19th century {{began with}} a fierce fire, the Riddarholm fire, which ravaged Riddarholmen on November 15, 1802. The fire started {{early in the morning}} in the Administrative Court's old house (Cruuska palace) and was caused by a guard master's <b>negligent</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> fuel. The fire quickly spread to the {{southern}} side of the house and lit the roof of the old King's House (Wrangel Palace), destroying many antiques, including the nearly 300-year-old woodcut Blood Carlsbad painting that was stored in the Administrative Services Archives of Wrangel palace.|$|R
5000|$|The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 2011 first {{introduced}} legislation specifically addressing the liability of citizen good Samaritans or volunteers in the Republic of Ireland, without introducing {{a duty to}} intervene. This act provides for exemption from liability for a person, or voluntary organisation, for anything done while providing [...] "assistance, advice or care" [...] {{to a person who}} is injured, in serious risk or danger of becoming injured or suffering from an illness (or apparently so). There are exclusions for cases of [...] "bad faith" [...] or [...] "gross negligence" [...] on behalf of the carer, and incidents relating to <b>negligent</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> motor vehicles. This Act only addresses situations where there is no duty of care owed by the good Samaritan or the volunteer.|$|R

40|$|Forest {{fires in}} Italy are {{mainly caused by}} humans, and {{directly}} depend on social behavior, whether voluntary (arson) or involuntary (negligence). Despite the progress in knowledge made with studying the physical facets of the phenomenon, causes and motives of human-related fire remain mostly unknown. This paper proposes {{the implementation of the}} Delphi method (an interactive expert-questionnaire process) in order to assess why fires are ignited. In four study cases, within a high fire incidence area (southern Italy), the Delphi technique identified as major cause <b>of</b> negligence the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> fire in agriculture and, as major causes of voluntary fires, motives related to seasonal labor. The main results in terms of frequency are: (i) for involuntary events (negligence), experts unanimously identified the relevant importance <b>of</b> <b>negligent</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> agricultural fires, particularly stubble burning (13. 99 % of responses). For (ii) voluntary fires (arson), results highlight the relative importance of fires ignited by seasonal workers as an instrument to force or maintain employment (8. 41 % of responses) ...|$|R

40|$|Forty-eight {{individuals}} {{were asked to}} participate in dyadic role plays that were recorded on videotape and transcribed. The tapes were scored on effectiveness of conflict management, and the transcriptions were scored on integrative and distributive conflict behavior, perceived friendliness, and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> communality (''we,'' ''us''). In line with the hypotheses, correlation and regression analyses demonstrated positive relations with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> communality and integrative conflict behavior and with effectiveness of conflict management. On the basis of only 7 % <b>of</b> all <b>words</b> <b>used</b> in the conversations, variance in conflict behaviors and friendliness could be assessed for about 50 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{three-way}} interaction of gender, media presentation, and concern with the correct <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> in affecting student performance in accounting. Prior research is presented to support an expectation that verbal cues and descriptions are more important to female students than to male students in the effective <b>use</b> <b>of</b> imagery for recall of accounting information. Measurement of quiz performance in an accounting classroom setting in the USA is used to provide evidence regarding how language characteristics (accent and correct <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>words)</b> and classroom presentation method (media) affect student performance (recall) differently by gender. The findings indicate that at the beginning of the semester, concern with the correct <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> and presentation method may have contributed to poor performance for the quizzes of female students compared to male students. However, as the semester progressed, female performance was not significantly different from the performance of male students. This suggests that female students may have adapted to non-preferred instructor verbal characteristics and presentation method.

The fact about awareness of the usage of Indonesian language in literatures {{is expected to be}} supporting data in the development of Indonesian language history. The source of the data is Indonesian literatures including novels. The data are collected by reading technique, marking out, and taking notes. The data are analyzed using comparison technique, a technique that use words or terms in certain time and compared to those from another time. The result of this analysis shows that in 1980 ’s, many Indonesia literatures used vernacular words and terms. This period of time can be used as an alternatif to mark the development of Indonesian language, especially the development of the vocabulary. Besides, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> and terms in the speech of Indonesian novel characters are an implication that Indonesian society, particularly the writers are worried that traditional culture will be shifted by national culture.
