Robert Gordon Sproul, who became university president the day after Lawrence became a professor, {{was a member of the}} Bohemian Club, and he sponsored Lawrence's membership in 1932. Through this club, Lawrence met William Henry Crocker, Edwin Pauley, and John Francis Neylan. They were influential men who helped him obtain money for his energetic <b>nuclear</b> <b>particle</b> investigations. There was great hope for medical uses to come from the development of particle physics, and this led to much of the early funding for advances Lawrence was able to obtain.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical <b>nuclear</b> <b>particle</b> with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E

In this study, the nuclear volume, the ultrastructure of chromatin and the number and distribution of <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> in the cell nuclei of supraoptic neurons of 3 -month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were analyzed after osmotically induced activation of transcription by periods of acute (1 day) and chronic (6 days) dehydration, and after halting the stimulation by rehydration of animals. The nuclear volume and the ultrastructure of chromatin were assessed on ultrathin sections. The number and distribution of <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> were assessed on freeze-fracture replicas. The initial phase of osmotically induced enhancement of transcription was accompanied {{by an increase in}} nuclear volume and by a partial replacement of <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> of large diameter (> 11 nm) by smaller <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles.</b> This latter change affected predominantly the nuclear periphery (0 - 1000 nm from the nuclear membrane) and occurred simultaneously with a partial decondensation of chromatin clusters that may be related to chromatin unfolding. In chronically stimulated animals, the decondensation of chromatin and the replacement of large <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> by smaller ones was enhanced in the nuclear periphery and was partially propagated to the interior of the nucleus. After suppression of cellular activation by rehydration of animals, the number of <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> returned to control levels in the nuclear periphery while {{in the center of the}} nucleus the number of small particles decreased and the number of large particles increased as compared to control values. These results, together with the observation that in unstimulated cells the nuclear periphery and the nuclear interior differ in their composition of <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles,</b> evidence a structural and functional compartmentalization in the cell nucleus of supraoptic neurons.

40|$|Past {{work in this}} {{laboratory}} {{has shown}} that <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> generated during electrolysis can be registered by CR 39 plastic detectors held within the electrolyte solution, suspended in the vapor above the solution, or placed just below the metal cathode {{that serves as the}} bottom of the electrolyte compartment of the electrolysis cell. However, not every electrolysis experiment produced <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> so that total reproducibility was not achieved. Therefore another experimental technique has been developed which has shown the generation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> in each of twenty five consecutive electrolysis experiments using heavy or light water solutions of lithium salts. The damage trails caused by the <b>nuclear</b> <b>particles</b> are made visible by etching in hot concentrated caustic solution, and the electrolysis experiments are accompanied by suitable blank, or control, experiments. The damage trails begin either at the surface of the CR 39 chip that faces toward the electrolyte, at the opposite surface, or totally within the 0. 83 mm thickness of the plastic detectors. It is demonstrated that the nuclear damage trails could not have been caused by ordinary radionuclides contaminating anything involved in the experimental procedure. The described phenomena pose a formidable challenge to nuclear theory. 1...|$|R

500|$|The {{theoretical}} physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg considered {{whether the}} neutron {{could be a}} fundamental <b>nuclear</b> <b>particle</b> like the proton and electron, rather than a proton–electron pair. [...] Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new <b>nuclear</b> <b>particle,</b> but its exact nature remained unclear. [...] In his 1933 Bakerian Lecture, Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about [...] Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of , this implied the neutron as a proton–electron composite had a binding energy of about , which sounded reasonable, although {{it was hard to}} understand how a particle with so little binding energy could be stable. [...] Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933–4. [...] By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but Ernest Lawrence's team at the University of California produced a small one. [...] Then Maurice Goldhaber, a refugee from Nazi Germany and {{a graduate student at the}} Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that deuterons could be photodisintegrated by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of 208Tl (then known as thorium C"): ...|$|E
2500|$|James Chadwick {{discovered}} {{a much more}} massive <b>nuclear</b> <b>particle</b> in 1932 and also named it a neutron, leaving two kinds of particles with the same name. Pauli earlier (in 1930) had used the term [...] "neutron" [...] for both the neutral particle that conserved energy in beta decay, and a presumed neutral particle in the nucleus, and initially did not consider these two neutral particles as distinct from each other. The word [...] "neutrino" [...] entered the scientific vocabulary through Enrico Fermi, who used it during a conference in Paris in July 1932 and at the Solvay Conference in October 1933, where Pauli also employed it. The name (the Italian equivalent of [...] "little neutral one") was jokingly coined by Edoardo Amaldi during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light neutral particle from Chadwick's neutron.|$|E
