40|$|Printing a wax grid on a {{conventional}} membrane filter yields a device {{functioning as a}} most probable <b>number</b> <b>apparatus</b> (MPN), used at a single dilution but with {{a very large number}} of growth compartments (e. g., 3, 650). By restraining the lateral spread and confluence of colonies, the hydrophobic grid-membrane filter (HGMF) allows growth- or colony-forming units (GU) to be resolved at levels far above those which produce an uncountable lawn on {{a conventional}} membrane filter. It also eliminates the size variation of normal bacterial colonies. As a result, the HGMF can give more accurate estimates of the concentration of GU. The method by which grid-cell count observations can be used to obtain MPN estimates of the number of GUs is described, and estimates obtained using the MPN method on the HGMF are compared with those resulting from conventional colony count procedures on membrane filters. A linear relation was observed between MPNGU and the number of GUs, at levels up to 30, 000 GUs, for pure cultures of bacteria and for samples of natural waters. The HGMF has great potential for reducing the labor required in quantitative microbiology, since it allows, with one filter, enumeration of microorganisms over a very large concentration range and therefore reduces the need to make dilutions...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{processes}} with microstructured reactors allow paradigm {{changes in}} process development {{and thus can}} enable a faster development time to the final production plant. They do this by exploiting similarity effects along the development chain (modularity) and intensification. The final result can be a (significantly) reduced <b>number</b> of <b>apparatus</b> in the plant, a (significantly) reduced apparatus size, and a higher predictability in the scale-out of the apparatus. So far, this was mainly achieved via transport intensification given in microstructured reactors – improved mixing and heat transfer which increase productivity and possibly improve selectivity. A more new idea is chemical intensification through deliberate use of harsh chemistries at unusual (high) pressure, temperature, concentration, and reaction environment which again increases productivity. A very new idea is the process design intensification – the reaction-maximized flow processes need less separation expenditure and the small unit size together with the high degree in functionality gives large potential for system integration. Both means change and simplify the process scheme totally {{which can lead to}} a reduced <b>number</b> of <b>apparatus</b> and has impact on predictability. The modular nature of the small flow units allow an easy implementation to modern modular plant environments (Future Factories) which enables to perform all the testing cycles (lab, pilot, production) in one plant environment; an example are here container plants.

Rather a combination of forced convection, free convection and transient effects were responsible for the observed heat transfer.

MethodData on availability of resources, its use and the reference population for each hospital were obtained from the Specialized Care Information System (SIAE) for the years 1996 - 1997. The units of analysis were the hospitals and the provinces in the INSALUD territory. The independent variables were the ratio of technologies and professional per inhabitant. Also the waiting list and the economical level of the province were used. Data analysis included the extremal quotient and multiple linear regression. ResultsThe ratio of the highest to lowest rate of CT and NMR use is 15 and 27 among hospitals and 3 and 4 among provinces, respectively. The number of neurosurgeons, <b>number</b> of CT <b>apparatus,</b> waiting list for CT and rate of NMR use, all standardized per population, explains 61 % of CT variability among hospitals. Among provinces, the <b>number</b> of CT <b>apparatus</b> explains 31 % of all variability. For NMR use among hospitals, the number of neurosurgeons, number of orthopedic surgeons and CT use, all variables standardized per population, explains 42 % of variability. The amount of equipment is not associated with NMR rate among provinces. ConclusionsThe variation found in the INSALUD territory for the two procedures is high and ecologically associated to the availability of resources.

In the British Isles {{there is a large}} <b>number</b> of HFM <b>apparatus</b> of different sizes and forms, mainly in the quality assurance and research laboratories of thermal insulation manufacturers. With the advent of European legislation requiring manufacturers to declare thermal performance values of their products, the National Physical Laboratory organised an intercomparison to assess the comparability and accuracy of industrial HFM measurements in the UK and Eire with the aim of helping to establish consistent measurements. Seventeen HFM apparatus featured in the intercomparison, with NPL using a guarded hot-plate apparatus to provide baseline thermal conductivity values. Measurements were made at 10 8 C and 23 8 C, on two thicknesses of samples of expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, and high density rock fibre. With few exceptions, the measurements agreed to within 5 %. In a total of 154 data points 69 % were within 3 %, and 50 % were within 2 %.

40|$|Background: Blood {{pressure}} (BP) recording is {{the most}} commonly measured clinical parameter. Standing mercury sphygmomanometer {{is the most}} widely used equipment to record this. However, recording by sphygmomanometer is subject to observer and instrumental error. The different sources of equipment error are faulty manometer tube calibration, baseline deviations and improper arm bladder cuff dimensions. This is further compounded by a high prevalence of arm bladder miss-cuffing in the target population. Objectives: The study was designed to assess the presence of equipment malcalibrations, cuff miss-matching and their effect on BP recording. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional check of all operational sphygmomanometers in a health university was carried out for the length of the manometer tube, deviation of resting mercury column from " 0 " level, the width and length of arm bladder cuff and extent of bladder cuff-mismatch with respect to outpatient attending population. Results: From the total of 50 apparatus selected, 39 (78 %) were from hospital setups and 11 (22 %) from pre-clinical departments. A manometer height deficit of 13 mm was recorded in 36 (92. 23 %) of the equipment in hospital and 11 (100 %) from pre-clinical departments. Instruments from both settings showed significant deviation from recommended dimensions in cuff bladder length, width and length to width ratio (P < 0. 001). Significant <b>number</b> of <b>apparatus</b> from hospital setups showed presence of mercury manometer baseline deviation either below or above 0 mmHg at the resting state (χ 2 = 5. 61, D.

Bladder cuff mismatching in response to the target population was found at 48. 52 % for males and 36. 76 % for females. The cumulative effect of these factors can lead to an error in the range of 10 - 12 mmHg.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for chemical and food production technologies will {{change in the}} future as a result of shorter time to market and increasing market volatility. Especially the rising use of renewable resources will require the implementation of flexible and fast to install small-scale production technologies. The increasing <b>number</b> of necessary <b>apparatuses</b> and their distributed operation, however, will constitute major challenges, both economically and procedurally. The proposed solution to face the economic challenge is modularization and standardization. For food production, dewatering represents a key issue. Thus, biomass processing should first be divided into small-scale water separation steps and then into further large-scale processing steps. As dewatering usually happens thermally and heat exchangers often benefit from the economies of scale, heat supply and energy consumption or heat transfer with little capital investment are further issues. Therefore, temperature levels should be decreased and the use of solar heat increased. For the production of biofuels and chemicals from biomass, process integration and process simplification are proposed to improve the efficacy of production equipment and processes. Choosing raw materials with molecular structures, similar to the desired chemical building block, will lower the need for heat exchange and make small-scale manufacturing of fuels and chemicals possibl...|$|R
