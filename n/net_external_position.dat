The short-run impact of various types of fiscal measures are considered {{as well as the}} dynamics of adjustment to long-run steady states. The analysis and related simulations suggest that the effect of fiscal policy changes on the real exchange rate can vary widely and will depend closely on a number of structural features, including the degree of asset substitutability,the composition of government spending, and the initial size of the public debt and <b>net</b> <b>external</b> <b>position.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The exorbitant {{privilege}} literature {{analyzes the}} positive differential returns on {{net foreign assets}} enjoyed by the United States {{in the last quarter}} of the twentieth century as the issuer of the global reserve currency. In the first age of international financial integration (1870 - 1914), the global reserve currency of the period was the British pound sterling. Whether the United Kingdom enjoyed a similar privilege is analyzed with a new dataset, encompassing microdata on railroad and government financial securities. The use of microdata avoids the flaws that have plagued the US studies, particularly the use of incompatible aggregate variables. New measures of Britain’s <b>net</b> <b>external</b> <b>position</b> provide estimates on capital gains and dividend yields. As the issuer of the global reserve currency, Britain received average revenues of 13. 4 % of GDP from its international investment position. The country satisfied the necessary condition for the existence of an exorbitant privilege. Nonetheless, Britain’s case is slightly different from the American one. British external assets received higher returns than were paid on external liabilities for each class, but British invested mostly in securities with low profile of risk. The low return on its <b>net</b> <b>external</b> <b>position</b> meant that, for most of the time, Britain would not receive positive revenues from the rest of the world if it were a net debtor country, but this pattern changed after 1900. The finding supports the claim that, at least partially, exorbitant privilege is a general characteristic of the issuer of the global reserve currency and not unique to the late twentieth century US...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{developments of the}} Italian banking system during the Nineties from two related points of view: <b>net</b> <b>external</b> <b>position</b> and degree of internationalisation, i. e. branches and subsidiaries abroad. These themes seem particularly interesting {{in the light of}} the widespread belief that the euro area will significantly increase banking competition and cross-border operations in coming years. We find two major forces driving banks' external net position: the growth in loans to domestic borrowers and the convergence in interest rate levels across European countries. The development of foreign branches and subsidiaries has been influenced by two counterbalancing forces; the big banking groups reduced their presence abroad while some medium-sized banks opened their first branches; the focus of foreign branches and subsidiaries has been on specific segments of banking activities, very often exploiting "localization" advantages. Despite the improvement in the Nineties, Italian banks have tended to show a relatively low degree of internationalisation compared with the main European banking system.                  JEL Codes: G 21, F 23 Keywords: Bank, Banking</p...|$|E

40|$|According to the “Saving Glut hypothesis”, global {{imbalances}} {{are caused}} by inefficiently high level of precautionary savings in financially underdeveloped regions, where agents have limited opportunity to diversify idiosyncratic risk. This paper generalizes the approach by modeling idiosyncratic risk in entrepreneurial activities, which can be only partially hedged. As a result, agents save too much and invest too little, relative to the efficient allocation, depressing production activities and the real interest rate. Capital account liberalization towards financially more advanced economies then produces an outflow of capital in search of safer investment, with the effect of further reducing domestic investment in countries with poor financial institutions. The model predicts welfare losses for less financially developed economies, {{and an increase in}} wealth inequality for advanced economies.

40|$|THESIS 8851 This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three essays. The first one examines cases {{in which there is}} a large shift in a country 2 ̆ 7 s net foreign asset position due to the re-valuation of its foreign assets and/or foreign liabilities. It highlights the differences in large valuation shocks between countries characterized by large gross stocks of foreign assets and foreign liabilities and countries exhibiting large <b>net</b> <b>external</b> <b>positions.</b> Finally, it analyzes the macroeconomic dynamics in the neighborhood of large valuation episodes. We find that developing countries and emerging markets had negative valuation episodes as a result of their large and negative net foreign as set position. By contrast, gross stocks of foreign assets and liabilities play a crucial role in large valuation episodes occurring in advanced economies. The second essay studies the dynamic effect of positive shocks in different types of government spending on the real exchange rate of the European Monetary Union (EMU) countries. To this end, we estimate a panel-vector autoregression and find that these shocks appreciate the real exchange rate. The magnitude and persistence of the exchange rate response vary across different types of government spending. A shock in government investment produces the largest and most persistent appreciation while a shock in total consumption produces the largest impact and the least persistent exchange rate response. Within government consumption, government wages play the most important role. Furthermore, we also compare these results to those generated by the set of countries used in the studies of Perotti finding contrasting evidence: shocks in government expenditure and government consumption depreciate the real exchange rate...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study, from an {{empirical}} point of view, {{the determinants of}} the real exchange rate (RER). Relative to the vast previous literature on this topic we aim to distinguish the impact of two important components of government expenditure—public investment and transfers—on the RER, which has usually been neglected. Using panel cointegration techniques, we assess the relevance of those variables in {{the determination of the}} RER for a wide set of countries from 1980 to 2009. Our results suggest that changes in either government transfers or public investment {{have an impact on the}} RER in emerging economies. On one hand, transfers tend to appreciate the RER because they induce an increase in the relative demand for nontraded goods. On the other, an increase in public investment generates an RER depreciation. This result can be explained by the fact that, in this case, there is an increase in the relative productivity in the nontraded sector of the economy. We also study the effect of countries’ <b>net</b> <b>external</b> assets <b>position</b> on the RER and find that it differs markedly between developed and developing countries: this variable has a significant effect only in the case of developing economies. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the relation between}} the balance of payments and the international investment position of countries. It starts with the observation that the net international investment position of many countries is developing independently from their current account balances. This phenomenon can be explained by valuechanges of cross border assets and liabilities that are not registered on the balance of payments. These value changes have impact on the <b>net</b> <b>external</b> investment <b>position</b> of a country as soon as the returns on its external assets and liabilities start to diverge. Such divergent developments can be attributed to currency developments,differences of composition of external assets and liabilities and performance effects. These mechanisms are discussed, followed by two case studies, viz. the case of the ‘black hole’ (the Netherlands) and the case of ‘dark matter’(the US). Understanding {{the relation between the}} international investment position of a country and its balance of payments becomes more and more relevant as countries prepare for ageing of the population.
