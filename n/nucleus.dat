5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the <b>nucleus,</b> controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary <b>nucleus.</b> The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary <b>nucleus.</b> Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary <b>nucleus</b> would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E

These include the <b>nucleus</b> accumbens, <b>nucleus</b> basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal <b>nucleus.</b> These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the <b>nucleus</b> basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear import {{depends on}} the importin binding its cargo in the {{cytoplasm}} and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the <b>nucleus.</b> Inside the <b>nucleus,</b> RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the <b>nucleus</b> and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the <b>nucleus</b> in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.|$|E
50|$|These <b>nuclei</b> are {{considered}} to be association <b>nuclei,</b> one of the three broader subdivisions of thalamic <b>nuclei.</b> These <b>nuclei</b> receive input from the cerebral cortex.

5|$|The {{number of}} protons and {{neutrons}} in the atomic <b>nucleus</b> can be modified, although this can require very high energies {{because of the}} strong force. Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier <b>nucleus,</b> such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei. For example, {{at the core of}} the Sun protons require energies of 3–10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion—the coulomb barrier—and fuse together into a single <b>nucleus.</b> Nuclear fission is the opposite process, causing a <b>nucleus</b> to split into two smaller nuclei—usually through radioactive decay. The <b>nucleus</b> can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons. If this modifies the number of protons in a <b>nucleus,</b> the atom changes to a different chemical element.|$|E

The hypoglossal <b>nucleus</b> receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic <b>nucleus.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the <b>nucleus,</b> but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the <b>nucleus</b> than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the <b>nucleus</b> in the middle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} method for segmenting cell <b>nuclei</b> {{in the skin}} histopathological images. The proposed technique consists of four modules. First it separates the <b>nuclei</b> regions from the background with an adaptive threshold technique. Next an elliptical descriptor is used to detect the isolated <b>nuclei</b> with elliptical shapes. This descriptor classifies the <b>nuclei</b> regions based on two ellipticity parameters. <b>Nuclei</b> clumps and <b>nuclei</b> with irregular shapes are then localized by an improved seed detection technique based on voting in the eroded <b>nuclei</b> regions. Finally, undivided <b>nuclei</b> regions are segmented by a marked watershed algorithm. Experimental results on 114 different image patches indicate that the proposed technique provides a superior performance in <b>nuclei</b> detection and segmentation...|$|R
40|$|Cleavage in Cecidomyidae (Diptera) is {{characterized}} by the elimination of chromosomes from presumptive somatic <b>nuclei.</b> The full chromosome complement is kept by the germ-line <b>nuclei.</b> The course of cleavage in Mayetiola destructor (Say) is described. After the fourth division two <b>nuclei</b> lie in the posterior polar-plasm and become associated with polar granules, and fourteen <b>nuclei</b> lie {{in the rest of the}} cytoplasm. All the <b>nuclei</b> possess about forty chromosomes. During the fifth division the posterior <b>nuclei</b> do not divide and the polar-plasm becomes constricted to form primordial germ cells (pole cells). The remaining fourteen <b>nuclei</b> divide and lose about thirty-two chromosomes so that twenty-eight <b>nuclei</b> are formed containing only eight chromosomes. These are the presumptive somatic <b>nuclei.</b> During subsequent divisions the pole cell <b>nuclei</b> retain the full chromosome number; these divisions occur less frequently than those of the somatic <b>nuclei.</b> Experiments were performed on early embryonic stages to elucidate the properties of the posterior end during the time that chromosome elimination was taking place from the pre-sumptive somatic <b>nuclei.</b> Ultraviolet irradiation, constriction, and centrifugation technique...|$|R

5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect {{is that as}} atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the <b>nucleus</b> {{as a result of}} the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a <b>nucleus.</b> Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the <b>nucleus</b> of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a <b>nucleus</b> is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the <b>nucleus.</b> According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino, while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the <b>nucleus</b> by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the <b>nucleus,</b> rather than a positron emitted from the <b>nucleus.</b> A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr {{to create a new}} theory of the compound <b>nucleus</b> in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the <b>nucleus.</b> In this model, the <b>nucleus</b> could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E

[...] In the guinea pig, ascending projections to the inferior colliculi are primarily ipsilateral (>80%), with the largest single source coming from the SPON.

5|$|Cell nuclei contain {{most of the}} cell's genetic material, {{organized}} as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured {{in such a way}} to promote cell function. The <b>nucleus</b> maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression—the <b>nucleus</b> is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the <b>nucleus</b> are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina), a network within the <b>nucleus</b> that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.|$|E
5|$|During its lifetime, a <b>nucleus</b> may {{be broken}} down or destroyed, either {{in the process of}} cell {{division}} or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death).

5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs.

As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the <b>nucleus,</b> it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the <b>nucleus.</b> Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
