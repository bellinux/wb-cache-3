25|$|Typically, {{computer}} programs {{are stored in}} <b>non-volatile</b> <b>memory</b> until requested {{either directly or indirectly}} to be executed by the computer user. Upon such a request, the program is loaded into random-access memory, by a computer program called an operating system, where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. The central processor then executes ("runs") the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. A program in execution is called a process. Termination is either by normal self-termination or by error– software or hardware error.|$|E
40|$|The move to many-core {{systems and}} the {{emergence}} of new <b>non-volatile</b> <b>memories</b> will require that we rethink and redesign systems for high-performance I/O. Individual core speeds are not increasing in sequential execution speed as quickly as <b>non-volatile</b> <b>memories</b> such as flash, PCM, and memristor technologies are improving speed. The formerly increasing CPU-I/O gap will therefore shrink considerably: what used to be I/O-bound will become CPU-bound with our existing I/O interfaces.

40|$|Abstract. There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in using 3 -D DRAM structures and <b>non-volatile</b> <b>memories</b> such as Phase Change Memories (PCM) to both improve access latencies and reduce energy consumption in multicore systems. These new memory technologies present both opportunities and challenges to computer systems design. In this paper we address how such memories should be organized to fully bene t from these technologies. We propose to keep 3 -D DRAMs as main memory systems, but use <b>non-volatile</b> <b>memories</b> as backing store. In this connection, we view DRAM based main-memory both as a cache memory and as main memory. The cache like addressing allows for fast address translation and better memory allocation among multiple processes. We explore a set of wide-ranging design parameters for page sizes, sub-page sizes, TLB sizes, and sizes of write-bu ers...|$|R
25|$|According to the {{original}} 1971 definition, the memristor was the fourth fundamental circuit element, forming a non-linear relationship between electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. In 2011 Chua argued for a broader definition that included all 2-terminal <b>non-volatile</b> <b>memory</b> devices based on resistance switching. Williams argued that MRAM, phase change memory and RRAM were memristor technologies. Some researchers argued that biological structures such as blood and skin fit the definition. Others argued that the memory device under development by HP Labs {{and other forms of}} RRAM were not memristors but rather part of a broader class of variable resistance systems and that a broader definition of memristor is a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favored HP's memristor patents.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a team at HP Labs {{claimed to}} have found Chua's missing memristor based on an {{analysis}} of a thin film of titanium dioxide thus connecting the operation of RRAM devices to the memristor concept. The HP result {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature. Following this claim, Leon Chua has argued that the memristor definition could be generalized to cover all forms of two-terminal <b>non-volatile</b> <b>memory</b> devices based on resistance switching effects. There are, however, some serious doubts as to whether the memristor can actually exist in physical reality. Additionally, some experimental evidence contradicts Chua's generalization since a non-passive nanobattery effect is observable in resistance switching memory. Chua also argued that the memristor is the oldest known circuit element, with its effects predating the resistor, capacitor and inductor.|$|E

[...] The staff of IGN wrote that [...] "unlike most controllers, Sega's pad forces the user's hands into an uncomfortable parallel position." [...] In contrast to the Sega CD and Sega Saturn, which included internal backup memory, the Dreamcast uses a 128 kbyte memory card called the VMU (or [...] "Visual Memory Unit") for data storage. The VMU features a small LCD screen, audio output from a one-channel PWM sound source, <b>non-volatile</b> <b>memory,</b> a directional pad, and four buttons. The VMU can present game information, {{be used as a}} minimal handheld gaming device, and connect to certain Sega arcade machines. [...] For example, players use the VMU to call plays in NFL 2K or raise virtual pets in Sonic Adventure. Sega officials noted that the VMU could be used [...] "as a private viewing area, the absence of which has prevented effective implementation of many types of games in the past." [...] After a VMU slot was incorporated into the controller's design, Sega's engineers found many additional uses for it, so a second slot was added. This slot was generally used for vibration packs providing force feedback like Sega's [...] "Jump Pack" [...] and Performance's [...] "Tremor Pack", although it could also be used for other peripherals including a microphone enabling voice control and player communication.
