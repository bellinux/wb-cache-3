5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience would <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|As {{he slowly}} regains his memory, Mike recalls his {{feelings}} for Susan and challenges Ian for her affections. When Susan learns {{that the two}} had made a bet on her {{in a game of}} poker, she calls off the wedding and declares that she does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> either of them again. Realizing that letting both of them go is a mistake, Susan decides to take Ian back. However, he tells her that he cannot {{spend the rest of his}} life wondering if she is still in love with Mike, and he leaves. Susan and Mike reunite and become engaged. The couple get married in a private ceremony in the woods, with Julie as their only guest.|$|E
5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} {{only a matter of time}} before they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E

50|$|Bruce {{eventually}} leaves England {{to return}} home to a civilian life in Gotham, but Alfred remains in England, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bruce Wayne damage his body further. He does not return to Gotham until a while later, when Dick Grayson persuades {{him to do so}} in later issues.|$|R
5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, {{though he did not}} tell the Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate with him for the greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him gain high office.|$|E
5|$|Despite this success, Berger {{still had}} to {{negotiate}} with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the Waffen-SS at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by Generaloberst Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) {{on a number of issues}} around Waffen-SS recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to SS-Brigadeführer. According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the Waffen-SS would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.|$|E
50|$|The {{state of}} Missouri, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> service lost between St. Louis and Kansas City, stepped {{in on that}} part of the National's route, and {{introduced}} the Kansas City Mule and St. Louis Mule to provide service there; Amtrak now operates the Missouri River Runner between the two cities.|$|R
50|$|During {{the same}} period of time, LEO was {{struggling}} to produce its own machines that would be able to compete with IBM. Its parent company, J. Lyons and Co., simply did not have the financial might to develop a new line of machines. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its work go to waste, it sold its computer division to English Electric.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{frequent}} rain and other difficulties in Hong Kong, the filming was nearly abandoned. When {{he returned to}} Los Angeles, McQueen fell ill because he had an abscessed molar. He had <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a dentist until he returned to California. His dentist and physician ordered him to take {{an extended period of}} rest—one that halted production again for weeks.|$|R
5|$|Gulfton {{is located}} in District 137 of the Texas House of Representatives and {{represented}} by Gene Wu since 2013. Gulfton is within District 17 of the Texas Senate and represented by Joan Huffman since 2009. In May 1991, Marc Campos of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, expressed concerns that proposed state senate redistricting plans would deliberately re-draw Texas Senate, District 15 to ensure the re-election of John Whitmire. He felt this would hamper the possible election of Hispanic representatives. Campos cited the inclusion of Gulfton in Whitmire's district would dilute Hispanic voting strength, since many Gulfton residents are not eligible to vote {{due to a lack}} of citizenship. A May 15, 1991 Houston Chronicle article reported that some people did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Gulfton included in a mostly Hispanic Texas Senate district citing fears that the residents might not vote. During the afternoon of May 1, 2010, 7,000 people protested Arizona's SB 1070 bill along Bellaire Boulevard and Chimney Rock in Gulfton.|$|E
5|$|Natasha and Andrew {{break up}} and Natasha briefly dates Kyle Canning. Natasha discovers {{that a student}} in her class is gay and tries to out them, the {{resulting}} rumours lead Chris to reveal he is gay. Michael starts dating Ruby Rogers (Yesse Spence) and Natasha tries to sabotage the relationship. She reveals that she does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Michael get hurt. Natasha becomes head of the school social committee and she bullies the other members, in particular Sophie Ramsay (Kaiya Jones), into voting for the things she wants. Natasha notices that Andrew is spending time with Summer and she steals the social money, causing the event to be cancelled. Natasha convinces Andrew to throw a party and they get back together. Michael discovers Natasha took the money and suspends her. Natasha later warns Summer {{to stay away from}} Andrew. When she notices Summer's house is on fire, Natasha runs in to rescue her. Michael finds Natasha and they, along with Summer and Andrew, are rescued by firefighters.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' and Cameron's {{relationship}} was deteriorating and they contemplated divorce. While Cameron visited the artistic commune at San Miguel de Allende in Mexico and befriended the artist Renate Druks, Parsons {{moved into a}} house in Redondo Beach and {{was involved in a}} brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan before Cameron returned. By March 1951, Parsons and Cameron had moved to the coach house at 1071 South Orange Grove, while he began work at the Bermite Powder Company, constructing explosives for the film industry. They started holding parties once more that were attended largely by bohemians and members of the beat generation, and Cameron attended the jazz clubs of Central Avenue with her friend, the sculptor Julie Macdonald. Cameron produced illustrations for fashion magazines and sold some of her paintings, including some purchased by a friend, the artist Jirayr Zorthian. Parsons and Cameron had decided to travel to Mexico for a few months. On the day before they planned to leave—June 17, 1952—he received a rush order of explosives for a film set, and began work on the order at his house. In the midst of this project, an explosion destroyed the building, fatally wounding Parsons. He was rushed to hospital, but was declared dead. Cameron did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his body and retreated to San Miguel, asking her friend George Frey to oversee the cremation.|$|E
50|$|The bout is one-sided. Palmer looks done for, {{but he gets}} new {{motivation}} {{after seeing}} Diggs, who is sitting courtside, move his hand slightly (which he interprets as a show of support).

50|$|In June 2009, the {{financial}} {{situation at the}} company had not improved, leaving KAP {{in danger of being}} closed by CEAC. The government, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its largest company being shut down, agreed to guarantee a €45 million loan. In exchange, the government would receive half of the stakes owned by CEAC, leaving CEAC with a stake of 29.3%.|$|R

After a brief skirmish, the zoogs are defeated. To abate further hostilities, the zoogs agree to a new treaty with the cats of Ulthar.|$|R
25|$|The papacy, also {{an enemy}} of the emperors, did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the kingdom of {{southern}} Italy (then one of the richest in Europe) in German hands, but Henry pressed Pope Celestine III to baptize and crown his son: the Pope put him off.|$|E
25|$|What {{motivated}} Zhao remains, even today, a {{topic of}} debate by many. Some say {{he went into the}} square hoping a conciliatory gesture would gain him leverage against hard-liners like Premier Li Peng. Others believe he supported the protesters and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them hurt when the military was called in. After the incident, Zhao was placed under indefinite house arrest.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} Pennsylvania Avenue {{provided}} an unobstructed view between the White House and the Capitol. The {{construction of an}} expansion to the Treasury Building blocked this view, and supposedly President Andrew Jackson did this on purpose. Relations {{between the president and}} Congress were strained, and Jackson did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Capitol out his window, though in reality the Treasury Building was simply built on what was cheap government land.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1935, Krazy Kats Sunday edition was {{published}} in full color. Though the number of newspapers carrying it dwindled in its last decade, Herriman continued to draw Krazy Kat—creating roughly 3,000 cartoons—until his death in April 1944 (the final page {{was published}} exactly two months later, on June 25). Hearst promptly canceled the strip after the artist died, because, contrary to the common practice of the time, he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a new cartoonist take over.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} {{undesirable}} species is a recognized problem with all fishing methods and unites environmentalists, who do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> fish killed needlessly, and fishermen, {{who do not}} want to waste their time sorting marketable fish from their catch. A number of methods to minimize this have been developed for use in trawling. Bycatch reduction grids or square mesh panels of net can be fitted to parts of the trawl, allowing certain species to escape while retaining others.|$|E
25|$|One {{story is}} that before knowing if the viceroy had {{received}} his request for a meeting, Hidalgo received word that Calleja was already en route with another army. Hidalgo’s troops had sustained heavy casualties during Las Cruces and Hidalgo feared {{that he could not}} withstand another royalist assault. Another view is that Hidalgo was a priest, not a military man and the bloodshed of that battle horrified him. He did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it, nor the riots of the Bajio cities repeated in Mexico City.|$|E

Edward Price, a CIA official since 2006, stirred controversy when he published an op-ed in The Washington Post, explaining why he surprised himself by resigning, after he perceived Trump using his visit to CIA HQ for partisan political posturing.|$|E

But for the previous 20 years, though he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had de facto control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him, and he served {{until the end of}} the war. During this period the company began to decline, losing more than $10million a month ($ today). The administration of President Franklin Roosevelt had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production, but the idea never progressed.|$|E
