Syren, a location-based, multi-speaker {{augmented}} audio reality installation {{was presented}} as a shipboard exhibit at the 12 th International Symposium on Electronic Art in August 2004. It was conceived as a continuous 3 -day spatial audio experience that augments the landscape through the Baltic archipelago with location-based audio media, spatialised through a 12 channel speaker array. As the ship tracks between Helsinki, Mariehamn, Stockholm and Tallinn, listeners on the upper deck hear sounds that are perceived to originate from geographic features. Our custom GIS is derived from electronic <b>nautical</b> charting <b>information</b> that includes coastlines, buoys and beacons. A handheld GPS provides both position and direction data that was used by a software system to drive parameters of the spatial audio presentation.

In this study, we evaluate the potential of these methods for supplementing the procedure to assess the adequacy of hydrographic surveying and nautical charting coverage. Optically-derived bathymetry provides information in areas that have not been surveyed and monitor any seafloor changes that may have occurred since the last survey of the area.

It is now heading to Web-based GIS technology for efficiency data distribution as to secure the safety of vessel navigation. Web-based GIS holds the potential to make distributed <b>nautical</b> charts <b>information</b> available to a very large worldwide audience. In practice, the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) took six months {{to more than a}} year to produce a new or updated chart. Therefore, any updates that are important to the users are published in Notice to Mariners by both RMN and Marine Departments monthly. Undoubtedly, this would cause some confusion to the mariners about the reliability of data, as two different departments manage the Notice to Mariners in different formats and timing. Moreover, nautical charts are widely used in offshore engineering works, fisheries industries, and others. All of these parties seek for the latest <b>information</b> about <b>nautical</b> chart in order to success their works. Since the charts are in different format, projection, symbolization and producers, they should be integrated for the needs of safety information. To overcome these problems, it is important to propose Web-based GIS system to manage and visualize nautical charts online. Thus, this paper studies on the creation of Nautical –WebGIS for sharing the charts information throughout Malaysia with the latest Notice to Mariners from both RMN and Marine Departments. The area of this study would be both MAL 5 (Peninsular Malaysia) and MAL 6 (Sabah and Sarawak).

Linschoten confirmed rumors in Europe that the Portuguese Estado da India had become decadent and unstable, especially in its capital Goa. He also mentioned the absence of Portuguese control in the market of Bantam, which would become the capital of Dutch Indonesia. In addition, the book disclosed <b>nautical</b> and economic <b>information</b> about the Indian Ocean until then carefully guarded by the Portuguese, especially about the Spice Islands.

This article discusses the main features that made the cartographic, cultural, and economic information of the Itinerario crucial to this historical expedition. Historicizing the discipline of geography is indispensable for understanding how travel and technology affect what can be known of the planet. Following Foucault's understanding of the production of knowledge, the central argument is that the Itinerario inaugurated a leap in the Dutch geographical “episteme” and a new struggle for the Indian Ocean.

40|$|Among {{all those}} goods {{which have been}} offered as {{examples}} of public goods, national defense and lighthouses {{have been among the}} most frequently cited. In both cases, it is typically claimed that only a government can effectively provide the good. This paper will present historical evidence which demonstrates that such a claim is false. For instance, the 700 year history of privateering—-the use of private armed ships during time of war—-will show that national defense in the form of warfare on the seas was not, and need not, be monopolized by government. It will also be shown that lighthouses were frequently built and operated by private entrepreneurs, rather than by governments. Indeed, maritime history, especially that concerning the age of sail, is rich with examples of privately supplied goods that today are often thought of as being “public. ” Some additional ones which will be examined herein include: the positive information externalities provided by Lloyd’s of London and the American Shipmasters ’ Association with regard to ship construction, movements, and quality; the voluntary carriage of mail by shipmasters; the “speaking” of vessels and the subsequent reporting of a vessel’s geographical position; the assistance given to vessels in need of supplies; the spontaneous lifesaving and salvage actions of pilot boats and their crews; the private publication of navigation manuals; the development of private systems of signal flags; and the dispersal of <b>nautical</b> <b>information</b> by private organizations and individuals.

40|$|Hydrographic {{surveying}} {{although an}} expensive venture, is today {{considered the most}} significant tool in the expansion of world maritime trade by providing timely and adequate <b>nautical</b> <b>information</b> to mariners {{in the form of}} charts for safe and efficient navigation. Most maritime nations especially in developing countries may not have realized the advantages to be gained from the provision of functional hydrographic services. This has rendered their waters inadequately surveyed thereby denying them the much needed revenue to be accrued through maritime trade. IHO C- 55 publication indicated that only 20 % of Nigerian waters with depth between 0 - 200 m and 10 % with depth greater than 200 m are adequately surveyed. It further reveals 70 % with depth between 0 - 200 m and 10 % with depth greater than 200 m requires re surveying at larger scale or to modern standard, while 10 % of waters with depth between 0 - 200 m and 80 % with depth greater than 200 m has never been systematically surveyed. With this statistics, it becomes clear the need to carry out detailed survey of Nigerian waters in order to update the current charts or produce new ones. The aim of this dissertation therefore is to examine the cost benefit of surveying Nigerian waters. The dissertation examines Nigerian maritime environment, the status of hydrographic surveying, nautical charting and maritime safety information in Nigeria and the role of nautical charts. Other areas that were examined include the trend of international maritime trade and the relevance of maritime transportation on Nigerian economy. The cost benefits analysis of surveying Nigerian waters was carried out to determine the true gains to be derived from the project. Although it was difficult to quantify the economic and commercial benefit which flows with a developed hydrographic programme, it was however very clear that the benefits of carrying out a detailed hydrographic surveying of Nigerian waters outweighs the cost. The result showed an impressive cost benefit ratio of 1 : 21 which underscores the dare need to survey Nigerian waters. This is quite expected {{in the case of a}} nation that depends largely on its maritime sector for foreign exchange earnings especially in the oil and gas sector. Faculty of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|Inland {{shipping}} is {{an important}} pillar of the European transport system; however the challenges of inland navigation due to dense traffic, increasing ship dimension, reduced maneuver space and visibility are multifaceted and increasing. About 20 to 30 collisions per year, partially caused by carelessness, demonstrate the necessity of driving assistance systems for inland waterway applications. The project LAESSI (Guiding and assistance systems to improve safety of navigation on inland waterways) is developing efficient navigation assistance functions for inland waterway transport which aim the reduction of risk of collisions by supporting the skipper in its task. Therefore, <b>nautical</b> <b>information</b> like position, height, velocity and heading has to be determined. One focus in this contribution is a bridge collision warning system, which provides a timely alert to the skipper, whenever the vessel, particularly the wheelhouse or radar mast, will not safely pass the bridge. A feasibility study has identified Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies as basis for the reliable height determination for such a bridge collision warning system. This approach requires information about the vertical clearance of the bridge superstructure as well as precise height information in the same height reference system at least 300 m before the vessel will pass the bridge. The high accuracy level of less than 10 cm in the vertical position necessitates the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) as suitable GNSS processing method. RTK is a phase-based differential GNSS technique and uses additional observations from permanent reference stations to mitigate or eliminate effects like tropospheric and ionospheric delays or satellite clocks and orbit errors. As bridge collision warning system is a safely critical application, this means that beside the provision of accurate height information also an integrity monitoring for the complete RTK procedure has to be introduced. The shore-based architecture is designed {{in such a way}} that correction data, based on a permanent GNSS reference station network, will be checked for their integrity before they are broadcasted (Pre-Broadcast Monitoring) to the processing computer on the vessel. Furthermore, several station dependent effects like signal interferences, signal losses or multipath effects, caused due to obstacles near the inland waterways, impact the GNSS signals, which hamper or falsify the ambiguity fixing and finally the position results. To prevent the provision of faulty results a further integrity monitoring for the shipborne architecture has to be applied. This shipborne integrity monitoring utilizes on the one hand a number of internal statistical parameters from the RTK algorithm like the conventional used fixed ratio value and on the other hand additional information from other sensors or observations. The contribution will present the derived requirements for accuracy, integrity and time to alert for different inland waterway assistance functions. Furthermore an overview about the system architecture and a communication concept based on VHF Data Exchange System (VDES) communication channels will be given. The main focus, however, is an RTK-algorithm which not only estimates position, velocity and heading, but also provides integrity information. This concept considers in a first realization internal statistical parameters from the RTK adjustment, other observations (e. g. Doppler shift) and physical information (e. g. baseline length of two GNSS antennas). A first measurement campaign was done in July 2016 in Koblenz/Germany on the river Moselle. This test area is characterized by three bridges in a relatively short distance of only 300 m which make the provision of reliable and precise RTK position data rather challenging. The preliminary analyses based on three hours GPS and GLONASS observations showed a high rate (> 85...|$|E
