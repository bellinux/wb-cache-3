40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the Chinese saving rate based on the flow of funds data. It finds that the most widely adopted view of precautionary saving, which is regarded as the top reason for maintaining a high saving rate in China, is misleading because this conclusion is drawn from the household survey data. In fact, the household saving rate has declined dramatically since the mid- 1990 s, as is observed from the flow of funds framework. The high national saving rate is attributed to the increasing shares of both government and corporation <b>disposable</b> <b>incomes.</b> Insufficient consumption demand is caused by the persistent decrease in percentage share of household to <b>national</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income.</b> Government- directed income redistribution urgently needs to be improved to accelerate consumption, which in turn would make the Chinese economy less investment-led and help to reduce the current account surplus.

The relation between savings and investments, which is equal to current account balance, looks less favourable. The main source of imbalance is a negative balance of incomes expressing bigger outflow of primary incomes in relation to their inflow. Public finances can be identified as the weakest chain link of economic development.

40|$|High {{ratios of}} {{external}} debt to GDP in selected Asian countries {{have contributed to}} the initiation, propagation, and severity of the financial and economic crises in recent years, reflecting runaway fiscal deficits and excessive foreign borrowing by the private sector. Applying the formal framework proposed by Villanueva (2003) to a selected group of Asian countries, the research estimates the external debt thresholds beyond which further debt accumulation will have negative effects on growth and will become unsustainable. The framework is an extension of the standard neoclassical growth model that incorporates global capital markets. ‘Sustainability’ is measured in terms of the steady-state ratio of the stock of external debt to GDP, as functions of real world interest rates, risk spreads and their responsiveness to external debt burdens and market perceptions of country risk, marginal propensities to save out of <b>national</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and foreign borrowing, rates of technical change, and parameters of the production function. The major policy implications are that in the long run, fiscal consolidation and the promotion of private saving are critical, and that reliance on foreign saving in a globalized financial world has limits, particularly when the risk spreads are positively correlated with rising external debt levels. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Chinese savings puzzle {{is defined}} by its {{increasing}} national savings rate since the early 1990 s and reaching an unusually high level in recent years. There are two main causes for this puzzle. The first one is the high and increasing share of Chinese firms and financial institutions in the <b>national</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> (these agents have no final consumption and so save their whole <b>disposable</b> <b>income).</b> This can be partly explained by an uneven sharing of value added, which favors profit {{to the detriment of}} wages, due to the high and increasing supply of labor in urban areas. The high coprporate savings also results from the low distribution of firms' income. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) generally have little incentive to distribute dividends and those that are distributed, are usually reinvested; private firms face rationing in the credit market and need to finance a bulk of investment with their own retained earnings. The second cause of China's savings puzzle relates to the increasing and high household saving rate. This {{can be explained by the}} life-cycle hypothesis while taking into account of a set of pertinent Chinese factors, such as the one-child policy, which induces parents to save more in the absence of sufficient children to support their post-retirement life, and the necessity for households to accumulate enough savings in order to buy a house when the mortgage market is still limited. A complementary explanation is the higher precautionary savings accumulated by households to prepare for contingencies, e. g. unemployment and health risks...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, taking {{advantage}} of the inclusion of a special module on material deprivation in EU-SILC 2009, we provide a comparative analysis of patterns of deprivation. Our analysis identifies six relatively distinct dimensions of deprivation with generally satisfactory overall levels of reliability and mean levels of reliability across counties. Multi-level analysis based on 28 European countries reveals systematic variation across countries in the relative importance of with and between country variation. The basic deprivation dimension is the sole dimension to display a graduated pattern of variation a across countries. It also reveals the highest correlations with national and household income, the remaining deprivation dimensions and economic stress. It comes closest to capturing an underlying dimension of generalized deprivation that can provide the basis for a comparative European analysis of exclusion from customary standards of living. A multilevel analysis revealed that a range of household and household reference person socio-economic factors were related to basic deprivation and controlling for contextual differences in such factors allowed us to account for substantial proportions of both within and between country variance. The addition of macro-economic factors relating to average levels of <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and income inequality contributed relatively little further in the way of explanatory power. Further analysis revealed the existence of a set of significant interactions between micro socio-economic attributes and country level gross <b>national</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> per capita. The impact of socio-economic differentiation was significantly greater where average income levels were lower. Or, in other words, the impact of the latter was greater for more disadvantaged socio-economic groups. Our analysis supports the suggestion that an emphasis on the primary role of income inequality to the neglect of differences in absolute levels of income may be misleading in important respects. deprivation, economics, income, socio-economic differentiation, multi-level analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{makes use}} of both output and income {{statistics}} derived from the System of National Accounts to examine performance in the three North American countries. In doing so, the paper follows recommendations contained in the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) for calculating aggregate real income statistics such as gross national income (GNI) and gross <b>national</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> (GNDI) rather than aggregate real gross domestic product (GDP), in order {{to demonstrate the utility}} of alternate measures for analyzing aggregate economic performance and the standard of living. To move from estimates of GDP to estimates of GNI and GNDI, adjustments are made for changes in relative prices, referred to as a "trading gain" (the combined effect of changes to the terms of trade and changes in the ratio of traded goods prices to non-traded goods prices), and for current account entries other than the trade balance. The paper compares real output and income measures for Mexico, the United States, and Canada. Differences between the GDP and GNDI estimates illustrate the extent to which non-production factors, such as relative price changes, can influence the economic performance of a nation, either as compared to that of other nations or in terms of a nation's ability to purchase the goods and services its citizens consume. They also illustrate the benefit of using more than one measure when comparing economic performance across countries. Economic accounts...|$|R

The first problem we encountered was the selection of the benchmark. A couple of alternative ways to conduct relativizations were selected. First, we applied the conventional poverty approach. The poor were those whose income remained below 60 % of the <b>national</b> equivalent <b>disposable</b> <b>income.</b> Second, we collapsed European nations together into one data pool and calculated a common poverty line for the EU.

If we apply the conventional nation-based ways of operationalizing poverty (poverty line 60 % of median income) the poverty rate varies from 7, 1 % in Sweden to 20, 5 % in Italy. The shift to the common European poverty line will expand that gap. The variation is from 0, 7 % in Luxembourg to 43, 1 % in Spain.

30|$|The {{framework}} of Europe 2020, the European Union’s growth {{strategy for the}} decade, shows policymakers’ increasing interest in poverty issues: {{one of the five}} headline targets consists in reducing poverty or social exclusion, by lifting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020 (European Commission 2010). The definition of adequate policies, however, needs to rely not only on a measure of the level of poverty or social exclusion characterising a country but also on a clear knowledge of the underlying processes and trigger factors. For this reason, in the set of indicators used by the European Union (EU) to monitor social inclusion, the at risk of poverty (ARP) rate is complemented by the persistent at risk of poverty (PARP) rate that provides a more detailed picture of how consistently households experience poverty in time (Őzdemir and Ward 2010). According to Eurostat, the ARP is the share of people with an equivalised <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> below the ARP threshold, which is set at 60  % of the <b>national</b> median equivalised <b>disposable</b> <b>income.</b> The PARP is then defined as the share of individuals at risk of poverty during the current year and at least two out of the three previous ones (Eurostat 2012).|$|R
