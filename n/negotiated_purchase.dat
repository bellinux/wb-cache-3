5|$|Lenders, {{including}} Bank of America, {{moved to}} foreclose on the retail and transit {{portion of the}} mixed-use development on October 19, 2009, because the developer, Joseph Freed and Associates LLC, ran out of money. Freed technically defaulted in March. With cost overruns exceeding $34million as of August 25, Freed owes $128.5million on a $205million construction loan, according to a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court. On November 3, the developer announced it had landed 13 new tenants to open within the succeeding few months. On November 20, a circuit court judge stripped Freed of the development rights and turn the responsibility over to CB Richard Ellis. On the same day a partial occupancy permit for the underground pedway connecting the red line and the blue line {{as well as the}} first floor retail space was granted. Freed claimed that the loan payments were current and that the default was based on a technicality. As receiver, CB Richard Ellis was scheduled to file a status report with the court December 8 and a full report, including financials, on January 15, 2010. In March 2011, Bank of America acquired the $206 million property with a credit bid of $100 million at a sheriff's foreclosure sale.
