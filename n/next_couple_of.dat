40|$|We {{examine the}} {{distributional}} and e ciency impacts of climate {{policy in the}} context of fiscal consolidation in a dynamic general-equilibrium overlapping generations model of the US economy. The model includes a disaggregated production structure, including energy sector detail and advanced low- or zero-carbon energy technologies, and detail on government taxes and spending. In contrast to revenue-neutral carbon tax swaps, using the carbon revenue for deficit reduction implies a relaxation of future public budgets as debt repayment results in lower interest obligations. While we show that the intergenerational welfare impacts depend importantly on what tax recycling instrument is used, we find that combining debt consolidation with a carbon policy entails the possibility of sustained welfare gains for future generations. We thus argue that combining fiscal and climate policy may o er the chance for positive societal gains (without considering potential benefits from averted climate change). Importantly, this may enhance the political support for revenue-raising climate policies that are framed over the <b>next</b> <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> decades...|$|R

Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further {{in an area of}} low vertical windshear, before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21. Over the <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23. Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti. During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure. As a result, the system started to move towards the south-southeast.|$|E

40|$|In this perspective, {{we present}} an {{overview}} of recent progress on Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with a specific focus on its accuracy and on models able {{to take into account}} environmental effects, including complex media. To this end, we first summarise recent benchmarks and define an average TD-DFT accuracy in reproducing excitation energies when a conventional approach is used. <b>Next,</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> TD-DFT with models able to account for different kinds of interactions between a central chromophore and nearby chemical objects (solvent, organic cage, metal as well as semi-conducting surface) is investigated. Examples of application to excitation properties are presented, allowing to briefly describe several recent computational strategies. In addition, an extension of TD-DFT to describe a phenomenon involving interacting chromophores, e. g. the electronic energy transfer (EET), is presented to illustrate that this methodology can be applied to processes beyond the vertical excitation. This perspective therefore aims to provide to non-specialists a flavour of recent trends in the field of simulations of excited states in ‘‘realistic’’ situations...|$|R
