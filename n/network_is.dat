40|$|Two sets {{of studies}} {{examined}} {{the viability of}} using bat-like sonar input for artificial neural networks in complex pattern recognition tasks.

The neural <b>network</b> <b>was</b> able to recognize novel echoes of faces almost perfectly (above 96 % accuracy) when it was required to recognize up to five faces. In the second face recognition task, a sonar neural <b>network</b> <b>was</b> trained to recognize the sex of 16 faces (eight males and eight females). After training, the <b>network</b> <b>was</b> able to correctly recognize novel echoes of those faces as 'male' or as 'female' faces with accuracy levels of 88 %. However, the <b>network</b> <b>was</b> not able to recognize novel faces as 'male' or 'female' faces. In the second set of studies, a sonar neural <b>network</b> <b>was</b> required to learn to recognize the speed of a target that was moving towards the viewer.
