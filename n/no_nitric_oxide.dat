Several automobile and related {{companies such as}} Delphi, Ford, Chrysler, and Toyota have also put extensive research into development of NOx sensors. Many academic and government labs are pushing to develop the sensors as well. The term NOx represents several forms of nitrogen oxides such as <b>NO</b> (<b>nitric</b> <b>oxide),</b> NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and N2O (nitrous oxide aka laughing gas). In a gasoline engine NO {{is the most common}} form of NOx being around 93% while NO2 is around 5% and the rest is N2O. There are other forms of NOx such as N2O4 (the dimer of NO2), which only exists at lower temperatures, and N2O5, for example. However, owing to much higher combustion temperatures due to high cylinder compression and turbo or supercharging, diesel engines produce much higher engine-out NOx emissions than spark-ignition gasoline engines do. The recent availability of Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) allows the properly equipped diesel engine to emit similar values of NOx at the tailpipe compared to a typical gasoline engine with a 3-way catalyst. In addition, the diesel oxidation catalyst significantly increases the fraction of NO2 in [...] "NOx" [...] by oxidizing over 50% of NO using the excess oxygen in the diesel exhaust gases.|$|E

5000|$|Nitro{{tyrosine}} is {{a product}} of tyrosine nitration mediated by reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite anion and nitrogen dioxide. Nitrotyrosine is identified as an indicator or marker of cell damage, inflammation as well as <b>NO</b> (<b>nitric</b> <b>oxide)</b> production. Nitrotyrosine is formed {{in the presence of the}} active metabolite NO. Generally in many disease states, oxidative stress increases the production of superoxide (O2−) and NO forming peroxynitrite (ONOO−) a destructive free radical oxidant. The production of ONOO− is capable of oxidizing several lipoproteins and of nitrating tyrosine residues in many proteins. It is difficult to determine the production of ONOO− so, usually nitrotyrosine in proteins are the detectable marker for indirectly detecting ONOO−. It is detected in large number of pathological conditions and is considered a marker of NO-dependent, reactive nitrogen species-induced nitrative stress. Nitrotyrosine is detected in biological fluids such as plasma, lung aspirants-BALF (Broncho alveolar lining fluid) and urine. Increased level of nitrotyrosine is detected in rheumatoid arthritis [...] septic shock [...] and coeliac disease. In all these studies nitrotyrosine was undetected in healthy subjects.

50|$|Arsenic {{can cause}} {{oxidative}} stress through {{the formation of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Reactive oxygen species are produced by the enzyme NADPH oxidase, which transfers electrons from NADPH to oxygen, synthesizing a superoxide, which is a reactive free radical. This superoxide can react to form hydrogen peroxide and a reactive oxygen species. The enzyme NADPH oxidase is able to generate more reactive oxygen species {{in the presence of}} arsenic, due to the subunit p22phax, which is responsible for the electron transfer, being upregulated by arsenic. The reactive oxygen species are capable of stressing the endoplasmic reticulum, which increases the amount of the unfolded protein response signals. This leads to inflammation, cell proliferation, and eventually to cell death. Another mechanism in which reactive oxygen species cause cell death would be through the cytoskeleton rearrangement, which affects the contractile proteins. The reactive nitrogen species arise once the reactive oxygen species destroy the mitochondria. This leads to the formation of the reactive nitrogen species, which are responsible for damaging DNA in arsenic poisoning. Mitochondrial damage is known to cause the release of reactive nitrogen species, due to the reaction between superoxides and nitric oxide (<b>NO).</b> <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) is a part of cell regulation, including cellular metabolism, growth, division and death.

40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} static magnetic field (SMF) on oxidant and antioxidant parameters of the cancerous and noncancerous human gastric tissues. Materials and Methods. Gastric tissues obtained from patients with gastric cancer {{were used in the}} study. SMF was created by using two static magnets. Before and after treatment with SMF, oxidant and antioxidant parameters were measured in the tissue samples. Results. In the cancerous tissue, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was found higher and malondialdehyde (MDA) level was found lower as compared with noncancerous tissue. SMF affects oxidant/antioxidant parameters differently in the cancerous and noncancerous tissues. In this regard, SMF causes increase in SOD activity and decrease in MDA level in the noncancerous tissue. However, it decreases SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and increases MDA level and catalase (CAT) activity in the cancerous tissue. There were <b>no</b> differences between <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (<b>NO)</b> and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> synthase (NOS) parameters in or among the cancerous and noncancerous tissues. Conclusions. SMF accelerates peroxidation reactions possibly by suppressing SOD and GSH-Px enzymes in the cancerous gastric tissue.
