40|$|This paper studies {{insider trading}} to examine {{undervaluation}} as a motive behind corporate spinoffs. We show an unmistakable increase (decrease) {{in the number}} of insider <b>purchases</b> (sales) and <b>net</b> <b>purchases</b> (sales) in the four quarters prior to a spinoff announcement. In addition, relative to a benchmark period, insider selling is significantly lower, and their <b>net</b> <b>purchases</b> significantlyhigher,in the three quarters prior to a spinoff announcement compared to other periods. We find that announcement period excess returns for abnormal <b>net</b> insider <b>purchases</b> are significantly higher than excess returns for abnormal net insider sales. Moreover, only firms with abnormal <b>net</b> insider <b>purchases</b> exhibit significant improvement in theirlong-run market and operating performance after a spinoff.

50|$|The <b>net</b> <b>purchase</b> cost of {{a product}} {{is the amount of}} the invoice plus any {{additional}} fees and taxes that are incurred. Business owners can negotiate the purchase price of a product if they know what the <b>net</b> <b>purchase</b> price is in comparison to the invoice price. This is not always easy to do, but it should be apparent, at least following the first purchase of a product. Any fees or taxes added to the invoice price indicate the additional fees that are being tacked on to the price. If purchasing a product in a large volume, it may be possible for the manufacturer to waive some of these costs for a large enough order. If a car dealer has additional incentives available for the purchase of a vehicle, he generally discounts the vehicle below the invoice price. This should be seen as a sign for the buyer that additional room for negotiation may exist.|$|E

To determine the condition of a country's financial markets is through the capital market {{that can be seen}} from the Composite Stock Price Index (CSPI). Factors that affect the movement of a country's stock index are changing of central bank interest rates, the stock price index of regional countries, the global economy situation, the energy prices level, currency exchange rates, politics stability of a country (Blanchard, 2006). The purpose of this study is analysing the effect of the exchange rate of USD / IDR, the World Gold Price, the World Oil Price, the DJIA index, the Nikkei Index and the Foreign <b>Net</b> <b>Purchases</b> to the Composite Stock Price Index (IHSG) in Indonesia Stock Market (BEI) in 2003 to 2013 by using ARCH-GARCH models.

40|$|Determinants {{of trade}} flows have always {{attracted}} researchers. In this paper, we model monthly trade flows in India over January 2000 – December 2007 {{in a bid}} to gauge their responsiveness to exchange rate movements. Capital account and overall BOP surplus have led the Indian Rupee (INR) to appreciate and forex reserves to accumulate. In so far as the RBI intervenes to stem this forex accretion by the <b>net</b> <b>purchase</b> of USD, it puts further pressure on the INR to appreciate. It therefore becomes important to study the response of the current account to these changes in the exchange rate. We employ standard empirical estimations of India’s export supply and import demand functions using data from the Reserve Bank of India. We also assess the short-term dynamics of these trade flows through error correction models. Finally, we estimate vector auto regression models to gauge the extent of contemporaneous interaction between trade flows and the explanatory variables in the system. ...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{economic}} {{recession in the}} United States led to widespread destruction of jobs, home foreclosures, credit freeze and to creditor repossessions of key assets such as personal cars. Our objective is to empirically assess transportation conditions of US households {{with a focus on}} transportation spending. The latter is examined in the context of changes in multiple metrics such as total number of household cars, zero-vehicle status, expenditures on local public transportation and gasoline, down payment and <b>net</b> <b>purchase</b> price of cars, decline in household vehicle stock, and interest rates on auto loans. Using an econometric model of repeated cross-sections of data on households from the Consumer Expenditure Survey for the period 2005 through 2009, we examine factors which affect recession-period spending. In an effort to demonstrate the effects of the recession on specific groups, as well as to examine equity implications for vulnerable populations, our overall results are disaggregated by variations in transportation spending of minority, single mother and young households. Transportation spending declined significantly between 2005 and the recession years. A large part of this was due to lower car-ownership levels and an overall increase in zero-car households. Those households that did acquire a car needed to make higher levels of down payment. They also paid higher interest rates compared to the pre-recession period. Minorities spent significantly less than non-minorities before the recession but the difference from non-minorities was not significant during the recession. Single mothers did not spend significantly less than other households overall; however, their spending level became significantly less during the recession and they {{were much more likely to}} become zero-car households during the recession.

From a near absence of FII inflows till 1992, today such inflows represent a dominant proportion of total flows. Positive fundamentals, gradual removal of structural barriers combined with fast growing markets have made India an attractive destination for foreign institutional investors. Funds flow from FIIs have crossed the record Rs 97, 900 crore mark this year. The <b>net</b> <b>purchase</b> of Rs 97, 955. 50 crore (21. 42 billion) is the higher ever investment by overseas firms in any single year in India. Today, FIIs are the key drivers of the Indian equity market and rising stakes in Indian companies. But, {{at the same time}} there is unease over the volatility in foreign institutional investment flows and its impact on the different segments of the economy. The increase in the volume of foreign institutional investment (FII) inflows in recent time has led to concerns regarding the volatility of these flows, threat of capital flight, its impact on the stock markets and influence of changes in regulatory regimes [...] Globally strong consensus has emerged that the achievement of more dynamic economic growth requires a greater role of the foreign capital.
