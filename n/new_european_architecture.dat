5000|$|A10 <b>new</b> <b>European</b> <b>architecture</b> was an {{architectural}} magazine published in Amsterdam that {{relied on a}} network of correspondents throughout Europe. The magazine ran from 2004 to 2016. It often highlighted young practices and emphasized the establishment of connections between the various European nations.|$|E
50|$|The jury {{consisted}} of chairman Detlef Rahe (internationally renowned architect and designer), Hans Ibelings (editor {{and publisher of}} the magazine A10 - <b>new</b> <b>European</b> <b>architecture),</b> Lorraine Farrelly(acting head of the School of Architecture at the University of Portsmouth) and Johan Valcke (one of the founders of Design Flanders).|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} process which was coming since 1950 s to Western Europe {{got into a}} new and very difficult phase. The article is focusing on the basic areas of reforms in the EU (Agenda 2000), single currency, <b>new</b> <b>European</b> security <b>architecture,</b> start of negotiations with associate states and determination of financial plan for time after 1999. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposal}} from Russian President Dmitri Medvedev for a <b>new</b> <b>European</b> security <b>architecture</b> enlivened {{the debate about}} the relationship between the EU and Russia. Yet, under the term security, the Russians understand something different than the EU with her concept of soft power. New forums are needed in order to finally come to a common understanding about future affairs in the region...|$|R
50|$|The Republic of Macedonia could {{maintain}} all the guarantees for its security through the collective {{defence and security}} systems. That is why, the Republic of Macedonia supports the reinforcement of these collective systems and determines itself to actively participate in these systems and to cooperate {{with regard to the}} construction of the <b>new</b> <b>European</b> security <b>architecture</b> based upon NATO, OSCE and WEU.|$|R
50|$|A10 - <b>new</b> <b>European</b> <b>{{architecture}}</b> {{was founded}} in 2004 by architecture critic Hans Ibelings and graphic designer Arjan Groot. The first issue appeared in November 2004. The magazine is published by Boom publishers Amsterdam BV on a bimonthly basis. It has its headquarters in Amsterdam. The current editor-in-chief is Indira van 't Klooster.|$|E
40|$|Following {{publication}} of the de Larosière report in February 2009, the EU machinery has finally swung into action and is now delivering concrete proposals for the much-needed <b>new</b> <b>European</b> <b>architecture</b> for financial supervision. In his assessment of the initial steps proposed by the Commission in May and endorsed by the European Council in June, CEPS Director Daniel Gros finds that while they are not revolutionary {{in the sense of}} creating new powers for supervision at the EU level, they are potentially of immense importance as it is the EU that will create a number of new institutions. In his view, one should not underestimate the importance of this development, given that the history of the EU has shown repeatedly how the existence of strong institutions can fundamentally alter the distribution of power and thus affect policy...|$|E
40|$|Europe {{is on the}} move. Croatia’s recent {{application}} for the membership to the European Union has been excellent news in the headlines. In the <b>new</b> <b>European</b> <b>architecture</b> the proper definition of the Council of Europe’s place and role will be our most important challenge. With 800 million Europeans, at present, in 44 member states, we are Organization of the One Europe. The Human Rights Convention is the Council of Europe’s quality seal – the heart and basis of the European Community of peace-loving states. As a next step, accession to the European Cultural Convention should take place. The third step would be the accession to the European Social Charter. Like the Council of Europe, the EU wants to create a common legal area in Europe. The Council of Europe closer partnership with EU is political necessity...|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s, his {{diplomatic}} career {{allowed him}} to participate closely in the shaping of the <b>new</b> <b>European</b> Security <b>Architecture</b> emerging {{after the end of}} the cold war. First as Senior official to the CSCE and Ambassador to the Western European Union (WEU), then as Ambassador to Poland (1994-1996), Permanent Representative to the NATO Council (1996-1997) and Belgian Member of the Political Committee of the European Union (1997-2001).|$|R
50|$|The {{programme}} contains {{guidelines for}} a common politics on the topics of protection of fundamental rights, privacy, minority rights and rights of groups of people in need of special protection, {{as well as a}} citizenship of the European Union.In the programme there are also plans for a <b>new</b> <b>European</b> security <b>architecture</b> through the extension of cooperation in the areas of police, military and secret services and measures in the area of border-crossing data exchange between state authorities and surveillance of the internet.|$|R
40|$|The end of {{the cold}} war {{security}} order and its sudden transformation in 1989 has altered the structure of the European state system, intensified the interrelationship between military security and economic security and possibly inverted their relative importance, and raised new possibilities for cooperation in military and economic affairs. These changes also raise questions about the institutional choices available to reconfigure the European security space and the consequences of the choices already made. In this paper, we examine the causes and consequences of the reconfiguration of the institutions of European security that constitute, in turn, the building blocks of the <b>new</b> <b>European</b> security <b>architecture...</b>|$|R
40|$|The central {{assumption}} {{of this paper}} is that international regime theory constitutes an important heuristic tool which contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the dynamics of European security as it emerges from the Cold War era. Comprising a set of principles, norms, decision-making procedures and a framework of permanent organizations, the <b>new</b> <b>European</b> <b>architecture</b> forms an authentic security regime based on a process of regional cooperation. The Yugoslav conflict, which constitutes the first test of this regime, illustrates the fact that, even if these institutions failed to end the conflict, they did influence the behaviour of the main European actors. Not only did they favor interstate cooperation but they also reined-in the inclination of states to opt for self-centered policies based on short-term interests. From this perspective, regional security organizations have helped significantly to limit the scope and potential spill-over risks of the conflict in addition to decreasing the tension between the major European actors...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the Europeanization {{capacity of the}} Balkan states and demonstrates their Europeanization potential contrary to common assumptions of incompatibility between the Balkan and European integration. Using as case studies EU-candidate Romania and the Republic of Macedonia the paper argues that EU membership aspiration can actually bear significant transformations and adaptations in the Balkan domestic scenes. This creates new prospects for the future regional role of the EU and allows for new considerations concerning the region’s place in the <b>New</b> <b>European</b> <b>Architecture.</b> In the first part, Europeanization is analysed as a EU-oriented process, directly dependent upon specific mechanisms and intervening confining conditions. Analysis {{is based on a}} combination of supranational institutionalism, Europeanization approaches and democratisation theories that acknowledge the international dimension of democratisation. In the second part, the broader EU framework for the region and the more specific one for the promotion of regional development are presented, followed, in the third part, by the institutional response of the two case study countries. In the last part, the limitations of the current European system and the need for a parallel EU enlargement in the Balkans are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, the political role of the state borders in the Balkans has changed. Gradually they began to transform from barriers into zones of bilateral and multilateral cooperation. The common European integration includes the creation and development of Euro-regions. Within the context of reorganization of the new European space, geopolitical importance of South-East Europe has significantly upgraded. This fact reflects on the interests of the international community in security and development of this region. Despite that the Balkans constitute an indispensable part of the European continent, their incorporation into the <b>new</b> <b>European</b> <b>architecture</b> has been particularly difficult and problematic. They emerge as the most volatile and least integrated European region. There are significant variations among the countries concerning their territory, number of population, as well as the rate of the economic changes. The main forms of regional cooperation should be concentrated on the domains of transport, energy and communication infrastructure, trade and economic cooperation, environment and security. From this point of view, the economic growth and increase of living standard are the most important problems for all Balkan countries...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{disintegration}} of the Soviet empire, the independence of Ukraine {{has become one of the}} most significant geopolitical factors for the security and stability of Europe. To a great extent, the future European security order depends on Ukraine's security option in the new Europe. While cognizant of other security options, for instance, to integrate in the West or to join the pro-Russian security treaty of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Ukraine has defined itself as neutral. In its security policy, Ukraine intends to participate in Europe's major institutions, to develop close relations with its strategic partners and neighbors, and to maintain constructive relations with Russia. The process of Ukraine's self definition in a <b>new</b> <b>European</b> security <b>architecture</b> promises to continue to present great challenges.

40|$|Artificial {{intelligent}} {{methods are}} increasingly used within {{computer integrated manufacturing}} (CIM) applications. Real-time expert system environments are good tools to develop intelligent controllers. The {{first part of this}} paper summarises some problems of the application of artificial intelligence and expert systems within the CIM area. Then a <b>new</b> open <b>European</b> CNC <b>architecture</b> (OSACA) is introduced.

40|$|Published online: 29 October 2009 In November 2008, {{while the}} world {{financial}} crisis was still evolving, the European Commission tasked a High Level Group chaired by Mr. Jacques de Larosière[1] with proposing a new financial supervision <b>architecture</b> for <b>European</b> financial markets. [2] The High Level Group published its report (the Larosière Report) in February 2009, recommending {{the creation of a}} <b>new</b> <b>European</b> macro-prudential supervisory body and the establishment of a <b>new</b> <b>European</b> micro-prudential supervisory system. These recommendations were meant to strengthen the European financial supervisory framework and increase the financial stability of the European Union. [4] On May 27, 2009, the European Commission published a communication supporting the 'main thrust' of the recommendations found in the Larosière Report. [5] Additionally, in their June meetings, both the Council of the European Union[6] and the European Council[7] indicated their support of the Communication’s main proposals. This consensus has prompted the movement towards a <b>new</b> <b>European</b> financial supervision <b>architecture...</b>|$|R
40|$|Europe's {{current crisis}} {{is also a}} crisis of the European city. Economic, social, and {{political}} insecurities have changed our perception of territories, institutions, and forms of living, and have dramatically weakened the complex interactions within Europe. They have also compromised the reshaping of our physical landscape. Yet, the crisis is also creating new opportunities—for urban transformation, urban practices, and forms of participation. Based on case studies from Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, and Switzerland, Territories in Crisis describes the countless challenges faced by European Cities from historical, sociological, and economic perspectives and sets them in relation to existing and potential forms of urbanity. Territories in Crisis aims to develop a <b>new</b> <b>European</b> framework for <b>architecture</b> and urban planning {{in the era of}} crisi...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the protection of}} personal data in the European Union {{in the context of}} the fight against international terrorism taking into account the <b>new</b> <b>European</b> Union <b>architecture</b> provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon. After having delineated the European legal background concerning the right to privacy, the author examines the Passenger Name Records (PNR) Agreements concluded by the European Union with the United States, Canada and Australia. A further object of analysis is the 2007 proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the use of PNR data for law enforcement purposes, which is aimed at creating an autonomous PNR system in the European Union. The author considers that these instruments are likely to violate rights and fundamental freedoms of individuals, in particular the right to privacy. This is also due to the <b>architecture</b> of the <b>European</b> Union, whose structure is incapable of adequately and completely protecting the right to personal data protection. As a consequence, the author proposes solutions to modify PNR instruments, especially in light of the future changes that the Treaty of Lisbon will make to the structure of the European Union...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze {{the state of the}} art of macroprudential {{policies}} (MAP) with a focus on the case of the European Union. To this end the institutional framework of MAP is introduced and discussed with regard to several issues: the relationships and/or the conflicts with other policies and among the different institutional bodies involved, their mandate, accountability and governance. The operative framework - intermediate and final targets and toolkit - is specifically analyzed with regard to the case of the European Union and the introduction, in 2011, of a macroprudential supervisory pillar based on the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). Finally the main features of the <b>new</b> <b>European</b> supervisory <b>architecture</b> are addressed: the organization of MAP within the Single Supervisory Mechanisms (SSM), the definition of the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) and of the ESRB as far as macroprudential policy is concerned. In the conclusions, we evaluate the new architecture which is quite complex and cumbersome, and the challenge that the SSM is facing: to achieve comprehensive, rational, effective and efficient supervision, avoiding overlapping of competences and clarifying the specific roles of different bodies while keeping away additional burdens for the institutions supervised...|$|R
40|$|On June 18, 2004, {{the heads}} of European governments and states agreed on a new “Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe”. The {{historic}} agreement has many legally recognized elements, one of which involves formulating a <b>new</b> <b>European</b> institutional <b>architecture.</b> This will affect {{the balance of power}} and determine how decisions are taken. This paper illuminates the subject matter by examining the debate on institutional reforms in the EU and the constitutional aspects of enlargement. How does the communication between the agents that formulate the European Constitution affect the development of supranational governance? I present an innovative model that is derived from the international relations discipline. I argue that there are three-level games that formulate European policy, comprised by national preferences, intergovernmental bargaining, and the existence of a transnational epistemic community. I conclude that the “Convention on the Future of Europe ” has indeed acted as a transnational epistemic community, despite its intergovernmental nature that reflected the various national domestic preferences. However, in the short term, while most of the Convention’s proposals have been implemented within the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) constitution agreement, this settlement has not altered the centrality of national governments in most areas. Yet, in the long term, the Convention did succeed in innovating new institutions that would naturally direct the Union toward a supranational entity...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} post-war years Belgium {{emerged as a}} {{convinced}} supporter of Western European defence arrangements under British leadership. Only in 1947 did Belgium gradually discover a privileged partner in the United States, though initially only at the economic and financial level. It would take till the summer of 1948 before Belgian diplomacy shelved its post-war project for European defence and signed up to an Atlantic alliance. In the decades that followed, Belgium proved itself a loyal NATO partner. Nevertheless, the good relations between Brussels and Washington did not prevent profound crises disturbing the calm now and then. Moreover, unlike the Netherlands, Belgium was to make its own original contribution to détente between East and West. The fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, and the implosion of the Soviet Union, in 1991, brought {{an end to the}} Cold War and to the bipolar world order. This led to a debate about <b>new</b> <b>European</b> defence <b>architecture</b> in all the NATO countries, including Belgium, now the continent was no longer divided between East and West. In Belgium the debate was settled fairly quickly when the body politic, across party borders, returned to the original European defence option Paul-Henri Spaak had championed from 1945 to 1948. Combining European primacy and autonomy in the field of defence with Atlantic loyalty became a balancing act that turned out not always to be easy...|$|R
40|$|Borders {{and border}} regions receive a special {{attention}} in the <b>new</b> post- 1989 <b>European</b> <b>architecture</b> characterized by the processes of integration, transition and enlargement. What is actually happening to borders and border regions within this new environment? Are borders being abolished, weakened or are they being reproduced under a different pattern? What are the determinant factors which define the level and type of cross border interaction? This paper attempts to shed some light into the dynamics, perceptions and the new challenges concerning the "border phenomenon 2 ̆ 01 d.
