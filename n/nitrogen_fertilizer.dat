5|$|The {{properties}} of heavy water {{had been discovered}} in 1932 by Harold Urey. In 1933, Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun, the head of Norsk Hydro Rjukan, created a plan for industrial production of heavy water in Norway. As Norsk Hydro were already producing ammonia for <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> Tronstad and Brun had realized that large amounts of electrolyzed water were available. Tronstad was paid by Norsk Hydro as a consultant. Already in 1934, Norsk Hydro had opened a plant near the power station at Vemork. This was the world's first plant for industrial mass production of heavy water. Both French and German scientists expressed interest in the project.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen is {{the most}} {{important}} essential nutrient that {{plays a major role in}} achieving maximum crop yield in agriculture. Therefore, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizers</b> such as ammonium sulfate and urea have been extensively used in modern agriculture. These fertilizers are generally oxidized to nitrate via nitrite by nitrifying microorganisms in the agricultural field (4, 10, 11). The serious environmental problems associated with the use of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are nitrate contamination of ground and surface water due to nitrate leaching and loss from the agricultural field (15). For these reasons, controlled-release <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizers</b> have been developed to enable a slow release of nitrogen into the soil during the crop-growing season. The use of controlled-release <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizers</b> is mainly based on the principle of nitrogen utilization effi-ciency for crop production. However, in the current issue...|$|R

There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields. In order to provide more organic matter, a cover crop of wheat or rye is planted in the winter before planting the strawberries. Strawberries prefer a pH from 5.5 to 6.5 so lime is usually not applied.|$|E
25|$|Indirect {{consumption}} is mainly {{oil and natural}} gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002. The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizer</b> can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by The Royal Society, agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location. The energy used to manufacture farm machinery is also a form of indirect agricultural energy consumption. Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years. Food systems encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.|$|E
25|$|Rice pests are any organisms or {{microbes}} {{with the}} potential to reduce the yield or value of the rice crop (or of rice seeds). Rice pests include weeds, pathogens, insects, nematode, rodents, and birds. A variety of factors can contribute to pest outbreaks, including climatic factors, improper irrigation, the overuse of insecticides and high rates of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application. Weather conditions also contribute to pest outbreaks. For example, rice gall midge and army worm outbreaks tend to follow periods of high rainfall early in the wet season, while thrips outbreaks are associated with drought.|$|E

25|$|The nitrogen-rich {{compounds}} {{found in}} fertilizer runoff {{are the primary}} cause of serious oxygen depletion in many parts of oceans, especially in coastal zones, lakes and rivers. The resulting lack of dissolved oxygen greatly reduces the ability of these areas to sustain oceanic fauna. The number of oceanic dead zones near inhabited coastlines are increasing. As of 2006, the application of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizer</b> is being increasingly controlled in northwestern Europe and the United States.

The researches took place of the experimental plot of scientific industrial union of tea, subtropical cultures and tea industry in Anaseuli. In order to determine the influence of the norms of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizers</b> on the accumulation of nitrates, we used ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate on the background of P, K, Ca, Mg with the dozes – 75, 150, 300, 450  g per tree, following all the agricultural rules. And from the forms of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizers</b> on the accumulation of nitrates, on the background of P, K, Ca, Mg we used ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium carbonate, Montanus nitrate and sodium nitrate.

25|$|Due {{to their}} very high {{solubility}} and because soils are highly unable to retain anions, nitrates can enter groundwater. Elevated nitrate in groundwater {{is a concern}} for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause methemoglobinemia or blue-baby syndrome. Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to eutrophication, a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizer</b> has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring {{along the same lines}} as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.|$|E
25|$|Dwarfing is an {{important}} agronomic quality for wheat; dwarf plants produce thick stems. The cultivars Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. Taller wheat grasses better compete for sunlight, but tend to collapse {{under the weight of}} the extra grain—a trait called lodging—from the rapid growth spurts induced by <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizer</b> Borlaug used in the poor soil. To prevent this, he bred wheat to favor shorter, stronger stalks that could better support larger seed heads. In 1953, he acquired a Japanese dwarf variety of wheat called Norin 10 developed by Orville Vogel, that had been crossed with a high-yielding American cultivar called Brevor 14. Norin 10/Brevor 14 is semi-dwarf (one-half to two-thirds the height of standard varieties) and produces more stalks and thus more heads of grain per plant. Also, larger amounts of assimilate were partitioned into the actual grains, further increasing the yield. Borlaug crossbred the semi-dwarf Norin 10/Brevor 14 cultivar with his disease-resistant cultivars to produce wheat varieties that were adapted to tropical and sub-tropical climates.|$|E
25|$|Crops do not end {{up using}} all of the {{synthetic}} fertilizer it is fed. The remainder ends up polluting surrounding land. Some of it will evaporate into the air where it will acidify the rain and produce greenhouse gases. It will also seep into the groundwater or run off into nearby bodies of water, thus polluting the drinking water of nearby communities. Poor soil health resulting from overproduction, excessive fertilizer use and inappropriate application of fertilizer causes runoff and leaching. Runoff into forests or marine areas can alter the ecosystem by fertilizing some plan species and poisoning others. The result of toxic runoff from commodity agriculture surrounding the Mississippi River {{can be seen at}} the hypoxic zone where the river meets the Gulf of Mexico. Here, algae grow rampant as a result of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizer</b> runoff thereby suffocating the animal life. This area has not reduced in size despite previous action plans for reduction made by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force.
