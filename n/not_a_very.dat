5|$|He was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good {{businessman}} and although his fame grew statewide, his wealth never swelled to match until he became {{director of the}} Connecticut Retreat. In 1796, shortly after starting his work in Farmington, he married Rachel Hills. In the same year, his half-brother Michael died at sea. In 1797, his sister Polly died of spotted fever. His mother died in 1806. In 1811, Rachel's brother Reuben died, and Todd and his wife adopted his two daughters Theresa and Jennet. Rachel died in 1825, and Todd subsequently married her younger sister, Catherine. She would outlive him by 33 years, dying herself in 1866.|$|E

5|$|Mickiewicz and {{his family}} lived in {{relative}} poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, {{but not enough to}} substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also less visible on the Polish émigré political scene.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E

5|$|Słowacki was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular {{figure in}} Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, {{which can be}} seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E
5|$|He went {{one better}} at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he beat Fernando Meligeni to win the bronze medal, thus {{becoming}} the first Indian to win an individual medal since KD Jadhav won bronze at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics {{more than four decades}} earlier. Paes cited the match as one of his greatest performances on the court, in part because his wrist was severely injured. He was awarded the highest sporting honour by the government of India, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1996. His first successful year in the ATP circuit came in 1993, when he partnered Sébastien Lareau to reach the US Open doubles semifinal. After having a moderate season in 1994, he reached the quarter-finals of the 1995 Australian Open doubles with Kevin Ullyett. From 1996, he partnered with fellow-Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, which would prove to be a winning combination. Their first year was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful one, especially in the Grand Slams, with a round of 32 finish at Wimbledon being the best. 1997 proved to be a much better year for the team of Paes and Bhupathi, with the semifinals of the US Open their best Grand Slam result. Paes climbed the doubles ranking from no. 89 {{at the beginning of the}} year to no. 14 at the end of the year. That year he also made his best singles performance in a Grand Slam, getting to the third round of the 1997 US Open, beating Carlos Costa and Arnaud Boetsch before losing to Cédric Pioline.|$|E
