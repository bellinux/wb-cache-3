5|$|Despite {{holding a}} {{monopoly}} on cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King's Bench. Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work, {{there is evidence of}} Serjeants who did not; one, Robert Mennell, worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster, where the Common Pleas was located. This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts, many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas, a court of equity. This period was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of success for the profession overall, however, despite the brisk business being done. The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work, drawing it away from the Serjeants, {{and at the same time}} the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas, allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates.|$|E

[...] He carries a {{feathered}} spear or [...] "dart", a weapon often used in hunting in the 16th century. The leads of his three hounds are wound around his arm at right. Under the trees behind them at left Cupid lies asleep, with his bow and quiver of arrows hanging from a tree; this is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> for love. [...] High in the sky, a figure rides a chariot; this is either Venus from later in the story, or Apollo or Sol, representing the dawn. [...] Venus sits on a rock covered with a rich tablecloth with gold braid edges and buttons (not a military jacket, as sometimes thought). [...] Adonis has a horn hanging from his belt; his dress is classical, taken from Roman sculptures.|$|E

2500|$|He {{maintained}} that God {{was always a}} creator, and there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when he was non-creative (u-rā ṣonʿ nabud) before He turned into being creative. [...] According to him, it is requisite that He always be creator, then {{it is necessary for}} that in which His creation appeared to be eternal (qadim). [...] His creation makes its appearance (padid-āyanda ast) in Matter (hayulā), and therefore, Matter, a sign of the apparent power of God, is eternal; and since Matter, which is eternal, requires the existence of Space (makān), it follows that Space should be eternal too. [...] His ideas on time were that [...] time, world, and duration (zamān dahr wa moddat) are names whose meanings are derived from the same substance (jawhar). [...] He also philosophized that Time, a substance in motion and restless (jawhar-e ravanda wa biqarār), is the sign of God’s knowledge, {{in the same way that}} Space is the sign of His power; motion is the sign of His action, and the being (jesm) is the sign of His ability, and every one of these signs is infinite and eternal.|$|E
2500|$|According to Cernat, his {{articles}} for Integral show Fondane {{as an ally}} of the [...] "anti-political" [...] and lyrical side of Surrealism, a poet placing his trust in [...] "the negative-soteriological, liberating function of poetry". The impact of existentialist philosophy was even traced to the [...] "cine-poems" [...] by Martin Stanton (who called the pieces [...] "amazing"). In contrast to the Surrealists, Fondane {{did not believe in}} a need to circulate poems as universal messages, but rather saw them as the basis for a very personal relationship with the reader: [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> for print. Poetry is seeking its friends, not an audience. [...] Poetry will be for the few—or it will not be at all." [...] Chitrit, who parallels Fondane's definitions with the similar views of Romanian poet and Holocaust survivor Paul Celan, concludes: [...] "This is probably the closest that we can come to seeing contemporary poetry." [...] Fondane's other literary works also evidence the impact of his philosophical preoccupations. With Le Féstin de Balthazar, the writer modified his earlier Monologul by adopting Shestivist themes (introducing allegorical characters who discuss Aristotelianism, capitalism and revolution) and by introducing some elements from the burlesque. Originally conceived in 1918 and completed in 1933, Philoctète reworked Sophocles' play of the same title, interpreting it through the style of Gide's dramas.|$|E

The single [...] "California" [...] failed to be commercially successful, but [...] "Storm", featuring Jay-Z, reached the charts. [...] "Calling All Angels" [...] was successful in various countries and a huge hit in Brazil, however it was [...] "Lady" [...] that became the album's surprise hit, making the US Top 30 and propelling Baptism to gold status. Also in 2004, he appeared on N.E.R.D's album Fly or Die. From March 2005, Kravitz toured {{all over the world}} with the tour Electric Church, which ended at the Brixton Academy, London in July 2005. Kravitz served as the opening act for Aerosmith who are long term friends of Kravitz on their fall 2005 tour. The tour began on October 30 at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut. The night before that tour started, October 29, 2005, Lenny's father, TV producer Seymour [...] "Sy" [...] Kravitz, died. During that first show, Lenny broke the news to the stunned crowd and stated it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> to be sad, but rather a time to celebrate because he is now in Heaven. Lenny then dedicated Let Love Rule to his father. That tour was so successful that it was extended through February 25, 2006 and ended in Anaheim, California.|$|E
