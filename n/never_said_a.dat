5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
25|$|The Lausanne conference {{convened in}} late 1922 {{to settle the}} terms of a new treaty that would take the place of the Treaty of Sèvres. Inönü became famous for his {{stubborn}} resolve in determining Ankara's position as the legitimate, sovereign government of Turkey. After delivering his position, Inönü turned off his hearing aid during the speeches of British foreign secretary Lord Curzon. When the secretary had finished, Inönü reiterated his position as if Lord Curzon had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> word.|$|E
500|$|As a person, West {{was often}} {{described}} as an introverted and nervous character, but who also drew highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic. Regarding his shyness, WVU roommate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year, and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled a two-week period when his guard <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> word. Apart from being shy, West was always restless: Schaus described him as a [...] "bundle of nerves", Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy as [...] "always on the move", and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits, West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled. His first wife Martha Kane recalled that her husband often had difficulties opening up to her. After a big loss, the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him, but West would say [...] "get out" [...] at the home porch and drive away—an experience that [...] "killed" [...] her as a wife.|$|E

2500|$|For a long time, she {{has been}} {{reluctant}} to endorse Donald Trump, while other European populists had already embraced his candidacy, and only supported him by saying: [...] "For France, anything is better than Hillary Clinton". However, on 8 November 2016 she posted a tweet congratulating Trump on his presidential victory. Nevertheless, her strategy has difficulties as her image seems to remain controversial: Germany's Angela Merkel has said she [...] "will contribute to make other political forces stronger than the National Front" [...] and Israel still holds a bad opinion of her party. Nigel Farage has said: [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> bad word about Marine Le Pen; I've <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> good word about her party".|$|E
2500|$|Bunin {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in international myths and folklore, {{as well as}} the Russian folkloric tradition. But, (according to Georgy Adamovich) [...] "he was absolutely intolerant towards those of his colleagues who employed stylizations, the [...] "style Russe" [...] manufacturers. His cruel– and rightly so– review of Sergey Gorodetsky's poetry was one example. Even Blok's Kulikovo Field (for me, an outstanding piece) irritated him as too lavishly adorned... "That's Vasnetsov," [...] he commented, meaning 'masquerade and opera'. But he treated things that he felt were not masqueradery differently. Of the Slovo o Polku Igoreve... he said something to the effect that all the poets of the whole world lumped together couldn't have created such wonder, in fact something close to Pushkin's words. Yet translations of the legend... outraged him, particularly that of Balmont. He despised Shmelyov for his pseudo-Russian pretenses, though admitting his literary gift. Bunin had an extraordinarily sharp ear for falseness: he instantly recognized this jarring note and was infuriated. That was why he loved Tolstoy so much. Once, I remember, he spoke of Tolstoy as the one 'who's <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> single word that would be an exaggeration'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{appropriately}} for a cold war, {{the relationship}} between the East and West German border guards and officials was frosty. As a Bayerische Grenzpolizei report of 1968 noted, [...] "the conduct of the Soviet zone [...] border troops continued unfriendly and uncooperative. Officers and officials only sought contact to obtain information about refugees or to influence the border population with their propaganda." [...] There was very little official face-to-face interaction between the two sides on the ground, as the East German border guards were under orders not to speak to Westerners. Klaus Grünzner, a former West German border guard, later recalled: [...] "I served ... for eight years and the East German police <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> single word to us, except in 1974 during the World Cup, when East Germany beat us. One of the guards shouted at us: 'Sparwasser [...] really socked it to you!'" [...] After the initiation of détente between East and West Germany in the 1970s, the two sides established procedures for maintaining formal contacts through fourteen direct telephone connections or Grenzinformationspunkt (GIP, [...] "border information point"). They were used to resolve local problems affecting the border, such as floods, forest fires or stray animals.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1997, {{the press}} {{revealed}} that after 13 years playing Kathy, Gillian Taylforth had {{opted not to}} renew her contract when it expired in March 1998. Taylforth commented, [...] "I love EastEnders, it's in my blood. But after 12 years I want {{a bit of a}} change. I want {{to spend more time with}} my family and consider other offers. It was an extremely difficult decision to make but I felt this was the best time to go. I've had alternative job offers in the past, but I've always stuck with EastEnders. It's been brilliant for me and I will miss it hugely." [...] At the time, a BBC spokesperson would not confirm the departure saying, [...] "Gilly is in discussions about taking a possible break. It is the policy that long-serving, valued, senior cast members are eligible for such breaks." [...] However, her departure was later confirmed, with Taylforth saying that she made the decision to quit after she missed her daughter's sports day due to filming commitments on set. Barbara Windsor, who plays Kathy's mother-in-law Peggy Mitchell, said: [...] "This is really sad. Gill is a wonderful actress and a very good friend." [...] Steve McFadden, who plays Kathy's estranged husband Phil Mitchell, said: [...] "I can't believe it. I've been with her all day and she <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{career at}} the Met, however, was not without its ups-and-downs. Flagstad got {{involved}} in a long-running feud with tenor co-star Lauritz Melchior after Melchior took offense to some comments Flagstad made about [...] "stupid publicity photos" [...] during a game of bridge in Flagstad's hotel suite while the two were on tour together in Rochester, NY. Present during the infamous bridge game were Flagstad, Melchior and his wife, and Edwin McArthur. Afterwards, Melchior fanned the flames further by insisting that there be no solo curtain calls for Flagstad when the two performed together. Audiences had no clue that, despite the marvelous and sometimes historic performances, the two <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> word to each other off stage {{for the next two}} years. It was Flagstad's husband Henry Johansen who finally brought the two together to make peace. Flagstad also feuded with the Met's general manager, Edward Johnson, after conductor Artur Bodanzky's death, when she asked to be conducted for a few performances by her accompanist, Edwin McArthur, rather than by the Met's new conductor Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad had wanted this for McArthur, whom she had taken under her wing. Johnson refused and would not hear of it any further. Flagstad did get her way, though; she went over Johnson's head and discussed the matter with the Met's board of directors, particularly David Sarnoff, RCA and NBC founder and chairman. It was Sarnoff who made the arrangements for McArthur to begin conducting Met productions on a limited basis. Her relationship with Johnson improved, however; just before Flagstad left the Met in 1941, on the night of her 100th performance of Isolde ...|$|E
