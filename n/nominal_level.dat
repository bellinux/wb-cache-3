Blow signed up with Microsoft to release the game on Xbox Live in mid-2007, with that version officially announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process, as he believed the effort to meet all the requirements could have been better spent on polishing the game. At the same time, the certification team allowed him to retain certain aspects of his vision for the game that were otherwise contrary to the process, including giving the player immediate control of the game instead of requiring a start-up title screen. Microsoft also requested that Blow include some additional hints to the player based on results of playtesting, but Blow held his ground, refusing to release the game if {{he was forced to}} add these. He said he would likely not release a game again on the Xbox Live service under the same business model. Blow later released a Braid theme for Xbox Live; though he wanted to release this theme for free, Microsoft required the theme to be priced at a <b>nominal</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

There Taylor asked {{for an end to}} the persistent changes in leadership, and Khánh and his men assured him of stability. Westmoreland warned that persistent instability would turn the American political class and public against Saigon, as they would deem it useless to support such a regime. Taylor initially cabled the State Department back in the US to state a [...] "naked military fist" [...] had [...] "crumpled [...] carefully woven fabric of civilian government", and that the arrest of the civilians would be [...] "immediately and understandably interpreted by all the world as another military coup, setting back all that had been accomplished" [...] since the formation of the HNC and the creation of a veneer of civilian rule. He went on to say that an [...] "inescapable conclusion that if a group of military officers could issue decisions abolishing one of the three fundamental organs of the governmental structure...and carry out military arrests of civilians, that group of military officers has clearly set themselves above and beyond the structure of government in Vietnam." [...] Taylor bemoaned the fact that the generals had shown no second thoughts about ignoring US policy recommendations, particularly in disregarding his explicit advice to maintain stable civilian rule, at least at a <b>nominal</b> <b>level.</b> Taylor issued a thinly disguised threat to cut aid, releasing a public statement saying Washington might reconsider its military funding if [...] "the fabric of legal government" [...] was not reinstated.|$|E

We applied WASSP to test problems designed specifically to explore its efficiency and robustness in comparison with ASAP 3 and the Heidelberger-Welch algorithm, two sequential procedures based respectively on the methods of nonoverlapping batch means and spectral analysis. Concerning efficiency, WASSP compared favorably with its competitors, often requiring smaller sample sizes to deliver confidence intervals with the same <b>nominal</b> <b>levels</b> of precision and coverage probability. Concerning robustness against the statistical anomalies commonly encountered in simulation studies, WASSP outperformed its competitors, delivering confidence intervals whose actual half-lengths and coverage probabilities were frequently closer to the corresponding user-specified <b>nominal</b> <b>levels.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} modelling for interval data is proposed, {{assuming a}} multivariate Normal or Skew-Normal {{distribution for the}} midpoints and log-ranges of the interval variables. The intrinsic nature of the interval variables leads to special structures of the variance–covariance matrix, which is represented by five different possible configurations. Maximum likelihood estimation for both models under all considered configurations is studied. The proposed modelling is then considered {{in the context of}} analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance testing. To access the behaviour of the proposed methodology, a simulation study is performed. The results show that, for medium or large sample sizes, tests have good power and their true significance <b>level</b> approaches <b>nominal</b> <b>levels</b> when the constraints assumed for the model are respected; however, for small samples, sizes close to <b>nominal</b> <b>levels</b> cannot be guaranteed.
