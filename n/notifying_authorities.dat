50|$|Russell W. Brothers, Jr., a Nashville businessman, was {{familiar}} with Cornelia Fort Airpark and at one time lived there. At age 75, Brothers was flying a private plane solo at night from Miami, Florida to Dickson, Tennessee on April 20, 2012. After trouble with the landing grear, he made crash-landing in his 1961 vintage twin-engine Beechcraft airplane at the Cornelia Fort Airpark which was closed at the time. Without landing gear, he made a belly landing on a grassy area. The landing was not violent enough to trigger an alert signal by the airplane's automatic crash locator. Brothers was not injured and left the scene without <b>notifying</b> <b>authorities.</b> His wife picked him up, and he left the plane there as a mystery. A maintenance worker later saw it, but did not alert authorities until the following morning. The police traced the plane to Brothers and searched his home, where they found 16 firearms. Since he had a prior conviction as a felon 24 years previously, it was unlawful for Brothers to possess firearms. Subsequently, {{he was convicted of}} unlawful possession of firearms and obstruction of justice. Brothers pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to the weapons charge and also to obstruction of a federal investigation, receiving a 15-month jail sentence.|$|E

The research was done on 50 businesses in the retail sector in Gweru. The findings are that minimal efforts are being {{put in place to}} enforce compliance, and corruption levels are high among the tax collection officials. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) evade compliance by paying bribes, keeping two sets of records, relocating to new premises without <b>notifying</b> <b>authorities,</b> and temporarily closing businesses during compliance blitz. Penalties {{have been found to be}} the most effective in enforcing compliance. Publicity should be increased by authorities using radio, television, and pamphlets, which were found to be most effective. In addition, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) should give business people more formal tax education to enhance understanding of tax obligations and compliance...|$|E

40|$|Litter, or {{misplaced}} {{waste and}} trash, {{is one of}} the predominant causes of environmental pollution. It is a major contributor to soil and water pollution and has a devastating effect on agriculture. Litter pollutes irrigation water, damages soil composition and contributes to climate change which causes changes in weather patterns. Other adverse effects include damage to natural vegetation and wildlife, outbreaks of disease resulting in the loss of human lives and damage to national heritage sites. Public littering has become an escalating problem in Sri Lanka. However little is being done to mitigate the situation. The main reason for the lack of solutions is the amount of man power needed to constantly monitor public locations for instances of littering. Even though there is a certain percentage of the population willing to contribute to handling the situation they have no direct method of <b>notifying</b> <b>authorities</b> of such cases. The Public Littering Monitoring System proposed in this paper is an approach to utilize the assistance of the general public to continuously monitor instances of littering in public locations. Photographs of cases of public littering, taken at their respective locations by members of the general public is uploaded to the system via a publicly available website as input. The system will process these inputs and recommend the most critical cases of littering based on various criteria so that administrative users can take necessary action to control the situation...|$|E
40|$|First Place {{winner of}} non-oral presentations at the 4 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) {{held at the}} Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 25, 2008. Research {{completed}} at the Department of Physician Assistant, College of Health ProfessionsTo increase patient access, the FDA recently approved OTC sale of emergency contraception (EC) however increased access {{may not have been}} achieved due to pharmacists refusing to sell the product. Purpose: Measure knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of KS pharmacists regarding EC. Methods: A survey with 46 items assessing respondent characteristics, knowledge, and attitudes/beliefs was mailed to all 2, 601 registered KS pharmacists. Results: A total of 22. 4 % of pharmacists responded, n= 583. The overall mean knowledge score was 57 % ± 20, however scores were higher in persons working in settings where EC is sold, 46 % ± 21 vs. 61 % ± 18, p< 0. 001. The knowledge question with the lowest accuracy, 28 %, asked about <b>notifying</b> <b>authorities</b> in cases of sexual assault. Only 37 % correctly identified the primary mechanism of action as delaying/preventing ovulation. A majority of pharmacists would dispense EC in cases of rape (80 %), incest (79 %), and regardless of the situation (62 %). However, many expressed concerns including its use as a regular form of birth control (44 %), medical liability (41 %), and promoting unsafe sex (37 %). Religious and political views significantly affected willingness to dispense. Conclusion: Overall, knowledge of KS pharmacists regarding EC is low and should be strengthened. While the majority of pharmacists are willing to dispense EC, a significant number did express concerns indicating this may be causing some professional ethical stress deserving of statewide discussion...|$|E
40|$|While the Model Penal Code was {{certainly}} one {{the most influential}} developments in criminal law in the past century, the American Law Institute (ALI) took a seriously wrong turn by recognizing a defense of “renunciation” to the crime of conspiracy. Under the Model Penal Code formulation, {{a member of a}} conspiracy who later disavows the agreement and thwarts its objective (for example, by <b>notifying</b> <b>authorities</b> of the planned crime in order to prevent its completion) is afforded a complete defense to conspiracy liability. This defense has enormous implications for crimes involving national security and terrorism, which are typically planned covertly and involve extensive coordination among multiple actors. Many states follow the Model Penal Code approach and recognize the renunciation defense, without defining its precise contours or limits. Other states are still struggling with the issue, and have yet to accept or reject the renunciation doctrine. After surveying state and federal law across the United States, the authors unpack proposed policy arguments for and against the renunciation defense. The authors conclude that none of the pragmatic justifications advanced by the ALI in support of the doctrine survive close scrutiny. Moreover, renunciation is theoretically inconsistent with the social harm caused by an actor’s participation in a conspiracy, in contrast to the absence of harm present with other inchoate offenses such as incomplete attempts. In the authors’ view, renunciation is best understood historically as a special form of legislative grace designed to counteract some of the harsher aspects of conspiracy law. The authors argue that states grappling with this issue should decline to recognize a renunciation defense, and instead focus their attention on eliminating some of the more notable inequities of conspiracy liability...|$|E
