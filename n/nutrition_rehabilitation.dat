40|$|Abstract: COPD is a {{progressive}} illness with worldwide impact. Patients invariably {{reach a point}} at which they require palliative interventions. Dyspnea is the most distressing symptom experienced by these patients; when not relieved by traditional COPD management strategies it is termed “refractory dyspnea ” and palliative approaches are required. The focus of care shifts from prolonging survival to reducing symptoms, increasing function, and improving quality of life. Numerous pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions can achieve these goals, though evidence supporting their use is variable. This review provides a summary of the options for the management of refractory dyspnea in COPD, outlining currently available evidence and highlighting areas for further investigation.

The present study aimed to describe nutritional status and food consumption in stroke patients within 2  weeks of hospital admission and before discharge, as well as to investigate the effects of nutritional and dietary factors on rehabilitation outcomes. Methods:  One hundred patients from a consecutive cohort admitted to a metropolitan hospital with acute stroke were recruited and assessed by a single researcher, with 38 reassessed at discharge. Nutritional status was assessed using Mini-Nutritional Assessment and anthropometric indices and dietary intake was assessed by 1 -day weighed dietary records. Rehabilitation outcomes were changes in Barthel index scores and the rehabilitation efficiency index. Results:  Few (n =  9; 10 %) consumed ≥ 100 % of the estimated average requirement (EAR) for energy within 2  weeks of admission and 13 (33 %) had energy intakes < 50 % of EAR before discharge. A small but increasing proportion (7 % at admission, 13 % at discharge) were identified as being malnourished across the inpatient stay. Younger age, lower Barthel index and a higher energy intake in the early stages of admission predicted the extent and rate of restoration of functional abilities by discharge (F =  7. 503, P =  0. 001; F =  14. 558, P <  0. 001).

40|$|Cancer is a {{systemic}} disease {{that can affect}} nearly every organ in the body, resulting in a progressive loss of organ function. That loss of function may be initially slow, having minimal effect, {{or it may be}} rapid, resulting in more dramatic changes. The usual medical management of patients with cancer has focused more specifically on the administration of cytotoxic treatments. These treatments can potentially eradicate or minimize the tumour, but they may also have toxic side effects that in turn can also affect the patient. Cancer rehabilitation is a process that assists the individual with a cancer diagnosis to obtain optimal physical, social, psychological, and vocational functioning within the limits created by the disease and its treatment. The McGill Cancer <b>Nutrition</b> and <b>Rehabilitation</b> (CNR) program developed {{as a result of the}} everincreasing demand for a focus on addressing individual cancer patients and their needs, as well as on achieving optimal tumour-related outcomes.

40|$|Background. Fatigue is a {{debilitating}} consequence {{of lung cancer}} and its treatments. Reviewing the literature in cancer-related fatigue provides few etiological factors, making evidence-based interventions limited. In this study, previously identified factors as well as muscular and cardiorespiratory function were assessed as potential contributors to fatigue in stages 3 A/B and 4 NSCLC patients. Methods. Participants were evaluated by a physical therapist within the McGill Cancer <b>Nutrition</b> and <b>Rehabilitation</b> Program. Performance-based measures of physical function [upper limb strength and endurance (Jamar dynamometry), lower limb strength (30 sec chair rise), cardiorespiratory function (2 minute walk - 2 MW) ] and a symptom questionnaire (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale) were conducted {{at one point in}} time. The primary endpoint of global fatigue rating was assessed using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). Results. Fifty-eight patients (30 M: 28 F, mean age 68 +/- 12) participated in the study. Forty-three percent were actively receiving treatment at the time of assessment. On the BFI, 67 % had moderate or severe fatigue and 84 % indicated fatigue had interfered with their functioning during the past 24 hours. Global fatigue scores were unrelated to hand grip strength or endurance measurements, hematological parameters or sleep quality but were significantly correlated with chair rise performance, overall rating of breathlessness, patient rating of pain and patient rated weakness. Multivariate regression analysis suggested the best model for global fatigue scores incorporates patients' ratings of weakness, breathlessness and chair rise performance. Conclusions. Fatigue is prevalent and impacts on the function of advanced NSCLC patients. Several key factors contribute to this fatigue, with muscular and cardiorespiratory restrictions playing an important role. Such findings may have clinical implications in the recommendations of rest and exercise to best manage fatigue...|$|R

Doctor-patient relationship intervenes on the adherence of these advices. For hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, overweight and obesity, our study’s aim was to analyse the associations between the quality of the doctor-patient communication, evaluated in 2013, and patients’ adherence to their general practitioner (GP) ’s nutritional advices, between 2008 and 2013. Methods Performed by the National Institute of Cardiac Surgery and Interventional Cardiology in Luxembourg, 4391 patients were contacted. Five years after a coronary angiography, 1289 completed a self-rating questionnaire assessing the GP’Com- 5 items scale (Cronbach 0. 87). The variables were analysed with a multiple logistic regression model. Results Patients declared that 57. 9 % reduced or stopped their {{consumption of}} salt intake, whereas 65 % increased their consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables. Around 37 % of the patients reported having made changes following the advice of their doctor. An increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables was linked with the quality of doctor-patient communication when patients were hypertension (odd ratio (OR) = 1. 084, IC 95 %, [1. 017 - 1. 157]), overweight (1. 081 [1. 013 - 1. 155]), obesity (OR = 1. 130 [1. 056 - 1. 209]), hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1. 102 [1. 033 – 1. 175]) and diabetes (OR = 1. 103 [1. 029 - 1. 181]). The decreased of salt intake consumption was associated with the quality of physician-patient communication when the patient was hypertension (OR = 1. 102 [1. 034 – 1. 176]).

40|$|Background: Management {{of acute}} severe {{malnutrition}} greatly {{contributes to the}} reduction of childhood mortality rate. In developing countries, where malnutrition is common, number of acute severe malnutrition cases exceeds inpatient treatment capacity. Recent success of community-based therapeutic care put back on agenda the management of acute severe malnutrition. We analysed key issues of inpatient management of severe malnutrition to suggest appropriate global approach. Methods: Data of 1322 malnourished children, admitted in an urban nutritional rehabilitation center, in Burkina Faso, from 1999 to 2003 were analyzed. The nutritional status was assessed using anthropometrics indexes. Association between mortality and variables was measured by relative risks. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox model were used. Results: From the 1322 hospitalized children, 8. 5 % dropped out. Daily weight gain was 10. 18 (± 7. 05) g/kg/d. Among hospitalized malnourished children, 16 % died. Patients were {{at high risk of}} early death, as 80 % of deaths occurred during the first week. The risk of dying was highest among the severely malnourished: weight-for-heigh < - 4 standard deviation (SD), RR = 2. 55 P < 0, 001; low MUAC-for-age, RR = 2. 05 P < 0. 001. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox model showed that the variables most strongly associated with mortality were weight-for-height and MUAC-for-age. Among children discharged from the nutritional rehabilitation centre, 10. 9 % had weight-for-height < - 3 SD. Conclusion: The <b>nutrition</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> centre is confronted with extremely ill children with high risk of death. There is need to support those units for appropriate management of acute severe malnutrition. It is also important to implement community-based therapeutic care for management of children still malnourished at discharge from nutritional rehabilitation centre. These programs will contribute to reduce mortality rate and number of severely malnourished children attending inpatient <b>nutrition</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> centers, by prevention and early management. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although SMA involves a wide range of disease severity and a high mortality and morbidity rate, recent advances in multidisciplinary supportive care have enhanced quality of life and life expectancy. Active research for possible treatment options has become possible since the disease-causing gene defect was identified in 1995. Nevertheless, a causal therapy is not available at present, and therapeutic management of SMA remains challenging; the prolonged survival is increasing, especially orthopedic, respiratory and nutritive problems. This review focuses on orthopedic management of the disease, with discussion of key aspects that include scoliosis, muscular contractures, hip joint disorders, fractures, technical devices, and a comparative approach of conservative and surgical treatment. Also emphasized are associated complications including respiratory involvement, perioperative care and anesthesia, <b>nutrition</b> problems, and <b>rehabilitation.</b> The SMA disease course can be greatly improved with adequate therapy with established orthopedic procedures in a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach.

We evaluated the effect of Save the Children’s (SC) com-munity empowerment and nutrition program (CENP) on child growth, care, morbidity, empowerment, and behavioral determinants. This paper describes the research methods of this community-based study. We used a longitudinal, prospective, randomized design. We selected 12 impoverished communes with documented child malnutrition, three comparison, and three intervention communes in each of two districts in Phu Tho Province, west of Hanoi. SC taught district trainers in November 1999 to train local health volun-teers to implement the 10 -month CENP, including situ-ation analysis, positive deviance (PD) inquiry, growth monitoring and promotion, <b>nutrition</b> education and <b>rehabilitation</b> program (NERP), deworming, and mon-itoring. PD inquiries aim to discover successful care practices in poor households that likely promote well-nourished children. NERPs are neighborhood-based, facilitated group learning sessions where caregivers of malnourished children learn and practice PD and other healthy behaviors. We dewormed all intervention and comparison children. We weighed all children less than 24 months of age living in the intervention and comparison communes and randomly selected 240 children (120 intervention and 120 comparison). We gathered information on nutritional status, diet, illness, care, behavioral determinants, empowerment, and pro-gram quality, monthly for six months with a re-survey at 12 months. We collected most information through maternal interview but also observed hygiene and pro-gram quality, and videotaped feedings at home.
