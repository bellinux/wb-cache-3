Robinson. The study was carried out at Agricultural Research Farm of University of Tehran in Karaj during 2006. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a split-split plot arrangement with four replications. Rhizobium 1 meliloti inoculation and four levels of chemical nitrogen fertilizer (0, 25, 75 and 125 kg N ha) were allocated to the main plots while four levels of harvest frequencies (weekly interval, two weeks interval, three weeks interval and control with only one harvest at % 50 flowering) were assigned to subplots. Months of post harvest period of hard-seed breakdown after the last harvest in August were assumed as split-split plots in time. The rate of hard-seed softening was measured during post harvest period from August 2006 to March 2007. According to the results of this study, levels of hard-seedness decreased with increment in frequency of 1 harvest. Nitrogen application of 125 kg ha produced the highest percent of hard-seedness (p< 0. 05) among other <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizing</b> systems.

40|$|International audienceAccumulation of {{municipal}} solid wastes, such as household solid waste, can be rated as a harmful, if not critical, pollution problem. However, if these wastes can be composted {{and the end}} product used as soil organic amendment or fertilizer, this may represent one of the alternatives for achieving the goal of ensuring integrated and sustainable waste management. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizing</b> value of household solid waste compost in two soils of Morocco with contrasting properties: a sandy soil and a loamy-clay soil. The compost {{used in this study}} was prepared by aerobic biodegradation using the organic fraction after its separation from the non-compostable materials. A study of nitrogen availability of the compost was carried out in a Soil - Compost - Crop system under greenhouse conditions using lettuce as a test crop. Four increasing compost rates of 0, 10, 20 and 30 tons/ha were applied to the soils. The recommended mineral fertilizer rate by the Agricultural Extension Service for lettuce and its half values constituted additional treatments. The results show a high stock of mineral nitrogen in the loamy-clay soil before crop installation. Unlike the loamy-clay soil, the sandy soil generated a better yield increase and a better response to mineral fertilizers. The effect of compost rate on nitrogen mineralization was significant in the two studied soils. The quantities of mineralized nitrogen of the compost varied between 15 and 24 % of the compost total nitrogen applied to the sandy and the loamy-clay soils during the lettuce growing season. Therefore the use of household solid waste compost as soil amendment constitutes a beneficial alternative in Mediterranean soils because it permits the generation of a high <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizing</b> value...|$|E

The most economical and sustainable (and in long term, the only viable) way to provide these supplies on Martian bases is via bio-regenerative systems, by using local resources to drive oxygenic photosynthesis. Selected cyanobacteria, grown in adequately protective containment could serve as pioneer species to produce life sustaining substrates for higher organisms.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{there has been an}} ongoing {{controversy}} regarding the extent to which nitrogen fertilization can increase carbon sequestration and net ecosystem production in forest ecosystems. The debate is {{complicated by the fact that}} increased nitrogen availability caused by nitrogen deposition has coincided with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The latter could further stimulate primary production but also result in increased allocation of carbon to root exudates, which could potentially 'prime' the decomposition of soil organic matter. Here we show that increased input of labile carbon to forest soil caused a decoupling of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, which was manifested as a reduction in respiration of soil organic matter that coincided with a substantial increase in gross nitrogen mineralization. An estimate of the magnitude of the effect demonstrates that the decoupling could potentially result in an increase in net ecosystem production by up to 51 kg C ha- 1 day- 1 in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilized</b> stands during peak summer.

Maatalousoikeuden ja maatalouspoliittisen lainsäädännön yhtymäkohdat ympäristöoikeuteen ovat tarkastelun keskiössä. Ympäristötavoitteita ja -periaatteita tarkastellaan sekä ympäristöoikeuden yleisten oppien näkökulmasta että maataloudellista ympäristönsuojelua koskevien eri säännösten soveltamisen yhteydessä. Jälkimmäisiin kuuluvat varsinkin ympäristönsuojelulain vesien ja maaperän suojelua, ympäristölupia sekä pilaantuneen ympäristön puhdistamista koskevat säännökset sekä sanotun lain nojalla annetut asetustasoiset säännökset, kuten mm. vesien suojelemista nitraattien aiheuttamalta pilaantumiselta koskeva ns. nitraattiasetus. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan viljelijöiden vapaaehtoisiin sitoumuksiin ja sopimuksiin perustuvien ympäristötukien käyttöä. Lisäksi selvitellään ympäristövaikutusten arviointimenettelyyn, kunnan ympäristönsuojelumääräyksiin, ympäristövahinkojen korvaamiseen ja ympäristörikoksiin liittyviä säännöksiä sekä tulevien alueittaisten vesienhoitosuunnitelmien ja tavoiteohjelmien merkitystä. Tarkastelussa on myös mukana GMO- ja tavanomaisten viljelykasvien keskinäiseen rinnakkaiseloon liittyvät ongelmat vielä valmisteilla olevassa lainsäädännössä. Tutkimuksen loppuosassa esitetään de lege ferenda -kehittämisehdotuksia. Nämä lähinnä oikeuspoliittiset ehdotukset painottuvat nitraattiasetuksen tiukentamiseen, täydentämiseen fosforilannoitusta koskevilla säännöksillä ja parempaan alueelliseen kohdentamiseen sekä ympäristölupajärjestelmän kehittämiseen, ympäristötukien tehokkaampaan suuntaamiseen ja käyttämiseen pitkällä tähtäimellä lähinnä siirryttäessä tiukempaan pakolliseen sääntelyyn samoin kuin eräiden uusien ohjauskeinojen luomiseen. This {{dissertation}} {{on the environmental}} liability of agriculture first provides information about the circumstances and specific nature of the agriculture as an occupation and as elementary production, {{as well as its}} connection to certain basic human rights, and generally looks at rural law and environmental law and their intertwined relationship in current agricultural policy in addition to the relationship between agri-environmental liabilities and property rights. The study then concentrates on the legislative environmental directing of agricultural activities especially within cultivation and the various relevant principles represented in the agri-environmental sector of law. The last part is comprised of the main results of the study with some de lege ferenda proposals for addressing obvious shortcomings in the efficiency of current agri-environmental legislation. The dissertation adopts a broad concept of agricultural environmental liability that includes both compulsory and voluntary based legal obligations to prevent and minimize pollution, and to compensate for environmental damage or restore contaminated or polluted environments. Elements of the environment subjected to pollution include surface and ground water and soil, as well as air and even climate. Agricultural activities causing pollution are mainly fertilizing, manure spreading and storage, cattle pasturing and the use of pesticides. For watercourses it is mostly a diffuse type of pollution, appearing as eutrophication, and for ground water and soil it is usually point source pollution and contamination. Environmental protection has since 1980 s and 1990 s significantly modified the Common Agricultural Popolicy (CAP) of the EU and its legislation. The CAP was strongly shaped by the Uruguay Round with its WTO Agricultural Agreement, and is still {{under the influence of the}} prolonged Doha Round, which aims to renegotiate that agreement for the further liberalization of trade. The latest reform of the CAP created the Single Payment System (SPS) by Council Regulation (EC) 1782 / 2003, with the aim of decoupling the CAP supports from production. The SPS includes additional aid conditions the purpose of which are to ensure that fields are kept in good condition with regard to the environment and further cultivation. In addition, special agri-environmental supports – also of a voluntary nature, though based on legislation – have alongside LFA aid and special national support allowed to Finland after joining the EU in 1995, played a central role in the national adaptation to the CAP. The compulsory agri-environmental legislation, based on the targets and principles of article 174 of the EC Treaty, is mainly comprised of the measures of Directive 91 / 676 /EEC that concerns the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. It is implemented nowadays in pursuance to the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000, EPA) by Government Decree 931 / 2000, which stipulates that the actions in it, including instructions for good agricultural practices, refer to the Nitrate Directive´s action programme. The programme is being put into effect throughout the country. Finland thus chose to free itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones in accordance with article 3 (5) article of the directive. The provisions of the Nitrate Decree concern the volume and other conditions for storage of animal manure, and the use of manure and nitrogen fertilizers having seasonal, areal and quantitative restrictions. For instance, animal manure may be applied on a field as fertilizer equivalent to a maximum of 170 kg/ha/year of nitrogen. The use of maximum amounts of nitrogen on fields as fertilizer, contained in mineral fertilizer, animal manure and organic fertilizers, is allowed, for example, as follows: for grassland and pasture, silage and horticultural plants, 250 kg of nitrogen/ha/year (highest); for winter cereals, up to 200 kg of nitrogen/ha/year, of which normally 30 kg are used in the autumn and 170 kg in the spring; and for spring cereals, sugar beet, oilseed crops and other crops, up to 170 kg /ha/year. In addition, Annex 3 of the decree makes some special recommendations on procedures related to the use of animal manure. The Nitrate Directive is now connected to the water policy framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (with its planning system and action programmes) which is implemented mainly by the Act on Arrangement of Water Management (1299 / 2004). This system does not hinder the developing and tightening of the rules of the nitrate legislation also separately, if needed. The role of private law measures is restricted in the agricultural sector mainly to the Act of Compensation for Environmental Damage (737 / 1994) and the Adjoining Properties Act (26 / 1920). Both of these are based on objective liability. The principles in the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000) are not understood quite in the same way as the environmental principles in article 174 (2) of the treaty. This particularly concerns the principle of caution and care in section 4. 1. 2 of the act compared to the precautionary principle of the treaty with its heavier weight and larger area of application, as conventionally interpreted in the European Court of Justice. Environmental principles, in any case, work very much towards common goals. From a systematic point of view it would be reasonable in Finnish law to combine the principle of prevention together with that principle of caution and care into a larger main principle, a “principle of prevention and precaution”, for instance. The results from agri-environmental measures in Finland have been insufficient. Although the use of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizing</b> has generally decreased – the average balance of nitrogen in fields been reduced from 80 kg to 50 kg per hectare and the nitrogen flow potential for watercourses has decreased especially in eastern and middle Finland – the least and most insufficient decrease has occured in the coastal areas, where in many rivers and especially in the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland no reductions in the nitrogen load has been found. The reason is due to national circumstances, the overly high maximum amounts of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizing</b> allowed in the Nitrate Decree, actually already in the Nitrate Directive, and the fact that Finland by choosing to establish and apply the action programme relating to article 5 of the directive throughout its national territory exempted itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones. Additionally, the Nitrate Directive and Decree do not regulate or directly affect the use of phosphorous fertilizers. Therefore, reaching more concrete results in the protection of watercourses against eutrophication caused by agriculture is left to be managed by the agri-environmental aid scheme, which covers over 90 per cent of all active farms in Finland but has not in this respect been effective enough. Neither the polluter pay- principle and the precautionary principle nor the principle of prevention have sufficiently materialized for Finnish farming in terms of the protection of surface waters. Instead of the polluter pays principle prevails, through the scheme of agri-environmental aid the so-called provider gets principle. On the other hand, the ground water and soil situation is good, thanks to the ground water pollution and soil contamination prohibitions in section 7 and 8 of the EPA, as well as the prohibitions, warnings and measures prescribed for the use of plant protection and bioside products in accordance with the harmonized legislation in these areas. Still, a lack of harmony is noticeable between environmental aid payed on the basis of the “agreements for cultivation of ground water areas” and the groundwater pollution prohibition in the EPA. The recommendations forming part of the Nitrate Decrees regulations should be transformed into regulations. Limits for maximum nitrogen fertilization should be lowered in watercourse zones especially vulnerable to pollution, as well as to those parts of the country from which the heaviest loads still issue into the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland. Conditions for all agri-environmental aid should include more onerous conditions for phosphorous fertilization. The aid should also be based more on agreements tailored and negotiated to fit the activities and special characteristics of each farm. There are also grounds for lowering the limits of livestock installations requiring environmental permits for their establishment or enlargement, and for placing on these permits – in accordance with the principle that damage should as a priority be rectified at the source, and to enhance agricultural structure – the condition of having in one´s possession, by ownership or long-term lease, sufficient field area for the application of manure near enough to the installation. One possible economical measure to alleviate the diffuse pollution into waters could be a payment system that would be based on the arable land area under active cultivation and each farm´s number of livestock and thus on the farm´s estimated yearly surplus balance of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization. In general, it would be reasonable in terms of achieving a more genuine application of the polluter pays principle and also the principles of prevention and precaution to put more weight on using the compulsory legal measures and additional conditions in the CAP as well as national agri-aid instead of special agri-environmental aid. The trend of rising cereal prices, as well as possible increasing demand for other agricultural products, could help in the adoption of these measures. Agri-environmental aids should in the long run be mainly used temporarily and as an incentive during transitional periods for the implementation and adaptation of new and stricter legal environmental obligations...|$|E

The LUE model and a closely related linear regression model were studied at an ombrotrophic peatland in southern Sweden. Eddy covariance and chamber GPP, incoming and reflected photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), field-measured spectral reflectance, and data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used in this study. The chamber and spectral reflectance measurements were made on four experimental treatments: unfertilized control (Ctrl). <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilized</b> (N), phosphorus <b>fertilized</b> (P), and <b>nitrogen</b> plus phosphorus <b>fertilized</b> (NP). For Ctrl, a strong linear relationship was found between GPP and the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (APAR) (R- 2 = 0. 90). The slope coefficient (epsilon(s), where s stands for "slope") for the linear relationship between seasonal time series of GPP and the product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and PPFD was used as a proxy for the light use efficiency factor (epsilon). There were differences in epsilon(s) depending on the treatments with a significant effect for N compared to Ctrl (ANOVA: p = 0. 042, Tukey's: p <= 0. 05). Also. epsilon(s) was linearly related to the cover degree of vascular plants (R- 2 = 0. 66). As a sensitivity test, the regression coefficients (epsilon(s) and intercept) for each treatment were used to model time series of 16 -day GPP from the product of MODIS NDVI and PPFD. Seasonal averages of GPP were calculated for 2005, 2006. and 2007, which resulted in up to 19 % higher average GPP for the fertilization treatments compared to Ctrl. The main conclusion is that the LUE model and the regression model can be applied in peatlands but also that temporal and spatial changes in epsilon or the regression coefficients should be considered.

40|$|The use of acid {{tolerant}} rhizobacteria such as Bradyrhizobium japonicum is one {{effort for}} increasing soybean productivity in acid soil. B. japonicum is a N-fixing bacteria that can promote soybean growth through symbiosis with the host plants. The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the growth and production of soybean var. Wilis inoculated by B. japonicum and NPK inorganic fertilizer application in acid soil. Two isolates of B. japonicum that were BJ 11 (19) and BJ 11 (wt) were used as inoculant for soybean. BJ 11 (19) was resulted by transposons mutagenesis, whereas BJ 11 (wt) is a wild type of bacteria. Both isolates of B. japonicum were acid tolerant. Soybean was inoculated with BJ 11 (19) and BJ 11 (wt) combined with compost and nitrogen fertilizer (with two rates). The field experiment was conducted at Cikabayan, Darmaga, in a randomized complete block design with 12 treatments and 3 replicates. The results showed that application of the acid tolerant B. japonicum BJ 11 (wt), compost, and nitrogen fertilizer (10 g m- 2) increased the plant height, dry weight of shoots and roots, nodule number, dry weight of nodules, nitrogenase activity, number of pod and seed, seed weight, and nitrogen content of seeds in acid soil.

40|$|Sunflower {{nitrogen}} fertilization {{recommendations in}} South Africa {{are based on}} yield goals. In this approach, soil nitrogen supply is not taken into account {{with the result that}} nitrogen fertilization recommendations from differ-ent institutions are in disagreement. Delta yield, the difference between a well fertilized crop and a zero <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilized</b> control, was found to be a more reliable indicator of the economic optimum nitrogen rate for maize than the yield goal, in three different countries. In seeking improved accuracy, this study was done with the aim to compare delta yield with yield goal as estima-tors of the economical optimum nitrogen fertilization rate for sunflower. Reported results of fifty fertilization trials, each representing a specific year and locality, were collected, the nitrogen response curves fitted and the opti-mum nitrogen rates, corresponding yields and delta yields calculated. Grain yield responded to applied nitrogen significantly at only twenty-five of these tri-als and with the calculated optimum nitrogen rate within the limits of the applied nitrogen. Only 27 % of the variation in the optimum nitrogen fertiliza-tion rate was explained by yield goal compared with 87 % by delta yield, making it a far more reliable indicator of the optimum nitrogen rate. The relationship between delta yield and the optimum nitrogen rate is best described by a power function: Y=X 0. 669 with Y the optimum nitrogen rate and X the delta yield, both measured in kg per ha.

40|$|A {{two years}} field study was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of response of two sweet sorghum cultivars to different sources and time of nitrogen application during 2009 and 2010 at experimental farm Faculty of Agriculture, South Valley University at Qena Governorate, Egypt. Two cultivars viz. Tracy and Honey and six combination of source and application time of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilizes</b> viz. ammonium sulphate, 20. 5 % N in two equal doses (T 1) and in three equal doses (T 2), ammonium nitrate, 33. 5 % N in two equal doses (T 3) and in three equal doses (T 4), urea, 46. 5 % N in two equal doses (T 5) and in three equal doses (T 6) were tested in the study. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with cultivars in main plots and nitrogen fertilizers in sub-plots. Among sweet sorghum cultivars, cv Honey had the highest stalk height, stalk diameter, number of internodes per stalk, Brix value, sucrose content, apparent purity percentage and stalk and forage (leaves) yields and lowest reducing sugar content. Application of T 4 gave the highest value of the above measurements and lowest reducing sugar content. Cultivar and nitrogen treatments interaction was significant on stalk and forage yields as well as reducing sugar content. The highest stalk and forage yields and lowest reducing sugar content were obtained by planting cv Honey and application of ammonium nitrate in three equal doses (at planting, 4 leaf stage and booting). Plant height, stalk diameter, forage yield, brix and sucrose were positively and strongly correlated with stalk yield...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{theories}} on species occurrence and interactions between them deeply rely on resources availability. Grasses {{are known for}} their ability to preempt belowground resources, especially nitrogen to the detriment of tree seedlings. Objective {{of the study was to}} determine how combination in contrasted soil inorganic nitrogen x light availability influence plants in terms of growth and resource acquisition in mixed stand of oak seedling (Quercus petraea) and Deschampsia cespitosa during early phase of mixture growth. We designed a greenhouse experiment testing the Deschampsia effect on oak, grown in pots, alone or as a mixture under two levels of crossed resources, <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>fertilized,</b> N+, or unfertilized pots, N-), and light (shaded, L-, or well-lit pots, L+). Our results showed oak endured competition from grass in all resource combinations except in N-/L-. Light environment increased intensity and importance of competition on oak. Unexpectedly Deschampsia was facilitated by oak in N+ pot. A higher root biomass, length, SRL, and lower root diameter confer to Deschampsia better prospection and capitation capacities, allowing it to take 96. 6 % of a source of 15 N labeled inorganic nitrogen up. No root plasticity concordant with the foraging theory was observed. Why was Deschampsia facilitated by oak when nitrogen was not limiting is an intriguing question. One answer, still needing research, is that a better oak growth, and so production of more exudates, fosters Deschampsia growth. As a result, Deschampsia ability to harvest resources is reinforced. Oak seedling responds through driving the few resources it can collect to storage organs, following a conservative strategy...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the {{long-term}} effects on epiphytic lichen dry mass development, diversity and community structure after exposure to a simulated nitrogen deposition gradient. A whole tree experiment was set up in a boreal forest in the County of Västerbotten in Sweden, whereby 15 trees were artificially irrigated and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fertilized</b> during seven consecutive years (2006 - 2012). The treatments were equal to an additional deposition of 0. 6, 6, 12. 5, 25 and 50 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1. Branches from the trees were collected in October 2012 and the lichen material was harvested and further analysed during the spring 2013. The results from this study showed that the lichens were directly affected by the long-term increased nitrogen deposition. Generally, lichen dry mass and species richness declined at high nitrogen loads and the initial positive effects of low nitrogen loads reported in a preceding study had thus depressed with time. The results from this study also showed that the composition of the lichen community changed benefitting nitrogen-tolerant species, probably not because of competition but more likely because of nitrogen-sensitive species disappearance. This study strongly indicates that it takes more than a few years to detect changes in lichen communities exposed to enhanced nitrogen loads. In addition low concentrations seem to have a cumulative impact. Consequently, this study stresses the importance of also considering the cumulative effect of low nitrogen loads when determining critical values. The critical load for lichen communities in boreal forests might be below 6 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1...|$|R
