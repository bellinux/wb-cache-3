The model follows the compound Poisson framework with credit interest for positive reserve, and debit interest for <b>negative</b> <b>reserve.</b> Ruin occurs when the reserve drops below the critical value. The company controls the dividend pay-out dynamically with the objective to maximize the expected total discounted dividends until ruin. We show that that the optimal strategy is a band strategy and it is optimal to pay no dividends when the reserve is negative. ...|$|E
40|$|Since 2014, the ECB {{has applied}} a {{negative}} interest rate on the excess reserves (and deposit facilities) of commercial banks. This policy is complementary to Quantitative Easing (QE), a program whereby the ECB purchases securities on financial markets. Indeed, the QE provides liquidity to the banks and {{negative interest rate}}s encourage them to reallocate this liquidity. The <b>negative</b> <b>reserve</b> rate amplifies the fall in short-term and long-term market rates and reinforces the incentive for commercial banks to operate reallocation on their portfolios towards riskier assets. The total amount of liquidity subject to a negative interest rate is 1047 billion euros. Negative interest rates should reduce interest rate margins but the impact on profitability is mitigated by the capital gains banks realise when selling securities to the ECB under QE, by the possibility banks have to finance themselves at negative rates, by {{a decrease in the}} risk of default and by the possibility to raise non-interest income...|$|E

40|$|Lithium-ion (Li-Ion) {{batteries}} {{are increasingly being}} considered as bulk energy storage in grid applications. One such application is residential energy storage combined with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to enable higher self-consumption rates, which has become financially more attractive recently due to decreasing feed-in subsidies. Although residential energy storage solutions are commercially mature, it remains unclear which system configurations and circumstances, including aggregator-based applications such as the provision of ancillary services, lead to profitable consumer investments. Therefore, we conduct an extensive simulation study that is able to jointly capture these aspects. Our results show that, at current battery module prices, even optimal system configurations still do not lead to profitable investments into Li-Ion batteries if they are merely used as a buffer for solar energy. The first settings in which they will become profitable, as prices are further declining, will be larger households at locations with higher average levels of solar irradiance.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} wind turbines as new participants on prices and allocation within balancing markets. We introduce the cost-minimizing electricity sector model ELMOD-MIP, that includes detailed unit-commitment constraints, complex {{combined heat and power}} constraints, and minimum bid sizes for balancing capacity reservation. The model also features a novel approach of modeling balancing reservation by considering possible activation costs already during the reservation phase, mimicking the activation anticipation of market participants. The model includes the spot and balancing market of Germany and is applied to scenarios for 2013 and 2025. The results for 2025 show, in comparison to 2013, a price increase for positive and negative reserves, in case no new participants enter the market. With the participation of wind turbines the cost for balancing provision is reduced by 40 %, but above 2013 values. The relative cost savings from wind participation are higher for <b>negative</b> <b>reserve</b> provision than positive reserve provision, as wind turbines can use their full capacity if not activated and {{do not have to be}} curtailed ex ante. The participation of wind turbines especially reduces the occurrence of peak prices for positive and negative reserves in 2025. This reduction effect occurs even with a relatively low share where wind turbines participate with only five percent of their capacity. Therefore, further fostering the process of allowing wind turbines to participate in the German reserve market seems favorable...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{research}} was to improve the management of bronchial asthma in children by examining the peculiarities and diagnostic value of reaction markers of eosinophil granulocytes in the sputum and peripheral blood of patients with signs of eosinophil and non-eosinophil phenotypes of this disease. A cohort of 118 school-age children suffering from BA was examined during a period free from attacks. Group I (the main group) included 61 schoolchildren with signs of eosinophil phenotype (EP) of asthma detected by the character of bronchial inflammation with eosinophil granulocytes present in the sputum {{at a level of}} > 3 %, group II (the comparison group) included 57 patients with a lower number of eosinophils in the sputum (non-eosinophil phenotype (NP) of BA). The average index of the relative content of eosinophils in the peripheral blood among the representatives of group I was 5. 82 ± 0. 63 %, and in children with the signs of NPBA – 6. 02 ± 0. 74 % (P > 0. 05), and average indices in the groups of absolute eosinophil number in the blood were 0. 37 ± 0. 04 and 0. 41 ± 0. 05 respectively (P > 0. 05).

40|$|This paper {{expands the}} {{discussion}} about future balancing reserve provision to the long-term perspective of 2050. Most pathways for a transformation towards a decarbonized electricity sector rely on very high shares of fluctuating renewables. This {{can be a challenge}} for the provision of balancing reserves, although their influence on the balancing cost is unclear. Apart from the transformation of the generation portfolio, various technical and regulatory developments within the balancing framework might further influence balancing costs: i) dynamic dimensioning of balancing reserves, ii) provision by fluctuating renewables or new (battery) storage technologies, and iii) exchange of balancing reserves between balancing zones. The first part of this paper discusses and transforms these developments into quantitative scenario definitions. The second part applies these scenarios to dynELMOD (dynamic Electricity Model), an investment model of the European electricity system that is extended to include balancing reserve provision. In contrast to other models applied in most papers on balancing reserves, this model is capable of evaluating the interdependencies between developments in balancing reserve provision and high shares of fluctuating renewables jointly. The results show that balancing reserve cost can be kept at current levels for a renewable electricity system until 2050, when using a dynamic reserve sizing horizon. Apart from the sizing horizon, storage capacity withholding duration and additional balancing demand from RES are the main driver of balancing costs. Renewables participation in balancing provision is mainly important for <b>negative</b> <b>reserves,</b> while storages play an important role for the provision of positive reserves. However, only on very few occasions, additional storage investments are required for balancing reserve provision, as most of the time sufficient storage capacities are available in the electricity system...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a new lane reservation problem called bus lane reservation problem (BLRP). The {{focus of the}} problem is on optimally selecting lanes to be reserved from an existing transport network and designing reserved lane-based bus paths, such that the rapid and station arrival-time guaranteed bus transit can be ensured, thereby achieving rapid and reliable bus transportation. However, once lanes are <b>reserved,</b> <b>negative</b> impact, such as an increase in travel time on adjacent non-reserved lanes may be caused. For this problem, an improved integer linear program is first formulated to minimize such negative impact. As the existing commercial solvers, e. g., CPLEX, can only solve small-size problems, we develop an exact enhanced cut-and-solve algorithm and an improved kernel search heuristic for solving medium- and large-size problems. Results of extensive numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{occurrence}} of negative electricity prices on the German day-ahead spot market for the years 2008 and 2009. An empirical analysis shows that either a low system load combined with a moderate wind generation or a moderate system load combined with a high wind generation is a neccessary condition for the appearence of negative prices. However, the linear correlation between the negative market prices and global variables that characterise the system status (system load, wind generation, net export, residual load) is relatively low - wind generation having the highest correlation (- 0. 42). By elaborating the actual volumes of renewable electricity that are traded on the spot market, a marginally better correlation can be achieved. Limited transparency in this field makes this type of market-oriented analysis difficult.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Mallett Unit is a {{clinical}} test designed {{to detect the}} fixation disparity that {{is most likely to}} occur {{in the presence of a}} decompensated heterophoria. It measures the associated phoria, which is the "aligning prism" needed to nullify the subjective disparity. The technique has gained widespread acceptance within professions such as optometry, for investigating suspected cases of decompensating heterophoria; it is, however, rarely used by orthoptists and ophthalmologists. The aim of this study was to investigate whether fusional vergence reserves, measured routinely by both orthoptists and ophthalmologists to detect heterophoria decompensation, were correlated with aligning prism (associated phoria) in a normal clinical population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Aligning prism (using the Mallett Unit) and fusional vergence reserves (using a prism bar) were measured in 500 participants (mean 41. 63 years; standard deviation 11. 86 years) at 40 cm and 6 m. At 40 cm a strong correlation (p< 0. 001) between base in aligning prism (Exo FD) and positive fusional reserves was found. Of the participants with zero aligning prism 30 % had reduced fusional reserves. At 6 m a weak correlation between base out aligning prism (Eso FD) and <b>negative</b> fusional <b>reserves</b> was found to break (p = 0. 01) and to recovery (p = 0. 048). Of the participants with zero aligning prism 12 % reported reduced fusional reserves. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: For near vision testing, the strong inverse correlation between base in aligning prism (Exo FD) and fusional vergence reserves supports the notion that both measures are indicators of decompensation of heterophoria. For distance vision testing and for those patients reporting zero aligning prism further research is required to determine why the relationship appears to be weak/non-existent...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{interaction}} of the heart with the systemic vasculature, termed ventricular-arterial coupling, is a central determinant of net cardiovascular performance in normal and pathological conditions. Ventricular and arterial elastance can be easily assessed by echocardiography, both at rest and during stress. Aim: To assess noninvasively left ventricular-arterial coupling in healthy and diseased subjects at rest and during dipyridamole (DIP) stress. Materials and methods: We enrolled 365 patients (63 ? 16 years; 231 males) referred to stress echo lab: 131 "normals" (Nl); 86 patients with coronary artery disease, 68 with negative (CAD, SE -) and 18 with positive (CAD, SE+) stress echo; 148 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In all, ventricular-arterial coupling was indexed by the ratio of ventricular force (Systolic Pressure/End-Systolic Volume index) to arterial elastance (EaI, ratio of end-systolic pressure by stroke volume). 2 D echo (for ESV and stroke volume) and cuff sphygmomanometer (systolic pressure, multiplied x 0. 90 to obtain end-systolic pressure) provided the raw measurements. Results: At rest, EaI was profoundly increased in DCM (6. 3 ? 4. 4; p<. 001 vs. all other groups: Nl= 4 ? 1. 1; CAD, SE-= 3. 8 ? 1; CAD SE+= 4. 2 ? 1. 3).

An important implication of modeling the volatility in an emerging market's Central Bank reserves is firstly, sharp volatility changes are seen in the reserves, which is not common in developed markets and secondly, to see the sensitivity of variables to the magnitude and {{the sign of the}} reserves. Measuring the size of the volatility and observing its determinants is important in determining the guidelines for monetary policy. For a Central Bank that has a precautionary motive it is important to monitor the increase in the volatiltiy.

40|$|Human eyes see {{the same}} object from {{slightly}} different viewpoints. Unless the object is placed at infinity, our eyes have to verge towards each other in order to fixate on the same object. Such vergence eye movements are also coupled to appropriate accommodation changes of our eyes in order {{to focus on the}} object. Unfortunately, this coupling is disturbed when viewing current binocular displays. On binocular displays, images with correct stereoscopic depth cues can be presented to induce appropriate vergence eye movements. However, the lens focus of such displays is typically fixed regardless of changing depth cues. This posts an un-natural demand on the viewer’s eyes since the viewing condition demands vergence movement in the absence of appropriate accommodation changes. This thesis studies, for the first time, the effects of matching lens focus with stereoscopic depth cues on the time taken to form a single stereoscopic image when viewing a binocular micro-display. A micro-display system with dynamically adjustable lens focus was designed and prototyped for this study. The design and prototyping work forms part of the contribution of the thesis. An experiment was then conducted to study the time taken to merge a pair of left and right binocular images into a single stereoscopic image under four viewing conditions that exhaust the combinations of two lens focus (40 cm and 200 cm) and two object depths (40 cm and 200 cm). Results indicate that viewers took significantly shorter time to form a single overlaid stereoscopic image when the lens focus matched with the object depth (p< 0. 05, paired t test). Further examinations of the data suggest that unnatural demand for the eyes to diverge (e. g., lens focus was smaller than the object depth) are associated with significantly longer periods of double images. Among the ten viewers, seven consistently and significantly benefited from the effect of matching lens focus with stereoscopic depth cues but three viewers did not. The relationships between individuals’ performance in the study and their visual parameters have been studied. Significant correlations are found between the time taken to form a single stereoscopic image and the <b>negative</b> fusional <b>reserve</b> of the participants. The work of this thesis evaluates the potential benefits of applying dynamically adjustable lens focus to the future design of binocular micro-displays...|$|R
40|$|Dairy {{producers}} in the Netherlands are struggling {{to stay in business}} due to increased environmental legislation, population density, intensity of farming systems, costs of production and quota restrictions. One option available to Netherlands dairy farmers is to liquidate the value of their assets, put the money into an international bank, and buy an established dairy farm in the United States. The primary objective of this research is to compare the economic viability of a Netherlands dairy farmer staying in the Netherlands versus moving to the United States, assuming they will bring over all of their equity to put towards the purchase of a U. S. farm. The hypothesis that a Dutch dairy farmer would have a greater probability of economic success by relocating to the U. S was tested using a whole farm simulation model (FLIPSIM) to simulate the economic activity of a representative dairy farm in the Netherlands and 23 representative U. S. dairy farms in the major dairy producing regions over the 2002 - 2011 planning horizon. FLIPSIM generated an empirical probability distribution for net present value to rank the representative farms using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) for risk neutral and risk averse decision makers. The FLIPSIM results showed that six of the twenty-three U. S. dairy farms would give the Dutch farmer a 99 % chance of economic success. The added risk on income in the U. S. would result in these U. S. farms having a 1 to 99 % chance of <b>negative</b> ending cash <b>reserves</b> (ECR) and a 1 to 99 % chance of negative net cash farm income (NCFI). In a complete SERF analysis, seventeen of the twenty-three U. S. farms were preferred over the Dutch farm. In conclusion, the research shows Dutch dairy farmers with adequate equity would be financially better off by relocating to the U. S. if they desire to continue dairying, rather than staying in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|The recent rise {{of oil and}} {{gasoline}} prices accompanied by reluctant acknowledgement that traditional sources of energy are limited has renewed public interest in renewable energy sources. This perspective on energy is focusing attention on and facilitating acceptance of alternative energy concepts, such as solar, wind, and biomass. The nuclear energy alternative, while clean with potentially abundant fuel supplies and associated with low costs, is burdened with the frequently <b>negative</b> public opinion <b>reserved</b> for things nuclear. Coincident with the heightened examination of alternative energy concepts, 2004 marks the 25 -year anniversary of the Three Mile Island accident. Since this pivotal accident in 1979, no new reactor licenses have been granted in the U. S. The resolution of the issues of nuclear waste management and disposition are central to and may advance public discussions of the future use of nuclear energy. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is currently preparing the licensing application for Yucca Mountain, which was designated in 2003 as the site for a high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel repository in the U. S. The DOE also has been operating a deep geologic repository for the permanent disposal of transuranic (TRU) waste since 1999. The operational status of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) as a repository for TRU waste was successfully realized along with the lesson learned that stakeholder trust and acceptance are as {{critical to the success}} of a repository program as the resolution of technical issues and obtaining regulatory approvals. For the five years of its operation and for decades prior, the challenge of attaining public acceptance of the WIPP has persisted for reasons aligned with the opposition to nuclear energy. Due to this commonality, the nuclear waste approach to public acceptance, with its pros and cons, provides a baseline for the examination of an approach for the public acceptance of nuclear energy in the U. S. This paper will present these concepts and discuss the future of nuclear energy in the U. S. in light of the challenge of gaining public acceptance...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{constitutes}} a dominant form of sustainable energy {{that is expected}} to grow rapidly in the years to come. Increased inverter-based wind power penetration may however endanger grid stability and reliability, if not enriched with the capability to provide crucial ancillary services to the grid, such as frequency regulation. In order for the wind turbine technology to participate in the ancillary service provision, a more in depth understanding of the wind turbine dynamic behavior is acquired. Therefore, this Master Thesis Project was formulated to study how the wind turbine technology can assist in providing ancillary services under increased renewable penetration levels with a concentration on the frequency support. This project proposes the frequency controllers both at the single wind turbine level and the wind farm level to facilitate the provision of ancillary services. The power system transient simulation package PSCADTM/EMTDCTM V 4. 6. 2 is used for the controller design and the simulation study. The single wind turbine frequency controller enables the provision of the necessary positive or <b>negative</b> active power <b>reserves</b> in proportion to the measured grid frequency, via the kinetic energy stored in the rotating masses and pitch control. Thus, the wind turbine generator power output is enabled to increase or decrease respectively. The full potential offered by the technology is exploited, while the limitations associated with the provision of active power reserves are identified and respected by the implemented controller. The wind farm controller allows for the coordination and control of the available wind turbines within a wind farm, despite several barriers identified in this project. A list of parameters is used to this end, which can be varied to achieve a more sustained frequency response, despite the barriers introduced by the available limitations of the electrical and mechanical components of the wind energy conversion system. An offshore wind farm case study was performed to test the performance of the implemented controllers and investigate the impact of the wind farm frequency response on the grid frequency, in various scenarios. The successful response of the implemented controllers is proven, while no violation of physical or safe limits is identified thanks to the frequency controller designed in this project. The allowable ranges within which the controller parameters can be varied without unwanted situations are analytically discussed and summarized as important lessons learned. Finally, the active power product that can be provided within the Ancillary Service Market is quantified and described, while recommendations are made at the Ancillary Service Market level that reflect the capabilities of the wind turbine technology, if enriched with the designed controller. Overall, a positive effect of the frequency response provided by the wind turbine technology on the grid frequency is observed. Significant improvements have been achieved on the frequency nadir and the rate of change of frequency by the wind farm controller parametrization under different severity of the frequency deviations. In general, the frequency response that can be achieved through the wind turbine technology is in any case proportional to the amount of power that is generated by a certain wind farm (i. e. proportional to the wind speed conditions). The response provided can last for several seconds, thus constituting a “Fast Frequency Response” service the most appropriate option for the wind turbine technology. A trade-off between the maximum reserves provided and the duration of the response provided is seen. However, in the cases that a certain wind turbine needs to recover following a period of reserves provision, a compromise between the aggressiveness and the duration of the recovery period is also observed...|$|R
