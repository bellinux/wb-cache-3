50|$|Lakers are {{generally}} bulk carriers; that is, they carry cargoes of rock, ore, salt or grain in large contiguous holds, <b>not</b> packed <b>in</b> <b>containers.</b> The earlier ships required rail cars unloading on ore docks and unloading machinery at the receiving docks, but modern lakers are self unloaders, {{allowing them to}} unload faster and in more ports.|$|R
50|$|In shipping, {{break bulk}} cargo or general cargo are goods that must be loaded individually, and <b>not</b> <b>in</b> {{intermodal}} <b>containers</b> nor <b>in</b> bulk as with oil or grain. Ships that carry this sort of cargo are called general cargo ships. The term break bulk derives from the phrase breaking bulk—the extraction of {{a portion of the}} cargo of a ship or the beginning of the unloading process from the ship's holds. These goods may <b>not</b> be <b>in</b> shipping <b>containers.</b> Break bulk cargo is transported in bags, boxes, crates, drums, or barrels.

50|$|In {{the ocean}} {{shipping}} trade, neo-bulk cargo {{is a type}} of cargo that is a subcategory of general cargo, alongside the other subcategories of break-bulk cargo and containerized cargo. (Gerhardt Muller, erstwhile professor at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and Manager of Regional Intermodal Planning of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, promotes it from a subcategory to being a third major category of cargo in its own right, alongside general and bulk cargo.) It comprises goods that are prepackaged, counted as they are loaded and unloaded (as opposed to bulk cargo where individual items are not counted), <b>not</b> stored <b>in</b> <b>containers,</b> and transferred as units at port. Types of neo-bulk cargo goods include heavy machinery, lumber, bundled steel, scrap iron, bananas, waste paper, and cars.

40|$|Today’s crane-mounted {{planting}} heads plant seedlings with biologically {{similar or}} better results than operational manual planting. However, {{the total cost}} of mechanized tree planting in southern Sweden must decrease at least 25 % to compete economically with manual planting. Although seedlings packed in machine-specific packaging increase the productivity of planting machines by reducing seedling reloading time, they also increase logistics and investment costs. In this study, we analyzed {{the total cost of}} outplanting seedlings with an excavator-mounted Bracke Planter and seedlings packed according to four different concepts: cultivation trays, cardboard boxes, band-mounted seedlings in cardboard boxes and linked pots <b>in</b> <b>container</b> modules. The total cost per planted seedling was calculated for each packaging system as the sum of all costs from nursery to the recovery of empty packaging. The results showed that today’s system of transporting seedlings in cultivation trays is the most cost-efficient of the four alternatives. Machine-specific seedling packaging was 16 – 23 % costlier per planted seedling than cultivation trays when trucking distances were 100 km. Sensitivity analyses indicated that machine-specific seedling packaging increased in cost-efficiency relative to cultivation trays primarily when more planting machines were contracted, but also as planting machine fixed costs and productivity increased. Moreover, the relative cost-efficiency of band-mounted seedlings, but <b>not</b> seedlings <b>in</b> <b>container</b> modules, increased with increasing trucking distance. Thus, we show that investments in machine-specific seedling packaging for today’s planting machines are justified only when the fixed costs, productivity and number of contracted planting machines increase substantially...|$|R

40|$|In {{object-oriented}} programs, {{the relationship}} of an object to many objects is usually implemented using indirection through a collection.
