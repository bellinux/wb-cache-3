A mitochondria-targeted compound which is a conjugate of a positively charged rhodamine molecule with plastoquinone (SkQR 1) was found to rescue the kidney from the deleterious effect of both pathologies. Intraperitoneal injection of SkQR 1 before the onset of pathology not only normalized the level of ROS and lipid peroxidized products in kidney mitochondria but also decreased the level of cytochrome c in the blood, restored normal renal excretory function and significantly lowered mortality among animals having a single kidney.

Multiple linear regression showed cadmium in blood (median, 0. 38 µg/L) and urine (0. 52 µg/L; density adjusted = 0. 67 µg/g creatinine) to be significantly associated with effects on renal tubules (as indicated by increased levels of human complex-forming protein and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase in urine), after adjusting for age, body mass index, blood lead, diabetes, hypertension, and regular use of nephrotoxic drugs.

Herein we present novel information indicating that monensin (applied as tetraethylammonium salt) is a promising chelating agent for the treatment of Cd-induced renal and cardiac dysfunction. The study was performed using the ICR mouse model.

30|$|Despite {{the absence}} of {{randomized}} controlled studies evaluating the cumulative use of <b>nephrotoxic</b> <b>agents,</b> studies with cohorts of patients and those evaluating toxicity show that the association of several nephrotoxic risk factors, especially the accumulation of several nephrotoxic drugs, exponentially {{increases the risk of}} AKI [60, 61]. This should be taken into account when choosing drugs for patients at risk of AKI by considering their indications and favouring essential drugs.

In the ICU, according to the definition used, this incidence varies from 16 to 31  % [122 – 125]. Several other risk factors for kidney injury are usually concomitantly found in critically ill patients (hypotension, sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs), making it difficult to consider contrast media directly and solely responsible for AKI. Thus, most studies evaluate post-operative cardiac surgery patients or cardiology patients, but there are few trials available in critically ill patients.|$|R
40|$|Nephritis can {{be induced}} in rats by the {{injection}} of anti-kidney sera obtained from rabbits immunized with suspensions of perfused rat kidney. Anti-kidney sera, thus prepared, contain {{a number of}} antibodies capable, on injection into rats, of inducing a severe anaphylactoid reaction with general vascular manifestations that involve the kidney {{as well as other}} organs. These sera also contain a <b>nephrotoxic</b> <b>agent</b> that affects the kidney primarily. The nephrotoxic effect is characterized clinically by severe persistent albuminuria with casts, and transient anasarca during the acute disease, but no significant hematuria occurs. When a severe anaphylactoid reaction is superimposed on the nephrotoxic injury, hematuria is an outstanding feature. Nephrotoxin is demonstrable in vivo and is not related quantitatively to the precipitins in the anti-kidney serum against kidney extract. It is most readily obtained by immunization with kidney suspensions, but may occasionally appear after injections of other organ preparations; it does not result from immunization with erythrocytes or serum. Nephrotoxin is present in the globulin fraction of anti-kidney serum. The nephrotoxic action of anti-kidney serum is easily removed by absorption with kidney cells or fat-free kidney tissue. Similar preparations of liver likewise remove it, but less readily. Neither kidney, liver, or brain lipids affect it, nor does absorption with red blood cells or serum. Nephrotoxin appears to be an antibody that is relatively organ specific in its affinities. It differs from the more common antibodies involved in reverse anaphylaxis in one respect, at least: The animal rapidly becomes desensitized against the latter and fails to react, whereas desensitization to nephrotoxin is difficult to secure...|$|E

He worked with guinea pigs, rabbits, and rats. In these studies he has shown that in the recovery stage from acute uranium nephritis there is excessive formation of new epithelial cells in syncitial-like masses.

Far infrared radiation was not only beneficial to renal proximal tubule cell proliferation, it also increased the expression of ATPase Na+/K+ subunit alpha 1 and glucose transporter 1, as determined by western blotting. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found that far infrared radiation enhanced CDK 5 R 1, GNAS, NPPB, and TEK expression. In the proximal tubule cell line HK- 2, far infrared radiation protected against cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity by reducing apoptosis. Renal proximal tubule cell cultivation with far infrared radiation exposure resulted in better cell proliferation, significantly higher ATPase Na+/K+ subunit alpha 1 and glucose transporter 1 expression, and significantly enhanced expression of CDK 5 R 1, GNAS, NPPB, and TEK.

Net balance and renal clearance were similar for the five aminoglycosides when administered at a rate of 1 mg/kg per h. With gentamicin only, fractional excretion was correlated with the urinary flow rate. We can conclude that (i) gentamicin, generally considered the most <b>nephrotoxic</b> <b>agent,</b> had the highest degree of net reabsorption; (ii) netilmicin exhibited a net zero tubular balance; (iii) amikacin had different patterns of tubular disposition according to the dose, i. e., reabsorption at 1 mg/kg per h and secretion at 4 mg/kg per h, raising the hypothesis of a saturable process of reabsorption; and (iv) these differences in tubular reabsorption could account at least in part for the known different nephrotoxic potentials of these five aminoglycosides in humans...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Carnitine is an {{essential}} cofactor for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation that is actively reabsorbed by the luminal transporter Octn 2 (Slc 22 a 5). Because the <b>nephrotoxic</b> <b>agent</b> cisplatin causes urinary loss of carnitine in humans, we hypothesized that cisplatin may affect Octn 2 function. Experimental Design: Excretion of carnitine and acetylcarnitine was measured in urine collected from mice with or without cisplatin administration. The transport of carnitine was assessed in cells that were transfected with OCT 1 or OCT 2. The effect of cisplatin treatment on gene expression was analyzed using a mouse GeneChip array and validated using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Results: In wild-type mice, urinary carnitine excretion at baseline was ∼ 3 -fold higher than in mice lacking the basolateral cisplatin transporters Oct 1 and Oct 2 [Oct 1 / 2 (-/-) mice], indicating that carnitine itself undergoes basolateral uptake into the kidney. Transport of carnitine by OCT 2, but not OCT 1, was confirmed in transfected cells. We also found that cisplatin caused {{an increase in the}} urinary excretion of carnitine and acetylcarnitine in wild-type mice but not in Oct 1 / 2 (-/-) mice, suggesting that tubular transport of cisplatin is a prerequisite for this phenomenon. Cisplatin did not directly inhibit the transport of carnitine by Octn 2 but downregulated multiple target genes of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α, including Slc 22 a 5, in the kidney of wild-type mice that were absent in Oct 1 / 2 (-/-) mice. Conclusion: Our study shows a pivotal role of Oct 1 and Oct 2 in cisplatin-related disturbances in carnitine homeostasis. We postulate that this phenomenon is triggered by deactivation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α and leads to deregulation of carnitine-shuttle genes...|$|E

Fluid Overload Kidney Injury Score (FOKIS) is a decision support tool piloted in our PICU as a daily score incorporating subscores for AKI (pRIFLE creatinine and urine output), fluid overload (total fluid (in- out)/ICU admission weight), and exposure to nephrotoxic medications (a priori determined list of medications).|$|R
40|$|Postoperative acute renal failure, {{especially}} {{associated with}} oliguria, carries {{a high rate}} of mortality and morbidity. This complication can frequently be avoided if physicians are knowledgeable about preventable or modifiable risk factors. Patients who have underlying renal disease, sepsis, volume depletion or other conditions associated with renal hypoperfusion, or who have severe liver disease, are at particular risk. Exposure to <b>nephrotoxic</b> <b>agents</b> and wide fluctuations of intravascular volume are key conditions that can usually be minimized. Managing patients with chronic advanced renal failure (creatinine clearance 10 to 25 ml per minute) requires close interaction between the internists, anesthesiologists and surgeons. Understanding associated metabolic and organ system disorders is necessary to prevent complications and preserve remaining renal function. Chronic renal failure should not be a contraindication to an elective or emergent surgical procedure...|$|R
40|$|Acute kidney {{injury is}} a {{clinical}} syndrome which represents relevant and serious perioperative complication. It {{is associated with}} increased patient morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and not to mention greater healthcare costs. Yet, the patients who suffered from temporary acute kidney injury in the perioperative period, and regardless of the final outcome, usually complain afterwards about emotional distress, coupled with poor quality of life associated with loss of energy and limited normal physical activity. Therefore, {{the role of the}} physician to predict a kidney vulnerable patient in the perioperative period is a task of great importance, albeit not an easy one. The key management is risk stratification of the patient in conjunction with hemodynamic and oxygen optimization, in addition to avoiding <b>nephrotoxic</b> <b>agents</b> during the entire perioperative period...|$|R
