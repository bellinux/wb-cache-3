5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff, then went three-and-out. Virginia Tech recovered the kick at its 35-yard line, {{and began a}} drive that <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> three plays to score a touchdown. The key effort was a 51-yard sprint by running back Darren Evans, which advanced {{the ball to the}} Florida State 9-yard line. The score and extra point pushed Tech's lead to 14–3 with 4:37 remaining. Florida State responded with a quick touchdown drive of its own. From its 32-yard line, the Seminoles <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> six plays, three of them passes from E. J. Manuel, to reach the end zone. The score with 1:52 remaining trimmed Tech's lead to 14–10 at the 1:52 mark. As the quarter came to an end, Virginia Tech {{received the}} post-score kickoff and advanced the ball to its 22-yard line before the final seconds ticked off the clock and the first quarter ended with Tech leading 14–10.|$|E

5|$|Although St. Lucia {{suffered}} {{significant damage}} to its residential structures and agricultural land, its airports and hotels were operational within days having <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> small-scale repair work. Hospitals and other essential services kept running on standby power supplied by independent generators {{to assist in}} the cleanup and recovery efforts. Roads connecting the north and south of the island were quickly cleared. LUCELEC, the nation's only electricity provider, worked around the clock to repair dozens of downed electrical poles and restored electricity by August 21. The rest of the island's infrastructure weathered the storm. Two shelters were opened for hurricane-affected residence, and USAID/OFDA provided US$40,432 of assistance to the island.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system.|$|E

Testosterone <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E

5|$|Match, non-friction: The {{earliest}} type {{of match}} for lighting fire {{was made in}} China by 577 AD, invented by Northern Qi (550–577) court ladies as they desperately looked for materials to light fires for cooking and heating as enemy troops of Northern Zhou (557–581) and the Chen Dynasty (557–589) besieged their city from outside. Early matches in China were designed to be lit by an existing flame and carried to light another fire. They were pinewood sticks impregnated with sulfur and <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> a slight touch from a flame to light. This {{was written in the}} Records of the Unworldly and Strange by Tao Gu in 950 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period).|$|E

5|$|On {{the ensuing}} possession, Boston College <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> seven plays and just under {{three minutes to}} travel 74yards. The drive culminated in a 14-yard quarterback {{scramble}} for a touchdown. Duane Brown, who had blocked the first Boston College field goal attempt, again charged through the Boston College offensive line and blocked the extra point attempt. This time, the ball bounced {{into the hands of}} Virginia Tech's Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive two-point conversion. The play kept Boston College's lead within a single touchdown and extra point. With 5:27 remaining in the half, the score was now 169 in favor of Boston College.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Test of the 1948 Ashes series, held at The Oval in London, was {{the final}} Test in that cricket series between Australia and England. The match took place on 14–18August, with a rest day on 15August. Australia won the match by an innings and 149 runs to {{complete}} a 4–0 series win. It was the last Test in the career of Australian captain Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the best batsman {{in the history of}} the sport. Going into the match, if Australia batted only once, Bradman <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> four runs from his final innings to have a Test batting average of exactly 100, but he failed to score, bowled second ball for a duck by leg spinner Eric Hollies.|$|E

United now <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> four points, one of them gained at Ewood Park, relegating Blackburn Rovers in the process. Manchester United eventually secured the championship on the final day, coming back from a goal down against Tottenham to win 2–1. The achievement was all the more special for Ferguson, who lifted his fifth domestic championship in seven seasons.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost three}} years in the wilderness, Fingleton {{returned}} to the Test arena in the First Test at Durban. After making two in the first innings, he was unbeaten on 36 when Australia reached their second innings target with nine wickets in hand. During the first innings, a 140km/h gale hit the ground, uprooting trees and forcing balls that were heading into the wind to do U-turns. He followed this with 62—the innings top-score—and 40 in the Second Test at Johannesburg. After taking a 93-run first innings lead, Australia needed a Test record of 399 in the second innings to win on a turning wicket, and after the early demise of Brown, Fingleton joined McCabe in a 177-run partnership that pushed the score to 1/194. Such was the dominance of McCabe that he scored more than 80% of the runs during this partnership. Australia <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> 125 with half the day remaining and eight wickets in hand when poor visibility ended play. McCabe had flayed the attack and reached 189 not out when the South Africans had the match called off, claiming that the fieldsmen were endangered by the batsman's vigorous hitting.|$|E
5|$|Clemson fielded the {{following}} kickoff, and its offense continued {{with the success}} it found in its final drive of the first half. As in that drive, C. J. Spiller was a key performer. Clemson's drive began at its 40-yard line, and it took just five plays for the Tigers to score a touchdown. Four of those plays, including the culminating one, came from Spiller, who covered 40 yards during them. Spiller's touchdown cut Georgia Tech's lead to 23–20. But as quickly as Clemson scored, Georgia Tech moved even more quickly. From its 30-yard line, the Yellow Jackets <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> three plays, the keystone coming on a 70-yard throw from Nesbitt to Thomas for a touchdown. With 5:10 remaining in the quarter, the Yellow Jackets restored the 10-point margin, 30–20.|$|E
5|$|Liddell debuted for Scotland in a 5–4 wartime {{win over}} England at Hampden Park, {{equalising}} Tommy Lawton's opening goal. He gained several more wartime caps. He gained {{his first full}} cap against Switzerland scoring twice in a 3-1 win at Hampden Park on 15 May 1946 At international level, Liddell played predominantly as an outside left, in competition with Scotland-based Lawrie Reilly and Willie Ormond. The Scottish Football Association (SFA) denied Liddell and his teammates {{the opportunity to participate}} in the 1950 World Cup, hosted by Brazil, because of an earlier decision not to sanction involvement as British Home Championship runners-up. The decision meant qualification depended on the final match against England on 25 May 1950, which Scotland lost 1-0 when joint-first <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> a draw. Despite pressure from players, the SFA maintained its position.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{second drive}} {{of the half}} began at its 41-yard line after a 31-yard kickoff return by Wilson. On the first play of the drive, Taylor was sacked for a 13-yard loss. He made good the lost yardage on the next play, however, {{completing}} a 42-yard throw to Danny Coale. From the Stanford 40-yard line, Taylor gained fiveyards on a running play, then attempted a long pass downfield. The throw was intercepted by Stanford's Delano Howell at the Cardinal 3-yard line, returning Luck and the Stanford offense to the field. Luck <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> two plays to drive {{the length of the}} field and score a touchdown. A 56-yard run by Stepfan Taylor was followed by a 41-yard touchdown pass to Coby Fleener, and the following extra point kick was good, making the score 26–12 with 5:49 remaining.|$|E
5|$|With Goebel dead, {{tensions}} {{began to}} ease. The idea of Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, as governor was more palatable {{to much of}} the opposition than civil war in the state, though many of them may have preferred war to a Goebel governorship. After a lengthy meeting, a bipartisan compromise was drafted which would have ended the matter. The terms called for Republican recognition of Goebel's rightful election (and Beckham's subsequent right to govern). Republicans would also remove the militia from Frankfort. Democrats would, in turn, extend immunity to any Republican official found to have ties to the assassination, stop contesting elections for other state offices, and work to pass a nonpartisan election reform bill. The agreement <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> Taylor's signature to become effective. Unwilling to relinquish his office, Taylor balked.|$|E
5|$|Davidson was {{in strong}} all round {{form in the}} 1961–62 Australian season, which was a purely {{domestic}} one. Against Victoria in Sydney, he scored 106 in a hard hitting innings with the tail. He made 58 of the 59runs added in a last wicket partnership with Doug Ford, the other being a leg bye. The partnership lasted only 44 balls and Davidson managed to farm the strike and face 41 of these. The effort helped {{to set up a}} ten-wicket win. The following week against Western Australia in Perth, he made 108 after New South Wales had slumped to 6/38 to help the visitors recover to 218. New South Wales struggled in their second innings and Western Australia <b>needed</b> <b>only</b> 175 for victory. However, Davidson took his career best innings bowling figures of 7/31 to bowl out the hosts for 106 and seize a victory. In both matches against Queensland, Davidson took four quick wickets in the second innings to secure narrow victories after bold declarations. New South Wales won the Shield in that season with 64 of a maximum possible 80 points, playing aggressive cricket under Benaud. It was their ninth title in a row. Davidson was a key factor in the dominance, scoring 521runs at 40.07 and taking 42 wickets at 13.62.|$|E
