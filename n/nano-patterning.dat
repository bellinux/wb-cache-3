30|$|Polymers {{provide a}} {{fertile ground for}} {{biomimetic}} approaches as they offer {{a wide range of}} materials and easy fabrication routes capable of creating surfaces with controllable properties. In an earlier work, nano-scale polymer patterns resembling the protuberances on lotus leaves were created on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films spin-coated on silicon surfaces, using capillary force lithography (CFL) [13]. Figure  2 C shows a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the patterns fabricated at a holding time of 60  min. Such <b>nano-patterns</b> are hydrophobic when compared to silicon surface. Moreover, approximate calculation of contact area based on simple geometry reveals that the contact area can be lowered by 7 times in the case of <b>nano-patterns</b> as compared to silicon flat surface. By the virtue of their hydrophobicity and the capability to reduce contact area substantially, the <b>nano-patterns</b> reduced friction force by 14 – 24 times at nano-scale, when the friction force was measured using an atomic force microscope [13]. In these measurements, when the applied normal load was kept zero, friction force in silicon was measured to be 20 nN, whereas for <b>nano-patterns</b> it was ~ 0.84 nN. It is worth noting that the friction force exists even at the zero applied normal load, at nano-scale. This is due to the influence of intrinsic adhesion on friction force [13]. The large decrease in friction force induced by the <b>nano-patterns</b> in the absence/presence of an applied normal load is indicative of the ability of the patterned surfaces to significantly reduce inherent adhesion and friction.|$|R

30|$|The {{demonstration}} of imaging by helium (He) ions is relatively {{a new technique}} to characterize the surfaces at sub-nanoscale with extraordinary additional advantages of in situ ion lithography, <b>nano-patterning,</b> device prototyping, fabrication of quantum dots, beam-induced chemistry, and milling at nanoscale [15, 16]. Such a diverse usage is possible due to the light mass of the He ion and high speed, which results in smaller interaction volume with the surface layers and therefore in better resolution and potential milling feature size. From the perspective of sputtering and patterning, {{the result is a}} reduced proximity effect in the surface layer. The light ion mass results in low energy transfer and hence a relatively lower sputtering yield compared to gallium. Exploiting the method of <b>nano-patterning</b> of graphene with helium ions leads considerable promise for a number of applications in nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and mechanics. It has been emphasized [17 – 22] that in an application like high-speed field-effect transistors, there is a strong need for graphene to be patterned at the nanoscale.

40|$|Transparent {{conductive}} electrodes {{are critical}} to the operation of optoelectronic devices, such as photovoltaic cells and light emitting diodes. Effective electrodes need to combine excellent electrical and optical properties. Metal oxides, such as indium tin oxide, are commonly used. There is substantial interest in replacing them, however, motivated by practical problems and recent discoveries regarding the optics of <b>nano-patterned</b> metals. When designing <b>nano-patterned</b> metallic films for use as electrodes, one needs to account for both optical and electrical properties. In general, it is insufficient to optimize nano-structured films based upon optical properties alone, since structural variations will also affect the electrical properties. In this work, we investigate the need for simultaneous optical and electrical performance by analyzing the optical properties of a class of <b>nano-patterned</b> metallic electrodes that is obtained by a constant-sheet-resistance transformation. Within such a class the electrical and optical properties can be separated, i. e., the sheet resistance can be kept constant and the transmittance can be optimized independently. For simple one-dimensional periodic patterns with constant sheet-resistance, we find a transmission maximum (polarization-averaged) when the metal sections are narrow (100 nm). Our design carries over to more complex two-dimensional (2 D) patterns.

3000|$|The anti-reflection {{behavior}} of Si-nano-patterned structures {{can be understood}} as below. First, the Si <b>nano-patterned</b> structures can be considered as a graded-index layer between the Si substrates and air due to the gradually changed volume ratio. The graded index layer can effectively eliminate the light reflection as revealed by Fresnel theory [20]. Second, the suppression of light reflection can also be attributed to the strong scattering between the incident light and formed <b>nano-patterned</b> structures because the light wavelength is comparable with the geometric size of Si nanostructures. According to Mie’s scattering theory, the strong forward scattering results in the enhanced optical absorption of incident light which can significantly reduce the surface reflection [21]. With increasing the depth of Si <b>nano-patterned</b> structures, the incident light can be trapped more effectively which improves the anti-reflection behaviors as shown in our simulation results. If the depth remains constant, which indicates the thickness of the graded index layer does not change. However, if the diameter of Si <b>nano-patterned</b> structures becomes small, the scattering between the incident light and <b>nano-patterned</b> structures is enhanced. Therefore, the reflectance is decreased in the whole spectral range as shown in Fig.  5. Usually, the significantly anti-reflection behaviors were usually realized in the nanostructures with high aspect ratio. Our simulation results suggest that the good anti-reflection characteristics can also be achieved by using Si nanostructures with lower aspect ratio, which is in well agreement with the previous work [17], in which, they found that the optical absorption can be obviously enhanced by forming low aspect ratio hemispherical nanopit structures. It is worth noticing that the reflectance will be strongly suppressed when the wavelength is comparable with diameter (Fig.  5 [...]...|$|R

30|$|In summary, the anti-reflection {{behaviors}} of Si <b>nano-patterned</b> structures prepared by nano-sphere lithography technique are studied via FDTD solutions {{as well as}} experimental observations.

With increasing the etching depth from 0 to 150  nm and reducing the diameter of nanostructures from 500 to 200  nm, the surface reflection can be obviously suppressed. In the experiment, we fabricated substrates with diameter of 300  nm and depths of 51, 91, 115, and 150  nm, and the reflectance is lower than 10  % in the measurement spectral range which is consistent with the simulation results. By depositing Si QDs/SiO 2 multilayers on the <b>nano-patterned</b> structures, the reflectance can be further reduced and the reflectance at 820  nm can be as low as 3.6  %. The maximum PL intensity of quantum dots can be achieved and is improved by 6.6 -folds for samples deposited on the <b>nano-patterned</b> structures with depth of 91  nm compared with that of flat one. However, further increasing the etching depth results in the reduction of PL intensity although the surface reflection is still reduced, which can be ascribed to the strong surface recombination of carriers.
