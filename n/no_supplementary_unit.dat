40|$|The article {{studies the}} role of <b>supplementary</b> {{communicative}} <b>units</b> functioning as discourse markers in analytical articles and opinion columns of modern Russian and English newspapers. The dependence of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of different <b>supplementary</b> communicative <b>units</b> {{on the type of}} the article and on the language is discussed. The article proves that the use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> in opinion columns in Russian and in English has more common features than in analytical articles. The highest frequency of occurrence of these units is registered in Russian analytical articles, the lowest – in English articles. In Russian newspapers analytical articles and columns demonstrate more similar characteristics than in English materials. <b>Supplementary</b> communicative <b>units</b> with organizing functions occur more frequently in Russian articles, in English articles and columns they are equally rare. Regulative <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> are used equally often in all analyzed newspaper texts. There is a conclusion that regulative <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> tend to be more universal in their use in the two languages, while organizing units show greater dependence on the language. The presented analysis of the supplementary communicative units’ use can become one of the ways to take an inventory of persuasive language means in media discourse. These units produce a productive influence on the readers, help them interpret the text adequately; enhance their attention and mental activity...|$|R

500|$|When the {{directive}} was revisited during 1977, {{some of the}} older units that were being reviewed (such as millimetre of mercury for blood pressure) were retained but others were phased out, thereby broadly aligning the allowable units with SI. The directive was however overhauled to accommodate British and Irish interests in retaining the imperial system in certain circumstances. It was reissued as directive 80/181/EEC. During subsequent revisions, {{the directive}} has reflected changes in the definition of SI. The directive also formalised the use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>units,</b> which in 1979 were permitted for a period of ten years. [...] The cut-off date for the use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> was extended a number of times and in 2009 was extended indefinitely.|$|R

5000|$|On 8 May 2007, several British {{newspapers}} including The Times used {{correspondence between}} Giles Chichester MEP and EU Commissioner Günter Verheugen {{to report that}} the European Commission had decided to allow meat, fish, fruit and vegetables {{to continue to be}} sold in pounds and ounces. These reports did not mention that pounds and ounces would only retain <b>supplementary</b> <b>unit</b> status. On 10 September, the EU Commission published proposed amendments to the Units of Measurement Directive that would permit <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> (such as pounds and ounces) to be used indefinitely alongside, but not instead of, the units catalogued in the Units of Measurement Directive.
