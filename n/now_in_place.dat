5|$|In recent years, {{the high}} level of bog being {{destroyed}} by cutting has raised environmental concerns. The problem is particularly acute for raised bogs as they yield a higher-grade fuel than blanket bogs. Plans are <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in both the Republic and Northern Ireland to conserve most of the remaining raised bogs on the island.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, a {{low-level}} low-pressure area developed west of Wichita Falls {{at the intersection}} of a dry line extended southward across Central Texas and the stationary front extended eastward across the Red River valley. With the low-pressure system <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> the air mass over the Red River valley became increasingly unstable, featuring surface temperatures near 90°F (32°C) and high dew points caused by the northerly surge of moisture induced by the subtropical jet. The combination of high temperatures and a moist atmosphere resulted in a favorable environment for thunderstorm development. However, despite the heat, temperatures alone were insufficient in breaking the capping inversionan area of warmer air aloft that prevents the relativity cooler air near the surface from rising. Instead, the approaching shortwave trough provided the impetus necessary to force convection to occur, allowing for the formation of showers and thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|The {{businessman}} and politician William Smith was appointed Lord Warden in 1891, but died in Walmer Castle {{during his first}} visit here in October of that year. Smith had proposed that the historical artefacts in the castle should be protected from being removed by later Lord Wardens and suggested that government pass an Indenture of Heirlooms Bill. The government carried out the plan after Smith's death, protecting almost 70 pieces of furniture and 50 artworks at the castle and forbidding them being moved from the castle without the Secretary of State for War's approval. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, became the next Lord Warden; with adequate legal protection <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> the 3rd Duke of Wellington suggested returning his grandfather's possessions to the castle, but Lady Salisbury declined the offer.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, {{and then there is}} the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other words, we filter what we see and hear.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{origins of}} Burmese folk faith and nat worship are not {{definitively}} known. However {{at the time}} King Anawrahta (1044-1077) was ruling, nat worship was rampant. He became frustrated with this widespread worship of nats, and tried to eliminate them. The people continued to worship the nats, and so the king ordered the destruction of all statues and images of nats. Despite this people still worshiped them, by using a coconut as a symbol for them. <b>Now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> of a typical nat statue, there sat a coconut, which served as an offering to the nat, {{as well as a}} symbol for the nat itself.|$|E

25|$|Many astronomers {{request that}} nearby {{communities}} use low pressure sodium lights or amber Aluminium gallium indium phosphide LED {{as much as}} possible, because the principal wavelength emitted is comparably easy to work around or in rare cases filter out. The low cost of operating sodium lights is another feature. In 1980, for example, San Jose, California, replaced all street lamps with low pressure sodium lamps, whose light is easier for nearby Lick Observatory to filter out. Similar programs are <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in Arizona and Hawaii. Such yellow light sources also have significantly less visual skyglow impact, so reduce visual sky brightness and improve star visibility for everyone.|$|E

25|$|London has {{proposed}} Games based on providing world-class facilities {{and services for}} the athletes, and a legacy for sport and the community. Whilst the Olympic Park would undoubtedly leave a strong sporting and environmental legacy for London, {{the magnitude of the}} project, including the planned upgrade and expansion of transport infrastructure, would require careful planning to ensure all facilities and rehabilitation projects were completed on time. Air quality in London at proposed Games-time is generally satisfactory. Increasing levels of ozone pollution are however a concern, but legislation and actions <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> are aimed at correcting that trend.

25|$|In his letters, Palmerstonhad {{instructed}} the joint plenipotentiaries Elliotand his cousin AdmiralGeorge Elliotto acquire the cession {{of at least}} one island for trade on the Chinese coast. With the British expeditionary force <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> a combined naval and ground assault was launched on the Chusan Archipelago. Zhoushan Island, the largest and best defended of the islands was the primary target for the attack, as was its vital port of Dinghai. When the British fleet arrived off of Zhoushan, Elliot demanded the city surrender. The commander of the Chinese garrison refused the command, stating that he could not surrender and questioning what reason the British had for harassing Dinghai, as they had been driven out of Canton. Fighting began, a fleet of 12 small junks were destroyed by the Royal navy, and British marines captured the hills to the south of the Dinghai. The British captured the city itself after an intense naval bombardment on 5 July forced the surviving Chinese defenders to withdraw. The British occupied Dinghai harbor and prepared {{to use it as a}} staging point for operations in China. In the fall of 1840 disease broke out in the Dinghai garrison, forcing the British to evacuate soldiers to Manila and Calcutta. By the beginning of 1841 only 1900 of the 3300 men whom had original occupied Dinghai were left, with many of those remaining having been rendered incapable of fighting. An estimated 500 British soldiers died from disease, with the Cameron and Bengali volunteers suffering the most deaths as opposed to the Royal Marines, who were relatively unscathed.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two local}} {{secondary}} schools. Norton Hill School has approximately 1,400 {{students from the}} age of 11 to 18. In 1999 it became a Technology College and in 2007 changed specialism to become a Maths and Computing College. In 2006 Norton Hill was also awarded a second specialism as a Language College. The school was described by Ofsted in 2007 as outstanding in every respect. The school has received both the Sportsmark Award by Sport England and Artsmark Silver Award. Somervale School which has foundation status, is a specialist Arts College. In 2008, the school was the first in Bath and North East Somerset to win the Eco-Schools Silver Award. The number of pupils on the school roll has fallen to 603. This fall prompted the school to propose a federation with nearby Norton Hill School in March 2009 called the Midsomer Norton Schools Partnership [...] This is <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> with Alun Williams as the overall head teacher of both schools within the federation.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian {{government}} {{initiated a}} search for a new anthem around the time of its adoption of a new green-and-white flag in November 1968, but continued to use [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] until June 1969, when the mostly white electorate voted in favour of a republican form of government. The royal anthem officially remained in place until the formal declaration of a republic in March 1970, when it was abandoned along with numerous other overt references to the Crown. Republican Rhodesia was without an anthem for over four years before the chosen music was announced on 28 August 1974: the Fourth Movement, commonly called [...] "Ode to Joy", from Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The fact that the Council of Europe had adopted this tune as the [...] "Anthem of Europe" [...] in January 1972 apparently did not perturb the Rhodesian government; John Sutherland and Stephen Fender comment that Rhodesia's choice proved deeply embarrassing for the British Labour government, whose leaders now had to respect a melody associated with Rhodesia when attending official European functions. With a tune <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> the Rhodesian government organised a nationwide competition to write matching lyrics, the winner of which would receive a cash prize of R$500 (equal to about US$1,000).|$|E
