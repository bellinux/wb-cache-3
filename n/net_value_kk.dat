40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} structural changes {{on the distribution of}} <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added and the difference between <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added and agricultural income over time. We present and discuss the changes in the distribution of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added (land, labor, capital, and farm income) over time. <b>Net</b> <b>value</b> added by U. S. agriculture grew significantly from $ 18 billion in 1960 to $ 95 billion in 1996. We examine regional differences in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added using the Theil entropy measure. The inequality (dispersion) of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added increased over time. The increased inequality in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added represented both increases in regional dispersion in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added and increases in the average inequality in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added in each region. Thus, the <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added is becoming less alike across the United States. We also examine the inequality in the components of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added. The greatest dispersion occurred in returns to land followed by returns to capital. Therefore, changes in the dispersion of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added by agriculture ar...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{changes in}} <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added generated through Canadian and U. S. farm production, 1970 - 2000. We {{consider how the}} structural changes in Canadian and U. S. agriculture have affected the size and distribution of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added and its components: rent, capital, labor, and to net farm income. We use the Theil Measure of Inequality (TMI) to compare and explain changes in 1) the between and within-region distribution of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added, and 2) changes {{in the distribution of}} factor shares of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added in Canada and in the U. S. Results show that in Canada (1960 - 2000), <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added has become somewhat more equally distributed relative to the number of farms per province, but has varied widely from 1972 - 1988. Between-region inequality in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added accounted for from 0. 5 to 85. 5 percent of this inequality from 1960 - 2000. In the U. S. (1949 - 2000), <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added has become more unequally distributed. About half of the variation in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added in the U. S. is due to between-region variation and about half to within-region variation in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added. We find that most of the variation in the components of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added (returns to capital, labor, nonoperator landlords, and to farm operators) in Canada and the United States is due to variations across regions, rather than to variations in the components of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added themselves. These variations have generally been due to macroeconomic differences in regions, such as shifts in enterprise specialization, urbanization, changes in government programs, and to other structural changes in agriculture.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple bioeconomic model {{to investigate the}} economic and ecological issues associated with the commercial harvest of Pacific sardines relative to their value as forage for commercially, recreationally, and ecologically important predators in the California Current ecosystem. The model {{was used to evaluate}} how changes in the <b>net</b> per unit <b>value</b> of sardines, the <b>net</b> per unit <b>value</b> of sardine predators, and the transfer efficiency of predators affect the total <b>net</b> <b>value</b> of sardines, i. e. the <b>net</b> <b>value</b> of catches and the <b>net</b> <b>value</b> from sardine predation. Given recent market conditions for sardines and their commercial predators, and transfer efficiencies derived from predation data of the 1960 s, {{it was found that the}} value of commercially caught predators and the efficiency by which they convert sardines to exploitable biomass were most important in determining the viability of the sardine fishery. The values assumed for predators that are not commercially caught were of no consequence under these conditions. Taking the value of sardines as forage into account does not necessarily mean an either-or situation for the fishery. As long as there is some measure of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> from the fishery and <b>net</b> <b>value</b> from predation, both benefit society at large.

In the result of the EU enlargement not only a united legislative and economical body was formed on European basis, but also the support payments in many branches of economy in the new member states have increased substantially, including those in agriculture and rural development. A brief characteristics of place of agriculture in the economy of the Baltic states and Poland is given in the article, {{as well as that of}} the changes in total amount of support achieved before the entry into the EU.

Four distinct concepts are relevant and useful depending on circumstances: marginal and total values of travel, and gross versus <b>net</b> <b>values.</b> A utility-theoretic inverse demand systems approach is implemented to estimate the separate demands for recreation trips and time onsite at the destination, and implemented using data on pink salmon fishing in Alaska.

In addition to estimating net benefit under current conditions, the CVM {{was also used}} to examine changes in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> under two hypothetical management scenarios: an increased chance of catching more trout and an increased chance of catching a large (> 406 mm total length) trout. Trout anglers (n = 2, 570) were contacted on-site {{at each of the}} tailwaters between January 2001 and January 2002.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the use of the CAPM for {{investment}} decisions and evaluations. Four different measures are deductively drawn from this model: the disequilibrium <b>Net</b> Present <b>Value,</b> the equilibrium <b>Net</b> Present <b>Value,</b> the disequilibrium <b>Net</b> Future <b>Value,</b> the equilibrium <b>Net</b> Future <b>Value.</b> It is shown that all of them may be used for accept-reject decisions, but only the equilibrium <b>Net</b> Present <b>Value</b> and the disequilibrium <b>Net</b> Future <b>Value</b> may be used for valuation, given that they enjoy the additivity property. The two nonadditive indexes cannot be deducted from the CAPM assumptions if the decision problem “invest/no invest” is reframed as “invest in Z/invest in Y”. Despite their additivity, the equilibrium <b>Net</b> Present <b>Value</b> and the disequilibrium <b>Net</b> Future <b>Value</b> are unreliable for both valuation and decision, because they do not signal arbitrage opportunities whenever there is some state of nature for which they are decreasing functions with respect to the end-of-period cash flow.
