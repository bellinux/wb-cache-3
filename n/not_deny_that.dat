5|$|He {{was tried}} before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948. Knöchlein's defence hinged on {{the claim that}} he was not present at the massacre, {{although}} his lawyers did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> the event took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E
25|$|He did not {{consider}} himself a materialist: the social question was not only an economic issue but also an ethical one. He rejected the concept of class struggle. He did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> there was a struggle, but he saw it as {{the first stage of}} evolution, which was not be encouraged, but passed in favour of a greater spread of altruism. A position that proved irreconcilable with Marxism, which led him to adhere to the newborn Republican Party. He also opposed revolutionary syndicalism and severely criticized the general strike of 1904.|$|E
25|$|The bid was {{launched}} {{at a moment}} when there were strong pressures from Indonesian football fans for Halid to step down from his position as chairman of PSSI. There was no official support from the government of Indonesia until 9 February 2010, the deadline for the country's government to file a letter of support for the bid. Secretary General of PSSI Nugraha Besoes did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> Indonesia could be disqualified from the bidding process because the Indonesian government did not support the bid. On 19 March 2010, FIFA rejected Indonesia's bid to host the 2022 World Cup because the government stated that their concern is {{for the people of the}} country and so could not support the bid as FIFA requested. As a consequence, PSSI threw their support behind Australia's bid for the 2022 tournament.|$|E

25|$|Slovak sources {{usually do}} <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> many Hungarian {{teachers}} (replaced in Slovak schools by Slovak and Czech teachers), railwaymen (on strike against new Czechoslovak republic in February 1919), postmen, policemen, soldiers and civil clerks (replaced by Czech and Slovak soldiers, policemen and clerks) {{were forced to}} leave or left for Hungary voluntarily, the numbers however are unclear but census do show a rapid {{decline in the number}} of people with Hungarian as a mother tongue. Some teachers and civil servants were expelled from Czechoslovakia while some left due to the harsh circumstances. There are many examples of Hungarians who were forced to leave their homes from this territory (two famous ones are the families of Béla Hamvas, and of Albert Szent-Györgyi). The high number of refugees (and even more from Romania) necessitated entire new housing projects in Budapest (Mária-Valéria telep, Pongrácz-telep), which gave shelter to refugees numbering at least in the ten-thousands.|$|E

However, the Armenian patriarchate is the de facto administrator of the quarter and acts as a [...] "mini-welfare state" [...] for the Armenian residents. The Arab-Israeli conflict significantly impacted the quarter's politically uninvolved Armenian population. A 1992 article published by the Catholic Near East Welfare Association stated that [...] "Armenians in Jerusalem try to maintain good relations with Arabs and Israelis, but they do <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> their community has been affected by tensions in the city." ...|$|E

[...] The phrase was inscribed over the chapel door at Sandhurst, the British {{military}} academy, in 1913. [...] The phrase is again referenced when Duffy writes [...] "Dulce— No— Decorum— No— Pro patria mori." [...] The writer Will Heaven said that, whilst the poem denies that death in war is [...] "sweet and proper" [...] (dulce et decorum), it does <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> the soldiers died for their country (pro patria mori).|$|E

500|$|Admitting {{that the}} {{existence}} of qualia seems obvious, Dennett nevertheless states that [...] "qualia" [...] is a theoretical term from an outdated metaphysics stemming from Cartesian intuitions. He argues that a precise analysis shows that the term is in the long run empty and full of contradictions. The eliminativist's claim with respect to qualia {{is that there is no}} unbiased evidence for such experiences when regarded as something more than propositional attitudes. In other words, they do <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> pain exists, but that it exists independently of its effect on behavior. Influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, Dennett and Rey have defended eliminativism about qualia, even when other portions of the mental are accepted.|$|E
500|$|Like other American {{films of}} 1999—such as Fight Club, Bringing Out the Dead, and Magnolia, American Beauty instructs its {{audience}} to [...] " [...] more meaningful lives". The film argues {{the case against}} conformity, but does <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> people need and want it; even the gay characters just want to fit in. Jim and Jim, the Burnhams' other neighbors, are a satire of [...] "gay bourgeois coupledom", who [...] " [...] in the numbing sameness" [...] that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples. The feminist academic and author Sally R. Munt argues that American Beauty uses its [...] "art house" [...] trappings to direct its message of nonconformity primarily to the middle classes, and that this approach is a [...] "cliché of bourgeois preoccupation; the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual 'self' through denial and renunciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose, and sly enough to present themselves sympathetically as a rebel." ...|$|E
500|$|Contemporary and near-contemporary chroniclers were {{generally}} negative in their attitudes towards Gaveston, blaming the royal favourite {{for many of}} the problems of the reign. Gaveston was accused of such various crimes as draining the treasury, orchestrating the arrest of treasurer Walter Langton, and filling the court with foreigners. According to the Lanercost Chronicle, [...] "There was not anyone who had a good word to say about the king or Piers." [...] Nevertheless, the chroniclers did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> he had certain good qualities. Irish chroniclers were appreciative both of his military and his administrative skills during his period in Ireland. Likewise, Geoffrey the Baker called him [...] "graceful and agile in body, sharp witted, refined in manner, [...] sufficiently well versed in military matters". Marlowe, however, focused exclusively on the negative aspects of Gaveston's biography, portraying him – according to Hamilton – as [...] "a sycophantic homosexual with a marked tendency towards avarice, nepotism, and especially overweening pride". This was the impression that lived on in the popular imagination.|$|E

500|$|After {{the deaths}} of Calvin and his successor, Beza, the Geneva city council {{gradually}} gained control over areas of life that were previously in the ecclesiastical domain. Increasing secularisation was accompanied by {{the decline of the}} church. Even the Geneva académie was eclipsed by universities in Leiden and Heidelberg, which became the new strongholds of Calvin's ideas, first identified as [...] "Calvinism" [...] by Joachim Westphal in 1552. By 1585, Geneva, once the wellspring of the reform movement, had become merely its symbol. Calvin had always warned against describing him as an [...] "idol" [...] and Geneva as a new [...] "Jerusalem". He encouraged people to adapt to the environments in which they found themselves. Even during his polemical exchange with Westphal, he advised a group of French-speaking refugees, who had settled in Wesel, Germany, to integrate with the local Lutheran churches. Despite his differences with the Lutherans, he did <b>not</b> <b>deny</b> <b>that</b> they were members of the true Church. Calvin's recognition of the need to adapt to local conditions became an important characteristic of the reformation movement as it spread across Europe.|$|E
