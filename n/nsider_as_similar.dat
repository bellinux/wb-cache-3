40|$|Wing ducts for liquid-cooled engine {{radiators}} {{have been}} investigated in the N. A. C. A. full-scale wind tunnel on a large model airplane. Th e tests were made to determine {{the relative merits of}} several types of duct and radiator installations for an airplane of a particular des ign. In the test program the principal duct dimensions were system atically varied, and the results are therefore somewhat applicable to the general problems of wing duct design, although they should be co <b>nsidered</b> <b>as</b> preliminary and only indicative of the inherent possibil ities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{government}} innovation proceeds in {{line with}} the administrative reformation movement. The innovative government frequently finds the momentum in the government in w'iict: the administration has experienced reformation.

The administrative reformation experiences stagnation, even in some case, it shows paradoxico! situation. Congruent to the administrative reformation development, the governmental innovation development (central and local) has not reached the maximal result.

The complexity of the co <b>nsidered</b> problem, <b>as</b> well as, operational considerations lead to propose an on-line decentralized management structure where the criticality of each aircraft demand for service is evaluated using a fuzzy formalism. Then after detailing the proposed collaborative scheme between ground handling fleet managers, airlines and airport authorities, a heuristic approach is proposed to solve each fleet assignment problem. A case study considering a large airport is discussed...|$|R
