25|$|As {{with the}} rest of the South West, there is a fairly low {{diversity}} of bird species. Endemism is similarly low, as most South West bird species are habitat generalists with wide distributions. Exceptions include the red-eared firetail (Stagonopleura oculata) and the white-breasted robin (Eopsaltria georgiana), both of which occur only in the karri forest; the western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), western whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis) and western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), all of which inhabit the region's heath vegetation; and the <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-bird</b> (Atrichornis clamosus), which inhabits densely vegetated gullies. Other forest birds include the purple-crowned lorikeet.|$|E
50|$|Endangered {{species such}} as the <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-bird,</b> western bristlebird and the western whipbird are known to inhabit the area. The {{endangered}} Western ringtail possum is also frequently sighted in the area.|$|E
50|$|John Gilbert, a naturalist, {{surveyed}} {{the area in}} the 1840s giving his name to the Gilbert's potoroo and discovering the <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-bird.</b> Two Peoples Bay was declared a nature reserve in 1967.|$|E
50|$|In July and August 2006 eight <b>Noisy</b> <b>Scrub-birds</b> were {{released}} in the Porongurup Range by the Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia, {{as part of a}} trans-location program for the conservation of this endangered species.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it contains almost the entire population of <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-birds,</b> a large proportion of western bristlebirds and most of the western subspecies of western whipbirds. It also supports over 1% of the world populations of flesh-footed shearwaters and, probably, of great-winged petrels, as well as significant numbers of short-billed black cockatoos, Australasian bitterns, western rosellas, red-capped and rock parrots, red-winged fairywrens, western spinebills, western thornbills, white-breasted robins and red-eared firetails. [...] Hooded plovers are regularly seen. Mammals found in the IBA include Gilbert's potoroos, quokkas, western ringtail possums, honey possums, western brush wallabies and quendas.|$|R

He set up the Division of Wildlife's first sound laboratory 1961-1965 and was instrumental in establishing the CSIRO Wildlife Sound Library. In 1965 he transferred to Western Australia where he retired in 1971. During his career with CSIRO {{he was involved in}} pioneering studies, involving sound recording, of superb lyrebirds and <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-birds.</b> He wrote many scientific papers, mainly dealing with bird song and vocal mimicry. Following retirement he continued his interest in sound recording and was generous in passing on his expertise to others.

50|$|Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve is a {{protected}} area {{managed by the}} Department of Parks and Wildlife 35 km east of Albany, Western Australia. The area is accessible by 2WD vehicles. The bay itself, including two small secluded beaches, faces due east and is protected from the Southern Ocean by a headland formed by the granite massif of Mount Gardiner. The nature reserve was established in 1967 to protect the threatened <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-bird</b> and its habitat.|$|E
5000|$|The reserve forms {{part of the}} Two Peoples Bay and Mount Manypeaks Important Bird Area, {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because of its significance in the conservation of several rare and threatened bird species. [...] It supports a population of <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-birds,</b> a species that {{was thought to be}} extinct until rediscovered in 1961. The population then was estimated at less than 100, while in 1994 it was thought to be around 1100 (of which 450 occur in the reserve). [...] Other threatened birds inhabiting the reserve are the western ground parrot, western bristlebird, western whipbird and Australasian bittern.Other threatened bird species that have been observed within the park include short-billed black cockatoo, peregrine falcon, hooded plover, little bittern and red-eared firetail. Seabirds nesting on the islands around the bay include the great-winged petrel and flesh-footed shearwater.|$|R

40|$|The <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-bird</b> is an {{endangered}} songbird {{restricted to the}} south coast of Western Australia and {{has a history of}} population bottlenecks. This study evaluated the impact that genetic bottlenecks had on genetic diversity of this species using neutral (microsatellite) and adaptive (Major Histocompatibility Complex) genes and how this diversity may influence extinction risk. The results have been used to provide recommendations for future conservation management strategies for this species...|$|E
40|$|The Endangered <b>Noisy</b> <b>Scrub-bird</b> {{is a small}} {{passerine}} that {{is seldom}} seen but often heard in its range on the south coast of Western Australia. The difficulties in observing this cryptic bird mean that {{little is known about}} its social system. The loud, conspicuous territorial song of the male provides a convenient, non-intrusive means by which to study this species. The aim of this project was to investigate the patterns of song sharing and repertoire change in the <b>Noisy</b> <b>Scrub-bird</b> to provide indications of the social structure. It was found that groups of up to ten territorial males shared the same set of about five song types. Song groups were discrete, with members of a song group sharing most, if not all, of their song types. Males from different song groups had no song types in common. Repertoire change was rapid and, {{with the exception of one}} individual, was found in every territorial male studied in the Mt Gardner population. It occurred simultaneously in all members of a song group, with males making the same changes to their shared songs. The source of repertoire change was mainly modification of existing song types with occasional divergence of a single song type into two distinct song types, as well as some innovation providing new song types. The average life of a song type was approximately 6 months. Although some song types persisted for the entire 16 month sampling period, they were continually modified and a year later could no longer be recognised as the same type. Translocation of eight male scrub-birds to the Porongurup National Park provided an opportunity to combine individuals that initially did not share any songs. This allowed the process of song group formation to be studied. Within a one to two month period these males altered their songs so that they shared with their new neighbours. There was some evidence that the songs of dominant males were copied. Observation of the population established on Bald Island by translocation confirmed that there were no appreciable long-term effects on the songs of translocated Noisy Scrub-birds. Song group size, repertoire size and levels of song sharing were very similar to those found in the Mt Gardner population. The striking feature of <b>Noisy</b> <b>Scrub-bird</b> song groupings was their discreteness and cohesiveness even in the presence of continual repertoire change. It is suggested that each song group consists of a dominant male whose songs are more attractive to females and/or effective in territory defence. This dominant male is surrounded by subordinate males that copy his effective songs. Repertoire change can be explained by the dominant male continually making changes to his songs, with the other males copying these changes to retain their mimicked effectiveness. Each song group may in fact represent a dispersed lek. The scenario suggested to explain <b>Noisy</b> <b>Scrub-bird</b> song groupings bears striking similarities to the hotshot hypothesis to explain lek formation whereby males cluster around a successful male. This study demonstrates the potential of using song to investigate aspects of the social system of a species which is otherwise very difficult to observe. Management of an Endangered species such as the <b>Noisy</b> <b>Scrub-bird</b> will always benefit from increased knowledge about their social system. For example, this study showed that taking males from different song groups for translocation probably has little impact on their success at the new site because of their ability to rapidly alter their songs to form new song groups. An additional benefit of regularly monitoring the songs of translocated males was that it allowed ongoing identification of individuals, even though their songs were continually changing...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Noisy</b> <b>Scrub-bird</b> is an {{endangered}} species of songbird endemic to the south coast of Western Australia that has undergone a major and prolonged population bottleneck. Using shotgun 454 next-generation DNA sequencing we have identified and characterised ten polymorphic microsatellite loci in this species. Observed allelic diversity was relatively low (2 – 5 alleles per locus) and significant deviations from Hardy–weinberg Equilibrium observed, although the presence of null alleles was onlypostulated for two loci. The microsatellite loci characterised in this study will be useful in a future population genetics studies in this endangered species...|$|E
40|$|The diet of {{nestling}} noisy scrub-birds, Atrichornis clamosus, {{was determined}} from observations at 12 nests and from examination of 718 faecal sacs. Nestlings were fed invertebrates of 18 orders {{plus a few}} small vertebrates. There {{was no significant difference}} in the proportions of the various taxa as determined from observational and faecal sac data. The most common prey from the combined data were Araneida (35 %), Orthoptera (29 %), larvae (13 %), Blattodea (7 %), Hymenoptera (4 %), Chilopoda (3 %), and Lumbricidae (2 %). There were significant differences between the proportions of the main prey items between years, within years and within territories. There were no significant differences in the type of prey fed at different ages. The data suggest that the female <b>noisy</b> <b>scrub-bird</b> is a generalist predator when feeding her young...|$|E
40|$|Western Australian Wildlife Management Programs are {{a series}} of {{publications}} produced by the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM). The programs are prepared in addition to Regional Management Plans to provide detailed information and guidance for the management and protection of certain exploited or threatened species (e. g. Kangaroos, <b>Noisy</b> <b>Scrub-bird</b> and the Rose Mallee). This program provides {{a brief description of the}} appearance, distribution, habitat and conservation status of flora declared as rare under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act (Threatened Flora) and poorly known flora (Priority Flora) in CALM's Central Forest Region and makes recommendations for research and management action necessary to ensure their continued survival. By ranking the Declared Rare Flora in priority order according these requirements, Departmental staff and resources can be allocated to those taxa most urgently in need of attention. Priority Flora that are under consideration for declaration as rare are also dealt with, but to a lesser extent than the Declared Rare Flora. However, the information available should assist i...|$|E
