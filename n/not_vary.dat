5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization.

The energy consumption of the brain does <b>not</b> <b>vary</b> greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI.

5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The {{researchers}} found that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover increases to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did <b>not</b> <b>vary</b> appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E

Although it is the predominant predator of lemurs, reports of its dietary habits demonstrate a wide variety of prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season; diet does <b>not</b> <b>vary</b> by sex. While the fossa is thought to be a lemur specialist in Ranomafana National Park, its diet is more variable in other rain forest habitats.|$|E

5|$|Brain tissue consumes a {{large amount}} of energy in {{proportion}} to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (membrane potential) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does <b>not</b> <b>vary</b> greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET, fMRI, and NIRS. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of glucose (i.e., blood sugar), but ketones provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids (caprylic and heptanoic acids), lactate, acetate, and possibly amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{conserve}} heat {{by reducing}} {{the flow of blood}} to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths. Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads, and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed). A cat's body temperature does <b>not</b> <b>vary</b> throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night. Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible. Their kidneys are so efficient, they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater. While domestic cats are able to swim, they are generally reluctant to enter water as it quickly leads to exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only {{be compared with the}} quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does <b>not</b> <b>vary</b> its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, of executives in the legislative process.|$|E

5|$|The meteoroid's {{absolute}} magnitude (the apparent magnitude {{it would have}} {{at an altitude of}} 100km at the observer's zenith) was approximately−6 and did <b>not</b> <b>vary</b> significantly during the few seconds of observation. It traveled a distance of 409km in 9.8seconds during the time it was observed. It moved at a speed of 41.74km per second, which did not change measurably during the flight. Jiří Borovička and Zdeněk Ceplecha from the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia estimated that the deceleration caused by the friction of the atmosphere reached only 1.7m/s2 at the fireball's perigee (closest approach to Earth), and its velocity was reduced by only 0.012km per second (less than 0.03%). This corresponds well with computer simulations provided by D.W.Olson, R.L.Doescher and K.M. Watson at the Southwest Texas State University, who concluded that the deceleration was less than 0.5m/s2 except for a few seconds near perigee. This small loss of speed, 12m per second, corresponded to a loss of kinetic specific energy (in the earth's frame of reference) of 0.5 MJ/kg, which was converted to heat (and perhaps sound). The change in the object's velocity vector due to Earth's gravity during the hours it was in the earth's vicinity was on the order of kilometres per second (see Orbit).|$|E
