5|$|The Sun, which {{comprises}} <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{matter in}} the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> remaining matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense {{is known as the}} frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Within {{cartilaginous}} fish, approximately 7 {{out of the}} 41 {{families of}} neoselachians (modern sharks, skates, and rays) disappeared after this event and batoids (skates and rays) lost <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> identifiable species, while more than 90% of teleost fish (bony fish) families survived.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{may have}} once been a towering stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. <b>Nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E

5|$|Basement rock {{under the}} Mono–Inyo chain {{consists}} of the same granitic and metamorphic rock {{that make up the}} Sierra Nevada. Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old. Volcanism occurred north of the chain, in the Bodie Hills, as far back as 28 million years. <b>Nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rock east of the Sierra Nevada in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a long, narrow skull that lacked <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> specializations that {{characterized}} later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive archosaurs such as Euparkeria. It had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) in its skull, {{two pairs of}} which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two antorbital fenestrae {{and a pair of}} tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{a series}} of phone calls between band members {{resulted}} in some low-key rehearsals, and soon to a decision to reunite. By February 2004, a full tour was announced, and tickets for <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> initial tour dates sold out within minutes. The band's four-night run at London's Brixton Academy was the fastest selling in the venue's twenty-year history.|$|E

5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. <b>Nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E

5|$|The album's cover art was {{directed}} by John Gillespie. John Holmstrom and guitarist Johnny Ramone both worked on illustration, with the entire back cover contemplating a military theme, while the inner sleeve artwork depicted many of the themes portrayed in songs. The subject matter of songs varied throughout the album, though <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> tracks on the album incorporated humor into the lyrics. The musical style showed more of a surf rock influence, and many songs had minimal structuring.|$|E
5|$|The first sequel, Super Smash Bros. Melee, was {{released}} for the GameCube {{two years after}} the original.

It also features three unlockable stages from the original game. As of March 2008, 7.09 million copies of Super Smash Bros. Melee had been sold worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} English from {{the latter half}} of the 20th century has been helped in part by the {{cultural}} and economic influence of the United States, itself originally formed from British colonies.

5|$|The {{tendency}} to panic continued in <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju. Men left their positions and straggled to the rear. They abandoned weapons on positions. On many occasions units {{lost most of}} their equipment while on the move, even when not under fire, causing logistical shortages. In other cases the majority of a unit would desert its position {{at the first sign}} of North Korean fire.|$|E
5|$|According to the Yugoslav {{census of}} 1931, the {{population}} of eastern Herzegovina comprised 4 per cent Croats, 28 per cent Muslims, and 68 per cent Serbs. According to Professor Jozo Tomasevich, the estimated population of the districts of Bileća, Gacko and Nevesinje was only around 1.1 per cent Croat, so in those areas <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> NDH government appointments and local Ustaše units were staffed by Muslims, an ethnic group that made up about 23.7 per cent of the local population. The poor Muslim peasants of eastern Herzegovina largely sided with the Ustaše. The NDH government immediately tried to strengthen their position by vilifying the Serbs, who, according to Tomasevich, comprised around 75 per cent of the population.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E

5|$|By {{the close}} of the first day, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{fighting}} was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava, with the 128th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Ptuj, the 45th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion around Maribor and the 112th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battalion were at Slovenj Gradec and marching east towards Dravograd. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services.|$|E
5|$|Cliché (Hush Hush) is the reissue of Romanian {{recording}} artist Alexandra Stan's debut studio album, Saxobeats (2011). It was released for digital download on 2 October 2013 through Maan Studio; its deluxe edition was {{made available for}} digital and physical consumption on 23 October 2013 by Victor Entertainment. The record premiered following an alleged physical altercation with her former manager Marcel Prodan, which resulted in Stan {{taking a break from}} her career. Along with Andrei Nemirschi and Marcian Alin Soare, Prodan has written and produced <b>nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> songs on Cliché (Hush Hush).|$|E
5|$|Indiana troops {{participated in}} 308 {{military}} engagements, {{the majority of}} them between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains. Soldiers from Indiana were present on most of the Civil War battlefields, beginning with the first engagement involving Hoosier troops at the Battle of Philippi (West Virginia) on June 3, 1861, to the Battle of Palmetto Ranch (Texas) on May 13, 1865. <b>Nearly</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fighting was outside of the state's boundaries. Only one significant conflict, known as Morgan's Raid, occurred on Indiana soil during the war. The raid, which caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and southern Indiana, was preceded by two minor incursions into Indiana.|$|E
