5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center,</b> in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17mph (28km/h), intensifying as it did so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Bermuda, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later {{changed to a}} hurricane warning the following day. Dean’s approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights. In Atlantic Canada, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island, while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory.|$|E
5|$|Initially, forecasters at the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{predicted}} that Matthew {{would take a}} more eastern track and hit the Florida Panhandle. Because the track shifted westward, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a Tropical Storm Warning from the Florida/Alabama border to Intracoastal City, Louisiana {{on the day before}} landfall.|$|E

5|$|Later on September22, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> began {{noting the}} {{possibility}} of increasing wind shear due to a large upper trough. Despite this, the intensity predictions did not forecast weakening within the next three days. Isaac continued to strengthen and reached hurricane status at 1200UTC on September23. However, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> did not operationally upgrade Isaac until 2100UTC on September23, at which time the storm was a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, Isaac significantly intensified, and on the following day, it reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 120mph (205km/h). The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> then predicted Isaac would become a Category4 hurricane on September25, though this did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{noted that}} very cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted that minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted that further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|E

5|$|Fourteen hours {{prior to}} Edith making {{landfall}} in Central America, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> warned citizens about the extreme {{danger of the}} approaching hurricane, {{and asked them to}} prepare for hurricane conditions. While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.|$|E
5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued its final advisory, as {{the lower level}} center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains of Central America and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered into the Pacific Ocean within a few days. Although {{the depression}} never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean {{and contributed to the}} development of Hurricane Juliette on September21.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, about 16hours before Florence made landfall, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida. Three hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Pensacola to Cameron, Louisiana, with {{a tropical storm}} warning issued from Pensacola eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. Around the time of Florence moving ashore, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> limited the hurricane warning from Pensacola, Florida to Morgan City, Louisiana. Hours after the hurricane made landfall, the warning {{was replaced by a}} tropical storm warning from Mobile, Alabama to Grand Isle, Louisiana, which was discontinued two hours later.|$|E

5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press {{that it is too}} early to suggest that the storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> forecast the outer edge of the hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E
5|$|Three {{hours after}} developing, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a {{tropical}} storm watch from Titusville, Florida, to Brunswick, Georgia, due to uncertainty in the track of the storm. Hours after becoming {{a tropical storm}}, a tropical storm warning was issued from Fernandina Beach, Florida, {{to the mouth of}} the Savannah River, with a tropical storm watch further northward to the mouth of the South Santee River in South Carolina, though these were cancelled after Edouard turned to the east. About 10hours before landfall, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued another tropical storm warning from Titusville, Florida to Brunswick, Georgia, with a tropical storm watch further south to Sebastian Inlet, Florida.|$|E
5|$|When Bob was {{designated}} a tropical storm, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued gale warnings for the Florida Keys west of Craig Key, and from Flamingo to Venice. Gale warnings were later posted for the Atlantic coast of Florida northward through St. Augustine. Small craft south of St. Augustine were advised {{to remain in}} port. While the storm was situated off the east-central coast of Florida, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Savannah, Georgia to Little River, South Carolina. The hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning after Bob's intensification to Category 1 status.|$|E
50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center's</b> area of {{responsibility}} includes Southern Hemisphere areas in the Pacific down to 18.5 degrees south eastward of the 120th meridian west.

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June 12, and eventually developed into Tropical Depression One {{in the southeastern}} Gulf of Mexico. Operationally, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> designated this system as Tropical Depression Two, which led to confusion because of Subtropical Storm One in April, and then another Tropical Depression Two in July. Outflow from Hurricane Celia in the Pacific Ocean and a trough in the Gulf of Mexico generated wind shear on the depression, which prevented it from intensifying into a tropical storm. The depression curved north-northeastward and eventually made landfall in near Tampa, Florida on June 26 around 1500UTC. As it was moving ashore, the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> noted that the depression was too poorly organized to locate the center of circulation, and discontinued advisories on the system.|$|E
5|$|August 7, 1980- Hurricane Allen passes about 310miles (500km) {{south of}} Key West, Florida. The {{threat of the}} large {{hurricane}} prompts the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center</b> to issue gale warnings for the Florida Keys. The hurricane produces gale force winds across the keys, {{though there was no}} significant damage.|$|E
50|$|The Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory of NOAA has {{conducted}} a re-analysis project to re-examine the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center's</b> data about historic hurricanes. In {{association with the}} project, Brian Jarvinen, formerly of NHC, used modern hurricane and storm surge computer models to recreate a storm consistent with contemporaneous accounts of the colonial hurricane.|$|R
500|$|Southeasterly gales {{had a large}} {{impact on}} {{shipping}} interests off North Carolina. Several vessels were imperiled; in one case a pilot boat capsized after colliding with another ship. In light of this incident, the hurricane is listed in the <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Center's</b> contemporary compilation of tropical cyclones that [...] "may have" [...] caused at least 25 fatalities. The storm grounded the schooner H. Wescott near Cape Fear.|$|R
