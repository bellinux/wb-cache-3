5|$|The Cuban {{government}} joined <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> 28 January 1988, and {{all three}} parties held a round of <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> 9 March. The South African government joined <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> 3 May and the parties met in June and August in New York and Geneva. All parties agreed to a ceasefire on 8 August. Representatives from the governments of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa signed the New York Accords, granting independence to Namibia and ending the direct involvement of foreign troops in the civil war, in New York City on 22 December 1988. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 626 later that day, creating the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM), a peacekeeping force. UNAVEM troops began arriving in Angola in January 1989.|$|E

40|$|Evolution {{towards the}} {{next-generation}} Internet assumes dynamic end-to-end (E 2 E) {{quality of service}} <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> the path between the two providers, which are interconnected {{by a number of}} transit providers. Negotiation is performed by means of an appropriate signaling protocol. Basic models for E 2 E service negotiation include: (1) the cascade model, which assumes that a single provider controls service <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> the path, and (2) the third-party (3 P) model, in which the trusted intermediary performs service <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> behalf of all domains on the path. This article presents a comparative study of the aforementioned negotiation models, regarding transport of signaling traffic. The three realistic topologies of interconnected networks have been simulated, using the network simulator NS 2. Particularly, we point out the applicability and deployment of the 3 P model...|$|R
5|$|Napoleon, {{expecting to}} win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> the basis of accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed; they prevailed. Napoleon adamantly refused.|$|E
5|$|<b>Negotiations</b> <b>on</b> {{continuing}} the coalition broke down the next day, apparently over demands from the Social Democratic Alliance {{to take over}} the leadership of the government, and Geir Haarde tendered the government's resignation to the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. The President asked the present government to continue until a new government can be formed, and held talks with the five political parties represented in the Althing.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the Eisenhower {{administration}} proposed <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within the Eisenhower administration for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E

5|$|The International Control Commission, {{in order}} to avoid a major {{escalation}} of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene.

40|$|Auctions are a {{fundamental}} mechanism to automate negotiations in electronic commerce. We consider {{a class of}} multi-lateral negotiation situations, which requires <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> multiple attributes of a deal. These situations are typical for corporate procurement. Current auction implementations do not support these negotiations adequately. In the paper we propose multi-attribute auctions, an economic mechanism, which supports <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> multiple attributes of a deal. In this approach we combine decision analysis techniques and single -sided auction mechanisms to allocate tasks. We outline the theoretical questions associated with multiattribute auctions and describe an implementation of the proposed mechanism. In this context, we tackle several important issues concerning the design of electronic market places...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{political}} economic issues of service trade liberalization of {{a developing country}} {{in the context of}} the Doha Round negotiations. We first discuss the various unique characteristics of the service industries. Then we incorporate these features in a Grossman-Helpman style political economy model and solve for the politically-determined service sector protection. We then examine how various factors such as increased cross-cutting lobbying, the reduction of state-owned service providers and linking <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> agricultural protection with <b>negotiation</b> <b>on</b> service sector liberalization can help reduce the political constraints on liberalizing the service sectors. © 2008 The Authors.

5|$|The envoys of Louis and Venice had {{meanwhile}} started <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> a new peace treaty, {{which was}} signed in Turin on 24 August 1381. According to the treaty, Venice renounced Dalmatia and also promised to pay 7,000 golden florins as an annual tribute to Hungary. Louis also stipulated that Venice was to transfer the relics of St Paul of Thebes to the newly established Pauline monastery at Budaszentlőrinc.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive <b>negotiations,</b> <b>on</b> 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muktafi {{also kept}} up the {{perennial}} conflict with the Byzantine Empire, with varying success. In May 902, al-Qasim ibn Sima al-Farghani was appointed {{in command of the}} frontier districts of the Jazira. In 902 or 903, a naval raid reached the island of Lemnos, dangerously close to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople; the island was plundered and its inhabitants carried off into slavery. Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu'l-Asha'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to the frontier districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> a prisoner exchange. The exchange eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on the agreed terms. After further negotiations, the exchange was completed in August 908.|$|E

5|$|As a Klingon moon, Praxis, explodes without warning, the {{starship}} USS Excelsior, commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu, {{is struck by}} the shock wave and its crew discovers {{that much of the}} moon has been obliterated. The loss of their key energy production facility and the destruction of the Klingon homeworld's ozone layer throws the Klingon Empire into turmoil. No longer able to maintain a hostile footing, the Klingons sue for peace with their longstanding enemy, the United Federation of Planets. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons revert to a more belligerent approach, Starfleet sends the USS Enterprise-A to meet with the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> Earth.

5|$|As {{the leader}} of the NCP, the largest party in parliament, Jyrki Katainen was tasked with forming a new {{coalition}} government. He said that the result of the election supported a coalition consisting of the three largest parties, i.e. the National Coalition, the Social Democratic Party and the True Finns. The most problematic question was believed to be the EU bailout policy, where the True Finns most differ from the other parties. Formal <b>negotiations</b> <b>on</b> government formation started after 24 April and the Kiviniemi government submitted its resignation on 29 April, starting to serve as a caretaker government until a new one was formed.|$|E
5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention.

In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
