The model is tested using multivariate probit analysis and {{is supported by}} the data. Implications for attitude research and statistical methodology are discussed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the informa-tion processing carried out by consumers in the course of making decisions about whether or not an attribute of a product is satisfactory to them. This type of de-cision is studied because it occurs frequently in decision net depictions of consumer choice processes. The literature on decision nets is reviewed in Bettman (197 4 a,b), so it will not be reexamined here. It is in-structive, however, to examine the hypothetical decision <b>nets</b> <b>shown</b> in Figure 1. It can be seen from these examples that decision nets can involve several binary decisions about satisfaction with particular attributes. These binary choices are the subject of this paper. Multiple-attribute attitude models also deal with in-formation about product attributes. In particular, the Fishbein (1972) attitude model can be expressed a...|$|E

40|$|Guaco (Mikania laevigata) is a {{medicinal}} plant {{used to treat}} fever, rheumatism, flu and respiratory tract diseases. Understanding the physiology of this species and its responses to environmental conditions has become necessary to improving the cultivation methods. In this context, this work aimed to access the effects of shading by using colored nets in on photosynthetic pigment concentration, photosynthetic rate and ultrastructure of chloroplasts of Mikania laevigata. The plants were cultivated during four months under nets with 50 % shading in blue, red and gray color nets and under full sunlight (0 %). The plants grown under full sunlight had decreased contents of a and b chlorophyll, and of carotenoids, while those grown under blue <b>nets</b> <b>shown</b> higher concentrations of a and b chlorophyll. The lowest density of chloroplasts was found in plants cultivated under full sunlight. Elongated chloroplasts were noticed in treatments with 50 % shading. Regarding the potential rate of photosynthesis no significant change was observed among the plants grown under red, blue and gray nets, {{which leads to the}} conclusion that the spectrum transmitted by different coloured nets did not affect guaco photosynthetic apparatus. O guaco (Mikania laevigata) é uma planta medicinal, usada para o tratamento de febre, reumatismo, gripe e doenças do trato respiratório. O entendimento do comportamento fisiológico dessa espécie e as suas respostas às condições do ambiente tornam-se necessários ao aperfeiçoamento dos métodos de cultivo. Nesse contexto, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar os efeitos do sombreamento com uso de malhas coloridas na concentração de pigmentos fotossintéticos, na taxa de fotossíntese e na ultra-estrutura de cloroplastos de plantas de Mikania laevigata. As plantas foram cultivadas por quatro meses sob malhas de 50 % de sombreamento nas cores azul, vermelha e cinza e a pleno sol (0 %). As plantas mantidas a pleno sol tiveram os menores teores de clorofila a e b e o menor teor de carotenóides, enquanto aquelas cultivadas sob malha azul tiveram a maior concentração de clorofilas a e b. A menor densidade de cloroplastos foi encontrada nas plantas cultivadas a pleno sol. Nos tratamentos com 50 % de sombreamento, foram verificados cloroplastos mais alongados. Com relação à taxa de fotossíntese potencial, não foi observada nenhuma diferença significativa entre plantas crescidas sob as malhas vermelha, cinza e azul, fato que leva a acreditar que o espectro diferenciado transmitido pelas malhas coloridas não interferiu no aparelho fotossintético do guaco...|$|E

Methods In the laboratory, polyester and polyethylene net samples were treated with ICON ® Maxx, washed up to 20 times and their efficacy determined in World Health Organization (WHO) cone assays against a susceptible laboratory An. gambiae s. s. colony. Over a 12 -month period, the polyester nets were evaluated in a hut trial to determine mosquito deterrence, induced exophily, blood-feeding inhibition and mortality. Results In the laboratory, ICON ® Maxx-treated polyethylene <b>nets</b> <b>showed</b> higher efficacy against pyrethroid-susceptible mosquitoes than polyester nets.
