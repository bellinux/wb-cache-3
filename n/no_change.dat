5|$|Symptoms of {{diabetes}} insipidus should prompt a formal fluid deprivation test {{to assess the}} body's response to dehydration, which normally causes concentration of the urine and increasing osmolarity of the blood. If these parameters are unchanged, desmopressin (an ADH analogue) is administered. If the urine then becomes concentrated and the blood osmolarity falls, {{there is a lack}} of ADH due to lack of pituitary function ("cranial diabetes insipidus"). In contrast, there is <b>no</b> <b>change</b> if the kidneys are unresponsive to ADH due to a different problem ("nephrogenic diabetes insipidus").|$|E

5|$|Various {{chemical}} color {{tests can}} be used to help identify fruit bodies suspected to be S.amygdalinus. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) will turn the cap flesh dingy orange, while it turns the cap cuticle red, or darker. Ammonia (as ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH) produces a dingy yellow on the flesh, and brown on the cap. Iron sulphate (FeSO4) produces either <b>no</b> <b>change</b> to a pale grey color with both the flesh and the cuticle. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) causes the flesh to turn orange or pink, but has no color reaction with the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with <b>no</b> <b>change</b> in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E
