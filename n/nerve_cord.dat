5|$|In Legacy of the Void, {{she serves}} as the Executor in the {{invasion}} of Aiur but falls under Amon's control, like many other Protoss. She leads the golden armada against Artanis's forces, who holds them out {{long enough for the}} Keystone to break them free from Amon's control. Under Artanis's urging, Selendis severs her <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> and urges her fellow templar to sever their cords as well, permanently freeing them from Amon's grasp.|$|E
5|$|Artanis is {{the central}} {{character}} of , {{the third and final}} part of StarCraft II. He leads the Protoss to invade Aiur but as the invasion went on, many Protoss fell under Amon's control. Amon has seized the Khala and is controlling the Protoss via their nerve cords. Artanis initially fell under their control but Zeratul severed his <b>nerve</b> <b>cord,</b> dying in the process. Shortly afterwards, Artanis leaves Aiur behind in the ship Spear of Adun and begins his quest to destroy Amon.|$|E
5|$|The {{nervous system}} of an insect {{can be divided}} into a brain and a ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cord.</b> The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of ganglia, or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first three pairs of ganglia are fused into the brain, while the three {{following}} pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect's esophagus, called the subesophageal ganglion.|$|E
50|$|A pair of parietal ganglia lie {{along the}} length of the main <b>nerve</b> <b>cords,</b> {{supplying}} <b>nerves</b> to the gill and associated olfactory organ. Because of the torsion of the <b>nerve</b> <b>cords,</b> one parietal ganglion is typically higher in the body than the other. Finally, the <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> terminate in a linked pair of visceral ganglia, which supply nerves to the remaining organs of the visceral mass.|$|R
25|$|The {{evolution}} of nervous systems {{dates back to}} the first development of nervous systems in animals (or metazoans). Neurons developed as specialized electrical signaling cells in multicellular animals, adapting the mechanism of action potentials present in motile single-celled and colonial eukaryotes. Simple nerve nets seen in animals like cnidaria evolved first, followed by <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> in bilateral animals – ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> in invertebrates and dorsal <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> supported by a notochord in chordates. Bilateralization led to the {{evolution of}} brains, a process called cephalization.|$|R
5|$|There are {{two pairs}} of main <b>nerve</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R
5|$|The brain {{develops}} in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages. It changes in shape {{from a simple}} swelling {{at the front of}} the <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> in the earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas and connections. Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells, and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.|$|E
25|$|The ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> {{extends from}} the suboesophageal {{ganglion}} posteriorly. A layer of connective tissue called the neurolemma covers the brain, ganglia, major peripheral nerves and ventral nerve cords.|$|E
25|$|The {{nervous system}} {{is similar to}} that of other arthropods, {{including}} a ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> with ganglia in each segment. Although the body contains a haemocoel, there are no circulatory, respiratory, or excretory organs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to modeling, simulation and visualization of peripheral <b>nerve</b> <b>cords.</b> Until now, only sparse datasets of <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> can be found. In addition, this data {{has not yet}} been used in simulators, because it is only static. To build up a more flexible anatomical structure of peripheral <b>nerve</b> <b>cords,</b> we propose a hierarchical tree data structure where each node represents a nerve branch. The shape of the nerve segments itself is approximated by spline curves. Interactive modeling allows for the creation and editing of control points which are used for branching nerve sections, calculating spline curves and editing spline representations via cross sections. Furthermore, the control points can be attached to different anatomic structures. Through this approach, <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> deform in accordance to the movement of the connected structures, e. g., muscles or bones. As a result, we have developed an intuitive modeling system that runs on desktop computers and in immersive environments. It allows anatomical experts to create movable peripheral <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> for articulated virtual humanoids. Direct feedback of changes induced by movement or deformation is achieved by visualization in real-time. The techniques and the resulting data are already used for medical simulators...|$|R
50|$|Concentration {{of nervous}} {{tissue in the}} head region is least marked in the acoels, which have nerve nets rather like those of cnidarians and ctenophores, but densest around the head. In other turbellarians, a {{distinct}} brain is present, albeit relatively simple in structure. From the brain one to four pairs of <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> run along the length the body, with numerous smaller nerves branching off. The ventral pair of <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> are typically the largest, and, in many species, {{are the only ones}} present. Unlike more complex animals, such as annelids, there are no ganglia on the <b>nerve</b> <b>cords,</b> other than those forming the brain.|$|R
50|$|The {{nervous system}} has small ganglia around the {{oesophagus}} from which {{two pairs of}} main <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> run through the body; one pair supplying the foot, and the other the visceral organs. As in the chitons, these main <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> are connected {{by a series of}} lateral nerves, giving the layout of the nervous system an appearance somewhat like a ladder.|$|R
25|$|An insect’s sensory, {{motor and}} {{physiological}} processes {{are controlled by}} {{the central nervous system}} along with the endocrine system. Being the principal division of the nervous system, it consists of a brain, a ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> and a subesophageal ganglion which is connected to the brain by two nerves, extending around each side of the oesophagus.|$|E

25|$|A {{chordate}} is {{an animal}} {{belonging to the}} phylum Chordata; they possess a notochord, a hollow dorsal <b>nerve</b> <b>cord,</b> pharyngeal slits, an endostyle, and a post-anal tail, {{for at least some}} period of their life cycle. Chordates are deuterostomes, as during the embryo development stage the anus forms before the mouth. They are also bilaterally symmetric coelomates. In the case of vertebrate chordates, the notochord is usually replaced by a vertebral column during development, and they may have body plans organized by segmentation.|$|E
5000|$|III. {{with two}} longitudinal, ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> linked by a band with two ganglia below the {{oesophagus}} ...|$|R
50|$|The brain {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ganglia in the head region, from which two or three pairs of <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> run {{down the length of the}} body. The <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> running along the ventral surface are always the largest, while the dorsal cords are present only in the Aspidogastrea. Trematodes generally lack any specialised sense organs, although some ectoparasitic species do possess one or two pairs of simple ocelli.|$|R
50|$|The group {{includes}} genera such as Cephalothrix {{in which the}} <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> are inside the body-wall longitudinal muscle, and Tubulanus, in which the <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> are between the outer circular muscle and the epidermis. Tubulanids are commonly encountered in rocky areas of intertidal zones in the northern hemisphere. They are often bright orange or have very distinctive banding and or stripes and can be many metres long, although only a few millimetres thick.|$|R
25|$|Like other annelids, these worms possess {{well-developed}} {{nervous system}}s. The nervous system {{consists of a}} central brain in {{the upper part of}} the head, which is relatively large compared with that of other annelids. Extending from the brain is a large ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> running the length of the body. There are many supporting ganglia along the length of this cord (including pleural, pedal and cerebral ganglia), and a series of small nerves in each body segment. Signals transmitted through the pedal ganglia allow the worms to retract rapidly into their tube if threatened.|$|E
25|$|Females become {{receptive}} to courting males at about 8–12 hours after emergence. Specific neuron groups in females {{have been found}} to affect copulation behavior and mate choice. One such group in the abdominal <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> allows the female fly to pause her body movements to copulate. Activation of these neurons induces the female to cease movement and orient herself towards the male to allow for mounting. If the group is inactivated, the female remains in motion and does not copulate. Various chemical signals such as male pheromones often are able to activate the group.|$|E
25|$|In the circulatory system, hemolymph, or insect blood, {{is used to}} {{circulate}} heat in a form of thermoregulation, where muscles contraction produces heat, which is transferred {{to the rest of}} the body when conditions are unfavorable. In lepidopteran species, hemolymph is circulated through the veins in the wings by some form of pulsating organ, either by the heart or by the intake of air into the trachea. Air is taken in through spiracles along the sides of the abdomen and thorax supplying the trachea with oxygen as it goes through the lepidopteran's respiratory system. There are three different tracheae supplying oxygen diffusing oxygen throughout the species body: The dorsal, ventral, and visceral. The dorsal tracheae supply oxygen to the dorsal musculature and vessels, while the ventral tracheae supply the ventral musculature and <b>nerve</b> <b>cord,</b> and the visceral tracheae supply the guts, fat bodies, and gonads.|$|E
50|$|The {{nervous system}} is {{composed}} by a net of interconnected neurons beneath the epidermis, without any concentration of neurons forming ganglia or <b>nerve</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{nervous system}} of {{gastropods}} {{consists of a}} series of paired ganglia connected by major <b>nerve</b> <b>cords,</b> and a number of smaller branching nerves.|$|R
5|$|Class Enopla ("armed"). All have stylets except order Bdellonemertea. Their {{mouth is}} located {{underneath}} and {{ahead of the}} brain. Their main <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> run inside body-wall muscles.|$|R
25|$|A {{vertebra}} {{can also}} be {{described in terms of}} the shape of the ends of the centrum. Centra with flat ends are acoelous, like those in mammals. These flat ends of the centra are especially good at supporting and distributing compressive forces. Amphicoelous vertebra have centra with both ends concave. This shape is common in fish, where most motion is limited. Amphicoelous centra often are integrated with a full notochord. Procoelous vertebrae are anteriorly concave and posteriorly convex. They are found in frogs and modern reptiles. Opisthocoelous vertebrae are the opposite, possessing anterior convexity and posterior concavity. They are found in salamanders, and in some non-avian dinosaurs. Heterocoelous vertebrae have saddle-shaped articular surfaces. This type of configuration is seen in turtles that retract their necks, and birds, because it permits extensive lateral and vertical flexion motion without stretching the <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> too extensively or wringing it about its long axis.|$|E
25|$|The clypeus is a {{sclerite}} {{between the}} face and labrum, which is dorsally separated from the frons by the frontoclypeal suture in primitive insects. The clypeogenal suture laterally demarcates the clypeus, with the clypeus ventrally separated from the labrum by the clypeolabral suture. The clypeus differs in shape and size, such as species of Lepidoptera with a large clypeus with elongated mouthparts. The cheek or gena forms the sclerotized area {{on each side of}} the head below the compound eyes extending to the gular suture. Like many of the other parts making up the insect's head, the gena varies among species, with its boundaries difficult to establish. For example, in dragonflies and damselflies, it is between the compound eyes, clypeus, and mouthparts. The postgena is the area immediately posteriad, or posterior or lower on the gena of pterygote insects, and forms the lateral and ventral parts of the occipital arch. The occipital arch is a narrow band forming the posterior edge of the head capsule arching dorsally over the foramen. The subgenal area is usually narrow, located above the mouthparts; this area also includes the hypostoma and pleurostoma. The vertex extends anteriorly above the bases of the antennae as a prominent, pointed, concave rostrum. The posterior wall of the head capsule is penetrated by a large aperture, the foramen. Through it pass the organ systems, such as <b>nerve</b> <b>cord,</b> esophagus, salivary ducts, and musculature, connecting the head with the thorax.|$|E
500|$|A {{dragonfly}} {{has been}} genetically modified with light-sensitive [...] "steering neurons" [...] in its <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> {{to create a}} cyborg-like [...] "DragonflEye". The neurons contain genes {{like those in the}} eye to make them sensitive to light. Miniature sensors, a computer chip and a solar panel were fitted in a [...] "backpack" [...] over the insect's thorax in front of its wings. Light is sent down flexible light-pipes named optrodes from the backpack into the <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> to give steering commands to the insect. The result is a [...] "micro-aerial vehicle that's smaller, lighter and stealthier than anything else that's manmade".|$|E
50|$|M. ozzardi {{and other}} {{nematodes}} have longitudinal muscles that {{run along the}} body wall. They also have dorsal, ventral, and longitudinal <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> connected to these longitudinal muscles.|$|R
2500|$|Worms are the {{simplest}} bilaterian animals, and reveal {{the basic structure}} of the bilaterian nervous system in the most straightforward way. [...] As an example, earthworms have dual <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> running {{along the length of the}} body and merging at the tail and the mouth. These <b>nerve</b> <b>cords</b> are connected by transverse nerves like the rungs of a ladder. These transverse nerves help coordinate the two sides of the animal. Two ganglia at the head end function similar to a simple brain. Photoreceptors on the animal's eyespots provide sensory information on light and dark.|$|R
50|$|The nerve {{system of}} Fasciola hepatica {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} nerve ganglia, each one is located {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. Around the oesophagus is a nerve ring. This nerve ring connects the two nerve ganglia together. The nerves stem off from this ring, reaching all the way down to the posterior end of the body. At the posterior end, one pair of nerves become thicker than the others, these are known as the lateral <b>nerve</b> <b>cords.</b> From these lateral <b>nerve</b> <b>cords,</b> the other <b>nerves</b> branch. Sensory organs are absent from F. hepatica.|$|R
500|$|Except {{for a few}} {{primitive}} organisms such as sponges (which have no nervous system) and cnidarians (which have {{a nervous}} system consisting of a diffuse nerve net), all living multicellular animals are bilaterians, meaning animals with a bilaterally symmetric body shape (that is, left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other). All bilaterians {{are thought to have}} descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the Cambrian period, 485-540 million years ago, and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body. At a schematic level, that basic worm-shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians, including vertebrates. The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain. The brain is small and simple in some species, such as nematode worms; in other species, including vertebrates, it is the most complex organ in the body. Some types of worms, such as leeches, also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the <b>nerve</b> <b>cord,</b> known as a [...] "tail brain".|$|E
500|$|Like other insects, ants have an exoskeleton, an {{external}} covering {{that provides a}} protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles, {{in contrast to the}} internal skeletons of humans and other vertebrates. Insects do not have lungs; oxygen and other gases, such as carbon dioxide, pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called spiracles. Insects also lack closed blood vessels; instead, they have a long, thin, perforated tube {{along the top of the}} body (called the [...] "dorsal aorta") that functions like a heart, and pumps haemolymph toward the head, thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids. The nervous system consists of a ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cord</b> that runs the length of the body, with several ganglia and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages.|$|E
2500|$|In the American lobster, {{endogenous}} morphine {{is found}} in the haemolymph and ventral <b>nerve</b> <b>cord.</b> [...] In lobsters which have had a pereiopod (walking leg) cut off or been injected with the irritant lipopolysaccharide, the endogenous morphine levels initially increased by 24% for haemolymph and 48% for the <b>nerve</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|E
