40|$|The {{development}} of carbon paste electrodes modified by molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) for the potentiometric analysis of uric acid {{was carried out}} in this study. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the optimum composition of the electrode constituent material, the optimum pH of the uric acid solution, and the performance of the electrode, which was measured by its response time, measurement range, <b>Nernst</b> <b>factor,</b> detection limits, selectivity coefficient, precision, accuracy, and life time. MIP was made from methyl methacrylate as the monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the cross-linker, and uric acid as the template. Electrodes that give optimum performance were produced from carbon, MIP, and paraffin with a ratio of 40 : 25 : 35 (% w/w). The obtained results show that the measurement of uric acid solution gives optimum results at pH 5, <b>Nernst</b> <b>factor</b> of 30. 19 Â mV/decade, and a measurement range of 10 â 6 â 10 â 3 Â M. The minimum detection limit of this method was 3. 03. 10 â 6 Â M, and the precision and accuracy toward uric acid with concentration of 10 â 6 â 10 â 3 Â M ranged between 1. 36 â 2. 03 % and 63. 9 â 166 %. The selectivity coefficient value was less than 1, which indicated that the electrode was selective against uric acid and not interfered with by urea. This electrode has a response time of less than 2 Â min; its life time is 8 Â weeks with 104 usage times.

40|$|The use of {{endosulfan}} pesticides {{in agriculture}} can cause environmental problems, such as pollution in aquatic environments {{that can lead}} to destruction of fishery resources and drinking water. So, it has become imperative to detect and separate the hazardous pesticide endosulfan from contaminated water. In this work, molecularly imprinted membrane has been fabricated for the specific recognition by using methacrylic acid (MAA) as functional monomer and ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate (EGDMA) as cross linker. The molecular imprinting of endosulfan on membrane matrix was confirmed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). This was followed by sensing of the endosulfan by voltammetry. The electrochemical potential is additional information enhancing the selectivity of the sensor. It can be concluded that MIP-based voltammetric sensors are very promising analytical tool for the development of highly selective analytical sensor. The test results of electrode performance indicated that MIP endosulfan-based aluminum-carbon sensor had detection limit of 0. 02 mM, sensitive in the concentration range from 0. 02 to 0. 12 mM with <b>Nernst</b> <b>factor</b> > 0. 059 V/decade and had good stability.  </p...|$|E
