5|$|<b>Nematodes</b> {{are among}} the largest animal phyla and include at least 12,000 known species that are parasites of vertebrates. In Kinsella's 1988 study in Florida, species {{diversity}} was higher in the saltwater marsh (Cedar Key) than the freshwater marsh (Paynes Prairie), but <b>nematodes</b> at Paynes Prairie occurred more commonly and made {{up the bulk of}} the parasites found in rice rats there.|$|E
5|$|Planted bulbs are {{susceptible}} to <b>nematodes,</b> the most serious of which is Ditylenchus dipsaci (Narcissus eelworm), {{the main cause of}} basal plate disease in which the leaves turn yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years. Other <b>nematodes</b> include Aphelenchoides subtenuis, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and Pratylenchus penetrans (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in narcissi.|$|E
5|$|The addax {{are most}} prone to parasites in moist climatic conditions. Addax {{have always been}} {{infected}} with <b>nematodes</b> in the Trichostrongyloidea and Strongyloidea superfamilies. In an exotic ranch in Texas, an addax was found host to the <b>nematodes</b> Haemonchus contortus and Longistrongylus curvispiculum in its abomasum, of which the former was dominant.|$|E

5|$|Another {{parasite}} is the nematode Beddingia (Deladenus) siricidicola, {{which was}} {{suggested in the}} New World in the 1970s as a possible biological control. B. siricidicola causes infertility in female wasps, but does not impair the fertility of males. Inside the host tree, the <b>nematodes</b> primarily feed on fungal mycelium. If they get near the wasp larvae, they infect females, which then couple with males and finally infest the wasp larvae. These eventually exit the tree carrying the <b>nematodes</b> with them. Competition for food between B. siricidicola and the wasp larvae also occurs, resulting in slower growth and possible starvation of the woodwasp larvae. The population of the Sirex woodwasp is very prone to infestation by B. siricidicola; infestation rates of up to 90% have been recorded. The <b>nematodes</b> are often used to combat the wasps by combining them with the symbiosis partner Amylostereum. The related species B. wilsoni has a similar effect, but as it also lives parasitically with the genus Rhyssa, it is not used for pest control.|$|E
5|$|Ectoparasites {{are seven}} species of mites, five ticks, five fleas, a louse, and the subdermal botfly larva, Cuterebra. Known endoparasites are three species of protozoans found in fecal smears, one trematode, four cestodes, seven <b>nematodes,</b> and nymphal pentastomids found in various {{internal}} organs.|$|E
5|$|Many ectoparasitic bird lice (Myrsidea spp. and Menacanthus spp.), endoparasitic cestodes and <b>nematodes</b> {{have been}} {{described}} from this species. However no predators or diseases are significant factors in adult mortality.|$|E

5|$|Mayfly nymphs {{may serve}} as hosts for parasites such as <b>nematodes</b> and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs' {{behaviour}} {{in such a way}} that they become more likely to be predated. Other <b>nematodes</b> turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm Paragordius varius, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{materials}} {{found in}} the environment also induce plant resistance as well. Chitosan derived from chitin induce a plant's natural defense response against pathogens, diseases and insects including cyst <b>nematodes,</b> both are approved as biopesticides by the EPA to reduce the dependence on toxic pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Some bioluminous {{bacteria}} infect <b>nematodes</b> that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract predators to {{the dead}} insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria and <b>nematodes.</b> A similar reason {{may account for the}} many species of fungi that emit light. Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus, Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium, cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal, but other functions may also be involved.|$|E
50|$|Ditylenchus {{destructor}} is a plant pathogenic <b>nematode</b> {{commonly known}} as the potato rot <b>nematode.</b> Other common names include the iris <b>nematode,</b> the potato tuber eelworm and the potato tuber <b>nematode.</b> It is an endoparasitic, migratory <b>nematode</b> commonly found in areas such as the United States, Europe, central Asia and Southern Africa.|$|R

5|$|Two {{parasitic}} worms {{first discovered}} in the gastrointestinal tract of camas pocket gophers are the nematode Heligmosomoides thomomyos and the cestode Hymenolepis tualatinensis. Other worms include two <b>nematodes</b> and the cestode Hymenolepis horrida.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and <b>nematodes</b> and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the <b>nematodes</b> Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|External parasites of the {{mistle thrush}} include the hen flea, the moorhen flea, the {{castor bean tick}} and the brightly {{coloured}} harvest mite. Internally, the thrush may be hosting tapeworms, <b>nematodes,</b> and Syngamus merulae a relative of the gapeworm. Blood parasites include Trypanosoma and Plasmodium species.|$|E

5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the {{trematode}} Alaria, the <b>nematodes</b> Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly {{infected with the}} nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, adults of which {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested animals.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, the CAS protein family {{contains}} four members: p130Cas/BCAR1, NEDD9/HEF1, EFS and CASS4. There are no {{paralogous genes}} for this family in acoelomates, pseudocoelomates, and <b>nematodes,</b> while a single ancestral member {{is found in}} Drosophila. Evolutionary divergence of the CAS proteins family members is discussed by Singh et al. in detail.|$|E
5|$|Known parasites of the marbled {{electric}} ray include the tapeworms Anthocephalum gracile and Calyptrobothrium riggii, the leeches Pontobdella muricata and Trachelobdella lubrica, the monogeneans Amphibdella torpedinis, Amphibdelloides kechemiraen, A. maccallumi, A. vallei, Empruthotrema raiae, E. torpedinis, and Squalonchocotyle torpedinis, and the <b>nematodes</b> Ascaris torpedinis and Mawsonascaris pastinacae.|$|E

40|$|Interspecific {{interaction}} between the endoparasitic stages of the cyst <b>nematode</b> (Heterodera oryzicola, Rao & Jayaprakash, 1978), and the root-knot <b>nematode</b> (Meloidogyne graminicola, Golden & Birchfeld, 1968) in roots of rice cv. Sattari was investigated under artificial inoculations. With the increase in initial density of. each <b>nematode</b> in the inoculum, there was corresponding significant increase in final density a t 35 days. When inoculated in combi-nation to the same plant, a t the same time or the cyst <b>nematode</b> first and root-knot <b>nematode</b> a week later or vice versa, the root-knot <b>nematode</b> was found to multiply more rapidly and was better adapted. The buildup of the cyst <b>nematode</b> was partly inhibited in the competition for food and space in roots...|$|R

5|$|Mites and <b>nematodes</b> feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor {{nutritional}} resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing overgrazing.|$|E
5|$|Mites of {{the genus}} Ptilonyssus, such as P. sittae, {{have been found in}} the Eurasian nuthatch's nasal cavities. Intestinal worms include the <b>nematodes</b> Tridentocapillaria parusi and Pterothominx longifilla. Small studies in Slovakia and Spain found no blood parasites, but a larger Spanish survey found some {{evidence}} of Plasmodium infection.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves can be {{afflicted with}} several {{different}} parasites and diseases, including tapeworms, <b>nematodes,</b> mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite Trichomonas gallinae is particularly severe. While a mourning dove will sometimes host it without symptoms, it will often cause yellowish {{growth in the}} mouth and esophagus that will eventually starve the host to death. Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.|$|E
