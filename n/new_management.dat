5|$|On 29 November 2014, the admin of {{the page}} {{announced}} his retirement on Facebook. He stated that he was leaving the page for personal reasons, but that Valor por Tamaulipas would continue under <b>new</b> <b>management.</b> That person, he said, had some relationship with law enforcement. The admin believes {{that this would be}} of benefit for the cyber community because it would allow for citizen reports to reach law enforcement directly. The admin also announced that the pages Responsabilidad, Fortaleza, and Valor por la Huasteca would go under <b>new</b> <b>management</b> too. The <b>new</b> <b>management</b> would be composed of people who he deemed trustworthy given their long history of support or because they had suffered a loss {{as a result of the}} violence. In a closing statement, he bid farewell by thanking God for bringing happiness to his personal and professional life. In the comment section of the Facebook post, many people thanked the admin for his support. Some of them, however, expressed their concerned with the new administration given his/her relationship with the government.|$|E

The Roma management appointed Luis Enrique, who had previous coached the Barcelona B side, in a bid to emulate Barcelona's football style.|$|E

5|$|Following Juventus's {{return to}} Serie A, Del Piero {{was locked in}} months of fractious {{negotiations}} over the signing of a new contract with Juventus' <b>new</b> <b>management.</b> After successfully negotiating a new contract till 30 June 2010, he was greeted with news {{of the birth of}} his first child, Tobias Del Piero.

5000|$|<b>New</b> Public <b>Management</b> asset of {{administrative}} practices,a consulting fad, {{and a body}} of theory that interprets recent developments in public administration. Many scholars argue persuasively that scholars should {{pay more attention to}} <b>New</b> Public <b>management</b> as a theory than as a fad. <b>New</b> public <b>management</b> {{is part and parcel of}} the massive intrusion of freemarket values into public space, which threatens to drive out political values altogether. It is worth noting that,in this sense, <b>new</b> public <b>management</b> is the radical opposite of the notion of migrating political values into [...] "private" [...] space in the interest of further democratizing society. However, <b>new</b> public <b>management</b> theory fails to addresses political questions in a meaningful way. This theory looks at public administration from its roots of capitalism, and goes on through the perspective of global capitalism. Intentional or not, <b>new</b> public <b>management</b> has served the interests of elites, particularly corporate elites, has degraded the ability of governments to address the public interest, and has served as a vehicle for elevating the apolitical governance of free trade and other supranational organizations,which have fully embraced the political philosophy of economic rationalism and new managerialism.|$|R

The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises {{in the region as}} the Burger King brand's master franchisee. Trans-Pacific Foods administered the chain's 81 locations until September 2003 when the <b>new</b> <b>management</b> team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack's Pty Ltd to re-brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands. An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{evaluate}} a <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution offered by the YANG data modelling language and the NETCONF network management protocol. The evaluation set out {{to answer the question}} if this network management solution is an efficient, secure and reliable way to dynamically manage networks. In addition, the new emerging network paradigms Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) were examined to understand how this <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution relates to them. The fundamental network management capabilities of network management solutions were examined {{for the purposes of the}} evaluation. The used source material included specifications of many network management protocols and research papers related to the field of network <b>management.</b> Moreover, a <b>new</b> YANG model was modelled and a prototype NETCONF server was implemented. The model was done to get a more in depth view of the data modelling process. Whilst, the server was examined to get an understanding of the server's internals and implementation details. The gathered information was used to evaluate the suitability of this <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution for the use of SDN and NFV. Furthermore, this <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution was analysed based on its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. In the evaluation it was observed that this <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution is substantially better for network configuration compared to the other solutions. However, it was observed that for network monitoring this <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution does not offer the same level of efficiency as some of the other solutions. In addition, this <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution was found to offer a more sophisticated and versatile information security and user management controls than the other solutions. The analysis showed that the strengths of this <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution were open interface, extendibility, security, reliability and performance, whilst the weaknesses of it were resource consumption and low utilization. The conclusion of this evaluation was that this <b>new</b> network <b>management</b> solution does offer an efficient, secure and reliable way to dynamically manage networks. However, many of the other network management solutions are still seen as useful solutions in their own limited areas...|$|R
