5|$|Despite the splendidly sized new {{building}} (albeit a plain one), the church declined in {{status as the}} college gradually died. It {{is possible that the}} community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. <b>Nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> know whether the clas resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with the appointment of a rector by King Henry III in 1246, although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost. There have been suggestions that there were one or more chantry chapels, which could suggest the presence of more than one priest.|$|E

25|$|We do not {{perceive}} by an immediate intuition that God exists, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> prove it a priori. But we do prove it a posteriori, i.e., from {{the things that}} have been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from the production of the things in this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.|$|E

In his own words: [...] "Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [...] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> {{need to be reminded}} we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about." ...|$|E

A detailed assessment of the issues has, however, convinced us that the arguments in favour of a contribution to tuition costs from graduates in work are strong, if not widely appreciated. They relate to equity between social groups, broadening participation, equity with part-time students in higher education and in further education, strengthening the student role in higher education, and identifying a new source of income that can be ring-fenced for higher education.|$|E

500|$|Newly {{elected to}} a mining seat, Benn was a {{supporter}} of the 1984–85 UK miners' strike, which was beginning {{when he returned to the}} Commons, and of his long-standing friend, the National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill. However, some miners considered Benn's 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike; firstly, that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a [...] "regional matter" [...] in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been. Benn also spoke at a Militant tendency rally held in 1984, saying: [...] "The labour movement is not engaged in a personalised battle against individual cabinet ministers, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> seek to win public support by arguing that the crisis could be ended by the election of a new and more humane team of ministers who are better qualified to administer capitalism. We are working for a majority labour government, elected on a socialist programme, as decided by conference." [...] This guest appearance was considered one reason why Benn did not become a member of Labour's Shadow Cabinet.|$|E
500|$|Although not {{achieving}} the sensationalism of tulips, daffodils and narcissi {{have been much}} celebrated in art and literature (see The Arts). The largest demand for narcissi bulbs were large trumpet daffodils, N. poeticus and N. bulbocodium, and Istanbul became important in the shipping of bulbs to western Europe. By the early baroque period both tulips and narcissi were {{an important component of}} the spring garden. By 1739 a Dutch nursery catalogue listed 50 different varieties. A catalog of a Dutch nursery from 1739 already counted 50 varieties. In 1757 Hill gave an account of the history and cultivation of the daffodil in his edited version of the works of Thomas Hale, writing [...] "The garden does not afford, in its Kind, a prettier plant than this; <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> know one that has been so early, or so honorably mention'd by all Kinds of Writers" [...] (see illustration). Interest grew further when varieties that could be grown indoors became available, primarily the bunch flowered (multiple flower heads) N. tazetta (Polyanthus Narcissus). However interest varied by country. Maddock (1792) does not include narcissi in his list of the eight most important cultivated flowering plants in England, whereas in the Netherlands van Kampen (1760) stated that N. tazetta (Narcisse à bouquet) is the fifth most important – [...] "Le Narcisse à bouquet est la premiere fleur, après les Jacinthes, les Tulipes les Renoncules, et les Anemones, (dont nous avons déja parlé,) qui merite nôtre attention". Similarly Philip Miller, in his Gardeners Dictionary (1731–1768) refers to cultivation in Holland, Flanders and France, but not England, because it was too difficult, a similar observation was made by Sir James Justice at this time. However, for most species of Narcissus Lauremberg's dictum Magna cura non indigent Narcissi was much cited.|$|E
