500|$|Students who die while {{enrolled}} at Texas A are also honored at Silver Taps, a ceremony held, when necessary, {{on the first}} Tuesday of the month. [...] This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A president Lawrence Sullivan Ross. [...] In the modern incarnation, {{on the morning of}} Silver Taps, a small card with the deceased student's <b>name,</b> <b>class,</b> major, and birthdate is placed as a notice {{at the base of the}} flagpole in Academic Plaza. [...] At 10:15p.m., all lights on campus are extinguished, and Albritton Tower begins to chime hymns. [...] When the music begins, students gather in silence in front of the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross at Academic Plaza. [...] At 10:30 pm, the Ross Volunteers march into the plaza and fire a 3-volley salute. [...] Buglers stationed at the top of the Academic Building then play a special rendition of Taps, known as Silver Taps. The song is played three times; once to the north, once to the south, and once to the west. [...] It is never played to the east, [...] "because the sun will never rise on that Aggie again." [...] Once the buglers have finished their tribute, the crowd disperses. [...] Generally, students remain silent until reaching their homes.|$|E
500|$|The pilot {{episode of}} Sit Down, Shut Up {{was written by}} series creator Mitchell Hurwitz and {{directed}} by Dwayne Carey-Hill. It was originally written by Hurwitz in 2000, but he [...] "kept it in a drawer for a long time" [...] and brought it out when he needed money. The idea for the series {{was based on the}} Australian situation comedy of the same name. He pitched his adaption to different networks that were interested in the concept, but they turned it down, because the characters were [...] "way too broad and way too self-centered and oblivious," [...] and they told him that he had to rewrite it. The Fox network picked it up in April 2008 under the <b>name</b> <b>Class</b> Dismissed, later changed to Sit Down, Shut Up. Hurwitz's adaption was originally planned to be live-action like its counterpart, but he decided to make it an animated series to [...] "avoid some work". He chose to use real images as backgrounds after he saw Mo Willems' Knuffle Bunny in a book store. He then contacted Willems to design the characters for Sit Down, Shut Up. The images for the school were taken at a school next door to the Rough Draft Studios, the series' animation studio. Production of the series halted in June 2008, when the writers found out that they would be {{under the jurisdiction of the}} IATSE Animation Guild, instead of Writers Guild of America (WGA). A month later, the writers and the production company, Sony Pictures, reached an agreement saying that the writers would still be covered by the IATSE, but their contract would be the same as the WGA's in certain areas. This made Sit Down, Shut Up the only primetime animated series on Fox not to be covered by the WGA. During this process, head writer Bill Oakley left the series.|$|E

50|$|The Shadacks (Ed and {{his nephew}} Tom) took over KOGO and 106.5 KPRI, and ran {{both of the}} {{stations}} into the ground by 1982. In 1983 both stations changed call letters to KLZZ AM/FM (went under the <b>name</b> <b>Class</b> FM/AM). KLZZ flopped, {{and that is when}} Edens Broadcasting bought the stations and turned both of them into CHR stations Q-106 (KKLQ AM/FM). In the early 1990s, Par Broadcasting bought the stations and separated the AM from the FM on April 25, 1994, with the AM flipping to a talk format. Par bought back the call letters KOGO for 600. The KOGO call letters, during the hiatis, were on 1590 AM in Ventura, California. At that time, 1590 was owned by Jack Woods (formerly Charlie of Charlie and Harrigan on KFMB and KCBQ). In 1997, Par Broadcasting sold its San Diego stations to Jacor/Citicasters, who in turn merged with Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in 1999. KOGO was reunited with its original FM sister in 1998 when Jacor/Citicasters purchased the radio properties of Nationwide Communications.|$|E
50|$|It emerged around 2005, as a split of Nuevo Claridad {{after being}} {{integrated}} in Izquierda Unida's reformist project since 1993 and had abandoned {{a line of}} class independence; following a conference given in Spain by the Bolivian leader of the LOR-CI, Javo Ferreira, they {{came into contact with}} the Trotskyist Fraction - Fourth International, attending their third international conference in that year and establishing themselves as their Spanish section under the <b>name</b> <b>Class</b> against Class (CcC). With the emergence of the 15M movement, Class against Class managed to make a qualitative leap and could grow {{in the rest of the}} state due to the participation they had in the movement. They participated actively in the general strikes of 2012 in that country, supported the strike of the Panrico bakery workers in Barcelona (the largest since the Spanish Civil War), the workers' struggle at the Santa Perpetua Coca-Cola factory, the struggle of the hoteliers grouped in the platform Las Kellys and the strike of the Movistar workers. After a period of organic growth, Class against Class held an extraordinary conference and there resolved to change its name to Workers' Revolutionary Current. The CRT publises Contracorriente, first as a monthly bulletin, later (since 2015) as a cultural and political magazine.|$|E

50|$|By far, one of Texas A&M's most honored traditions is Silver Taps. Silver Taps is {{the student}} body's final tribute paid to an Aggie who, {{at the time}} of their death, was {{enrolled}} in undergraduate or graduate studies. This final tribute is held the first Tuesday of the month when a student has died the previous month. The first Silver Taps was held in 1898 and honored Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the former governor of Texas and president of A&M College. Silver Taps is currently held in the Academic Plaza. On the day of Silver Taps, a small card with the deceased student's <b>name,</b> <b>class,</b> major, and date of birth is placed as a notice at the base of the academic flagpole, in addition to the memorial located behind the flagpole. The A&M student newspaper, The Battalion, dedicates their Tuesday issue on a Silver Taps day to sharing stories of who the deceased students were. Around 10:15 that night, the lights are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower. Students silently gather at the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross. At 10:30p.m., the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad marches into the plaza and fires three rifle volleys totaling 21 shots fired. Six buglers then play a special rendition of Silver Taps by Colonel Richard Dunn (Aggie Band Director, 1924-1946). Taps is played three times from the dome of the Academic Building: once to the North, South, and West. It is not played to the East because the sun will never rise on that Aggie again. After the buglers play, the students silently return to their homes. Students return to their dorms, and lights remain extinguished until Reveille the next morning.|$|E
