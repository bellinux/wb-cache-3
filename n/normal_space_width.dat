40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} existing articular cartilage damage and sex on joint space measurements after isolated degenerative medial meniscus tears. PURPOSE: To determine what factors affected joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> and narrowing in patients after removal of isolated degenerative medial meniscus tears. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 62 patients (15 women and 47 men) with all ligaments intact, no previous surgery to either knee, and an isolated degenerative medial meniscus tear removed in 1 knee were examined. The mean age at examination was 58. 2 years at a mean follow-up of 9. 4 years (range, 4 - 20 years). Subjective results were obtained with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee survey. Radiographs were taken using 45 ° weightbearing posteroanterior views. Midpoint and perceived minimum joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> of the medial and lateral compartments of both knees were measured to the nearest 0. 1 mm by 2 observers at different times, and they were blinded as to the previous measurements (Pearson intra- and interclass correlations, > 0. 93). Joint space narrowing was found by calculating the difference in joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> between knees. Percentage of <b>normal</b> joint <b>space</b> loss was calculated by dividing joint space narrowing by the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> in the contralateral knee. Other factors considered were patient sex and Outerbridge grading of articular cartilage. RESULTS: Women had a mean 1. 5 mm less <b>normal</b> joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> than men in the involved and noninvolved knees (P 50 % of the <b>normal</b> joint <b>space</b> as measured in the noninjured knee (P =. 016).

40|$|Quantification {{of joint}} <b>space</b> <b>width</b> of the ankle could provide {{information}} essential {{to evaluate the}} effects of potential disease-modifying agents and adverse effects of devices intended to ameliorate osteoarthritis elsewhere in the lower extremity. Current methods require proprietary software or have not been well validated; our purpose was to develop and assess the reliability of a digital joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> quantification method using public access software. We studied 95 patients, asymptomatic in the ankles and without history of ankle trauma, but with symptomatic medial knee osteoarthritis, participating in an ongoing longitudinal trial. Weightbearing anteroposterior radiographs of the ankle and supine radiographs of the pelvis were assessed, and the narrowest medial and lateral tibiotalar joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> and hip joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> were measured using Image J software (US NIH, Bethesda, MD). Medial joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> were 2. 56  ±  0. 50 and 2. 55  ±  0. 48  mm, and lateral joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> were 2. 45  ±  0. 55 and 2. 44  ±  0. 52  mm, for right and left ankle, respectively. Coefficients of variation for repeat measurements by the same observer were 1. 13 % and 4. 5 %, and by different observers 7. 30 % and 7. 27 %, for medial and lateral joint <b>space</b> <b>widths,</b> respectively.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the range of}} <b>normal</b> radiographic joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (JSW) values and {{the shape of the}} normal hip, and the influence of age, sex, dysplasia, coxa profunda, and acetabular roof curve abnormalities on these values. Methods: On routine conventional pelvic radiographs taken in the supine position in patients with no history of hip or lumbar pain, JSW was measured at three points (superolateral, apical, superomedial), together with the VCE, HTE, and neck shaft angles; acetabular depth; and femoral head diameter. Results: 223 radiographs (446 hips) from 127 women and 96 men (mean age 51. 3 years) were examined. Interindividual variations in JSW were large (apical site: 4. 19 (0. 92) mm; range 2 – 7). Mean JSW values were higher at the superolateral site than at the apical and superomedial sites in nearly 80 % of cases. Women had lower JSW values than men. JSW values did not fall with age. Marked right/left JSW asymmetry was seen in 13 / 221 (5. 9 %) subjects. Eight cases of acetabular dysplasia (7 unilateral) and 16 cases of coxa profunda were found, but no cases of acetabular protrusion. The JSW was thicker in dysplastic hips, and thinner in hips with coxa profunda. A roof curve abnormality was found in 96 / 446 (21. 5 %) hips. Conclusions: Normal JSW values vary widely; the JSW is commonly narrower at the superomedial sit...|$|R

Measurement with a 0. 1  mm graduated magnifying glass and 0. 5  mm graduated flat ruler at the hip superointermediate site (vertical going through the femoral head centre).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} impact of axial {{traction}} during acquisition of direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography of the wrist with regard to joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> and amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients (12 male, mean age 38. 1 years) were included in this Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study. Three-compartment wrist MR arthrographies were performed between October and December 2009 on a 3 T unit using a fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted isotropic high-resolution volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE) sequence in the coronal plane, with and without axial traction (3 kg). Two radiologists measured radiocarpal (radioscaphoid, radiolunate) and midcarpal (lunocapitate, hamatolunate) joint <b>space</b> <b>widths,</b> with and without traction, and assessed the amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces using a three-point scale: 0 = absence, 1 = partial, 2 = complete. RESULTS: With traction, joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> increased significantly at the radioscaphoid (Delta = 0. 78 mm, P < 0. 01), radiolunate (Delta = 0. 18 mm, P < 0. 01), and lunocapitate (Delta = 0. 45 mm, P < 0. 01) spaces, and both observers detected significantly more contrast material between the cartilage surfaces. At the hamatolunate space, the differences in joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (Delta = 0. 14 mm, P = 0. 54) and amount of contrast material were not significant. CONCLUSION: Direct wrist MR arthrography with axial traction of 3 kg increases joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> at the radiocarpal and lunocapitate spaces, and prompts better coverage of the articular cartilage by the contrast material.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the biochemical markers of arthritis and the radiographic grading of osteoarthritis (OA) in knees. Seventy-one women aged 49 - 85 years with knee OA were studied. Anterior-posterior knee radiographs and hand radiographs were taken in all patients. The radiographic grading of OA in the knee was performed by using the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria and the joint <b>space</b> <b>width.</b> The 71 patients with knee OA were divided into two groups: 37 patients exhibiting generalized osteoarthritis (GOA) and 34 non-GOA patients, according to the grading of their hand radiograph. C-reactive protein (CRP), urinary pyridinoline, YKL- 40, plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3, MMP- 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) - 1 were measured as the biochemical markers of arthritis. The radiographic grading with the Kellgren-Lawrence scale revealed a significant relationship to the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (P = 0. 003) : the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> decreased with increasing Kellgren-Lawrence grade. All biochemical markers had negative correlations with the joint <b>space</b> <b>width,</b> but only urinary pyridinoline had a significant correlation (P = 0. 039). Pyridinoline (P = 0. 034) and TIMP- 1 (P = 0. 017) also exhibited a significant relationship to the Kellgren-Lawrence grade. In GOA evaluations, the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> did not differ between GOA and non-GOA patients. CRP, pyridinoline, YKL- 40 and MMP- 3 levels were significantly greater in GOA patients than in non-GOA patients.
