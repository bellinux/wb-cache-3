40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe latest {{evolution}} in {{minimally invasive surgery}} is to avoid skin incisions by using natural orifices, called natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). However, to safely and efficiently perform NOTES, {{the requirements of the}} operating platform used need to be modified from the conventional endoscope. The aim {{of this paper is to}} systematically review specialised operating platforms used or in development for NOTES procedures. MethodsA review of the literature was conducted using Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, ISI Current Contents Connect and PubMed, a search tool of the National Library of Medicine and the national institute of Health, until the 1 st of December 2008. Data was extracted to specifically characterise the available platforms, their availability, advantageous characteristics and potential disadvantages. ResultsThere were 9 studies included in this review describing 6 different <b>navigation</b> <b>platforms</b> and 3 robotic systems for NOTES. Based on this analysis, it is our opinion that although the described surgical systems and <b>navigation</b> <b>platforms</b> possess some attractive characteristics, such as maneuverability, stability, enhanced optics, and the ability to provide triangulation and insufflation with proper suction/irrigation maintenance, there does not appear to be one platform which is clearly superior to others. ConclusionCurrent instruments are not suited for effective surgery in a NOTES environment. There are several important requirements for NOTES platform: 1) to provide safe access to the peritoneal cavity; 2) to provide a stable channel for instrumentation passageway and safe navigation, 3) to provide good visualization and illumination, thereby decreasing disorientation, 4) to maintain proper insufflation and suction/irrigation, and 5) to provide maneuverability and triangulation of the instruments. Effective collaborations between clinicians, engineering departments and industry are essential to maximise and expedite the innovative process in producing an optimal NOTES platform...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of Global Positioning System and Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) integrated navigation is reduced when GPS is blocked.

During GPS outages, the real-time pseudoGPS position is predicted with the mapping function, and the corresponding covariance matrix is estimated by an improved adaptive filtering algorithm.

In the last decade, with the rapid development of Micro Electro Mechanical Sensors (MEMS), great interest has been generated in low cost integrated GPS/INS applications. This paper presents a PC 104 based low cost GPS/INS integrated <b>navigation</b> <b>platform.</b> The platform hardware consists of low cost inertial sensors and an assembly of various PC 104 compatible peripherals, such as data acquisition card, GPS receiver, Ethernet card, mother board, graphic card, etc. The platform software including inertial/GPS data acquisition, inertial navigation calculation and integrated GPS/INS Kalman filter is implemented with Simulink, which can be directly loaded and processed in the PC 104 mother board {{with the aid of}} Matlab Real-Time Workshop (RTW) utility.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{world is}} evolving. Ten years ago Nigel Thrift (2004 : 41) made {{the claim that}} the experience of driving was slipping into our 'technological unconscious'. Only recently the New York Times suggested that with the rise of automated driving, standalone navigation tools as we know them would cease to exist, instead being 'fully absorbed into the machine' (Fisher, 2013). But in order {{to bridge the gap between}} past and future driving worlds, another technological evolution is emerging. This short, critical piece charts the rise of what has been called 'social navigation' in the industry; the development of digital mapping platforms designed to foster automotive sociality. It makes two provisional points. Firstly, that 'ludic' conceptualisations can shed light on the ongoing reconfiguration of drivers, vehicles, roads and technological aids such as touch-screen satellite <b>navigation</b> <b>platforms.</b> And secondly, that as a result of this, there is a coming-into-being of a new kind of driving politics; a 'casual politicking' centred on an engagement with digital interfaces. We explicate both by turning our attention towards Waze; a social navigation application that encourages users to interact with various driving dynamics.      </p...|$|R

40|$|Future space {{exploration}} will emphasize on cost effectiveness and highly focused mission objectives. Missions costs are {{directly proportional to}} its total weight, thus, the trend will be to replace bulky and heavy components of space carriers, communication and <b>navigation</b> <b>platforms</b> and of scientific payloads. MEMS devices are ideally suited to replace several of these components in the future, first by substituting larger and heavier components (e. g. a gyroscope), then by replacing entire subsystems (e. g., inertial measurement unit), and finally by enabling the microfabrication of highly integrated picosats. This progressive approach will also enable new mission scenarios and more detailed investigations of the space environment and of planetary surfaces. Very small satellites (1 to 100 kg) stand to benefit the most from MEMS technologies because reaching the desired performance levels is only possible using a highly integrated approach. The small satellites are typically used for science or technology demonstration missions, with much higher risk tolerance than multi-ton telecommunication satellites. In addition, the ability to mass produce MEMS components opens {{a new approach to}} {{space exploration}} in the future by sending constellations of nano and picosatellites into space.
