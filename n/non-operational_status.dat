2500|$|The War Department {{cancelled}} its {{orders for}} the C-76 on 3 August 1943. The Sara Clark Collection, National Archives, Record Group 342, Box 2719, document the disposition of the 25 YC-76 aircraft as Articles #1, #3, # 4, and #5 {{were placed in the}} [...] "Z" [...] category, ZC-76, due to the poor gluing conditions and assembly procedures by subcontractors found through a Material Division inspection of the subcontractors work. These aircraft were assigned to the Technical Training Command and used for ground purposes only. Article #2 was destroyed in static testing at Wright Field. Article #6 was lost in a crash. Article #9 was under repair, but repairs were stopped and the airplane placed in Class 26, <b>non-operational</b> <b>status.</b> Air Service Command operated 12 YC-76s on a service test basis for nine months and found that they required excessive man hours to maintain. It was suggested that these be placed into Class 26 or Survey.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} nationwide base closures (BRAC) targeted Castle AFB. The 322d Bomb Squadron was inactivated 3 May 1994, and {{the wing}} {{was placed on}} <b>non-operational</b> <b>status.</b> However, the 93d continued to supervise the closure of Castle AFB. It was inactivated on 30 September 1995 with {{the closure of the}} base.|$|E
5000|$|Remained in <b>non-operational</b> <b>status</b> until October 1977 when reorganized as an A-10 Squadron, tail coded [...] "WA", black/yellow {{checkered}} tail stripes. Performed fighter weapons {{training with}} the A-10 {{until the end}} of 1981, when inactivated and squadron was reassigned to the USAF Fighter Weapons School, being re-designated as [...] "A-10 Division".|$|E
50|$|Participated in the {{airborne}} assault of Southern France, August 1944, dropping airborne forces into the Rhone Valley. With {{the end of}} combat in May, 1945, aided in the redeployment of personnel {{after the war and}} also hauled freight and mail. Personnel demobilized in Italy on 14 November 1945 and placed in <b>non-operational</b> <b>status,</b> inactivated as an administrative unit in March 1946.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 June 1992 the 93rd was {{relieved}} from assignment to SAC and was reassigned {{to the newly}} formed Air Combat Command (ACC). It was then redesignated as the 93rd Bomb Wing and its B-52G aircraft given the ACC tail code of [...] "CA" [...] and carried blue tail stripes. The 328d Bomb Squadron was inactivated 3 May 1994, and the wing was placed on <b>non-operational</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
50|$|In January 1968, {{following}} North Korea's {{seizure of}} the , the 127th TFS {{was ordered to}} extended active duty, and deployed to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea and assigned to the PACAF 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. As {{a result of this}} federalization, the 184th TFG was placed in a <b>non-operational</b> <b>status.</b> The 127th was released from active duty in June 1969, being returned to Kansas state control. When returned to the 184th TFG, the group was returned to operational status.|$|E
50|$|On 26 January 1968, the 140th Tactical Fighter Wing was federalized {{and taken}} under the {{jurisdiction}} of Twelfth Air Force, Tactical Air Command. The Wing's 120th TFS was reassigned to the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing, its aircraft/personnel/equipment being reassigned to Phan Rang AB, South Vietnam. As was the practice during the Vietnam Era, most of the wings's personnel were also sent to various Tactical Air Command units, either in the United States or deployed to units in Pacific Air Forces or USAFE. The Wing, stripped of its assets, was placed in a <b>Non-Operational</b> <b>status</b> by HQ TAC.|$|E
5000|$|As part {{of their}} new mission, the 93d Group also gained the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress squadrons from the 93d Wing. However, the {{operations}} of the reestablished group was short, On 1 June 1992 the 93d was relieved from assignment to SAC and was reassigned to the newly formed Air Combat Command (ACC). Its B-52G aircraft given the ACC tail code of [...] "CA" [...] and carried blue tail stripes. The 328th Bomb Squadron was inactivated 3 May 1994, and the wing and group were placed on <b>non-operational</b> <b>status.</b> The group was inactivated on 31 October 1994.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, {{after two}} years of <b>non-{{operational}}</b> <b>status,</b> the 509th became operational again. On 1 March 1993, the wing activated the 509th Operations Group as part of the 509th Bomb Wing's reorganization under the USAF Objective Wing plan. All flying squadrons, as well as an Operational Support Squadron (OSS) were assigned to the 509th OG. The wing grew larger on 1 July 1993, when it accepted host responsibilities for Whiteman from the 351st Missile Wing. Its 509th OG received the first operational B-2 Spirit stealth bomber on 17 December 1993 (the date was the 49th anniversary of the activation of the 509th Composite Group and the 90th of the Wright brothers' flight).|$|E
50|$|This gave 41 Squadron {{the curious}} {{distinction}} of being the last fighter squadron ever to be based at Biggin Hill. The departure of the unit marked {{the end of an era}} for the Station in every sense of the word, as thereafter it was relegated to <b>non-operational</b> <b>status</b> and only used by the London University Air Squadron.However, as with 41 Squadron's 1946 disbanding, this, too, was a mere technicality. On 16 January 1958, just a day after being disbanded, 141 Squadron, based at RAF Coltishall, near Norwich in Norfolk, dropped the '1' at the beginning of its number and was thus reborn as 41 Squadron. In doing so, they automatically absorbed 141's all-weather Gloster Javelin FAW.4 fighters and personnel.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1968, a new crisis, {{the seizure}} of the American ship USS Pueblo by North Korean forces, and the 119th was called to active duty. In May 1968, the 119th TFS was {{assigned}} to the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing, District of Columbia Air National Guard and stationed at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina when the active-duty 354th TFW was deployed to South Korea. Group personnel were spread throughout the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, and South Vietnam. The 177th TFW was placed in <b>non-operational</b> <b>status.</b> The 177th TFG was reformed at Atlantic City airport in June 1969, and returned to New Jersey State control. The 119th TFS transitioned into the F-105 [...] "Thunderchief" [...] in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Because the {{requirements}} for rapid communications from the Department of the Navy to the fleet operational commanders had changed, the CNO authorized the activation of an additional teletypewriter system. This system, known as HICOM, was activated in 1957 and operated parallel to the existing communications channels. Later, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT), established an additional parallel circuit known as the [...] "Atomic Strike Coordinator Circuit." [...] It was determined that even more rapid communications would be necessary. Therefore, a new communications net, known as the [...] "Naval Operation Net" [...] was formed in 1959. At the same time, the Navy decided that the stations at Haiku and Heeia were no longer needed. The station at Heeia {{was turned over to}} the Marine corps Air Station at Kaneohe, while the Haiku station was placed in a <b>non-operational</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E

50|$|Reactivated under Pacific Air Forces at Clark AB, Philippines in 1973 with a {{training}} mission to provide dissimilar air combat training (DACT) to PACAF fighter squadrons using Soviet-style fighter tactics. Was carried in <b>non-operational</b> <b>status</b> {{until the end}} of August 1975, by which time the 405th Fighter Wing had been replaced by the 3rd TFW at Clark. Even then, it did not start training activities until January 1976, using a number of T-38 Talon DACT aircraft made surplus by the arrival of the F-5E Tiger IIs at Nellis AFB, Nevada. Eventually, the squadron also received the F-5E, with some of the planes coming from stocks destined for the South Vietnamese Air Force but never delivered and an embargoed Ethiopian Air Force order. By that time it had been redesignated Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, and secondly as a Tactical Fighter Training and Aggressor Squadron. Eventually, it became the 26th Aggressor Squadron. The aggressor F-5Es were painted in a variety of colorful camouflage schemes designed to mimic those in use by Warsaw Pact aircraft. Two-digit Soviet-style nose codes were applied to most aggressor aircraft, and these coincided with the last two digits of the serial number. When there was duplication, three digits were used. Squadron {{was among the first to}} apply the star and bar in toned-down or stencil form.|$|E
