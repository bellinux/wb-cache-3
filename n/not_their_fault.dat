5|$|In {{the five}} years that take place between seasons four and five, Susan and Mike are {{involved}} in a car crash that kills a mother and her daughter. Although Susan was driving, Mike takes the blame, as Susan did not have her license with her at the time. Susan feels incredibly guilty for taking the lives of Lila (Marie Caldare) and Paige Dash (Madeleine Michelle Dunn), but Mike insists it was <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault.</b> The argument over the topic becomes so great that it results in divorce. Giving up on love, Susan engages in a casual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold).|$|E
500|$|New York Times {{reviewer}} George Stade {{said that}} Shikasta [...] "forces {{us to think}} about... what we are, how we got that way and where we are going", but complained that the book is filled with [...] "false hopes", and that the fate of humankind relies on [...] "theosophical emanations, cosmic influences, occult powers, spiritual visitations and stellar vibrations". When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing [...] "both indicts and exculpates" [...] them, implying that humanity is bad, but it is <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault.</b> While Stade complemented Lessing on the book's satire, and her depictions of Zone 6, which he said [...] "have the eerie beauty of ancient Gnostic texts", he [...] "disapprove" [...] of the novel as a whole, but added, [...] "that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy reading it".|$|E
2500|$|At Pearl Jam's March 28, 1994 {{concert at}} the Bayfront Amphitheater in Miami, Florida, Vedder {{introduced}} the song by saying, [...] "I thought I'd throw {{in a bit of}} street education while you still have an open mind....Right across the street there's a little homeless community that lives under the bridge. You should just know that those people ain't all crazy and sometimes it's <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault.</b> This song is called 'Even Flow'." ...|$|E
60|$|The Romans, my lord, when a {{question}} {{was in the}} senate, whether they should ransom fifteen thousand citizens who had merited much by their former victories, but losing one battle were taken prisoners; were determined by the advice of that noble Roman Attilius Regulus not to redeem them as men unworthy their further care, though probably it was <b>their</b> misfortunes <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>faults</b> lost that day.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the priests}} {{are not the}} men they used to be, Souchey. And it is <b>not</b> exactly <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> neither. There are so many folks about in these days who care nothing who goes to glory and who does not, and they are too many for the priests." ...|$|R
50|$|Raymond and Neal {{arrive in}} Kiribati to begin filming the reality TV series, {{when the world}} around them has {{degraded}} into a state of turmoil, which may or may <b>not</b> be <b>their</b> <b>fault.</b> International incidents play out while the characters explore the island. As world events spiral out of control, Raymond, his friends and family react and respond to the world changing around them.|$|R
2500|$|As the regatta committee's minutes also note, it was rejecting Kelly {{because he}} was deemed ineligible because of his {{bricklaying}} work. The regatta's rules on amateurism excluded anyone ... who is or ever has been ... by trade or employment for wages a mechanic, artisan or labourer. Two days before he was due to sail to the UK, with his passage booked and his boat boxed, Kelly received a telegram which said: [...] "Entry rejected; letter follows." [...] He never received the letter. The Henley Stewards later declared that they had informed the governing board for U.S. rowing as soon as Kelly's entry was processed, {{and that it was}} <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> if the information was not passed on.|$|E
2500|$|In many jurisdictions, {{abuse that}} is suspected, not {{necessarily}} proven, requires reporting to child protection agencies, {{such as the}} Child Protection Services in the United States. Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as primary care providers and nurses, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child’s immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child {{that he or she}} has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> helps in disclosing more information. Dolls are sometimes used to help explain what happened. For the suspected abusers, it is also recommended to use a nonjudgmental, nonthreatening attitude towards them and to withhold expressing shock, in order to help disclose information.|$|E
2500|$|In reality, Smith was {{discontent with}} only a few colonists who acted this way; he [...] "claimed the early colonists were heroes. His primary purpose in writing The Generall Historie...was to eternalise 'the memory of those that effected' the {{settlement}} of Virginia". Smith {{goes so far as to}} compare the colonists to Adam and Eve in A Description of New England (1616). Just as Adam and Eve spread productivity throughout the world, so the colonists created life in the Virginia colony. Smith essentially sympathized with gentlemen; he knew that it was <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> that they were useless and that this trait was merely a product of the imposed standards of English society. He recognized that [...] "they were imprisoned by their own self-imposed limitations. What they could and could not do was decided by their awareness of traditional roles and by the shame that they would feel if others saw them engaged in physical work". Lemay suggests that, as a result of Smith's strict rules and the emigration to America, these men could shed these roles and create new lives for themselves in which they could celebrate the products of their labours and not feel humiliated.|$|E
5000|$|He {{met with}} the Lusitanian emissaries and agreed that it had <b>not</b> been <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> in waging war against the Roman (and Galba's) provinces - {{they had no choice}} due to their poverty - so Galba {{suggested}} that the Lusitanians become allies of Rome and receive fertile land to colonise. Galba promised lands in different areas, so when the Lusitanians agreed to Galba's offer, they split into three factions to march to their destination. When they arrived, they were met with Galba's forces and massacred.|$|R
6000|$|This was <b>not</b> {{altogether}} <b>their</b> <b>fault.</b> Ruth {{was poor}} and apparently friendless, {{but it was}} not her poverty that was against her. Lou Scott, who was [...] "as poor as a church mouse," [...] to quote her own frank admission, was the most popular girl in the seminary, the boon companion of the richest girls, and in demand with everybody. But Lou was jolly and frank and offhanded, while Ruth was painfully shy and reserved, and that was the secret of the whole matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>not</b> {{altogether}} <b>their</b> <b>fault,</b> Colonel," [...] said my landlord, with a grim look of humour. [...] "Jack Firebrace and Tom Humbold of Spotsylvania {{was here}} this morning, chanting horses with 'em. And Jack and Tom got 'em to play cards; and they didn't win--the British Captains didn't. And Jack and Tom challenged them to drink for the honour of Old England, and they didn't win at that game, neither, much. They are kind, free-handed fellows {{when they are}} sober, {{but they are a}} pretty pair of fools--they are." ...|$|R

60|$|In such a {{case the}} criticisms of the family circle, {{particularly}} of the smaller Jackson sisters, were so breezy and unrestrained that Mrs. Jackson generally {{felt it necessary to}} apply the closure. Indeed, Marjory Jackson, aged fourteen, had on three several occasions been fined pudding at lunch for her caustic comments on the batting of her brother Reggie in important fixtures. Cricket was a tradition in the family, and the ladies, unable to their sorrow to play the game themselves, were resolved that it should <b>not</b> be <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> if the standard was not kept up.|$|R
6000|$|... "The wind, Excellenza," [...] was {{the light}} response. [...] "But the figures, they are <b>not</b> yet without <b>their</b> <b>faults.</b> They need some touches yet. When those are given, and the--block yonder," [...] {{pointing}} towards the canvas screen, [...] "when Haman there, as I merrily call him,--him? it, I mean--when Haman is fixed on this, his lofty tree, then, gentlemen, will I be most happy to receive you here again." ...|$|R
50|$|Some caper films {{end with}} poetic justice, when a {{criminal}} gang's takings of a well planned heist are {{lost in a}} manner that is usually <b>not</b> quite <b>their</b> own <b>fault,</b> in complete opposition to the perfect execution of the crime itself. A striking example are the last minutes of Mélodie en sous-sol or the original versions of Ocean's Eleven and The Italian Job.|$|R
6000|$|... "Married; yes. They were married. It was <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> {{that the}} {{marriage}} was nothing. What was he {{to do when he}} heard that they had been deceived in this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid the}} horses are inside there, boys," [...] I said. [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> {{they belong to}} Lane, and whether you come along or not, I'm going to {{liberate}} them." ...|$|E
60|$|Randy and Earl both spoke earnestly, {{and it was}} <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> {{that what}} they had to say did not take effect. But Fred Dobson was both wild and reckless, and he shook his head.|$|E
60|$|The next evening, {{after work}} was over, George {{went in to}} Bob Grimstone's and told them all that had happened. When the story was told, Bob agreed that after all it was <b>not</b> {{altogether}} <b>their</b> <b>fault,</b> and that, indeed, they had, in some respects, justified his opinion of them. Mrs. Grimstone, however, was not so easily pacified. They had come back, she said; {{but it was more}} than likely that they wouldn't have come back at all, but might have been drifting out far at sea, perhaps cutting each other's throats and eating each other alive, which was, as the good woman said, what she had heard happened when boats were lost at sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Theophilus, [...] "there will {{be black}} laws {{like those of}} Illinois and Tennessee; there will be {{turbulent}} uprisings of the Irish, excited by political demagogues, that will bar them out of Northern States. Besides, as a class, they will be idle and worthless. It will <b>not</b> be <b>their</b> <b>fault,</b> {{but it will be}} the result of their slave education. All their past observation of their masters has taught them that liberty means licensed laziness, that work means degradation; and therefore they will loathe work, and cherish laziness as the sign of liberty. 'Am not I free? Have I not as good a right to do nothing as you?' will be the cry.|$|R
50|$|It is {{rare for}} {{a partner to}} be forced out by fellow partners, {{although}} that can happen if the partner commits a crime or malpractice, experiences disruptive mental illness, or is not contributing to the firm's overall profitability. However, some large firms have written into their partnership agreement a forced retirement age for partners, which can be anywhere from age 65 on up. In contrast, most corporate executives are at much higher risk of being fired, even when the underlying cause is <b>not</b> directly <b>their</b> <b>fault,</b> such as {{a drop in the}} company's stock price. Worldwide, partner retirement ages can be difficult to estimate and often vary widely, particularly because in many countries it is illegal to mandate a retirement age.|$|R
60|$|Stephen went. It was <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> {{that his}} sense at their comradeship was gone. To {{him it was}} as if the ties that had bound him to them were asunder, and he was become an outcast.|$|E
6000|$|... “It was <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault.</b> I slipped by {{when the}} guard was changed,” he said. “One would make excuses for such boldness, but you {{understand}} the necessities of business. Now, I have here examples of a most excellent tobacco.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why--so we would, {{but there}} was always a talk of sending Conrade and Francis home. I am afraid you will think them very backward, dear Rachel, {{especially}} Francie; but it is <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault,</b> dear children, and they are not used to strangers," [...] added Fanny, nervously.|$|E
5000|$|Publius Cornelius Scipio P.f. P.n. Africanus (living circa 211 BC/205 BC-170 BC) was {{the eldest}} son of Scipio Africanus and his wife Aemilia Paulla. [...] He was chosen flamen dialis and was augur from 180 BC. Little {{information}} on him survives, as he did not stand {{for any of the}} high offices or have a public career of note. Cicero relates that he was in poor health, the particulars of which he refuses to mention, stating that [...] "we ought <b>not</b> to reproduce ... <b>their</b> <b>faults</b> (of ancestors)." [...] Scipio died young from his poor health.|$|R
50|$|By 1966 it {{had become}} {{apparent}} that the industry would still be unable to obtain adequate private insurance, so the act was extended until 1976. A provision {{was added to the}} Act which prevented companies from offering certain defenses to damages claims (particularly defenses which claimed that the accident had <b>not</b> been <b>their</b> <b>fault).</b> A minimum time limit was also introduced (which could be surpassed by state law), giving claimants three years after discovering harm in which to make a claim. The alterations were intended to make the process of obtaining funds from reactor companies easier, and to remove discrepancies in different states where different laws applied. The new provisions only applied to incidents where a significant escape of radioactive material was deemed to have occurred (an ENO, extraordinary nuclear occurrence).|$|R
5000|$|Wasters are <b>not</b> without <b>their</b> <b>faults.</b> The all wooden {{construction}} usually makes wasters somewhat {{lighter and}} differently balanced than steel weapons. The difference of material properties between wood and steel creates {{a difference in}} performance when training and sparring. The wood wasters tend to recoil from strong contact with other wasters as may occur in a strong parry or absetzen, a phenomenon colloquially referred to as [...] "waster bounce". Steel weapons do not display this attribute to the same extent, usually binding and sliding with minimal rebound instead. The use of wood with rounded edges makes wasters considerably safer for practice than a steel weapon, but does not make them totally safe. Strong cuts or thrusts to vulnerable body parts during sparring may lead to significant injury to the individual. Wasters provide a safer training experience than steel weapons {{at the cost of}} authenticity.|$|R
60|$|Any freight {{of goods}} was anxiously watched by both nobles, {{and it was}} <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> if no {{disaster}} befell the travellers. Hugh talked of the Schlangenwald marauders with the bitterness of a deadly feud, but manifestly did not breathe freely till his whole convoy were safe across both the wet and the dry channel.|$|E
60|$|We {{unpacked}} our cooking-utensils and provisions, and had supper. There was no {{milk for}} our coffee, {{but we did}} not care. The evening did not pass gayly. We were annoyed by the conduct of old John and the express-boy, though, perhaps, it was <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault.</b> I had given them no notice that I should need them.|$|E
6000|$|... "People who haven't natural gumption never learn," [...] {{retorted}} Aunt Jamesina, [...] "neither {{in college}} nor life. If they {{live to be}} a hundred they really don't know anything more than when they were born. It's their misfortune <b>not</b> <b>their</b> <b>fault,</b> poor souls. But {{those of us who}} have some gumption should duly thank the Lord for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>not</b> {{altogether}} <b>their</b> <b>fault.</b> When it {{was determined}} that the king should ride out and meet the mob, the most stringent orders were given that on no account should the archers draw a bow upon the rabble. It is true that there were doubts whether many of them were not at heart with the people, which was not altogether unnatural, seeing that they were drawn from the same class and from the same counties. Still, doubtless, most of them would have proved true, and so long as they did their duty the others could hardly have held back; but, in truth, this had naught to do with the order, which was simply given to prevent a broil between the garrison and the mob, for had some of the latter been killed, it might have cost the king his life and the lives of all with him.|$|R
5000|$|Some time {{prior to}} 452, Liu Shao and Liu Jun the Prince of Shixing had {{become acquainted with}} the witch Yan Daoyu (嚴道育), whose magical {{abilities}} their sister Liu Ying'e (劉英娥) the Princess Dongyang had believed greatly. Because Emperor Wen was strict with his sons, he often rebuked Liu Shao and Liu Jun for errors in their behavior. Initially, Liu Shao and Liu Jun requested that Yan use magical powers to plead to the gods and ghosts so that Emperor Wen would <b>not</b> hear <b>their</b> <b>faults.</b> Later, Liu Shao and Liu Jun began to have Yan curse Emperor Wen to hasten his death, so that Liu Shao could become emperor. By this point, the brothers had become so resentful of their father Emperor Wen that when they corresponded with each other, they referred to their father derogatorily as [...] "that person", and referred to their uncle Liu Yigong the Prince of Jiangxia, who was the prime minister by this point, [...] "flatterer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Adrian then narrates how he {{came back}} to Spain after a {{business}} trip to Paris. However, instead of going home straight to his wife and young daughter, he went to the outskirts of town for a rendezvous with Laura. On their way home to the city, they get involved in a collision with another car. Although they are unhurt, the driver of the other car, a young bank worker named Daniel Garrido, dies at the scene. Laura rationalizes that it is <b>not</b> entirely <b>their</b> <b>fault</b> since Daniel was texting while driving and did not have his seat belt on. While another car passes by, Adrian and Laura pretend like nothing happens and the driver leaves. While trying to flee the scene, Adrian's car engine dies off. Laura waits for help while Adrian leaves with Daniel's car {{to get rid of it}} and the body. He drives it into a lake and disposes of it there. He then texts Laura his location and she comes to fetch him with his car, now repaired.|$|R
