40|$|Legal Capital of Capital Companies, its Formation and Protection This diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} concepts on legal capital, its economic significance and mainly with statutory rules of legal capital formation. The attention {{is given to}} various aspects of monetary as well as non-monetary contributions to the legal capital of capital companies, inclusive of the legal capital minimum requirement, and also the issue of <b>no</b> <b>par</b> <b>value</b> <b>shares</b> is mentioned. The Czech law {{is based on the}} capital formation and maintenance doctrine. Also the European law, which influences Czech legal rules to a high extent, stands on the principles of fixed legal capital. This means that capital companies must be provided by their owners (members, shareholders) with a certain capital stock at the time the companies are formed and come into being and this capital stock must be kept in the company for its whole life. The sense of these rules is predominantly seen in the protection of creditors. The capital formation rules comprise mainly the requirement for minimum legal capital and rules concerning the contributions to the legal capital. The minimum capital requirement is aimed at securing that the capital company starts its business with sufficient funds. The regulation of contributions is meant to ensure that the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Share {{premiums}} now {{constitute a}} substantial proportion of UK company equity but rarely featured on nineteenth century company balance sheets. This paper discusses when and why this changed {{and why the}} definition of the share premium account as company capital took nearly a century to reach the statute books. From 1855 to 1948 any surplus above par on issued shares could be treated at the directors' discretion, including appropriation for the payment of dividends. This freedom was removed in the Companies Act 1948 (s. 56), after the Cohen Committee recommended that share premiums should normally be treated as share capital and employed in a very limited range of transactions. The paper outlines the accounting and legal history of the share premium account and argues that the growth of share premiums was due to a tax avoidance loophole, open from 1889 to 1973, which permanently changed company practice on share issues after 1920. The effect of legal restrictions {{on the use of the}} share premium account is also addressed. One possible future consequence of the loss of economic significance of the nominal <b>value</b> of a <b>share</b> is the total abolition of both this and the share premium account by adoption of <b>no</b> <b>par</b> <b>value</b> (npv) <b>shares,</b> a change which has recently been adopted in Australia and is again under consideration in the UK.
