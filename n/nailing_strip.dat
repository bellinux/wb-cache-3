50|$|Not that I {{had much}} to do with it. In common with {{hundreds}} of others I was drafted there, and we patrolled the streets usually in pairs-without any tangible result. We did, however, rather anticipate a great commercial invention. To our clumsy regulation boots we <b>nailed</b> <b>strips</b> of rubber, usually bits of old bicycle tires, and so ensured some measure of silence when walking.|$|R

5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots {{began to emerge}} in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply <b>nailed</b> <b>strips</b> of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|R
60|$|To {{gain access}} to this scuttle one was forced to climb a sort of ladder which had been formed by <b>nailing</b> <b>strips</b> of wood against the logs, and, as I learned before we were {{come to an end}} of using this cabin as a place of refuge, it was by no means a simple task to ascend, even for lads who were {{accustomed}} to swarming up trees, or shinning the slender masts of our river craft.|$|R
5|$|Cadet George Washington Street, of Wisconsin, was {{identified}} as the first person ever to score a touchdown for the Naval Academy. The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley, of Pennsylvania, was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, the uniforms the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported blue, black, and white striped uniforms, while the Naval Academy wore maroon and white uniforms. Both teams also <b>nailed</b> <b>strips</b> of leather {{to the bottom of}} their shoes to help deal with slipping.|$|R

5|$|The {{pressure}} from the ice caused Endurance to start to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and <b>nailing</b> <b>strips</b> over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the {{pressure from}} the ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough {{to know when to}} stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|R

2500|$|For Doctor Whos 21st-century revival the Dalek casings {{retain the}} same overall shape and {{dimensional}} proportions of previous Daleks, although many details have been re-designed {{to give the}} Dalek a heavier and more solid look. Changes include a larger, more pointed base; a glowing eyepiece; an all-over metallic-brass finish (specified by Davies); thicker, <b>nailed</b> <b>strips</b> on the [...] "neck" [...] section; a housing for the eyestalk pivot; and significantly larger dome lights. The new prop made its on-screen debut in the 2005 episode [...] "Dalek". [...] These Dalek casings use a short operator inside the housing while the 'head' and eyestalk are operated via remote control. A third person, Nicholas Briggs, supplies the voice in their various appearances. In the 2010 season a new, larger model appeared in several colours representing {{different parts of the}} Dalek command hierarchy.|$|R
50|$|This {{process has}} been {{replaced}} in modern architecture by lath and plaster, a common building material for wall and ceiling surfaces, in which a series of <b>nailed</b> wooden <b>strips</b> are covered with plaster smoothed into a flat surface. In many regions this building method has itself been overtaken by drywall construction using plasterboard sheets.|$|R
50|$|On November 30, 1882, cadet Vaulx Carter {{organized}} a {{game between the}} Naval Academy and the Clifton Athletic Club (in fact Johns Hopkins University) and won 8 - 0, the first intercollegiate game in Maryland. It snowed heavily before the game, {{to the point where}} players for both teams had to clear layers of snow off of the field, making large piles of snow along the sides of the playing ground. Both teams also <b>nailed</b> <b>strips</b> of leather to the bottom of their shoes to help deal with slipping. The field was 110 yards by 53 yards, with goalposts 25 ft apart and 20 ft high. During play, the ball was kicked over the seawall a number of times, once going so far out it had to be retrieved by boat before play could continue. The following season, Gallaudet college and Georgetown played twice; the first intercollegiate games in Washington, D. C.. The deaf-mute Gallaudet players sewed their own uniforms, made of heavy canvas with black and white stripes.|$|R
2500|$|Carpet is {{commonly}} made in widths of [...] and [...] in the US, 4m and 5m in Europe.

For environmental reasons, the use of wool, natural bindings, natural padding, and formaldehyde-free glues is becoming more common. These options are almost always at a premium cost.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} was so fine and bright {{that all the}} {{passengers}} were on deck, and after breakfast the word was passed forward that the carpenter was wanted. Reuben {{found that he was}} wanted to <b>nail</b> some <b>strips</b> of wood on the floor of some of the cabins, to prevent the boxes from shooting out from under the berths when the vessel rolled. As he was at work at one of these, a young lady came {{to the door of the}} cabin, and uttered a little exclamation of surprise at seeing Reuben kneeling on the floor. Then, seeing what he was doing, she said: ...|$|R
60|$|As before, {{some of the}} Indians {{carried a}} board with <b>strips</b> <b>nailed</b> across it for steps, and the desperadoes had a similar contrivance. The two boards were placed at {{opposite}} ends of the stockade, and, while some of the enemy began to mount them, others came rushing on with a tree trunk, which they used as a battering-ram against the stockade gate.|$|R
2500|$|Anastasia was {{seventeen}} years, {{one month old}} {{at the time of the}} assassination, while Maria was nineteen years, one month old. Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday.

Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found [...] "shards of a container of sulfuric acid, <b>nails,</b> metal <b>strips</b> from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber." [...] The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes. Also, striped material was found that appeared to have been from a blue-and-white striped cloth; Alexei commonly wore a blue-and-white striped undershirt.|$|R
50|$|A {{door frame}} {{can be built}} into the can wall, or rather the can wall is built around the frame. The process {{involves}} initially having a door frame set in place (on the foundation) and stacking cans {{to either side of}} the frame until they reach the other walls of the building and the ceiling. The door frame is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially {{into the side of the}} frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the <b>nails.</b> Short <b>strips</b> of metal lath are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix.|$|R
5000|$|On August 23, 2007, a Russian {{archaeologist}} {{announced the}} discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovskys memoirs.

50|$|It {{forms the}} {{substructure}} of wattle and daub, a composite building material used for making walls, in which wattle is daubed with a sticky material usually made of {{some combination of}} wet soil, clay, sand, animal dung and straw. Wattle and daub {{has been used for}} at least 6,000 years, and is still an important construction material {{in many parts of the}} world. This process is similar to modern lath and plaster, a common building material for wall and ceiling surfaces, in which a series of <b>nailed</b> wooden <b>strips</b> are covered with plaster smoothed into a flat surface.Many historic buildings include wattle and daub construction, and the technique is becoming popular again in more developed areas as a low-impact sustainable building technique.|$|R
60|$|The foot-lights {{had been}} {{arranged}} by <b>nailing</b> narrow <b>strips</b> of board on the under {{side of the}} stage, and allowing them to project about six inches beyond where the curtain would come when it was lowered. On these strips the bottles, some large and some small, were to be placed, each with a candle in it. Ben was confident that they would remain there safely enough, provided no one walked very heavily on the stage; he also suggested to Mopsey {{that he should have}} as little fighting as possible in the play, because of the insecurity of these bottle foot-lights. This piece of advice, however, caused the author to frown severely, as if he felt that some of his best scenes would thus be interfered with.|$|R
2500|$|A less {{widely used}} {{treatment}} for ingrown toenails is nail bracing. Nail braces work by gently lifting {{the sides of}} the toenail and eventually retraining the nail to grow to a flatter shape over time. The total time needed for the nail to be reshaped is one full nail growth or about 18 months. [...] There are two main types of nail braces: adhesive and hooked. Adhesive nail braces are generally made of a thin strip of composite material that is glued {{to the top of the}} <b>nail.</b> The <b>strip</b> naturally tries to return to a flat state and lifts the edges of the nails in the process. Hooked nail braces consist of a hook (usually made of dental wire) placed under either side of the nail with some type of tensioning system pulling the hooks together.|$|R

Carpet is commonly made in widths of [...] and [...] in the USA, 4m and 5m in Europe. Since the 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was sewn together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned underlay (pad) using <b>nails,</b> tack <b>strips</b> (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal stair rods.
