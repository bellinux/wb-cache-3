5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in 'old-style' serif typefaces {{took place in the}} late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

The attribution came to be considered certain by the Imprimerie's director Arthur Christian.|$|E
5|$|Andrei Kolmogorov {{developed}} in a 1931 paper {{a large part of}} the early theory of continuous-time Markov processes. Kolmogorov was partly inspired by Louis Bachelier's 1900 work on fluctuations in the stock market as well as Norbert Wiener's work on Einstein's model of Brownian movement. He introduced and studied a particular set of Markov processes known as diffusion processes, where he derived a set of differential equations describing the processes. Independent of Kolmgorov's work, Sydney Chapman derived in a 1928 paper an equation, <b>now</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Chapman–Kolmogorov equation, in a less mathematically rigorous way than Kolmogorov, while studying Brownian movement. The differential equations are <b>now</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Kolmogorov equations or the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations. Other mathematicians who contributed significantly to the foundations of Markov processes include William Feller, starting in the 1930s, and then later Eugene Dynkin, starting in the 1950s.|$|E

The Deseret-Western, <b>now</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Deseret Power Railroad, supplemented its fleet with two ex-NdeM locomotives in the late 1990s, and another three in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drain Holland Fen, and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close {{to the location of}} the present Grand Sluice.
