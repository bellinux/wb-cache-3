40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} minor mergers between an S 0 galaxy and a gas-rich satellite galaxy, by means of N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. The satellite galaxy is initially on a <b>nearly</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> and undergoes several periapsis passages before being completely stripped. In most simulations, {{a portion of the}} stripped gas forms a warm dense gas ring in the S 0 galaxy, with a radius of ~ 6 - 13 kpc and a mass of ~ 10 ^ 7 solar masses (Msun). The ring is generally short-lived ( 6 Gyr in the central parts of the S 0 galaxy {{as a consequence of the}} interaction.

40|$|Several galaxies have {{exhibited}} X-ray flares {{that are}} consistent with the tidal disrup-tion of a star by a central supermassive black hole. In theoretical treatments of this process it is usually assumed that the star was initially on a <b>nearly</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> relative to the black hole. Such an assumption leads in the simplest approximation to a t− 5 / 3 decay of the bolometric luminosity and this is indeed consistent with the relatively poorly sampled light curves of such flares. We point out that there is another regime in which the decay would be different: if a binary is tidally separated and the star that remains close to the hole is eventually tidally disrupted from a moderate eccentricity orbit, the decay is slower, typically ∼ t− 1. 2. As a result, careful sampling of the light curves of such flares could distinguish between these processes and yield insight into the dynamics of binaries as well as single stars in galactic centres. We explore this process using three-body simulations and analytic treatments and dis-cuss the consequences for present-day X-ray detections and future gravitational wave observations.

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with <b>nearly</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet Nine described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet Nine the analysis estimates that Planet Nine is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the evolution of}} planets undergoing a strong tidal encounter using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), {{for a range of}} periastron separations. We find that outside the Roche limit, the evolution of the planet is well-described by the standard model of linear, non-radial, adiabatic oscillations. If the planet passes within the Roche limit at periastron, however, mass can be stripped from it, but in no case do we find enough energy transferred to the planet to lead to complete disruption. In light of the three new extrasolar planets discovered with periods shorter than two days, we argue that the shortest-period cases observed in the period-mass relation may be explained by a model whereby planets undergo strong tidal encounters with stars, after either being scattered by dynamical interactions into highly eccentric orbits, or tidally captured from <b>nearly</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits.</b> Although this scenario does provide a natural explanation for the edge found for planets at twice the Roche limit, it does not explain how such planets will survive the inevitable expansion that results from energy injection during tidal circularization. 1...|$|R
40|$|Stellar mass compact {{objects in}} short period (P � 10 3 s) orbits about a 10 4. 5 – 10 7. 5 M ⊙ massive black hole (MBH) {{are thought to}} be a {{significant}} continuous-wave source of gravitational radiation for the ESA/NASA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) gravitational wave detector. These extreme mass-ratio inspiral sources began in long-period, <b>nearly</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> that have multiple close encounters with the MBH. The gravitational radiation emitted during the close encounters may be detectable by LISA as a gravitational wave burst if the characteristic passage timescale is less than 10 5 s. Scaling a static, spherical model to the size and mass of the Milky Way bulge we estimate an event rate of ∼ 15 yr − 1 for such burst signals, detectable by LISA with signal-to-noise greater than five, originating in our galaxy. When extended to include Virgo cluster galaxies our estimate increases to a gravitational wave burst rate of ∼ 18 yr − 1. We conclude that these extreme mass-ratio burst sources may be a steady and significant source of gravitational radiation in the LISA data streams.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} topics related {{mostly to}} the dynamics of white dwarfs (chapter 2), the dynamics of stars around binary super massive black holes (chapters 4, 5 and 6) and dynamics in the singular isothermal sphere (chapter 7). In chapter 2 the kinematics of young ( 0. 95 M⊙) are also investigated, and it is shown that they {{are consistent with the}} majority being formed via single-star evolution from massive progenitor stars. In chapter 3 it is shown that the coolest, oldest white dwarfs can be identified photometrically from their unique colors, and five new ultracool white dwarfs are spectroscopically confirmed. In chapter 4 it is shown that close binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) should produce a burst of tidal disruptions of up to 0. 1 yr − 1 as they form. The quiescent rate is ∼ 10 − 5 yr − 1 per galaxy, and it is therefore shown that binary SMBHs can potentially be identified via multiple tidal disruptions from the same system. In chapter 5 we perform more extensive simulations of the dynamics of stars around binary SMBHs to better quantify and understand the stellar dynamics. By incorporating general relativistic corrections, we also investigate the processes undergone by compact remnants orbiting the binary SMBHs, analyzing both objects that plunge directly into the SMBHs, and those that undergo extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The potential used to mimic general relativistic precession in these simulations is novel, and more accurate for the type of <b>nearly</b> <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> considered in this work: It is described in chapter 6.

40|$|Let G {{be a real}} form of {{a complex}} semisimple Lie group GGˆ, P⊂ GP⊂Gˆ a {{parabolic}} subgroup and V= G/PV=Gˆ/P the corresponding flag manifold of GGˆ. As was shown by J. A. Wolf in [Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 75 (1969), 1121 [...] 1237; MR 0251246 (40 # 4477) ], there exists exactly one GG-orbit MM on VV that is closed (and hence compact) in VV. This orbit is connected, of minimal dimension amongst the GG-orbits and it is naturally endowed with a GG-invariant CR structure, namely the one induced by the GGˆ-invariant complex structure of VV. Let us call a homogeneous CR manifold which occurs as a closed orbit of this kind a minimal <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit.</b> Observe that any minimal <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> MM is (up to equivalences) uniquely determined just by a pair (G,P) (G,P), where GG is a real form of a complex semisimple Lie group GGˆ and PP is a parabolic subgroup of GGˆ. The authors single out a set of properties satisfied by the pairs of Lie algebras (g= Lie(G), p= Lie(P)) (g=Lie(G),p=Lie(P)) associated with minimal <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> and prove that, conversely, any pair satisfying such properties (called an effective minimal parabolic CR algebra) {{is associated with a}} minimal <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> in some flag manifold.

Then, they study some topological properties of the homogeneous CR manifolds associated with effective minimal parabolic CR algebras and give complete characterizations of those, whose associated minimal <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> satisfy some special conditions on their CR structure.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{three-dimensional}} {{evolution of a}} viscous protoplanetary disc which is perturbed by a passing star on a <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit.</b> The aim is to test whether a single stellar flyby is capable to excite significant disc inclinations which would favour the formation of so-called misaligned planets. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics to study inclination, disc mass and angular momentum changes of the disc for passing stars with different masses. We explore different orbital configurations for the perturber's orbit to find the parameter spaces which allow significant disc inclination generation. Prograde inclined <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> are most destructive leading to significant disc mass and angular momentum loss. In the remaining disc, the final disc inclination is only below 20 ^∘. This {{is due to the}} removal of disc particles which have experienced the strongest perturbing effects. Retrograde inclined <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbits</b> are less destructive and can generate disc inclinations up to 60 ^∘. The final disc orientation is determined by the precession of the disc angular momentum vector about the perturber's orbital angular momentum vector and by disc orbital inclination changes. We propose a sequence of stellar flybys for the generation of misalignment angles above 60 ^∘. The results taken together show that stellar flybys are promising and realistic for the explanation of misaligned Hot Jupiters with misalignment angles up to 60.

40|$|The {{gravitational}} radiation driven capture (GR capture) between unequal mass {{black holes}} without spins {{has been investigated}} with numerical relativistic simulations. We adopt the parabolic approximation which assumes that the gravitational wave radiation from a weakly hyperbolic orbit {{is the same as}} that from the <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> having the same pericenter distance. Using the radiated energies from the <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> simulations, we have obtained the critical impact parameter (b_ crit) for the GR capture for weakly hyperbolic orbit as a function of initial energy. The most energetic encounters occur around the boundary between the direct merging and the fly-by orbits, and can emit several percent of initial total ADM energy at the peak. When the total mass is fixed, energy and angular momentum radiated in the case of unequal mass black holes are smaller than those of equal mass black holes having the same initial orbital angular momentum for the fly-by orbits. We have compared our results with two different Post-Newtonian (PN) approximations, the exact <b>parabolic</b> <b>orbit</b> (EPO) and PN corrected orbit (PNCO). We find that the agreement between the EPO and the numerical relativity breaks down for very close encounters (e. g., b_ crit≲ 100 M), and it becomes worse for higher mass ratios.
