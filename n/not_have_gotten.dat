25|$|The Glamorgan reply could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> {{off to a}} worse start, losing opener Richard Grant {{very first}} ball. David Hemp soon followed, {{becoming}} Plunkett's second victim, with only seven runs on the board. Glamorgan were always struggling with the run-rate, {{with most of the}} top-order recording strike rates of below 100. Only four players made it to double figures, with Jamie Dalrymple top scoring with 32, and had stern support from wicket-keeper Mark Wallace, who fired 26 off sixteen deliveries. However, Glamorgan fell a long way short with Plunkett, the pick of the Durham attack, taking 3-16 off three overs.|$|E
25|$|The Pistons {{opened up}} with a rout in Game 1, as Detroit's big men keyed in on Dwight Howard and forced him to playoff lows 12 points and 8 rebounds, with five Pistons scoring in double figures. After being quiet in Game 1, the Magic's 3-point {{shooting}} picked up (11/26, with Jameer Nelson making 5-of-8), but could not overcome 19 turnovers and fell down in the series 2–0. There was a controversial call {{at the end of}} the third quarter, where Chauncey Billups made a 3 near the end of the 3rd quarter when the clock froze and approximately 0.5 seconds remained, but TNT clocks later revealed that Billups could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> the ball off in time.|$|E

Meanwhile, Handlen thought that if the arcs of the [...] "red reality" [...] {{were not included in}} this installment, it would not work as an episode. While Sepinwall called the [...] "green reality" [...] storyline [...] "boring", Handlen thought that the storylines of Marcus and Alina did not [...] "matter"; according to Handlen, the episode should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> into the details of the guest stars. Sepinwall and Handlen were disappointed that Rex did not appear in the episode; Handlen praised Rex, calling him a [...] "likable teenage boy" [...] who deserves more running time.|$|E

500|$|Tao {{made her}} Olympic début for Singapore at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, {{arriving}} ranked 26th out of 49 butterfly swimmers. On 9 August, {{the second day}} of the swimming competition, she qualified fourth fastest for the semifinals of the 100metres butterfly after winning her heat with a personal best time of 57.77seconds. The following day she made it to the finals, shaving off 0.23seconds for another personal best time and new Asian record of 57.54seconds. She came in fourth behind her role model, Australian swimmer Lisbeth Trickett, and the USA's Christine Magnuson and Australia's Jessicah Schipper. She thus set two Asian records and the national record for the event, and became the eighth fastest butterfly swimmer in the world and first Singaporean swimmer to qualify for an Olympic Final. On 11 August, she came fifth at the 100metres butterfly finals with a time of 57.99seconds. The top three spots were taken by Trickett (56.73seconds), Magnuson (57.10seconds) and Schipper (57.25seconds). Asked by The Straits Times about her performance, Tao said, [...] "If I have given another personal best, it would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> me a medal. The top three winners were just too good. I wanted to do my best and I pushed all the way and hoped for the best." [...] Given Tao's age compared to those of the medallists, there were hopes that she would be able to improve on [...] her performance at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.|$|E
