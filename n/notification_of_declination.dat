40|$|Several {{orientation}} and tracking systems employed in parabolic-cylindrical concentrators for focusing the {{direct solar radiation}} on the absorber tubes are analyzed from the technical and economic points of view. Case one, where the incidence factor was a function <b>of</b> <b>declination</b> and hour angle, showed that the maximum variations of incident factor from morning to noon was 0. 5 at zero angle <b>of</b> <b>declination.</b> Case two, where the incidence factor was a function <b>of</b> <b>declination,</b> hour angle and latitude, showed the maximum variation of the incidence factor to be 0. 128, which occurred during noon at the latitude of 30 degrees, corresponding to a change <b>of</b> <b>declination</b> from 0 to 23. 5 degrees. In case three, the incidence factor, a function <b>of</b> <b>declination</b> only, showed that the maximum variation of the incidence factor corresponding to the change in declination from 0 to 23. 5 degree was 0. 0758. It is concluded that system three is the most efficient from the technical and economic point of view...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss a novel and low cost {{experiment}} to determine the angle <b>of</b> <b>declination</b> <b>of</b> the sun on a chosen day. The <b>declination</b> <b>of</b> the sun varies from + 23. 5 degrees to - 23. 5 degrees {{in the course of}} one year. If the zenith angle of the sun is measured as a function of its hour angle on a particular day, it is possible to calculate the angle <b>of</b> <b>declination</b> by using <b>of</b> spherical trigonometric relationship between them. The zenith angle is determined by using the shadow length of a vertically placed rod. The hour angle is determined from the position of shadow as a function of time. The value <b>of</b> solar <b>declination</b> may be compared with that available in almanacs...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R

Stellar clusters and nebulae are not plotted, but a six-color press was used to distinguish six basic spectral classes of stars.
