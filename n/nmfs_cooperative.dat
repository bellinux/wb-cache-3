40|$|The National Marine Fisheries Service (<b>NMFS)</b> <b>Cooperative</b> Shark Tagging Program (CSTP) {{is part of}} {{continuing}} research directed {{to the study of}} the biology of large Atlantic sharks. The CSTP was initiated in 1962 at the Sandy Hook Laboratory in New Jersey under the Department of Interior's U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). During the late 1950 's and early 1960 's, sharks were considered a liability to the economy of resort communities, of little or no commercial value, and a detriment to fishermen in areas where sharks might damage expensive fishing gear or reduce catches of more commercially valuable species...|$|E
40|$|<b>NMFS)</b> <b>Cooperative</b> Shark Tagging Program (CSTP) {{covering}} {{the period from}} 1963 through 2004 are summarized for the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) in the western North Atlantic. The extent of the tagging effort, areas of release and recapture, sources of tags and recaptures, capture methods, and movements of tagged sharks are reported. Summary information includes number {{of males and females}} tagged and recaptured, overall recapture rate, and maximum distance traveled and time at liberty. In order to examine regional trends in size and maturation categories, the study area is divided into geographical areas. General migration patterns for life history stages for the two shark species are summarized and discussed. 2 LCS 05 / 06 -DW- 2...|$|E
