50|$|<b>Narco-state</b> (also narco-capitalism or narco-economy) is a {{political}} and economic term applied to states where policies are seen to collude and cooperate with the illegal drug trade. It {{has been argued that}} Tajikistan in the 2000s qualified as a <b>narco-state</b> in the Journal of Drug Issues. Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa, has been called a <b>narco-state</b> due to government officials often being bribed by traffickers to ignore the illegal trade. Colombian drug cartels used the West African coast as Jamaica and Panama increased policing. The Guardian noted Guinea-Bissau's lack of prisons, few police, and poverty attracted the traffickers. An article in Foreign Policy questioned the effectiveness of money from the United States, the European Union and the United Nations designated to combat the illegal trade.|$|E

5000|$|Drug trafficking, {{which is}} a major problem in Guinea-Bissau, has been a key issue in the {{election}} campaign, as parties have accused each other of involvement in the drug trade and taking money from cartels in order to finance their campaigns. According to observers, the state's ability {{to crack down on the}} drug trade is very limited, and some have described Guinea-Bissau as a <b>narco-state.</b> Gomes Junior said at a PAIGC rally on 29 October that [...] "only blind people cannot see that certain parties are financed with drug money". PRID President Aristides Gomes pointed to a seizure of cocaine made in September 2006, during his tenure as Prime Minister, in order to bolster his party's image with respect to the drug trade; that cocaine seizure was marred, however, by the subsequent disappearance of the cocaine. PRS President Kumba Yala accused Vieira of trafficking drugs, describing him as the foremost drug trafficker in Guinea-Bissau. Vieira did not reply to Yala's claim.|$|E

In addition, the Obama administration made a very modest effort by way of support for the struggling country although [...] "former drug czar Barry McCaffrey told Congress that Merida, was ‘a drop in the bucket,’" [...] and that the United States [...] "’cannot afford to have a <b>narco-state</b> as their neighbour.’"Thus far, of the resources promised by the United States Government regarding Mexico and their ongoing drug combat, little has been received, principally due to Mexico's current PRI government failing to honour the clause of improving and upholding human rights in the Mexican Federal Republic.|$|E

5000|$|The game {{takes place}} in Bolivia in July 2019. The country has become {{increasingly}} unstable as the Santa Blanca, a previously minor Mexican drug cartel, gains more power and influence within {{the country to the}} point where Bolivia has become a <b>narco-state</b> and the world's largest producer of cocaine. The rise in power of this drug cartel concerns the United States Government, as Santa Blanca's influence has begun to spread beyond Bolivia. The last straw comes when a bomb targets the U.S. embassy in La Paz and its intended target, DEA agent Ricardo [...] "Ricky" [...] Sandoval, is kidnapped, tortured and then killed by the Santa Blanca. As a result, the United States initiates Operation Kingslayer, a joint operation between the CIA, DEA, and JSOC. The United States Army dispatches a fireteam of elite special operations unit called [...] "Ghosts" [...] to destroy the cartel and reveal the connection between Santa Blanca and the local government. The Ghost team consist of Ghost Leader [...] "Nomad", Tactical Gunner [...] "Midas", Engineer [...] "Holt", and Sniper [...] "Weaver". The Ghosts individually make their own way into Bolivia. They rendezvous and are brought to the mission area in Bolivia by helicopter along with their CIA contact, Karen Bowman, who was also a close friend to Ricky. When they land in the province of Itacua they are met with Pac Katari, leader of the Kataris 26, the only resistance against Santa Blanca. Pac Katari gives them their first mission - to recover Amaru, an older man whose ideologies inspired him to found the Kataris 26, now captured by the Santa Blanca. After this mission, the Ghosts are more or less free to tackle the cartel in any way and order they see fit.|$|E

The <b>narco-state</b> notion will be debated and opposed in terms of politics, territory, and economics...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Tajikistan has experienced an extraordinary and devastating expansion of opiate trafficking and consumption. While heroin was virtually unknown in the country up to the mid- 1990 s and opium was produced and consumed locally only to a modest degree, in less than a decade Tajikistan has become a key transit country for Afghan opiates bound north- and westwards, {{at the same time as}} it has witnessed a rapid growth of domestic heroin use. Tajikistan now rivals Afghanistan for the unenviable title of the country most dependent on the illicit drug industry, with the opiate industry adding at least 30 % to the recorded gross domestic product. The opiate trade is so important economically that it corrupts the whole political system. This article therefore argues that since the mid- 1990 s Tajikistan has become a <b>narco-state,</b> in which leaders of the most powerful trafficking groups occupy high-ranking government positions and misuse state structures for their own illicit businesses. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} amount of attention paid to Mexico and its struggle with drug cartels. The drug war in Mexico has cost the lives of 28, 000 people since 2006, leading to a growing concern that Mexico may become a <b>narco-state.</b> Although the situation in Mexico seems uncontrollable, {{this is not the first}} time drug trafficking organizations (DTO) have threatened the livelihood of a state. Colombia from the 1980 s through the mid- 1990 s was dominated by cartels that ruled with violence and almost brought Colombia to its knees. Colombia today continues with its fight against DTOs; however, the security of the state is no longer directly threatened by cartels. This thesis will discuss the history of the cocaine trade and explain why Mexico was able to supplant Colombia as the cocaine epicenter. Likewise, we will discuss the U. S. strategy to combat DTOs and identify shortcomings in order to implement a better strategy to defeat the cartels. We have seen an increase in violence in Mexico and it is critical for the U. S. to act in order to prevent the U. S. homeland from coming under siege by the bloody Mexican drug war fueled by the cartels...|$|E
40|$|This project {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} history, evolution, and rapid expansion of the drug trade industry in Mexico. Drug trafficking organizations have caused crime and violence to reach unprecedented levels {{on both sides of}} the border. As a result of economic and social struggle, a new form of Mexico’s capitalist state has emerged. This so-called <b>Narco-state</b> is battling a war against drugs which is ultimately failing due to the quickly evolving facets of organized crime. Drugs, human trafficking, and pirated property are all part of the multi-billion dollar import and export business. This generation’s culture of corruption has made its way to even the highest levels of the Mexican state government. As a result of intimidation, violence, and practically unlimited funds, the power struggle between government and organized crime has arguably been shifted in favor of the cartels. By summarizing and analyzing the points made in Ioan Grillo’s book El Narco, I attempt to provide a clear and accurate picture of the current issues involving the drug trade as well as our national response to it (or lack there of). It is necessary to educate ourselves regarding these often grim and sometimes overlooked current events in order to change them. By drawing examples from film, interviews, and music, this project may shed light on the evolving threat, proposed solutions, and the emerging culture of drug trafficking in Mexico...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} some concerns {{that derive from}} Suriname‘s May-July 2010 elections, {{which resulted in the}} re-emergence of erstwhile military ruler and convicted drug trafficker, Désiré (Desi) Bouterse, as President of the Republic. The victory reflects Bouterse‘s political acumen in aggregating disparate political interests and in establishing a viable coalition government. But because of his history and profile, this triumph has generated anxiety in some places internationally. In this respect, the {{study examines}} anxieties related to three matters: (a) relations with Guyana, where there is an existing territorial dispute and a recently resolved maritime dispute, (b) illegal drug trafficking operations, and (c) foreign policy engagement with Venezuela. There has been a flurry of bilateral activities—including several presidential summits—with Guyana since President Bouterse‘s inauguration, albeit seemingly more about symbolism than substance. Although the maritime dispute was settled by a Tribunal of the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea in 2007, the 15, 000 km 2 New River Triangle is still unresolved. Indeed, in June 2011 President Bouterse reasserted Suriname‘s claim to the Triangle. Suriname has upped the ante in that dispute by portraying internationally the map of Suriname as inclusive of the disputed area. In all likelihood that self-redefinition slowly will become the country‘s cartographic definition {{in the eyes of the}} world if Guyana does not successfully rebuff that move or pursue the definitive settlement of the dispute. A geonarcotics assessment shows Suriname to be still heavily implicated in trafficking, because of geography, law enforcement limitations, corruption, and other factors. But despite Bouterse‘s drug-related history and that of former senior military officers, several reasons suggest the inexpediency of a <b>narco-state</b> being created by Bouterse. As well, as part of Suriname‘s pursuit of increased Caribbean and South American engagement, it has boosted relations with Venezuela, which has included it in PetroCaribe and provided housing and agricultural aid. However, the engagement appears to be driven more by pragmatism and less by any ideological affinity with Hugo Chavez...|$|E
40|$|The United States {{has shaped}} the global {{response}} to drugs {{over the last}} century. Afghanistan, and its resultant massive opium production, is the greatest failure of the internationalization of the American-led war on drugs. Starting during the Progressive-era, the United States backed a prohibitionist stance toward certain drugs, including opium and its derivatives. While Afghanistan was creating its own opium policies after complete independence from Great Britain, the United States pushed a global anti-drug approach. Despite having minimal contact previously, the Americans and Afghans joined in a brief, but significant, opium alliance during the Second World War, with the United States secretly purchasing the bulk of Afghan opium. After the war, the United States publicly asked Afghanistan to end opium cultivation while suggesting in private that the Afghans should continue production. At the United Nations, the Americans sabotaged the Afghans' attempt to get legal international recognition as an opium exporter. The United States did respond to Afghanistan's destitute condition by supplying developmental aid that would have the unforeseen consequence of increasing poppy cultivation. Improved transportation networks also provided opportunities for Western youth to visit Afghanistan as drug tourists and couriers. During the 1970 s, the decade before the Soviet invasion, Washington's concern over Afghan opium reached {{the highest level of}} government. Despite new efforts to replace opium as a cash-producing plant, Afghan drug production steadily increased. With Afghanistan on the verge of transforming into a global producer of heroin, the United States fomented unrest in the nation by first funding and then backing known drug traffickers. Along with Soviet aggression, the American intelligence program led to chaotic conditions that were capitalized on by drug traffickers. After years of war in the 1980 s and 1990 s, Afghanistan gained the dubious title of the world's most prolific <b>narco-state.</b> After the post- 9 / 11 invasion, with American boots on the ground for over a decade, Afghanistan remained a major source for opium. As a result, Afghanistan was the most visible breakdown of the American global war against drugs...|$|E
40|$|Other written product {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 2001, the United States has appropriated over $ 15 billion to help secure, stabilize, and reconstruct Afghanistan. In February 2007, the administration requested $ 12. 3 billion in additional funding to accelerate some of these efforts to prevent the conflict-ridden nation from once again becoming {{a safe haven for}} terrorists and from devolving into a <b>narco-state.</b> More than 50 nations, including the United States, and several multilateral organizations are engaged in securing, stabilizing, and reconstructing Afghanistan. Progress has been made in areas such as economic growth, infrastructure development, and training of the Afghan army and police, but after more than 5 years of U. S. and international efforts, the overall security situation in this poor and ethnically diverse country has not improved and, moreover, has deteriorated significantly in the last year. The lack of security limits the success of efforts to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan. Direct challenges to these efforts include a resurgence of the Taliban, the limited capabilities of Afghan security forces, inadequate infrastructure, limited government capacity, corruption, a largely illiterate and untrained labor force, a dramatic increase in drug production, and a lack of viable licit economic opportunities. Since 2003, we have issued five reports on U. S. efforts in Afghanistan [...] one on food and agricultural assistance, two on reconstruction assistance, one on efforts to establish Afghan national security forces, and one on drug control programs. We identified programmatic improvements that were needed, as well as many obstacles that limited success and should be taken into consideration in program design and implementation. A key improvement we identified in most of the U. S. efforts was the need for improved planning, including the development of strategic plans with elements such as measurable goals, specific time frames, cost estimates, and identification of external factors that could significantly affect efforts. Some additional needed improvements we identified include better coordination among the United States and other donor nations, more flexible options for program implementation, and timelier project implementation. We also concluded that several obstacles, especially deteriorating security and the limited institutional capacity of the Afghan government, challenge the effectiveness of U. S. efforts. ...|$|E
