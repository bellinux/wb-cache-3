25|$|As {{the inquiry}} unfolded, home videos of {{initiation}} rites in the CAR's French-speaking commando {{found their way}} into the media. The new Minister of National Defence David Collenette argued that the videos were disgusting, demeaning and racist. With the continued accumulation of such politically damaging visibility, the Minister of National Defence advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to disband the Canadian Airborne Regiment in 1995. It has been suggested that this move was as much driven by budget cuts to the Canadian Forces as by the Somalia Affair, but there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> affair gave the minister the public support needed to make his request for disbandment.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> engines were different from one another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E
6000|$|Then Mr. Bunny Rabbit hipperty-hopped away {{to where}} his family awaited him, {{and there could be}} <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> long story had come to ...|$|R

60|$|There was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{presence}} of property of a missing British official upon a suspicious vessel {{would have been}} a difficult thing to explain in any civilized port in the world.|$|R
500|$|Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources {{gave the}} issue 3 stars out of 5 saying, the issue [...] "doesn't {{do much to}} advance the agenda or tighten up the plotlines of [...] "Trinity War", but there is {{absolutely}} <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> developments in this issue {{are going to have}} lasting ramifications for the Phantom Stranger and his quest for redemption." [...] Newsarama's Richard Gray gave it an 8 out 10 saying [...] "Some will pick up this issue for the links to the current “Trinity War” arc, but all should be transfixed by the way J.M. DeMatteis views the afterlife." ...|$|E
500|$|Wark {{was not a}} [...] "supremely talented" [...] player, but, {{according}} to football journalist Jim White, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid. Every week, they played as an entity {{greater than the sum}} of its parts." [...] He has been described as [...] "a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record".|$|E
500|$|In Part II, {{she accused}} her colleagues of redefining {{predisposition}} {{so that it}} had to include an awareness that the action to be undertaken was illegal, {{despite the fact that the}} CPA did not include specific intent to receive child pornography as an element of the crime. [...] "The elements of predisposition," [...] she said, [...] "should track the elements of the crime". The Bare Boys purchases were not, she argued, as dispositive of that as the majority claimed. Her last sentences responded to White's, saying that there was <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> jury had been properly instructed on entrapment law and thus, their decision that Jacobson could not claim entrapment should be allowed to stand.|$|E
60|$|There {{could be}} <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> men were {{intending}} to break camp, and, uncertain {{as to what}} he should do, Jet watched until all the camp equipage had been stowed on board the craft.|$|R
60|$|There {{could be}} <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> man was coming {{for the sole}} and only purpose of paying them a visit, and Jet was quite {{confident}} he had grown suspicious he and his companion were being followed.|$|R
50|$|Guests {{must ask}} KAT-TUN a Yes or <b>No</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> splits <b>the</b> group in half {{in order to}} receive a delicious food prize. The guests have 3 chances but usually KAT-TUN is lenient and splits in half so the guest can receive their present.|$|R
500|$|Modern {{historians have}} been {{divided on the}} issue. T. F. Tout, writing in 1914, {{rejected}} the idea. J. S. Hamilton, who wrote a biography of Gaveston in 1988, {{on the other hand}} says that [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> king and his favourite were lovers". Pierre Chaplais, writing a few years later, had more reservations. Chaplais cites the fact that Edward had four children with his wife – and even an extra-marital son – as well as the relative silence of contemporary commentators on the topic. He also finds {{it hard to believe that}} Philip IV of France would have allowed the English king to marry his daughter Isabella if Edward was known to be homosexual. Mark Ormrod has pointed out the inherent anachronism of speaking of homosexuality in a medieval context. Instead Ormrod suggests the focus should be on the motivation behind the use of sexuality in contemporary attacks on the King and Gaveston.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to DDoS attacks against Church of Scientology websites, Anonymous also organized a campaign {{on one of}} their websites to [...] "begin bumping Digg", referring to an attempt to drive up Scientology-related links on the website Digg.com. On January 25, 2008, eight of the top ten stories on Digg.com were about either Scientology-related controversies or Anonymous and attempts to expose Scientology. Digg CEO Jay Adelson told PC World that Anonymous had not manipulated the site's algorithm system to prevent artificial poll results, stating: [...] "They must have {{done a very good job}} of bringing in a diverse set of interests ... It just happened to hit a nerve that the Digg community was interested in." [...] Adelson said two other instances which similarly have dominated the Digg main page in the past were the Virginia Tech Massacre in the aftermath of the incident and the [...] "7/7" [...] London bombings in 2005. Adelson commented on the popularity of Scientology theme within the Digg community: [...] "In the history of Digg, there's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> topic of Scientology has been of great interest to the community ... I can't explain why." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 19, 2017, at his Senate {{confirmation}} hearing, Jon Huntsman Jr., Trump's {{nominee for}} United States Ambassador to Russia, stated: [...] "There is no question, underline <b>no</b> <b>question,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Russian government interfered in the U.S. election last year." ...|$|E
5000|$|Diane Abbott, {{the member}} of {{parliament}} for Hackney, said [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> continuing achievement gap between black boys and the wider school population has some bearing on the involvement of African-Caribbean boys in gangs." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first thought}} {{which came to}} my mind was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Avenger was in great danger of being {{captured}} in short order, for I made <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enemy would pursue Barney, and we were where we could not escape, save {{by way of the}} bay.|$|R
60|$|Then suddenly, {{although}} we knew full well it must soon come, {{the report of}} a rifle rang out on the still air; after this another and another, until there could be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> foremost of the party had come upon those of whom we gave warning.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dichotomy}} {{with which}} historians view Stephens aside, there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> black {{population of the}} time revered him [...] and Sen. Stephens was murdered {{in the basement of}} a courthouse by the K.K.K. for his political views and assisting freed slaves.|$|E
2500|$|... there [...] <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hippy [...] {{movement}} and its repercussive influence in England owed {{much of its}} imagery, its manner, dress and personal appearance to the Pre-Raphaelite ideal ... It was observed by {{all of us who}} were involved with these exhibitions [...] that visitors included increasing numbers of the younger generation, who had begun to resemble the figures in the pictures they had come to see.|$|E
2500|$|The UN {{report also}} {{condemned}} {{the use of}} indiscriminate rocket attacks by Palestinian militants which targeted known civilian areas within Israel, stating that [...] "here's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> firing of rockets and mortars [...] was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians and damage to civilian structures. The mission found that these actions also amount to serious war crimes and also possibly crimes against humanity".|$|E
5000|$|<b>No</b> one <b>questioned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Clarendon County {{schools were}} unequal. At the {{beginning}} of the hearings in U.S. District Court, the defendants admitted upon <b>the</b> record <b>that</b> [...] "the educational facilities, equipment, curricula and opportunities afforded in School District No. 22 for colored pupils are not substantially equal to those afforded for white pupils." ...|$|R
6000|$|During {{five minutes}} the boys watched intently, {{and then there}} could be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> leader should be awakened. They had seen a man, {{or at least a}} portion of one, as the foliage was parted gently to admit of his looking out, and Neal said as he raised his gun: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{singular}} story," [...] the lawyer said, [...] "and if supported by proofs, {{there can be}} <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> you are <b>the</b> Marquis, for whom we have been advertising, for many years." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. criticized {{excessive}} U.S. {{spending on}} military projects, and suggested a linkage between {{its foreign policy}} abroad and racism at home. In 1971, a Time Magazine essayist wondered why there were 375 major foreign military bases {{around the world with}} 3,000 lesser military facilities and concluded [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. today has too many troops scattered about in too many places." [...] In a 2010 defense report, Cordesman criticized out-of-control military spending. Expenditures to fight the War on Terror are vast and seem limitless.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to judge how the example set by developers such as Ripley affected the standards of speculative builders. Writing in 1891 William Cudworth had {{no doubt about the}} beneficial impact of the improved dwellings movement over the longer term. [...] "There can be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> housing of the operative classes is comparably better than it was fifty years ago. There is more provision for separate bedrooms.... The cottage of today with its wide streets and separate closets is a fair approach to sanitary perfection".|$|E
2500|$|The MSHA filed {{a motion}} in federal court to allow UMWA participation, and U.S. District Judge Robert E. Maxwell ordered ICG to allow UMW {{officials}} to enter the mine, saying [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public interest is best served by a complete and thorough investigation into the occurrence of the problems at the Sago Mine....There is a strong public interest in allowing miners {{to play a role}} in this investigation, as it is their health and safety that is at issue." [...] On January 27, 2006, the ICG said it would appeal.|$|E
2500|$|There can be {{no doubt}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current {{dictatorship}} has been pernicious for the human [...] development of the regions outside of the North and Khartoum. There can be <b>no</b> [...] <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> data support the claims made in <b>the</b> Black Book <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sudan has [...] been governed to benefit those regions disproportionately at the expense of all others.|$|R
2500|$|Section 106 of the 1976 [...] Act grants {{the owner}} of a {{copyright}} a variety of exclusive rights in the copyrighted work, including ... the right [...] "to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords." ... Although the word [...] "copies" [...] is in the plural in 107(1), there can be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> under <b>the</b> Act the making of even a single unauthorized copy is prohibited....|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] {{said the}} younger man, [...] "there can be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> as to <b>that.</b> <b>The</b> Logos is assuredly but a name used by St. John to signify the Deity." ...|$|R
2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Committee members felt that the graver charges would not be believed in if the more sensationalist accusations were dismissed, as Wilson claims. [...] However, there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Committee members exercised poor judgement in their selection of some testimony. [...] They reprinted 55 depositions from the small town of Hofstadt, many dubious, where fewer than ten murders occurred. [...] (The depositions average only 2.11 on Lipkes’s scale, with soldiers providing 85% of the testimony.) [...] Meanwhile, the Committee failed to investigate carefully well-documented cases of mass executions, such as Andenne, Tamines, and Dinant.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa LeCount, an {{associate}} professor of archaeology at the University of Alabama, theorized that, if it is a crown, it might have been carved into the stone to establish leadership. [...] "The stone could have been used as a tool by an emerging king to validate his exalted position and to legitimize his right to the throne. Only the elite in that society would have known how to read and write." [...] LeCount said there should be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Olmecs represented the [...] "mother culture" [...] and predated the Mayans, whose writings and buildings remain to this day.|$|E
2500|$|... "The present case begins {{where our}} prior cases left off. [...] Here there is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial stop {{was based on}} {{reasonable}} suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in Brown. [...] Further, the petitioner has not alleged that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in Kolender. [...] Here the Nevada statute is narrower and precise." [...] The Nevada Supreme Court had held that the Nevada statute required only that the suspect divulge his name; presumably, he could do so without handing over any documents whatsoever. [...] As long as the suspect tells the officer his name, he has satisfied the dictates of the Nevada stop-and-identify law.|$|E
60|$|The {{one thing}} which seemed most {{surprising}} to us lads, after Captain Smith {{had called it}} to our notice, was that these people, who knew there could be <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> winter would find them in Jamestown, when there could be neither roasting ears, peas, beans, nor fowls of the air to be come at, made no provision for a harvest.|$|R
60|$|There {{could be}} <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enemy hoped {{we might be}} so venturesome as to sally out, and I doubt {{if there was a}} man within the {{fortification}} who did not feel convinced that St. Leger's troops were ready to swoop down in assault at the first show of our having sent away any portion of our force.|$|R
