Employee attitude surveys {{before and after the}} changes show those moving to 12 -hour working much more satisfied with both <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and other changes, compared with those remaining on 8 -hour shifts. The creation of extra non-work days was seen as the major advantage of the longer shifts, which compensated for the harder work regime identified under teamworking and the greater rigidity of the 5 -shift system. The findings underline the potential significance of working hours for employee support for broader changes in working practices. Possible explanations of why the longer shift pattern met with considerable support at one research site, but failed to gain support at a similar site elsewhere, are also explored.

The basis of working hours is contained the Labour Code 262 / 2006. Working hours are often decisive factor for selecting employment.

From the 1 st May 2004 is the Czech Republic member of the European Union and it implies an obligation to bring Czech legal regulation into conformity with European Union regulation. For regulation of working hours are important judgements of the European Court of Justice. The most important judgements are mentioned in the thesis (e. g. Jaeger, SIMAP). These judgements had big influence on definitions of working hours in Labour Codes of the Member States.

Improving the labour market situation would not only increase living standards and growth potential but also reduce social exclusion and ease pressures on public spending. This paper analyses various characteristics of the French labour market that may explain the low utilisation of labour potential. It puts forward the need for a comprehensive reform of the labour market aiming at: i) shifting the burden of social protection in the labour market away from employers towards the state by reducing and streamlining employment protection legislation; ii) removing incentives that lead to early withdrawal from the labour market; iii) allowing employers and employees more freedom to <b>negotiate</b> <b>working</b> hours; and iv) improving efficiency in job placement services. employment protection legislation, France, labour costs, minimum wage, inactivity traps, <b>working</b> <b>time</b> reduction, wage bargaining, public employment services...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patters across 22 European countries. The focu was on three questions: how much mothers prefer to work, how much they {{actually}} work, and to what degree their preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> are (in) consistent with each other. The focus was on cross-national differences in mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, comparison of mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> to that of childless women and fathers, as well as on individual- and country-level factors that explain the variation between them. In the theoretical background, the departure point was an integrative theoretical approach where the assumption is that there are various kinds of explanations for the differences in mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns – namely structural, cultural and institutional –, and that these factors are laid in two levels: individual- and country-levels. Data were extracted from the European Social Survey (ESS) 2010 / 2011. The results showed that mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns, both preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> varied across European countries. Four clusters were formed to illustrate the differences. In the full-time pattern, full-time work was the most important form of work, leaving all other <b>working</b> <b>time</b> forms marginal. The full-time pattern was perceived in terms of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times</b> in Bulgaria and Portugal. In polarised pattern countries, full-time work was also important, but it was accompanied by a large share of mothers not working at all. In the case of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> many Eastern and Southern European countries followed it whereas in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> it included all Eastern and Southern European countries as well as Finland. The combination pattern was characterised by the importance of long part-time hours and full-time work. It was the preferred <b>working</b> <b>time</b> pattern in the Nordic countries, France, Slovenia, and Spain, but Belgium, Denmark, France, Norway, and Sweden followed it in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> The fourth cluster that described mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> was called the part-time pattern, and it was illustrated by the prevalence of short and long part-time work. In the case of preferred <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> it was followed in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Besides Belgium, the part-time pattern was followed in the same countries in terms of actual <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> The consistency between preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> was rather strong in a majority of countries. However, six countries fell under different <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns when preferred and actual <b>working</b> <b>times</b> were compared. Comparison of working mothers’, childless women’s, and fathers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> showed that differences between these groups were surprisingly small. It was only in part-time pattern countries that working mothers worked significantly shorter hours than working childless women and fathers. Results therefore revealed that when mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>times</b> are under study, an important question regarding the population examined is whether it consists of all mothers or only working mothers. Results moreover supported the use of the integrative theoretical approach when studying mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns. Results indicate that mothers’ <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns in all countries are shaped by various opportunities and constraints, which are comprised of structural, cultural, institutional, and individual-level factors.

These changes have an impact on <b>working</b> <b>time</b> duration and the way <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is organised. One of the manifest results is the erosion of a clear demarcation between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and non-working time – the work and private sphere. The European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) is among the sources that have clearly established the link between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> patterns and the health and wellbeing of workers.

This applies to organizations, forms of employment and <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is such an adaptation and the main subject of this essay. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the conditions that underpin unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> in relation to the Swedish legislation and to EU legislation. The intention has been to investigate the work environment impacts of unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> and what differences there are from a gender perspective. The conclusion is that workers who enter into agreements for unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> have significantly different terms from traditional workers. Workers with unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> are exempted from the <b>working</b> <b>time</b> law and so even the provided safety net. A frequent part in agreements of unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> also means that the employee agrees to an elimination of compensation for overtime work. Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is appropriate for workers who have working tasks that they can adjust to their <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> Workers with controlled working tasks have not the same opportunity, which increases the risk of perceived ill health. Unregulated <b>working</b> <b>time</b> is therefore not suitable for all forms of employment.

Time adequacy is the fit between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and all other time demands and can be achieved through <b>working</b> <b>time</b> flexibility and autonomy.
