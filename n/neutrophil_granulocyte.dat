30|$|In {{addition}} to humoral factors, leukocytes are also thought {{to contribute to}} the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction during sepsis. While VNS did not influence microglial activation, our results suggest a modulatory effect of VNS on the migration of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> to the brain. In this regard, VNS reduced the mRNA expression of the neutrophil-specific chemokine CXCL 1 and the adhesion molecule ICAM- 1 in the hypothalamus, indicating a VNS-induced reduction of migration signals for <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes.</b> Interestingly, and possibly due to the early time point of investigation, protein-level immunohistochemical analysis did not show any differences of ICAM- 1 between the septic groups neither in the SFO and neighboring choroid plexus nor in the cortex. This might be due to different regulatory processes on mRNA and protein level, which act in a time-dependent manner. <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> are thought to migrate into the brain parenchyma 12 to 24  h after an insult [40 – 45]. At the early time point (4.5  h) of this study, they were probably still adhering to and rolling on endothelial cells [45]. Interestingly, the number of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> counted in the cortex did not differ between the septic groups, but we could show here, for the first time, that VNS reduced the colocalization between ICAM- 1 and <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> indicating a decreased interaction and adhesion of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> and ICAM- 1 on cerebral blood vessels. This might contribute to the beneficial effects of VNS on brain microcirculation. As ICAM- 1 protein expression was not influenced by VNS, this might rather point to a VNS-induced modulation of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> themselves. Mechanism by which VNS modulates <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> should be further analyzed in future studies. As one possible mechanism, we analyzed leptin plasma concentration, which was reduced by VNS. Leptin is well known as appetite-regulating hormone but recently its function as neuro-immune mediator became known [46]. In this regard, leptin is involved in the migration of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> to the brain [40, 44, 47]. Therefore, upon other in part mentioned mechanisms, VNS might also inhibit neutrophil migration to the brain in a leptin-dependent manner.|$|R

50|$|In medicine, granulocytosis is the {{presence}} in peripheral blood of an increased number of granulocytes, a category of white blood cells. Often, the word refers to an increased <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocyte</b> count, as neutrophils are the main granulocytes.|$|E

30|$|In addition, a {{correlation}} between <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> and endoglin (CD 105) can be shown. Pessler et al. (2008) described that infiltration of granulocytes and neovascularization correlate {{with each other in}} chronic septic arthritis as well as in septic total arthroplasties. <b>Neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> produce cytokines in the process of neovascularization (Vågesjö et al. 2012).

40|$|Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) stimulates integrin-dependent {{adhesion}} of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> to endothelial cells, one of {{the early}} key events in acute inflammation. However, the signalling pathway(s) of ET- 1 -stimulated neutrophil adhesive responses has not been elucidated. Previous studies indicated that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation could mediate rapid responses of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> to various stimuli. In this study, we investigated the role of ERK signalling in human <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes</b> challenged with ET- 1. ET- 1 rapidly down-regulated the expression of L-selectin and up-regulated the expression of CD 11 b/CD 18 on the neutrophil surface. Concomitantly, ET- 1 induced homotypic adhesion (aggregation) of neutrophils, that was blocked by a monoclonal antibody to CD 18. ET- 1, through ETA receptors, evoked activation of Ras and subsequent phosphorylation of Raf- 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPK/ERK kinase) and ERK 1 / 2. ERK activation by ET- 1 was rapid, concordant with the kinetics of ET- 1 -stimulated neutrophil aggregation. Neutrophil responses to ET- 1 were markedly attenuated by the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor PD 98059, whereas inhibitors of p 38 MAPK, tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase had no detectable effects. We have observed a tight correlation between neutrophil ERK activation and homotypic adhesion. These data indicate an essential role for ERK in mediating ET- 1 -stimulated adhesive responses of human <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocytes...</b>|$|R

50|$|With {{macrolide}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocyte</b> proliferation but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive secretions in airways. The antimicrobial and antibiotic effects of macrolides, however, are not believed {{to be involved in}} their beneficial effects toward treating DPB. This is evident, as the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of the macrolide-resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, macrolide therapy still produces substantial anti-inflammatory results.|$|E
5000|$|FERMT3 {{mutations}} {{can result}} in autosomal recessive leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome-III (LAD-III). a deficiency in beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrin activation in platelets and leukocytes that causes haemorrhaging and recurrent infections. Loss of FERMT3 expression in leukocytes compromises their adhesion to the inflamed endothelia and affects <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocyte</b> binding and spreading while selectin mediated rolling is unaffected. It has also been found that FERMT3 lowers Natural Killer cell’s activation threshold, such that a loss of FERMT3 affects single receptor activation of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity but has no impact on multiple receptors, where the protein deficiency is overcome and target cells are killed.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to imply the {{possibilities}} of the urgent cytological examination of synovial fluids in differential diagnosis of arthropathies and to motivate the clinicians to use this method. It gave valuable information particularly with respect to differentiate the inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint diseases. This study included 115 synovial fluids obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the swollen knee from the patients in the period between 2003 and 2008. At our department the urgent cytological examination of the synovial fluids consisted of macroscopic analysis that includes volume, colour, clarity, viscosity and mucin clot test, native microscopic analysis for crystals and tissue fragments, counting the total nucleated cell count and semiquantitative microscopic analysis for <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocyte</b> percentage on the slides stained with Hemacolor rapid staining. All cytological analyses were done within one hour since FNA. According to our results the clarity, viscosity, mucin clot test, the total nucleated cell count and the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocyte</b> percentage enabled distinction between inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases with statistically significant difference at the 0. 01 level but we could not differentiate these two groups of illnesses according to volume and colour. In inflammation the total nucleated cell count and the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocyte</b> percentage was greater than in non-inflammation, the clarity was only translucent and opaque, the viscosity was low and the mucin clot test was negative. In non-inflammatory diseases the clarity varied from transparent to opaque, the total nucleated cell count and the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>granulocyte</b> percentage was smaller than in inflammatory diseases, the viscosity was high and consequently the mucin test was highly positive in all samples. Crystals were detected in only 12 samples of synovial fluids, mostly in inflammation and they were all monosodium urate (MUS) so we could diagnose gout. We could conclude that the urgent cytological analysis of the synovial fluid is a very useful, simple and reliable basic diagnostic screening test in differentiation inflammatory and non-inflammatory joint diseases and we recommended using it as the initial test in the diagnostic procedure of these illnesses using our protocol...|$|E
