50|$|In North America, from 1947 to 1995, all <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> <b>area</b> (NPA) <b>codes</b> were {{distinguished}} with a 0 or 1 as {{the middle}} digit, while central office codes (the first three digits of a seven-digit local number) never had a 0 or 1 {{as the middle}} digit.|$|R
50|$|Many {{telephone}} numbering {{plans are}} structured based on divisions into geographic {{areas of the}} service territory. Each area identified in the plan is assigned a numeric routing code. This concept was first developed for Operator Toll Dialing of the Bell System in the early 1940s, which preceded the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) of 1947. The system divided the North American service territories into numbering plan areas (NPAs), and called the numerical prefix the <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> <b>area</b> <b>code,</b> which became known in a short-form as area code. The area code is prefixed to each telephone number assigned.|$|E
50|$|The SPID is a {{numeric string}} from 3 to 20 digits in length. A SPID (or more than one, if necessary) is {{assigned}} when the ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) is {{obtained from the}} phone company. Beginning in 1998, most phone companies began to use a generic SPID format. In this format, the SPID is a 14-digit number that includes a 10-digit telephone number (which includes the 3-digit <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>Area</b> <b>code),</b> a 2-digit Sharing Terminal Identifier, and a 2-digit Terminal Identifier (TID). The generic SPID format {{makes it easier to}} tell users what to specify when installing an ISDN line and simplifies corporate installation procedures.|$|E
50|$|The new {{numbering}} plan was officially accepted in October 1947, dividing most of North America into 86 Numbering Plan Areas (NPAs). Each NPA {{was assigned a}} <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>Area</b> <b>code,</b> often abbreviated as area code. These codes were first used by long-distance operators to establish long-distance calls between toll offices. The first customer-dialed direct call using area codes was made on November 10, 1951, from Englewood, New Jersey, to Alameda, California. Direct distance dialing (DDD) was subsequently introduced {{across the country and}} by the early 1960s most areas of the Bell System had been converted and it was commonplace in cities and most larger towns.|$|E
50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 440 is a North American {{telephone}} <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for {{the state}} of Ohio, serving parts of the Greater Cleveland area, but not the city of Cleveland or most of its inner suburbs. This <b>area</b> <b>code</b> was established August 16, 1997. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 440 was formed by a three-way split of <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 216, one of the original North American <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>codes.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 330 was created in 1996 from the southern part of 216 and 440 was added the following year {{to keep up with the}} increasing number of cellular phones, as well as population factors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 201 was the first-assigned <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> <b>area</b> (NPA) <b>code</b> of the {{original}} NPAs when AT&T devised the North American <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> in 1947. It {{was also the first}} <b>area</b> <b>code</b> with Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) service, when in 1951 the first direct-dialed long-distance call was made from Englewood, New Jersey to Alameda, California.|$|R
50|$|This page {{details the}} format and usage of {{telephone}} numbers in Slovakia. Today, Slovakia uses a closed <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> with <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> beginning with 0.
