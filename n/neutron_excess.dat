Adding another alpha particle would lead to unstable 44Ti, which quickly decays via two successive electron captures to stable 44Ca; this makes up 2.806% of all natural calcium and is the second-most common isotope. The other four natural isotopes, 42Ca, 43Ca, 46Ca, and 48Ca, are significantly rarer, each comprising less than 1% of all natural calcium. The four lighter isotopes are mainly products of the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes, leaving the two heavier ones to be produced via neutron-capturing processes. 46Ca is mostly produced in a [...] "hot" [...] s-process, as its formation requires a rather high neutron flux to allow short-lived 45Ca to capture a neutron. 48Ca is produced by electron capture in the r-process in type Ia supernovae, where high <b>neutron</b> <b>excess</b> and low enough entropy ensures its survival.|$|E

The pass of r-process ejected per supernova is expected to be about 0. 0001 solar mass per Type II or Ib supernova, but this is sensitive to details of the presupernova structure, the explosion mechanism, and the amount of material that falls back onto the neutron star when the reverse shock arrives there...|$|R

A weak target dependence is seen. Previously these cross sections have been reported to have a strong, approximately quadratic, dependence on the projectile mass.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{understanding of}} SNe Ia diversity {{is one of}} the most urgent issues to exploit thermonuclear explosions of accreted White Dwarfs (WDs) as cosmological yardsticks. In particular, we investigate the impact of the progenitor system metallicity on the physical and chemical properties of the WD at the explosion epoch. We analyze the evolution of CO WDs through the accretion and simmering phases by using evolutionary models based on time-dependent convective mixing and an extended nuclear network including the most important electron captures, beta decays, and URCA processes. We find that, due to URCA processes and electron-captures, the <b>neutron</b> <b>excess</b> and density at which the thermal runaway occurs are substantially larger than previously claimed. Moreover, we find that the higher the progenitor metallicity, the larger the <b>neutron</b> <b>excess</b> variation during the accretion and simmering phases and the higher the central density and the convective velocity at the explosion. Hence, the simmering phase acts as an amplifier of the differences existing in SNe Ia progenitors. When applying our results to the <b>neutron</b> <b>excess</b> estimated for the Tycho and Kepler young supernova remnants, we derive that the metallicity of the progenitors should be in the range Z = 0. 030 – 0. 032, close to the average metallicity value of the thin disk of the Milky Way.
