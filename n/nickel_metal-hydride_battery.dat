It has combined ratings of [...] and 550 Nm. The electric-motor is powered by 240-cell, 288 V, 6 Ah <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> <b>battery</b> array. The 4motion four-wheel drive system {{was replaced by a}} lighter Torsen centre differential from Audi Q7 to save weight. The electric motor has the top speed of 50 km/h. Start-stop system supports regenerative braking, coasting. Power steering, air conditioning were changed to be powered by battery.|$|E
50|$|A popular early {{mobile phone}} <b>battery</b> was the <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> (NiMH) type, {{due to its}} {{relatively}} small size and low weight. Lithium ion batteries are also used, as they are lighter {{and do not have}} the voltage depression due to long-term over-charging that <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> <b>batteries</b> do. Many mobile phone manufacturers use lithium-polymer batteries as opposed to the older lithium-ion, the main advantages being even lower weight and the possibility to make the battery a shape other than strict cuboid.|$|R
5000|$|... 2016-era laptops use {{lithium ion}} batteries, with some thinner models using the flatter lithium polymer technology. These two {{technologies}} have largely replaced the older <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> <b>batteries.</b> Battery life is highly variable by model and workload, and {{can range from}} one hour to nearly a day. A battery's performance gradually decreases over time; substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and {{the design of the}} battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.|$|R
40|$|Capacity fade, {{generally}} {{observed in}} <b>metal-hydride</b> electrodes of <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> <b>batteries</b> with prolonged cycling, {{is a problem}} of concern. To investigate the capacity fade, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in lanthanum rich mischmetal alloy (MmNi 3. 6 Al 0. 4 Mn 0. 3 Co 0. 7) electrodes. The impedance measurements were conducted during charging at different stages of cycle life. A novel approach was made to get reaction resistances and limiting currents from impedance data based on an equivalent circuit for finite spherical hydrogen diffusion. The main cause of the capacity fade occurring in metal-hydride electrodes with number of cycles was due to particle pulverization and consequent poor hydrogen desorption kinetics, thereby making it more difficult for hydrogenation to occur because of passivation and resistance of electron conduction between the alloy particles...|$|R
50|$|The Chrysler TEVan was {{a battery}} {{electric}} vehicle produced from 1993 to 1995 by Chrysler and sold primarily to electric utilities throughout the United States. The first generation used either nickel-iron or nickel-cadmium batteries. Only 56 were produced and were sold for approximately $120,000 each. Half were produced using nickel-iron batteries and half were equipped with the nickel-cadmium packs. The TEVan {{was built on the}} same production line as the gasoline-powered minivans at Chrysler's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada. It had a top speed of 70 mi/h km/h, seating for five adults, and a curb weight of 5060 lb. The second generation, named the EPIC (Electric Powered Interurban Commuter Vehicle), was launched in 1997 with advanced lead acid batteries and later in 1998 with <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> <b>batteries.</b> It was offered for lease in New York and California in 1999.|$|R

The objective of this thesis is to design and simulate the solar based stand-alone electrical energy model using MATLAB/SIMULINK software for smart home. Here in this solar based stand-alone system the home is not grid-tied to any local utility, but a battery energy storage system (BESS) is used as a primary backup source. The area under interest selected here is Rockford [...] -a Northwest Suburb of Chicago. The various solar data for the Rockford Area (Latitude 42. 5, Longitude 89. 5) was collected from the NASA Surface meteorology and solar energy website. And a load profile for a generic home was assumed based on the Official energy Statistics of the U. S government [1]. This stand-alone system involves a solar panel, Boost Converter, Maximum Power Point Tracker, DC/AC Inverter, Bidirectional Converter and Battery as its major Simulink blocks. The objective is to provide 24 / 7 highly efficient and economically feasible green and clean solar powered electricity. During the day time the residential loads are supported by the solar panels, which also charge the battery. During the night time the battery is used as a primary source for distributing power to the various domestic appliances of the home. The charging and discharging current is controlled by the bidirectional converter based on the State of Charge (SOC) of the <b>Nickel</b> <b>Metal-Hydride</b> (NiMH) <b>battery</b> bank. The objective of this thesis is to illustrate that using the proposed MATLAB/SIMULINK solar stand alone model, the average daily load requirement of a generic Rockford home of 45. 6 kWh/day is achieved. It was determined that in order to meet this load requirement an array of 46 solar panels (2 in Series and 23 in parallel) are required. PV system supplies the desired 15. 6 kWh of energy during the day time. In order to meet the night load, a battery storage system of 30 kWh (48 V, 625 Ah) is employed. Therefore the simulation done using MATLAB/SIMULINK software validates the feasibility of this solar stand alone system...|$|R

Accessories for the phone included car, desktop and overnight travel chargers, installed hands-free car kits, leather cases, and a selection of batteries. The slimmest battery then available was the Slim and Slim Extended (Life), followed by the Standard, XT, and Talk-Pak XT batteries. The Talk-Pak XT and XT used <b>Nickel</b> <b>Metal-Hydride</b> while the others used Nickel Cadmium. A Lithium Ion battery was introduced in 1994.|$|R
40|$|<b>Nickel</b> <b>Metal-Hydride</b> (NiMH) is an {{advanced}} high-power battery {{technology that is}} presently employed in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) {{and is one of}} several technologies undergoing continuing research and development by FreedomCAR. Unlike some other HEV battery technologies, NiMH exhibits a strong hysteresis effect upon charge and discharge. This hysteresis has a profound impact on the ability to monitor state-of-charge and battery performance. Researchers at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) have been investigating the implications of NiMH hysteresis on HEV battery testing and performance. Experimental results, insights, and recommendations are presented...|$|R

However, the power output of DMFC is lower than hydrogen fuel cells. To improve the power output of DMFC {{it is very important}} to reduce diffusion polarization at higher current density conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} in viewgraph format {{an overview}} of NASDA's evaluation of commercial <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> (Ni-MH) cells and the development and testing of Ni-MH cells for use in space. The commercial cells are concluded to be feasible and suitable for use in LEO; for GEO, the durability for overcharge is needed because long-term charge retention is required. For the aerospace Ni-MH cell design, two activation procedures are applied to evaluate {{the effect of the}} difference in the amount of overcharge protection and precharge. Specific energy of the Ni-MH cell is nearly accomplished at 50 Wh/kg. Initial characteristics indicate the effect derived from precharge. Thirty-five amp-hour class Ni-MH cells have good performance for LEO cycle of 25 and 40 percent DOD up to 3000 cycles as similar to commercial cells. The effect of the difference in the amount of overcharge protection will appear in life test...|$|R
50|$|They {{are often}} {{rectangular}} {{but can also}} be cylindrical. They usually have a screen to show information such as voltage, power, and resistance of the coil. To adjust the settings, the user presses buttons or rotates a dial to turn the power up or down. Some of these devices include additional settings through their menu system such as: atomizer resistance meter, remaining battery voltage, puff counter, and power-off or lock. The power source is the biggest component of an e-cigarette, which is frequently a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Smaller devices contain smaller batteries and are easier to carry but typically require more repeated recharging. Some e-cigarettes use a long lasting rechargeable battery, a non-rechargeable battery or a replaceable battery that is either rechargeable or non-rechargeable for power. Some companies offer portable chargeable cases to recharge e-cigarettes. Nickel-cadmium (NiCad), <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> (NiMh), lithium ion (Li-ion), alkaline and lithium polymer (Li-poly), and lithium manganese (LiMn) batteries {{have been used for}} the e-cigarettes power source.|$|R
40|$|Lithium can be {{intercalated}} into a {{wide variety}} of materials using nonaqueous electrochemical cells. The use of aqueous methods is less common because of the reactivity of many lithium intercalation compounds with water. Here we show that lithium can be intercalated into host compounds from aqueous LiOH solution, provided the chemical potential of the intercalated l ithium is sufficiently lower than the chemical potential of l ithium in l ithium metal. Us ing L iMn~O ~ as the host, we fo rmed L i 2 Mn 204 by intercalating Li f rom L iOH solution in an aqueous cell. This method may prove to be an economica l wayof preparing l ithium transition metal oxides with high l ithium contents for l ithium-ion cell cathodes. Lithium-ion cells now represent the state-of-the-art in small-size rechargeable batteries for consumer electronic devices. The common choices for cathode materials in these cells are LiCoO 2, LiNiO 2, and the spinel, LiMn 204. LiCoO 2 / carbon 1 cells are now in commercial production and have about twice the energy density of nickel-cadmium and <b>nickel</b> <b>metal-hydride</b> cells. Furthermore, the cells have an average discharge voltage of about 3. 8 V, which allows...|$|R
