500|$|Six out {{of eight}} areas in Knowle West are ranked as being {{economically}} deprived. The {{closure of the}} Imperial Tobacco factory at nearby Hartcliffe in 1990 meant the loss of 5,000 jobs and an estimated further 20,000 jobs in service and supporting industries throughout South Bristol. A House of Commons report noted that this had a seriously {{negative effect on the}} area as many people in Knowle West and neighbouring areas lost the opportunity for [...] "manual and semi-skilled employment". The Independent in 1995 noted high drug use and associated crime and reported on the establishment of Knowle West Against Drugs, led by local parents concerned about these problems. In 2006, BBC News said [...] "Knowle West has {{more than its share of}} social problems. [...] The highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>kids</b> in care of any council ward in Bristol. [...] The lowest number of young people with any qualifications (under half). [...] A major petty crime problem, drug addiction, and add to that people are fed up with bad housing." [...] Shawnie, a 2006 novel by social worker Ed Trewavas, written from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl living in Knowle West, documents some of the deprivation he encountered in his work. One of the novel's characters [...] "describes Knowle West ... as a 'shit hole' populated by 'yokels, cider-heads, junkies, dole-scammers, slappers and failed wide boys, all interbreeding and nicking their cruddy possessions off of each other in some giant, dismal rota.'" ...|$|E

We find that more education causes a substantial decrease in childlessness {{and an increase in}} the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> children per woman. Our findings are robust to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> falsification checks and we can provide complementary empirical evidence on the mechanisms leading to these surprising results. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In {{traditional}} medicine, saffron {{is used as}} a {{drug for}} treating many diseases. However there are many documents and evidences concerning its abortive and teratogenic effect especially in high doses. Aim: This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of saffron decoction consumption on pregnant mice and their offspring. Methods: In this study, 20 female mice after breeding and observation of vaginal plaque, randomly and equally divided into two groups. During pregnancy, animals were housed under the same environmental and nutritional condition while the test group received 0. 5 % saffron decoction as their drinks instead of tape water for control group. The pregnant mice were weighted during pregnancy and after delivery. Following the parturition, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> live <b>kids,</b> their weight and sex and any pretended obvious abnormality were assigned. Results: The duration of pregnancy period and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> live <b>kids</b> in test group were significantly less than control group while the mean infant’s weight in test group was more than control group. There was obvious one-eye blindness in 4 kids from saffron consumed group. In the case of mother's weight and sex ratio <b>of</b> live <b>kids</b> {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups. Conclusion: This study indicated that saffron has a specific teratogenic effect on visual system and causes preterm labor and reduces the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> live infants which may be due to its abortive effect.

Live weight, body measurements, hair diameter and density per unit area were directly obtained from animals. Milk production, life span, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>kidding</b> and other behavioural data (0 - 5 score) were collected by interviewing farmersThe proportion of White type linearly decreased from east (30 % in Sylhet) to west (18 % in Bogra) but an erratic fashion was observed in Silver Bezoar type. White type was significantly (p< 0. 001) heavier at 3, 6, 9 and 12 month among the groups. Body length behaved similarly although heart girth and height at wither showed irregular pattern between groups. White goat possessed coarser but Black goat had more dense (p< 0. 01) hair at flank and thigh. Herding tendency, resting in crowdy place, grazing habit (p< 0. 001) of White type was higher than its contemporaries. Average milk yield (g/day) was higher (p< 0. 05) in White type (366. 84) than Black (248. 83) and Silver Bezoar types (274. 16). Above findings suggest that White and Silver Bezoar types of Black Bengal goat are superior to Black coated goats and thus demand due attention in order for their conservation. Further study is needed for genetic characterization for final recommendation...|$|R
