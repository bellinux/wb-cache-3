5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement was <b>nowhere</b> <b>more</b> {{evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of}} his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E

25|$|Protestant missionary {{efforts in}} Asia were <b>nowhere</b> <b>more</b> {{successful}} than in Korea. American Presbyterians and Methodists {{arrived in the}} 1880s and were well received. In the days Korea was under Japanese control, Christianity became in part an expression of nationalism in opposition to Japan's efforts to promote the Japanese language and the Shinto religion. In 1914, out of 16 million people, there were 86,000 Protestants and 79,000 Catholics; by 1934 the numbers were 168,000 and 147,000. Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. Harmonizing with traditional practices became an issue. The Catholics tolerated Shinto rites. The Protestants developed a substitute for Confucian ancestral rites by merging Confucian-based and Christian death and funerary rituals.|$|E

Psychology does not apply to him. He is just history, one of its ever-repeating characters. He has no face." [...] This concept of Richard as a faceless personification of the process of a cyclical history became extremely important in Ian Holm's performance. Whilst some critics felt that Holm was physically too slight to play such a 'large' character, this was precisely the point. Holm's Richard is not the dominating larger-than-life presence of the third play as he appears on the page, but is instead a small figure, nurtured by, trapped within and ultimately destroyed by the times that have produced him. Holm himself has stated [...] "I played Richard very much as a cog in the historical wheel, and not as an individual character.

2500|$|As larger gun calibres became {{common in}} foreign battleships, it was {{recognised}} that greater protection was needed {{than had been}} {{thought to be the}} case in previous classes and so their main armour belt was twelve inches thick over the machinery spaces and magazines. The armour belt in the King Edward VII-class battleships, the immediately preceding class, was <b>nowhere</b> <b>more</b> than nine inches (229mm) thick. The deletion of the casemate armour required for the 6 inch guns formerly mounted allowed the main belt armour to be increased at very little cost in weight. They were more heavily armoured than any other British pre-dreadnoughts, and more heavily armored in terms of area and thickness than any of the dreadnoughts prior to the [...] (considered as the first of the [...] "super-dreadnoughts") of 1909. They were the first British battleships to have solid watertight bulkheads, penetrated by no doors or pipes, intended to contain flooding, with access across the bulkheads being via lifts (elevators). The solid bulkheads proved unpopular in service because of the inconvenience they imposed on the crew and were not repeated in the early British dreadnoughts, although Russian experience in the Russo–Japanese War suggested that such bulkheads were useful in keeping pre-dreadnoughts from sinking. As further protection, each compartment in the Lord Nelsons had its own ventilation and pumping arrangements, eliminating the need for a single main drainage system as employed in previous British battleships and seen as a possible weakness during flooding.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), the {{education}} system in China has been geared toward economic modernization. In 1985, the national government ceded responsibility for basic education to local governments through the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's [...] "Decision on the Reform of the Educational Structure." [...] In unveiling {{the education}} reform plan in May 1985, the authorities called for nine years of compulsory education and the establishment of the State Education Commission (created the following month). Official commitment to improved education was <b>nowhere</b> <b>more</b> evident than in the substantial increase in funds for education in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–90), which amounted to 72 percent more than funds allotted to education in the previous plan period (1981–85). In 1986 some 16.8 percent of the state budget was earmarked for education, compared with 10.4 percent in 1984. Since 1949, education has been a focus of controversy in China. As a result of continual intraparty realignments, official policy alternated between ideological imperatives and practical efforts to further national development. But ideology and pragmatism often have been incompatible. The Great Leap Forward (1958–60) and the Socialist Education Movement (1962–65) sought to end deeply rooted academic elitism, to narrow social and cultural gaps between workers and peasants and between urban and rural populations, and to eliminate the tendency of scholars and intellectuals to disdain manual labor. During the Cultural Revolution, universal fostering of social equality was an overriding priority.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, Kathleen Wheeler {{contrasts}} the Crewe Manuscript {{note with}} the Preface: [...] "Contrasting this relatively factual, literal, and dry {{account of the}} circumstances surrounding the birth of the poem with the actual published preface, one illustrates what the latter is not: it is not a literal, dry, factual account of this sort, but a highly literary piece of composition, providing the verse with a certain mystique." [...] In 1985, David Jasper praised the poem as [...] "one of his greatest meditations on the nature of poetry and poetic creation" [...] and argued [...] "it is through irony, also, as it unsettles and undercuts, that the fragment becomes a Romantic literary form of such importance, <b>nowhere</b> <b>more</b> so than in 'Kubla Khan'." [...] When talking about the Preface, Jasper claimed that it [...] "profoundly influenced {{the way in which the}} poem has been understood". Responding in part to Wheeler in 1986, Charles Rzepka analysed the relationship between the poet and the audience of the poem while describing [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] as one of [...] "Coleridge's three great poems of the supernatural". He continued by discussing the preface: [...] "despite its obvious undependability as a guide to the actual process of the poem's composition, the preface can still, in Wheeler's words, lead us 'to ponder why Coleridge chose to write a preface ... ' What the preface describes, of course, is not the actual process by which the poem came into being, but an analogue of poetic creation as logos, a divine 'decree' or fiat which transforms the Word into the world." ...|$|E
