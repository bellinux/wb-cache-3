5|$|The {{government}} threatened another dissolution if {{the bill}} for the Parliament Act were not passed, and followed through on their threat when opposition in the Lords did not diminish. The general election of December produced little change from January. The calling of a second dissolution of parliament <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been contrary to the wishes of Edward VII. Edward had died in May 1910 while the crisis was still in progress. His successor, George V, {{was asked if he}} would be prepared to create sufficient peers, which he would only do if the matter arose. This would have meant creating over 400 new Liberal peers. The King did, however, demand that the bill would have to be rejected at least once by the Lords before his intervention. Two amendments made by the Lords were rejected by the Commons, and opposition to the bill showed little sign of reducing. This led Asquith to declare the King's intention to overcome the majority in the House of Lords by creating sufficient new peers. The bill was finally passed in the Lords by 131 votes to 114 votes, a majority of 17. This reflected a large number of abstentions.|$|E

No major Celtic settlement has been found at the site, but the city's Latin name <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have derived from an originally Brittonic one and artifacts have been found showing that the hills of the London were frequented if not inhabited by small villages.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{large-scale}} seal hunting in the 19th century, the southern elephant seal recovered to a sizable population in the 1950s; since then, an unexplained decline in the subpopulations of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean has occurred. The population <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be stable; {{the reasons for the}} fluctuation are unknown. Suggested explanations include a phenomenon of depression following a rapid demographic rebound that depletes vital resources, a change in climate, competition with other species whose numbers also varied, or even an adverse influence of scientific monitoring techniques.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they have}} never been seen, Higgslike fields play an {{important}} role in theories of the universe and in string theory. Under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of Einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. Such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be speeding up the expansion of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Russia {{remains the}} largest and most {{important}} partner for Belarus both in the political and economic fields. After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' customs duties were unified in March 2001 but the customs controls were soon restored. In terms of trade, almost half of Belarusian export goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian industry, Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of raw materials and components. After initial negotiation with the Russian Central Bank on monetary union, the Russian ruble was set to be introduced in Belarus in 2004, but this was postponed first until 2005, then until 2006, and <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been suspended indefinitely.|$|E

Other airfields in Veshchevo and Kasimovo (Vartemyagi) have been abandoned. In {{the northern part}} of Vsevolozhsky District, to the south of the old Finnish border, Karelian Fortified Region (KaUR) is located, which was reconstructed as late as in the 1960s, but <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be abandoned as well. There is Bobochinsky tank range (195.975km², founded in 1913) between Kamenka and Kirillovskoye and a number of military facilities in Vsevolozhsky District in the lowlands between Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg-Hiitola railroad, including Rzhevsky artillery range (founded in 1879), a huge area, , encircled by the Road of Life, the roads Rzhevka – Novoye Devyatkino and Novoye Devyatkino – Matoksa and the coast of Lake Ladoga (available to visitors since 2003). In 2006 a Voronezh early warning radar was built in Lekhtusi, Vsevolozhsky District. The port of Vysotsk is a base of the Baltic Fleet. 138th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade is located in Kamenka, and in the 56th District Training Centre in Sertolovo.|$|E

Givhan referenced Tom Ford, Anna Sui and Dolce & Gabbana as [...] "nfluential designers [...] have evoked her name {{as a source of}} inspiration and guidance." [...] She concluded that [...] "Cher's Native American showgirl sexpot persona <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> epitomize the fashion industry's rush to celebrate ethnicity, adornment and sex appeal." [...] Vogue proclaimed Cher [...] " [...] favorite fashion trendsetter" [...] and wrote that [...] " [...] set the grounds for pop stars and celebrities today", describing her as [...] "ternally relevant [...] the ruler of outré reinvention". Alexander Fury of The Independent lauded Cher as [...] "the ultimate fashion icon" [...] and traced her influence among female celebrities such as Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Kim Kardashian, stating that [...] "hey all graduated from the Cher school of never sharing the stage, with anyone, or anything...

Riker is tempted to save her, {{but in the end}} he refuses to do so out of respect for his promise; however, he quickly shows signs of regret at this decision, which he expresses to the captain. Tension between Picard and his first officer grows as Riker <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be {{embracing}} his powers, and his behavior toward the crew begins to change. At Q's suggestion, and with Picard's blessing, Riker uses his powers to give his friends what he believes they want, turning Wesley into an adult, giving La Forge (LeVar Burton) his sight, and creating a Klingon female companion for Worf. [...] All the recipients reject their gifts, however, with Data (Brent Spiner) even anticipating and declining Riker's attempt to make him human. Picard declares that Q has failed, and when Q attempts to go back on his word, he is forcibly recalled to the Continuum. Picard is pleased to see Q gone, and praises Riker for confirming his trust in his [...] "Number One".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{these recent}} developments, Larkin and his circle are {{nonetheless}} still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, notes that [...] "there <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be a very}} wide consensus {{that it was a}} bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents." [...] Peter Riley, a key player in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: [...] "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew perfectly well that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book for The Daily Telegraph, British doctor and science writer James Le Fanu was critical, and commented that Taylor did not {{acknowledge}} [...] "the explanatory gap" [...] between current understanding of the brain's structure and [...] "what it does, how we think, feel and emote". Le Fanu concluded, [...] "The paradox of Brainwashing is {{that it would have been}} a much more interesting book if Dr Taylor had pursued the contrarian view of seeking to explain why that 'explanatory gap' is not merely unbridged but, with the advance of the neurosciences, <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be unbridgeable. A brain that was simple enough to be fully known would be too simple to contain conscious observers who might know it." [...] Nigel Hawkes of The Times criticized what he saw as Taylor's conclusion that [...] "we are all a little bit brainwashed by our culture and experience" [...] and noted that this assessment places Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple group in the same classification as the tabloid press. [...] A review in Financial Times by Jerome Burne was also critical, and he commented that Taylor does not convey [...] "a clear enough message" [...] in the work.|$|E

500|$|The OF Tape Vol. 2 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Pitchforks Jordan Sargent {{stated that the}} album was mostly a success because [...] "every member steps up", with Domo who had [...] "evolved from the group's bumbling stoner into {{a guy who can}} spit dizzying, complicated verses". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone stated that the album contained a [...] "fizzy energy that elevates it above its limitations", musing that Odd Future were a lot like [...] "early Wu-Tang, a thrilling regional act, and a bunch of whip-smart black hipsters whose worldview is grounded in their corner of sun-baked [...] southern California." [...] PopMatters's Jeff Dunn felt that every member improved from their past mixtapes, stating that Ocean, Tyler, and Sweatshirt were all impressive, consistently [...] "spitting dizzying, more original lines than they ever have on mixtapes past." [...] Dunn wrote that [...] "after the mixed returns of Goblin, Tyler himself <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> realize that less is more on his part", who [...] "wisely tones down the shock-for-shock’s-sake rhymes quite a bit, making his appearances all the more rewarding when they do occur." [...] Steve Labate of Paste mused that [...] "while Odd Future’s critics try hard to frame them as such, it’s difficult to accept Tyler and the OF crew as mere shock artists, flippantly tossing off incendiary slurs for attention—the music is too tongue-in-cheek clever, too brainy and self-aware, too anything-goes eccentric." ...|$|E

In {{response}} to the season, Bianco from USA Today commented: [...] "Happily, it <b>now</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have landed on solid ground." [...] Also of the seventh season, Entertainment Weeklys Jennifer Armstrong said: [...] "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," [...] whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented: [...] "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part." [...] HitFix gave a positive review saying that, [...] "season 7 overall {{has been one of}} the show's strongest ever." [...] and added, [...] "There was a time when Grey's Anatomy was this show where I suffered through a lot of stuff that made me cringe to get to those genius melodrama moments it could do so well. Over the last couple of years, it's evolved into a show that's much more consistent in tone, where it may not move me as often as it did in the early years but also very rarely makes me question my reasons for watching." [...] Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly called it a [...] "so-so season", and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "emotional". Also acknowledging the fan base Verne Gay of Newsday wrote [...] "Grey's has had a good season and has an intensely loyal fan base to prove it." [...] regarding the 8th season.|$|E
