40|$|The {{concentration}} and size distribution of microbubble suspensions are important parameters for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The {{aim of this}} preliminary {{study was to investigate}} the relationship between changes in the microbubble population and the administration process variables, specifically syringe inner diameter, <b>needle</b> <b>inner</b> diameter, volume flow rate and the liquid in which the microbubbles are suspended. It was found that reducing either the syringe or <b>needle</b> <b>inner</b> diameter produced large reductions in microbubble concentration during administration, as much as 99. 9 % for <b>needle</b> <b>inner</b> diameters < 0. 24 mm. Increasing the volume flow rate up to 3 mL/min and changing the suspending fluid from distilled water to glycerol, however, were both found to reduce the degree of microbubble destruction. Further work is needed to fully explain these observations. However, investigation of the response of microbubbles to changes in hydrostatic pressure only, indicated that this was unlikely to be the main mechanism of destruction and hence that shear stress was a more important factor. Comparison with findings from another recent study of microbubble stability indicated that microbubble size, {{concentration and}} composition were also important parameters and should be taken into account in designing administration procedures for microbubble agents. It was concluded that current procedures should be reviewed, particularly for therapeutic applications, and that the results should also be taken into account when assessing the accuracy of microbubble size distribution measurements obtained using automatic particle sizing equipment in which microbubbles are made to flow under pressure...|$|E

The sucrose quantity remained fairly constant over time and position, whereas the other sugars exhibited a larger change with time and position. A small osmotic gradient existed from branch to stem base under pre-dawn conditions, and the osmotic gradient between upper stem and stem base was close to zero. The turgor in branches was significantly driven by xylem water potential, and the turgor loss point in branches was relatively close to daily minimum needle water potentials typically reported for Scots pine.

40|$|Electrospinning is an {{effective}} technology for the fabrication of ultrafine fibers, which can be the basic component of a tissue engineering scaffold. In tissue engineering, because cells seeded on fibrous scaffolds with varying fiber diameters and morphologies exhibit different responses, {{it is critical to}} control these characteristics of electrospun fibers. The diameter and morphology of electrospun fibers can be influenced by many processing parameters (e. g., electrospinning voltage, <b>needle</b> <b>inner</b> diameter, solution feeding rate, rotational speed of the fiber-collecting cylinder, and working distance) and solution properties (polymer solution concentration and conductivity). In this study, a factorial design approach was used to systematically investigate the degree of influence of each of these parameters on fiber diameter, degree of fiber alignment, and their possible synergetic effects, using a natural biodegradable polymer, poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate), for the electrospinning experiments. It was found that the solution concentration invoked the highest main effect on fiber diameter, whereas both rotational speed of the fiber-collecting cylinder and addition of a conductivity-enhancing salt could significantly affect the degree of fiber alignment. By carefully controlling the electrospinning parameters and solution properties, fibrous scaffolds of desired characteristics could be made to meet the requirements of different tissue engineering applications. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Electrospinning of fibrous tissue {{engineering}} scaffolds has been traditionally conducted using positive voltages. In the current study, positive voltage (PV) electrospinning and negative voltage (NV) electrospinning were investigated for forming fibrous membranes of poly(hydroxybutyrate-co- hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). In both PV-electrospinning and NV-electrospinning, the fiber diameter generally increased with increasing <b>needle</b> <b>inner</b> diameter and PHBV concentration but decreased with increasing working distance. The {{use of a}} conductivity-enhancing surfactant, benzyl triethylammonium chloride (BTEAC), significantly reduced PHBV fiber diameters from the micron scale to the sub-micron scale. Interestingly, with increasing applied voltage, the fiber diameter increased for PV-electrospinning but decreased for NV-electrospinning. The PV-electrospun fibrous membranes from solutions without BTEAC (PVEfm) and with BTEAC (PVEfm-B) and NV-electrospun membranes from solutions without BTEAC (NVEfm) and with BTEAC (NVEfm-B) were characterized {{in terms of their}} structure, wettability, thermal properties and tensile properties.

For comparisons, PVES of these polymers was also conducted. It was found that chitosan fibers could not be produced using NVES. Under NVES or PVES, the fiber diameter of electrospun scaffolds generally increased with increasing <b>needle</b> <b>inner</b> diameter and polymer solution concentration but decreased with increasing working distance for all four polymers. Neither NVES nor PVES altered the chemical structure of gelatin, PLGA, and PBT. PVES and NVES resulted in fibrous membranes bearing positive charges and negative charges, respectively.

40|$|Highly {{concentrated}} protein therapeutics offer {{a convenient}} way for subcutaneous (sc) drug administration {{by the patient}} him-/herself or a healthcare professional. As the therapy e. g. with monoclonal antibodies requires quite high doses {{in the range of}} mg per kg body weight, the development of highly concentrated protein formulations is needed due to the limited injection volume, generally considered being 1 - 2 mL for sc administration. The development of highly concentrated formulations exceeding 50 - 100 mg/mL poses several challenges including chemical and physical stability (e. g. aggregation) as well as solution viscosity. Thereby, the increase in viscosity observed with higher protein concentration may cause severe limitations during product development as well as processing and drug administration. These limitations are defined by the flow rate/injection rate depending on the applied pressure which is needed during manufacture (fill-finish), in particular during filtration, and drug administration. The focus of this work was to investigate the rheological behavior of protein solutions at high protein concentrations. The main objective was to obtain a profound understanding of two critical, hydrodynamic processes for highly concentrated protein solutions, which were drug administration and filtration, and to elucidate the role of viscosity with regard to potential limitations. The current work provides a detailed overview on product characteristics of ten commercially available, highly concentrated protein therapeutics (Chapter 1). This technical overview summarizes formulation properties like viscosity and number of visible and sub-visible particles, physico-chemical properties like pH and osmolality as well as injection device characteristics, such as device dimensions. The analysis of marketed products revealed significant differences between the products. The current benchmark for maximum protein concentration and of viscosity was identified as a liquid formulation at a protein concentration of 200 mg/mL with a dynamic viscosity of 102 mPas (20 ? C). This product, which is provided in a pre-filled syringe, also exhibits the largest inner needle diameter of 25 G compared to other commercial products using 27 G needle for the injection device. In the following (Chapter 2), advantages and limitations of different methods for viscosity determination of protein formulations are discussed. Moreover, a high-throughput method to measure viscosity was established. This method uses a capillary electrophoresis instrumentation without operation of the electrical field. The established method has the advantage of being automated offering the possibility for high-throughput by use of low sample amounts in the microliter range at the same time. (Allmendinger et al., J Pharm Biomed Anal, 99 (2014) 51 - 58) Based on these studies, the present work investigated and characterized the subcutaneous drug administration process of highly concentrated protein formulations providing quantitative in vitro (Chapter 3) and in vivo data (G¨ottingen minipigs) of injection forces (Chapter 4). Chapter 3 describes in detail the establishment of an in silico model to predict injection forces depending on syringe and needle dimensions, solution viscosity, and injection rate. Importantly, this model accounts for shear thinning behavior (non-Newtonian flow behavior) of highly concentrated protein olutions, which leads to lower effective injection forces than expected from current literature models. (Allmendinger et al., Eu J Pharm Biopharm, 87 (2014) 318 - 328) To address the in vivo situation, Chapter 4 investigates and quantifies the contribution of the subcutaneous tissue backpressure and specifically reports the additional influence of body temperature on injection forces, which was found to compensate the tissue backpressure to some parts. Overall, an extended model, which addresses the injection force as a function of viscosity, volumetric flow/injection rate, needle/device dimensions, shear-thinning behavior, sc backpressure, and body temperature, was developed to predict injection forces representative for the in vivo situation. This knowledge is of key importance for the development of combination products (e. g. autoinjectors or pre-filled syringes) as a detailed understanding of injection forces depending on various parameters is required. It may be also supportive for the definition of limits during the evaluation, planning, and design phase during the development of injection devices. (Allmendinger et al., submitted to Pharm Research, 2014) Besides drug administration, filtration was investigated as another critical hydrodynamic process for highly concentrated protein formulations, depending on formulation composition and filter material (Chapter 5). For both processes, filtration and drug administration, shear thinning behavior was found for some of the products depending on viscosity and protein concentration, shear rate, and formulation composition. Within the present work it was shown, that the two investigated hydrodynamic processes, filtration and drug administration by injection, are two highly complex processes which are influenced by various factors. Thereby, the final limiting parameter for the injection process is given by the user capability of the patient population. However, the <b>needle</b> <b>inner</b> diameter was shown to have major influence on injection forces. It is related to injection forces by the power of four compared to other parameters like viscosity, injection rate, and contribution of sc backpressure being directly proportional. For the filtration process, the final limiting parameter may be discussed controversially. The study showed that the filtration pressure is mainly defined by the pore size distribution of the filter material, which was furthermore found to trigger the rheological behavior at high protein concentrations dependent on filtration rate. Moreover, literature data reported that the influence of filtration pressure on product quality might not be the limiting parameter during filtration. For the formulations previously tested, the shear stress exposure during manufacture was not considered important for final product quality, however only tested up to a protein concentration of 100 mg/mL. More important causes of aggregation were suggested to be the presence of air-bubbles, adsorption to solid surfaces, or contamination by particulates. Nevertheless, the stability of formulations showing pronounced shear-thinning behavior at high shear rates, which is most likely only the case for higher protein concentrations than previously tested, needs further experiments and has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis dependent on product and process characteristics. (Allmendinger et al., submitted to J Pharm Sci, 2014) With respect to viscosity, the current work has demonstrated for both processes, drug administration and filtration, that the potential limitation defined by the proportional increase in pressure based on Newtonian flow behavior was overestimated due to the presence of shear-thinning behavior which was shown for highly concentrated protein formulations...|$|E

40|$|General {{calibration}} of the Vitaprint extruder Introduction Being tansferrable, the Vitaprint extruder {{is capable}} of printing structures, sliced by various free and open software, such as Slic 3 r or Cura. To allow this, however, certain settings need to be adjusted. Table of Contents Basic extrusion calculation Extrusion adjustment by drawing Introduction Materials Procedure Basic extrusion calculation The first approximation of extrusion settings can be calculated theoretically, based on some simple assumptions. Due to its mechanical, piston driven nature, extrusion can be precisely controlled by motorized displacement of the piston (rotation vs thread, both of which is specified) and depends on {{the difference between the}} inner diameters of the syringe r s and the nozzle r n. If we assume non-elastic behavior and laminar flow, the displaced volume in the syringe should equal the extruded volume through the nozzle. If the printed stroke takes the cross-sectional shape of the nozzle, the length of the printed path can be calculated as follows: Where E equals the extrusion value (= displacement of the piston) and l path the length of the printed filament. This is useful for determining the amount of extrusion for custom designed geometries. When using slicing software Cura, the calculation differs somewhat, as certain parameters are calculated differently. We have determined an experimental nozzle width and correction factor for the use of a 5 ml syringe with a G 21 <b>needle</b> (<b>inner</b> diameter 0. 4 mm). The calculation {{can be found in the}} accompanied xls file titled "vitaprint_cura_filament_calc". Extrusion adjustment by drawing Introduction Certain simplifications in the calculation cause small, yet significant discrepancies between the theoretical and real system. Therefore additional tuning is required. To do this, we developed a simple "pen and paper" protocol, to evaluate the characteristics of the printed path. It can be used to adjust extrusion, feedrate, layer height and material polymerization time upon deposition.

RUN " 04 _cal_h. gcode" Backlash calibration PART 1 - Latency Determination Introduction When extruding materials with medium to high viscosity it can be observed that when the plunger movement is terminated the material still keeps flowing out of the syringe for some time. This happens due to mechanically elastic components in the system (air bubbles inside the material, syringe seal, plunger deformation under higher forces etc.). The removal of this phenomenon is not very feasible therefore we can compensate it with backlash. Thereby, the plunger not only stops when it's told to but instead it moves slightly backwards such that it pulls some of the material back into the syringe. The idea is to pull enough material back in that the outflow is stopped as soon as possible and yet, care must be taken not to pull the plunger so far back that the air comes into the syringe through the needle.

If not, several appropriate are available online like Termite, PuTTy etc. (download Termite here) CNC machine and control Python 3 environment (Spyder or similar) to run the g-code generator (download here) A glass beaker sunflower oil Data Acquisition 1. Connect the serial output of the weighing scale to the computer USB port and get the communication working run the serial read software check the data sheet of the weighing scale for baud rate, data bits, parity etc.) make sure all the settings in the software match the values in the data sheet. If they do, the values on the computer terminal monitor should match the one you can read on the weighing scale screen if the software enables it, select the option for the data be written into a. txt file 2. Generate the testing protocol g-code Download the VITAPRINT_latency_test_protocol. py file from GitHub and open it in the preferred Python environment read the instructions in the heading of the file to familiarise yourself with the parameters you can manipulate Run the programme. Now, a file named '[TODAYSDATE-your_specified_filename]. gcode' should be generated in your working directory. Open this file in your CNC control software and see if it is working 3. Prepare the apparatus Fill the glass beaker with sunflower oil place it onto the weighing scale and press "Tare" Mount your extruder over the vessel mount the syringe, filled with material with needle attached onto the extruder (G 21 needle used in our case) extrude some material so that it starts flowing out and wait for the outflow to stop 4. Start recording the mass 5. Run the g-code in your CNC controller Figure 2 : The apparatus for latency measurement Data Processing How does it work? It is important to understand the workflow of the data processing. The raw data may contain some high frequency noise usually originating from the building vibration (people walking, door closing etc.). The raw data are therefore first low-pass filtered. Then they are blocked up in cycles (each cycles contains a dataset of mass values associated to one displacement step). Then, an exponential fit of a form f = aexp(-bx) + cexp(-dx) is fitted to each dataset. At the end, a 95 % point is found in every dataset and taken as the system latency. you can see the output signal after every stage in the Appendix below, for easier visualisation. Procedure Download the file for data processing (VITAPRINT_latency_data_processing. py) Copy the. txt file with your acquired data into the same folder as the data processing file. Open the VITAPRINT_latency_data_processing. py file in your Python environment and read the head of the file. Follow the instructions in the code header Run the code the Latency values should appear in your python command prompt as the programme output Important Notes and Tips In our setup this method proved to be repeatable and robust. However, depending on the hardware it may not be so. It is advisable to repeat this procedure several times to investigate whether you can rely on it.

5000|$|Vacutainer needle are double ended, {{with one}} side being {{encased in a}} thin rubber coating for safety. When the needle is screwed into the {{translucent}} plastic needle holder, the rubber needle is inside the holder, and the exposed needle will be inserted into the vein. When a Vacutainer tube is inserted into the holder, its rubber cap is punctured by the <b>inner</b> <b>needle</b> and the vacuum in the tube pulls blood through the needle and into the tube. The filled tube is then removed and another can be inserted and filled the same way. The amount of air evacuated from the tube predetermines how much blood will fill the tube before blood stops flowing.|$|R
30|$|ZnO nanofibers were {{prepared}} by calcination of the electrospun fibers of PVA/zinc acetate composite. The experiments {{were carried out}} as the following procedures: First, 0.25 g PVA (Sigma–Aldrich, Mw ≈ 80, 000), 0.5 g zinc acetate (Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 ··· 2 H 2 O), and 0.059 g glacial acetic acid (CH 3 COOH) were dissolved into 2 ml deionized water followed by vigorous magnetic stirring in a water bath at 60 °C for 3 h. Thus, a viscous gel of PVA/zinc acetate composite solution was obtained. Then, the solution was held in a glass syringe equipped with a stainless <b>needle,</b> whose <b>inner</b> diameter is about 0.5 mm. This needle simultaneously served as an electrode and {{was connected to the}} anode of a DC high-voltage source. During the electrospinning process, the distance and the applied voltage between the needle and the collectors were 17 cm and 25 kV, respectively. The electrospun fibers were collected on the n-type (111) silicon substrates. Finally, the as-prepared samples were annealed at 600 °C for 2 h in O 2 ambient to remove the PVA and make the zinc acetate decomposing to ZnO compositions.|$|R
40|$|Viscous high-fat {{foods such}} as cream, egg yolk, or {{mayonnaise}} are co-extruded with a 3 % sodium alginate solution from a syringe into a 50 mM calcium chloride solution. The food sample passes through the inner tube of a double needle assembly while the alginate solution is simultaneously extruded through a mantle surrounding the <b>inner</b> <b>needle.</b> As the sodium alginate solution forms a gel on contact with calcium ions, the food sample becomes encapsulated in the calcium alginate gel formed {{on the surface of}} the food sample. The encapsulation procedure may be carried out within a temperature range between 0 C and 25 C. Samples may be prepared for scanning electron microscopy or for transmission electron microscopy by selecting either wide or narrow bore needles, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A needle-tissue {{interaction}} experiment {{has been}} carried out, by inserting the <b>inner</b> <b>needle</b> of a trocar needle into two ex-vivo human livers. The dataset contains the forces that act on the needle during insertion and retraction into the livers. In addition, a MATLAB code file is included that provides base-level {{analysis of the data}} and generates force-position diagrams of the needle insertions. The dataset is available on Mendeley Data (do 1 i: 10. 17632 / 94 s 7 xd 9 mzt. 2), and is made publicly available to enable other researchers to use it for their own research purposes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 In Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFIC) or high {{frequency}} digital ICs, {{there is a}} demand to probe the internal nodes for testing. The ultra low capacitance RFIC probe presented in his work is a flexible tool for these applications. The probe utilizes the coupling between a tungsten <b>needle</b> and the <b>inner</b> conductor of a coaxial cable, forming a capacitor. The ultra low capacitance of the probe enables low probe loading on the circuit under test. With capacitive coupling, the probe output is the derivative of the input signal. Through the use of probe calibration and Fourier transforms, the probed signal can be recovered. Probe calibration develops a transfer function enabling recovery of time domain signals. By utilizing a simple mechanical design, input impedance is maximized and parasitic components are minimized...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the environment experienced by spacer grids in a boiling water reactor (BWR), specimens of the Ni-based Alloy X- 750 were exposed to a water jet in an autoclave at a temperature of 286 degrees C and a pressure of 80 bar. The oxide microstructure of specimens exposed for 2 h, 24 h, 168 h and 840 h has been investigated mainly using electron microscopy. The specimens suffer mass loss due to dissolution during exposure. At {{the same time a}} complex layered oxide develops. After the longest exposure the oxide consists of two outer spinel layers consisting of blocky crystals, one intermediate layer of nickel oxide interspersed with Ti-rich oxide <b>needles,</b> and an <b>inner</b> layer of oxidized base metal. The evolution of the oxide leading up to this structure is discussed and a model is presented...|$|R
40|$|Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoethylene) electrospun {{membranes}} {{were obtained}} from a blend of dimethylformamide (DMF) and methylethylketone (MEK) solvents. The inclusion of the MEK to the solvent system promotes a faster solvent evaporation allowing complete polymer crystallization during the jet travelling between the tip and the grounded collector. Several processing parameters were systematically changed to study their influence on fiber dimensions. Applied voltage and <b>inner</b> <b>needle</b> diameter do not have large influence on the electrospun fiber average diameter but in the fiber diameter distribution. On the other hand, the increase of {{the distance between the}} needle tip to collector results in fibers with larger average diameter. Independently on the processing conditions, all mats are produced in the electroactive phase of the polymer. Further, MC- 3 T 3 -E 1 cell adhesion was not inhibited by the fiber mats preparation, indicating their potential use for biomedical applications...|$|R
50|$|The needle complex {{starts at}} the {{cytoplasm}} of the bacterium, crosses the two membranes and protrudes from the cell. The part anchored in the membrane is the base (or basal body) of the T3SS. The extracellular part is the <b>needle.</b> A so-called <b>inner</b> rod connects the needle to the base. The needle itself, although {{the biggest and most}} prominent part of the T3SS, is made out of many units of a single protein. The majority of the different T3SS proteins are therefore those that build the base and those that are secreted into the host. As mentioned above, the needle complex shares similarities with bacterial flagella. More specifically, the base of the needle complex is structurally very similar to the flagellar base; the needle itself is analogous to the flagellar hook, a structure connecting the base to the flagellar filament.|$|R
30|$|First, fresh Fmoc-FF stock {{solution}} (3  mg/mL) was {{prepared by the}} above method. Next, 3  mg of alginate powder was slowly added to 1  mL of the fresh Fmoc-FF {{stock solution}} and stirred (1000  rpm) {{at room temperature for}} 30  min, resulting in a uniform and translucent mixed solution. The mixture was then centrifuged at 2000  rpm for 2  min to remove bubbles. Finally, the Fmoc-FF–alginate solution was added drop by drop to an abundant volume of an aqueous solution of CaCl 2 (2.0  wt.%), using a syringe <b>needle</b> with an <b>inner</b> diameter of 0.7  mm. Hydrogel beads could be formed in a few seconds when the Fmoc-FF–alginate liquid droplets were brought into contact with the CaCl 2 solution. In addition, we used an aqueous solution of CaCl 2 -HCl (pH[*]=[*] 6) as a control to study the effect of HCl on the structure of the hydrogel beads.|$|R

40|$|Needle polynomials 0 ≤pn≤ 1 {{of degree}} n on the {{interval}} [− 1, 1] attain the value p n (x 0) = 1 at some x 0 ∈[- 1, 1] and are “exponentially small”, p n (x) ≤e-nϕ(h), whenever x∈[- 1, 1]-h+x 0,h+x 0], 0 0. In this paper {{we intend to}} give a comprehensive study of multivariate needle polynomials. Even in the univariate case there is an essential difference between the sharpness of the corresponding <b>needles</b> at the <b>inner</b> and boundary points. This phenomenon becomes more intricate in the multivariate case. We will show that the sharpness of multivariate needle polynomials at the boundary points of convex bodies {{is closely related to}} the geometry of the boundary at the corresponding points. This will be accomplished for both ordinary and homogeneous multivariate polynomials. Finally, we shall discuss how properties of needle polynomials can be applied in the study of norming sets (optimal meshes) and cubature formulas. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary...|$|R
