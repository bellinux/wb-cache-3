5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E

The 1412 edition, known as Huolongjing Quanji (Complete Collection of the Fire Dragon Manual), remains largely unchanged from its predecessor {{with the exception of}} its preface, which provides an account of Jiao Yu's time in the Hongwu Emperor's army. In the preface Jiao Yu claims to describe gunpowder weapons that had seen use since 1355 during his involvement in the Red Turban Rebellion and revolt against the Yuan dynasty, while the oldest material found in his text dates to 1280.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} and economic power increasingly concentrated in Lima, the capital city, several administrations tried to decentralize the country with little success. The 1979 Peruvian Constitution contained provisions for the decentralization of power {{through the creation of}} autonomous regions, but they were not implemented. During the later years of the 19851990 presidency of Alan García, the government faced the prospect of losing the 1990 presidential elections because of a widespread economic crisis and faltering public support. As a way of creating an alternative source of power, the regime established twelve autonomous regions on January 20, 1989 in the hope of winning some elections at this level. However, due to the haste of their creation, these regional governments were <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> with fiscal resources of their own so they depended on the goodwill of the central government for funding.|$|E
5|$|Buckland had <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> a {{specific}} name, as {{was not uncommon}} {{in the early nineteenth}} century, when the genus was still seen as the more essential concept. In 1826, Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete binomial, Megalosaurus conybeari, which however was not much used by later authors and is now considered a nomen oblitum. A year later, in 1827, Gideon Mantell included Megalosaurus in his geological survey of southeastern England, and assigned the species its current valid binomial name, Megalosaurus bucklandii. Until recently, the form Megalosaurus bucklandi was often used, a variant first published in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer – and sometimes erroneously ascribed to von Ritgen – but the more original M. bucklandii has priority.|$|E

The Loews Hotels chain agreed to co-finance construction of the property with L'Enfant Plaza Corp., although details of the agreement were <b>not</b> <b>provided.</b> The hotel would occupy the top four floors and lobby of the 12-story building, with separate elevators for office tenants and hotel guests. The 378-room hotel, designed by Koubek, had a rooftop swimming pool, two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, and meeting rooms. The general contractor for the building was George Hyman Construction Co. (now Clark Construction Group).|$|E
5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of arrest and detention into section 10 when Parliament had <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{went with}} the 1st Aero to Galveston during the Vera Cruz {{incident}} in 1914, then to Fort Sill. Following a promotion to captain, Dodd and his observer, Lieutenant S. W. Fitzgerald, won the third annual contest for the Mackay aviation trophy when he descended at North Island after a trip of three hours and three minutes. The contest for the Mackay Trophy involved serial reconnaissance of troops maneuvering {{in the vicinity of}} San Diego and reports of their numbers and disposition. Accidents eliminated all machines but theirs and the trophy would not have been awarded that year if Fitzgerald had <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> a comprehensive and accurate report of the composition and location of the troops.|$|E

Guthy-Renker partnered with National Media Corp. to help market some of its fitness products, {{which led to a}} legal dispute that was settled with undisclosed terms in 1997. Guthy-Renker claimed National Media Corp. excessively aired infomercials for an exercise machine, the Fitness Flyer, and started selling an unauthorized imitation of the original.

5|$|If a reborn {{is created}} from a kit {{as opposed to}} whole {{manufactured}} doll, it may be called newborning. Manufacturers have reacted to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning. JC Toys began selling kits in December 2007 Other suppliers offer product lines that give reborners a choice of body parts and skin tones to make a customized doll.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} stages of its development, the wing-bud is <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> with special organs of {{respiration}} such as tracheation, as it resembles {{in this respect}} the other portions of the hypodermis {{of which it is}} still a part. It should be noted, however, that the histoblast is developed near a large trachea, a cross-section of which is shown in, which represents sections of these parts of the first, second, third and fourth instars respectively. At the same time the tracheoles uncoil, and extend in bundles in the forming vein-cavities of the wing-bud. At the molt that marks the beginning of the pupal stadium stage, they become functional. At the same time, the larval tracheoles degenerate; their function having been replaced by the wing tracheae.|$|E

The suggestion was {{to begin with a}} waltz until the friend pats the artist on the shoulder, when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The suggestion for I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist packing up until the artist pulls out the gun. A soft hurry follows as the girl confronts her father, leading to a crescendo at the climax.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez played {{independent}} {{league baseball}} {{for the next}} two seasons. After receiving an invitation to try out for the Pensacola Pelicans of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball, the Pelicans signed Ramirez for the 2005 season. In 43 games with Pensacola, Ramírez pitched to a 1.45 earned run average (ERA), struck out 93 batters and walked only 15. He finished the season with a record of 2–2 with 11 saves over 62 innings pitched. In September 2005, the Angels purchased Ramírez from the Pelicans. He pitched in one game for their Class AAA affiliate, the Salt Lake Stingers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). The Angels released Ramírez in spring training in 2006. Ramírez was <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> with a reason for his release.|$|E
5|$|The Nizam was {{prepared}} {{to enter into a}} limited treaty with India, which gave Hyderabad safeguards <b>not</b> <b>provided</b> for in the standard Instrument of Accession, such as a provision guaranteeing Hyderabad's neutrality {{in the event of a}} conflict between India and Pakistan. India rejected this proposal, arguing that other states would demand similar concessions. A temporary Standstill Agreement was signed as a stopgap measure, even though Hyderabad had not yet agreed to accede to India. By December 1947, however, India was accusing Hyderabad of repeatedly violating the Agreement, while the Nizam alleged that India was blockading his state, a charge India denied.|$|E
