50|$|In the OSI model, {{communicating}} {{systems are}} assumed to be connected by an underlying physical medium providing a basic (and unspecified) transmission mechanism. The layers above it are numbered (from one to seven); the nth layer is referred to as (n)-layer. Each layer provides service to the layer above it (or at the top to the application process) using the services of the layer immediately below it. The layers communicate with each other by means of an interface, called a service access point. Corresponding layers at each system are called peer entities. To communicate, two peer entities at a given layer use an (n)-protocol, which is implemented by using services of the (n-1)-layer. When systems are not directly connected, intermediate peer entities (called relays) are used. An address uniquely identifies a service access point. The address naming domains need not be restricted to one layer, so it is possible to use just one <b>naming</b> <b>domain</b> for all layers.For each layer {{there are two types of}} standards: protocol standards defining how peer entities at a given layer communicate, and service standards defining how a given layer communicates with the layer above it.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} geolocating Internet routers, using a {{methodology}} for extracting and decoding geography-related strings from fully qualified domain names (hostnames). We first compiled an extensive dictionary associating geographic strings (e. g., airport codes) with geophysical locations. We then searched a large set of router hostnames for these strings, assuming each autonomous <b>naming</b> <b>domain</b> uses geographic hints consistently within that domain. We used topology and performance data continually collected by our global measurement infrastructure to discern whether a given hint appears to co-locate different hostnames {{in which it is}} found. Finally, we generalized geolocation hints into domainspecific rule sets. We generated a total of 1, 711 rules covering 1, 398 different domains and validated them using domain-specific ground truth we gathered for six domains. Unlike previous efforts which relied on labor-intensive domain-specific manual analysis, we automate our process for inferring the domain specific heuristics, substantially advancing the state-of-the-art of methods for geolocating Internet resources...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} an {{experiment}} on {{the naming of}} household containers in Dutch and Icelandic carried out {{as part of the}} Evolution of Semantic Systems project (EoSS; Majid et al., 2011). This naming experiment allows us to support and elaborate on a hypothesis by Malt et al. (2003) that productive morphology in the <b>naming</b> <b>domain</b> can have an influence on boundary placement within the extensional space. Specifically, we demonstrate that the Dutch diminutive -(t) je favours a cut between small items versus others, whereas Icelandic, which does not use the diminutive in this domain, favours a cut between large items and others. This is not a typological effect, as Dutch and Icelandic are both Germanic languages and both have diminutive morphology available in principle. We find no evidence that the diminutive produces a proliferation of terms and/or fine-grained nesting within the extensional domain. Rather, the Dutch diminutive favours a more even distribution of terms across the space whereas Icelandic favours broad inclusive terms with a number of narrower specialist terms. Further, the extensional space defined by the diminutive is not associated with its own clear prototypical exemplar. Using evidence from compounding and modification, we also consider which semantic features are prominent in differentiating categories within the domain. By far the most prominent in both languages is the inferred contents of the container. Other than contents, however, the languages differ in the range and prominence of features such as intended usage or material of composition. Our results demonstrate that {{in order to understand the}} processes that produce semantic divisions of basic object classes, we should consider fine-grained analyses of closely related languages alongside analyses of typologically different languages...|$|E

40|$|A <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> is {{a unique}} {{alphanumeric}} designation that facilitates reference to sets of numbers which actually locate a particular computer on the Internet. <b>Domain</b> <b>names</b> are a fundamental part of the Internet&# 039;s user interface. Improving the usability of the Internet depends upon effective <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy. This study is intended to contribute to improvement in Internet usability for the end users of <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> Benefits of more usable <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> include: higher sales, customer satisfaction and productivity, and reduced support costs. <b>Domain</b> <b>name</b> policies worldwide vary considerably. Consequently, end users are inconvenienced by contradictory <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policies, diminishing the predictability of an entity&# 039;s <b>domain</b> <b>name,</b> and thus decreasing usability for end users. The study objective was to develop criteria with which policy makers can evaluate their <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policies, {{in order to improve}} the usability of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> for end users. The main research question posed was: What are the criteria for an effective <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy? The research methodology included a literature review, <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy examination and an ethnographic narrative. The literature review found existing research examining either <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> or usability in isolation. However, research examining the intersection of the two is scarce. The existing research describes <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> as part of the web user interface. In practical terms, this is about how people use <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> to access web sites, email addresses and other Internet resources. It was established that the predictability (and thus usability) of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> relies on effective <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy. The non-standardised and widely delegated process of <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy development leads to unpredictable and inconsistent <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> The narrative recollection presented the researcher&# 039;s inside perspective on the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> industry, with a focus on <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> usability. The researcher provided first-hand insights into the evolution of the industry and policy development process, from Australian and international perspectives. To address the problem of poor <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> usability, a framework for <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy evaluation is proposed. The framework extends the current research that treats <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> as a user interface by proposing criteria which address usability concerns. The framework allows policy makers to critically assess <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policies with end users in mind. Examples of the criteria include: understanding who are its intended and untended users, and whether it&# 039;s consistent with other <b>domain</b> <b>names.</b> The framework has the potential to set an international standard for the critical evaluation of <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policy, and become the basis for further research. This study was developed from the researcher&# 039;s perspective as a participant in the <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> industry. A secondary lens regarding the usability of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> was then applied. This study has only scraped the surface in terms of how the research fields of <b>domain</b> <b>names</b> and usability may be considered together. The research methodology for this study was primarily qualitative and interpretive. A quantitative study of <b>domain</b> <b>name</b> policies globally could provide further insight into areas including: the differences in second level country code <b>domain</b> <b>names,</b> and language implications of <b>domain</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R
