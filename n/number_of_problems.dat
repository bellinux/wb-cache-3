After the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded significantly with arms captured from the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija).

40|$|Background: The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> {{drug users}} {{is used as}} a key {{indicator}} to monitor the drug situation in the European Union. An alternative approach to estimate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> drug users is given by ‘the one-source capture–recapture analysis’ that uses a single registration. Methods: Two variants of the one-source capture–recapture analysis were applied to a single registration: the truncated Poisson regression model (TPR) and the Zelterman regression model. These models were applied to data about clinical drug-related hospital admissions derived from the Dutch Hospital Registration (LMR). The TPR accounts for heterogeneity in capture probabilities by allowing for covariates and the Zelterman regression model relies on the problem drug users that were seen only once or twice in the hospital; the latter model is known to be robust against unobserved heterogeneity. Results: The TPR model was found to have a bad fit due to unobserved heterogeneity. The Zelterman regression model estimated the population size at 10, 415 problem drug users (95 % CI is 8400 – 12, 429). This figure is an estimate <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> drug users who are at risk of a clinical hospital admission due to the medical consequences of their drug use. The model can also provide estimates of different subgroups of problematic drug users. Conclusion: The method presented here offers a promising alternative for estimating the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> drug users, including different subgroups of drug users. In addition, observed and unobserved heterogeneity can be accounted for in these estimates...|$|R

40|$|The {{similarities}} between drinking behavior and contagion {{are used to}} explore — under two types of social structure in the population: homogenous and heterogeneous mixing — the role of nonlinear social interactions on the dynamics of alcohol consumption; quantifying how some model parameters influence the latter dynamics. A deterministic model, assuming homogeneous mixing, is used to derive relative sensitivity functions which explain how the recovery and relapse rates affect the establishment <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> drinkers. A continuos-time Markov chain model {{is derived from the}} deterministic model; stochastic simulations are used to quantify how histograms <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> drinkers depend on the recovery and relapse rates, as these rates are gradually incremented. The impact of lowering the relapse rate, as a result of successful treatment, at various intervention times, is assessed by stochastic simulations of drinking dynamics among communities with small-world structure; reductions in the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> drinkers are obtained —with some community structures showing more vulnerability to higher levels of prevalence than others. We conclude from sensitivity analyses (of deterministic and stochastic models) that, either: increasing the recovery rate; or lowering the relapse rate, are measures with positive effects —they tend to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problem</b> drinkers...|$|R

People would try to imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E

EMI had already been awarded a contract for a dozen prototype units in October 1940 for delivery in February, but these continued changes made this impossible. Nevertheless, they presented a production contract for 1,500 units in December. Between December and March, production examples began arriving and displayed an enormous <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems,</b> which the engineers worked through one-by one. By July the systems were ready for use, and began being installed in the new Defiant Mk.

It was not until the beginning of December 1941 that these issues were fully solved and the units were cleared for squadron use.|$|E
