Both the core proteins of the exosome complex, {{as well as the}} two main associated proteins, are essential proteins.

5|$|Commander Keen is {{the final}} game in the series, {{released}} on May 30, 2001 for the Game Boy Color. Developed by David A. Palmer Productions and published by Activision, it was created as both a sequel and homage to the series as a whole, and does <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> episode number. Id was not a major partner in development, though it retained editorial control over the game, and Adrian Carmack contributed some artwork. The idea for a Game Boy Color Keen game came from John Carmack and id, who approached Activision, which in turn proposed Palmer as the developer.|$|E
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant {{who presented}} himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin {{felt compelled to}} capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into {{the title of the}} work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E
