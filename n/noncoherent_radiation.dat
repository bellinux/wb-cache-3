40|$|We {{present the}} {{solution}} of the problem of the 1 /, → 0, asymptotic terms discovered in the one-loop form factors of the gravitational effective action. Owing to certain constraints among their coefficients, which we establish, these terms cancel in the vacuum stress tensor and do not violate the asymptotic flatness of the expectation value of the metric. They reappear, however, in the Riemann tensor of this metric and stand for a new effect: a radiation of gravitational waves induced by the vacuum stress. This coherent radiation caused by the backreaction adds to the <b>noncoherent</b> <b>radiation</b> caused by the pair creation in the case where the initial state provides the vacuum stress tensor with a quadrupole moment.

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{investigate}} the possibilities providing the maximum-achieved parameters of the acoustothermometers and to find their possible applications. The method for constructing image of the tomographic type heat sources {{by means of the}} correlated processing of heat noises from these sources received by the multielement piezoelectric transducers has been proposed firstly. The methods for measurement of the thermal diffusivity, acoustic damping, parameter of the heat sources in the investigated objects and also the method for measurement of the losses in the piezoelectric transducers of the acoustothermometers have been proposed. The experiments shown that the correlated processing of the noise signals enables to obtain the three-dimensional distributions of the <b>noncoherent</b> <b>radiation</b> sourcesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

40|$|A {{problem of}} {{lighting}} objects and surfaces with artificial sources of <b>noncoherent</b> microwave <b>radiation</b> {{with the aim}} to observe them using radiometric equipment is considered. Transmitters based on dynamic chaos generators are used as sources of <b>noncoherent</b> wideband microwave <b>radiation.</b> An experimental sample of such a device, i. e., a radio lighting lamp based on a chaos microgenerator and its performance are presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} quantic {{detection}} for <b>noncoherent</b> optical <b>radiation</b> at noise limit is presented. Using the representation on coherent state of density matrix operators (p) and of detection operators (it),the detection probability (Qd), false alarm probability (Q°) and signal- noise ratio (S I Z), are estimated, as {{function of the}} number of freedom degrees of temporal oscillation modes (Mi) and of the spatial oscillation modes (Ms). A validation algorithm of statistical hypotheses, resulted from noncoherent optical field analysis, is made using Neyman-Pearson criterion...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} quantum Otto cycle {{based on the}} {{properties}} of a two-level system in a realistic out-of-thermal-equilibrium electromagnetic field acting as its sole reservoir. This steady configuration is produced without the need of active control over {{the state of the}} environment, which is a <b>noncoherent</b> thermal <b>radiation,</b> sustained only by external heat supplied to macroscopic objects. Remarkably, even for nonideal finite-time transformations, it largely over-performs the standard ideal Otto cycle and asymptotically achieves unit efficiency at finite power...|$|R
40|$|The development, fabrication, {{and testing}} of a {{preliminary}} model of an optical-to-optical (noncoherent-to-coherent) interface device for use in coherent optical parallel processing systems are described. The developed device demonstrates a capability for accepting as an input a scene illuminated by a <b>noncoherent</b> <b>radiation</b> source and providing as an output a coherent light beam spatially modulated to represent the original noncoherent scene. The converter device developed under this contract employs a Pockels readout optical modulator (PROM). This is a photosensitive electro-optic element which can sense and electrostatically store optical images. The stored images can be simultaneously or subsequently readout optically by utilizing the electrostatic storage pattern to control an electro-optic light modulating property of the PROM. The readout process is parallel as no scanning mechanism is required. The PROM provides the functions of optical image sensing, modulation, and storage in a single active material...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of optical radiation is required when sources of optical radiation {{are used in}} biological research. Such {{measurement of}} broad-band <b>noncoherent</b> optical <b>radiations</b> usually must be performed by a highly trained specialist using sophisticated, complex, and expensive instruments. Presentation {{of the results of}} such measurement requires correct use of quantities and units with which many biological researchers are unfamiliar. The measurement process, quantities, units, measurement systems and instruments, and uncertainties associated with optical radiation measurements are reviewed in this paper. A conventional technique for evaluating the potential hazards associated with broad-band sources of optical radiation and a spectroradiometer developed to measure spectral quantities is described. A new prototype ultraviolet radiation hazard monitor which has recently been developed is also presented. This new instrument utilizes a spectrograph and a spectral weighting mechanical mask and provides a direct reading of the effective irradiance for wavelengths less than 315 nm...|$|R
40|$|Non{{coherent}} {{and coherent}} numerical models for predicting emission from soils are compared. Coherent models use the boundary {{conditions on the}} electric fields across the layer boundaries to calculate the <b>radiation</b> intensity, and <b>noncoherent</b> models consider <b>radiation</b> intensities directly. Interference may cause different results in the two approaches when coupling between soil layers in coherent models causes greater soil moisture sampling depths. Calculations performed at frequencies of 1. 4 and 19. 4 GHz show little difference between the models at 19. 4 GHz, although differences are apparent at the lower frequency. A definition for an effective emissivity is also given for when a nonuniform temperature profile is present, and measurements made from a tower show good agreement with calculations from the coherent model...|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of {{models for the}} central radio source and the hard X-ray (30 keV) emitting region in Sco X- 1 are examined. It {{was found that the}} radio emission could result from <b>noncoherent</b> synchrotron <b>radiation</b> and that the X-rays may be produced by bremsstrahlung. It is shown that both mechanisms require a mass outflow from Sco X- 1. The radio source is located at r approximately 3 x 10 to the 12 th power cm {{from the center of the}} star, and its linear dimensions do not exceed 3 x 10 to the 13 th power cm. The magnetic field in the radio source is on the order of 1 gauss. If the hard X-rays are produced by thermal bremsstrahlung, their source is located at 10 to the 9 th power approximately r approximately 5 x 10 to the 9 th power cm, the temperature is 2 x 10 to the 9 th power K, and the emission measure is 2 x 10 to the 56 th power/cu cm. This hot plasma loses energy inward by conduction and outward by supersonic expansion. The rates of energy loss for both processes are about 10 to the 36 th power erg/s, comparable to the total luminosity of Sco X- 1...|$|R
