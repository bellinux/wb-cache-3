The test set-up consists of two loudspeakers simulating the engine noise and two smaller loudspeakers which belong to the active noise system. The system is completed by two acceleration sensors and one microphone per loudspeaker. The microphones {{are located in the}} <b>near</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> of the loudspeakers. The control algorithm including the update equation of the feed-forward controller is introduced. Numerical simulations are performed with a comparison to a state of the art method minimising the radiated sound power. The proposed approach is experimentally validated...|$|E
40|$|Non-linear sound {{propagation}} is investigated computationally by simulating compressible time-developing mixing layers using the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach and solving the viscous Burgers Equation. The mixing layers are of convective Mach numbers of 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2. The LES results agree qualitatively with known flow behavior. Mach waves are {{observed in the}} <b>near</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> of the supersonic mixing layer computed by the LES. These waves show steepening typical to non-linear propagation. Further calculations using the Burgers equation support this finding, where the initial wave slope has a role in kicking them. No visible non-linear propagation effects were found for the subsonic mixing layers. The effects of geometrical spreading and viscosity are also considered...|$|E
40|$|Sound wave {{scattering}} by {{a flexible}} plate embedded on water surface is considered. Linear acoustics and plate elasticity are assumed. The {{aim is to}} assess {{the effect of the}} plate’s flexibility on sound scattering and the potential in using that flexibility for this purpose. A combined sound-structure solution is used, which is based on a Fourier transform of the sound field and a finite-difference numerical-solution of the plate’s dynamics. The solution is implemented for a circular plate subject to a perpendicular incoming monochromatic sound wave. A very good agreement is achieved with a finite-difference solution of the sound field. It is shown that the flexibility of the plate dampens its scattered sound wave regardless of the type of the plate’s edge support. A hole in the plate is shown to further scatter the sound wave to form maxima in the <b>near</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> It is suggested that applying an external oscillatory pressure on the plate can reduce significantly and even eliminate its scattered wave, thus making the plate close to acoustically invisible. A uniformly distributed external pressure is found capable of achieving that aim as long as the plate is free edged or is not highly acoustically noncompact...|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Karl von Frisch {{correlated}} {{the runs}} and turns {{of the dance}} to the distance {{and direction of the}} food source from the hive. The orientation of the dance correlates to the relative position of the sun to the food source, and the length of the waggle portion of the run is correlated to the distance from the hive. Also, the more vigorous the display is, the better the food. There is no evidence that this form of communication depends on individual learning.

40|$|Aircraft {{structures}} {{located in}} the near noise field of a jet engine are subjected to extremely high fluctuating pressures that may cause structural fatigue. Studies of such structures have been limited by {{lack of knowledge of}} the loadings involved. ~ addition to the magnitude and frequency distribution of the acoustic pressures, it is necessary to know the cross correlation of the pressure over the surface area. A correla-tion technique has been used to determine this statistical relation in the <b>near</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> of a large turbojet engine. Measurements with micro-phones were made for a range of jet velocities at locations along the jet and at a distance from the jet. Free-field correlations of the over-all sound pressure and of the sound pressure in frequency bands from 100 to 1000 cps were obtained both longitudinally and laterally. In addition, correlations were obtained with microphones mounted at the surface of a plate that was large compared witlithe distance over which. a positive correlation existed. The region of positive correlation was generally found to increase with distance downstream of the engine to 6. 5 nozzle-exit diameters and remain nearly constant thereafter. In general, little change in the correlation curves was found as a function of jet velocity or frequency band width. The distance from unity to first zero correlation was greater for lateral than longitudinal correlations for the same conditions and locations. The correlation curves obtained in free space and on the sur-face of the plate were genera 12 y similar. The results are interpreted in terms of pressure loads on surfaces...|$|E
40|$|A {{fast and}} {{accurate}} numerical method is presented for predicting the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> generated by subsonic propellers. The free space field, including the <b>near</b> and far <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> radiated by noncompact sources, is calculated {{by means of}} a retarded time integration in time domain. The FW-H equation is applied to solving the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> generated by moving boundaries of solid body in the flow field, but its quadrupole term is neglected. Thus the noncompact sources mean the thickness source and the load source both are included in the dipole term. According to the assumption, the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> generated by a 3 -D shaped propeller is considered as the sum of the terms radiated by each strip element located spanwise. The pressure chordwise distribution at each element should be known before solving the <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> For this purpose a code solving 2 -D compressible full velocity potential equation with body-fitting coordinates is used which has been developed by BUAA previously. Comparison of calculated results with test data proves the present method and the code to be useful engineering tools. This conclusion has been also tested in the design of a propeller. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Two examples of near-field sound communication are bee’s waggle dance and Drosophila courtship songs. In fruit flies, the arista of the antennae and the third segment act as the sound receiver. Vibrations of the receiver cause rotation of the third segment, which channels sound input to the mechanoreceptors of the Johnston’s Organ.|$|R

However, this assumption is not completely verified for all types of road surfaces.

These <b>near</b> <b>field</b> <b>sounds</b> are received and interpreted using the Johnston’s organ in the pedicel of the antennae. Honeybees also perceive electric field changes via the Johnston's organs in their antennae and possibly other mechano-receptors. Electric fields generated by movements of the wings cause displacements of the antennae based on Coulomb’s law. Neurons of the Johnston’s organ respond to movements {{within the range of}} displacements caused by electric fields. When the antennae were prevented from moving at the joints containing the Johnston’s organ, bees no longer responded to biologically relevant electric fields. Honeybees respond differently to different temporal patterns. Honeybees appear to use the electric field emanating from the dancing bee for distance communication.|$|R

The {{purposes of this study}} are: (1) to describe and analyze <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> stimuli, <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> test conditions, and <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> calibration procedures currently employed by audiologists nationwide, and (2) to investigate the extent of agreement between current practice and suggested practice from the current literature. Respondents to the survey were 418 ASHA certified audiologists, who answered questions on demographic variables, <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> testing conditions, and <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> calibration procedures. Eighty-one percent of the respondents use <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> audiometry as part of their audiological practice. Demographic characteristics of the respondents indicate that they were representative of the population of ASHA certified audiologists.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{replicate}} a plane wave represents {{an essential element}} of spatial <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> reproduction. In <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> synthesis, the desired field is often formulated as a plane wave and the error minimized; for other <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> control methods, the energy density or energy ratio is maximized.

Previous investigations of BC-AC <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> sensitivity have used different estimation methods and report estimates that vary by up to 20 dB at some frequencies. In this study, the BC-AC <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> sensitivity was investigated by hearing threshold shifts, ear canal sound pressure measurements, and skull bone vibrations measured with an accelerometer.
