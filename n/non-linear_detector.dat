The new method compensates for certain measurement non-idealities, minimizing {{the likelihood of a}} false indication of an impurity. The algorithm, evolving projection analysis, is based on a previously reported method in which points in an n-dimensional absorbance space (n = number of wavelengths) are projected onto two-dimensional subspaces and modeled using the Kalman filter. Model deviations can be indicative of the presence of spectral impurities, or may result from measurement artifacts such as heteroscedastic noise or <b>non-linear</b> <b>detector</b> response. The modified algorithm incorporates model variants that mask the effects of heteroscedastic noise and non-linearities so that impurities can be detected even in the presence of these artifacts.

30|$|It {{should be}} noticed that linear MMSE {{detection}} is optimum {{only when the}} channel symbols are Gaussian, {{which is not the}} case. Indeed, even when the sources are Gaussian, the analog JSCC encoder is a non-linear transformation that produces non-Gaussian channel symbols. It is possible to formulate the optimum <b>non-linear</b> MMSE <b>detector</b> but this requires knowledge of the channel symbols probability p(s) and the calculation of an integral similar to that in (14). Notice the extraordinary complexity of the optimum <b>non-linear</b> MMSE <b>detector.</b> On the one hand, p(s) has to be discretized and estimated using Monte Carlo methods since it is not possible, in general, to find an analytical expression for p(s). When considering fading channels, knowledge of p(s) is particularly difficult since it depends on the analog JSCC encoding parameters which in turn change with the SNR. On the other hand, the non-linear MMSE detection integral has to be computed numerically which requires a refined discretization of p(s) to approach optimality. In the ensuing subsection, we investigate the utilization of a non-linear receiving structure for analog JSCC over MIMO channels that, although suboptimal, outperforms linear MMSE detection while keeping complexity at a low level.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} review the methods which are used to {{estimate}} the EMG amplitude from recordings of the EMG. (Note that this review {{does not include the}} related area of EMG-to-force processing.) Historically, Inman et al. [1952] are credited with the first continuous EMG amplitude estimator. They implemented a full-wave rectifier followed by a simple resistor-capacitor (RC) low pass filter. Early investigators studied the type of <b>non-linear</b> <b>detector</b> which should be applied to the waveform. This work led to the routine use of analog rectify and smooth (low pass filter) processing and root-mean-square (RMS) processing of the EMG waveform to form an amplitude estimate. Ensuing investigation has shown the promise of whitening individual EMG waveform channels, combining multiple waveform channels into a single EMG amplitude estimate and adaptively tuning the smoothing window length. None of these techniques have been routinely incorporated into EMG amplitude estimators. Emerging from this work is a standard cascade of six sequential processing stages which can be used to form most any EMG processor. The six stages are (1) noise rejection/filtering, (2) whitening, (3) multiple-channel combination (including gain scaling), (4) demodulation, (5) smoothing and (6) relinearization. Noise rejection/filtering generally consists of high pass filtering to suppress motion artifact in the raw EMG signal. High pass filtering also removes the offset in the EMG signal which arises from offsets in the recording electronics and A/D converter. Whitening increases the statistical bandwidth [Bendat and Piersol, 1971] of the raw EMG. By temporally uncorrelating the EMG signal, the whitening filter orthogonalizes the data samples, allowing the detection algorithm to operate on each whitened sampl [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Super Regenerative Receiver {{was invented}} by Armstrong in 1922 [1]. It is used in various {{applications}} such as sensor networks, short distance telemetry, home automation, biomedicine, remotely controlled systems, etc., because of its simplicity and low power design. In the classical super regenerative receiver, the RF oscillations obtained at {{the output of the}} oscillator is applied to a <b>non-linear</b> <b>detector</b> followed by a low pass filter. Hence the demodulation capabilities of the super regenerative receiver was restricted to amplitude modulation or on off keying (OOK) signals. The challenge is to use the super regenerative architecture to demodulate phase modulated signals which are more robust to interference compared to OOK signals and still maintaining the low power, low cost features of the receiver. The principle of super regenerative receiver is based on the theory of quenching, where a quench oscillator causes repeated build up and decay of oscillations and the oscillations are maximum at the zero crossing where the quench signal goes towards the positive half cycle. Any phase errors in the quench signal directly affects the phase detection performance. Thus {{it is also important to}} maintain synchronization between the quench signal and the carrier. In digital communications, packet arrival instants are generally random and unknown at the receiver. The payload of the packet can be successfully demodulated if the start time of the payload is known at the receiver. Thus the objective of this thesis is threefold.

30|$|The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{technology}} {{plays an}} important role in increasing the spectral efficiency of wireless communications by allowing for spatial multiplexing [1]. However, with the increase of the number of antennas, the complexity of the hardware and the signal processing at both the transmitters and the receivers are increased [2]. At the receiver side, designing reliable and efficient detectors has become a critical challenge of the MIMO systems. The maximum likelihood detectors (MLD) [3 – 5] which are the performance-optimal detectors suffer from exponential complexity in terms of the number of the transmitted signal, and they are not practical when the number of the transmitted signal becomes large. The linear detectors (LD) [6], including the zero forcing (ZF) and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) LDs, can provide polynomial complexity. However, the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the LDs is far inferior to the MLD. To improve the BER performance of the LDs, the decision feedback equalization, which utilizes the successive interference cancelation (SIC) scheme, can cancel the interference between different antennas and exhibit better BER performance than the LDs. To further improve the BER performance, the well-known vertical Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (VBLAST) detector [7 – 10], using both the SIC scheme and the ordering process, can provide excellent performance, while the error propagation is a critical problem in the VBLAST <b>detector.</b> Some other <b>non-linear</b> <b>detectors</b> were proposed to reduce the gap between the LDs and the MLD.

The resulting statistical representation generalizes most existing PCA-based models [1 [...] 3] and leads {{to the definition of}} a new family of <b>non-linear</b> probabilistic <b>detectors.</b> The performance of the approach is assessed using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis on several representative data-bases, showing a major improvement in detection performances with respect to the standard methods that have been the references up to now...|$|R
