40|$|The {{synthetic}} estrogen drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) plays {{important roles}} {{in the treatment of}} estrogen deficiency disorders for human beings. The excessive intakes of DES can lead to physiological dysfunction and raise the risk of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and other diseases. However, it is still abused for improving the fat deposition or sex reversal procedure in aquatic economic creatures for pursuit of huge interests. DES can exist in aquatic products or polluted aquacultural seawater, which seriously threatens human health. Therefore, it is desirable to establish simple and sensitive methods for the detection of DES. In this work, we have developed a new colorimetric and fluorescent probe Cy-DES for the detection of DES with high sensitivity and selectivity. As a near-infrared probe, Cy-DES is able to avoid autofluorescence of dissolved organic compounds and maximize signal-to-background contrast. Taking advantage of the strong electrostatic interaction between the probe Cy-DES and DES, the spectroscopic properties of probe Cy-DES can be obviously changed in presence of DES. Under testing conditions, there is an excellent linearity within the range of 1 - 8 mu M (r = 0. 9997) and the detection limit is 0. 2 mu M. The probe Cy-DES is successfully applied for the detection of DES in spiked seawater, shrimp and fish samples. Additionally, the detection of DES can be directly achieved by <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> utilizing of probe Cy-DES. The developed method is of great potential for application in the on-site detection of DES. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Colorimetric biosensors for the {{detection}} of analytes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> are required in environmental monitoring, point-of-care diagnostics, and analyses in resources constrained settings, where detection instruments may not be available. However instrument-based detection methods are usually more adequate for detecting small variations in the signal compared to naked-eye detection schemes, and consequently the limit of detection of the latter is usually higher than the former. Here we demonstrate that the limit of detection of colorimetric enzyme-linked immunoassays can be decreased several orders of magnitude when using naked-eye detection instead of a spectrophotometer for detecting the signal. The key step to lower the limit of detection is adding a small volume of chromogenic substrate during the signal generation step. This generates highly colored solutions that can be easily visualized <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> and recorded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> camera of a mobile phone.

50|$|Satellite {{watching}} {{is generally}} done <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> or <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aid of binoculars since most low Earth orbit satellites move too quickly to be tracked easily by telescope. It is this movement, as the satellite tracks across the night sky, {{that makes them}} relatively easy to see. As with any sky-watching pastime, the darker the sky the better, so hobbyists will meet with better success further away from light-polluted urban areas. Because geosynchronous satellites do not move relative to the viewer they {{can be difficult to}} find and are not typically sought when satellite watching. Although to the observer low Earth orbit satellites move at about the same apparent speed as aircraft, individual satellites can be faster or slower; they do not all move at the same speed. Individual satellites never deviate in their velocity (speed and direction). They can be distinguished from aircraft because satellites do not leave contrails. They are lit solely by the reflection of sunlight from solar panels or other surfaces. A satellite's brightness sometimes changes as it moves across the sky. Occasionally a satellite will 'flare' as its orientation changes relative to the viewer, suddenly increasing in reflectivity. Satellites often grow dimmer and are more difficult to see toward the horizons. Because reflected sunlight is necessary to see satellites, the best viewing times are for a few hours immediately after nightfall and a few hours before dawn. Given the number of satellites now in orbit, a fifteen-minute session of sky watching will generally yield at least one satellite passing overhead.|$|R
40|$|Industrialized {{production}} of jewelry uses {{large quantities of}} small diamonds of 3 mm and below. Traditional evaluation of the diamond stone’s quality is by <b>naked</b> human <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of a magnifying glass based on criteria known as 4 Cs, which are carat, cut, color and clarity. However, the process can be biased by human judgment due to inconsistent grading standard and physical fatigue. Therefore, it is worthwhile to automate the evaluation process. Among the 4 Cs criteria, the automation of evaluation of carat, cut and color is realized, only automatic diamond clarity grading lacks a systematic study. Hence, a fully automatic diamond clarity grading system is very desirable and would have a huge market demand. This thesis proposes a systematic framework for automatic diamond clarity grading for small diamonds and development of an effective algorithm for this task. Image processing and pattern recognition techniques are employed to tackle the problem, including image segmentation and classification. In the image segmentation stage, diamond is first extracted from the raw input image by the thresholding technique. It is then divided into separated regions by the diamond frame model and edge detection. In the classification stage, feature descriptors are extracted from each region and then classified as impurity or non-impurity by a learned classifier. The clarity scale of the diamond can be determined based on the identified impurity regions. This thesis contributes in several aspects. First, it contributes {{to the development of}} a systematic framework for automatic diamond clarity grading. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Second, it proposes efficient descriptions of impurity characteristics. Last, the image segmentation technique for extracting the diamond frame model can be used for evaluating diamond cutting quality...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{watermarking}} for authentication and {{copyright protection}} {{is one of}} the interesting areas of research in information security. This technique is no more limited to the images but also applied to the audio, video, softwares and databases. However, the limitation of digital watermarking is that it introduces small distortions in the original cover contents, thus causing slight degradation. These distortions are undesirable in some sensitive applications data like medical, military and law-enforcement etc, where imperceptibility is also desired. However, there are certain applications in which this requirement is just opposite. For example, in medical images, the original image contents must be hidden from the <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> to ensure the privacy. The problem is formulated into two parts. Firstly, to enhance the security of medical images by hiding the contents of image along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> recovery and fragility. Secondly, to optimize the three conflicting parameters of digital watermarking namely, capacity, imperceptibility and robustness so that we could find an appropriate way to embed the watermark information in the image while satisfying the said parameters. In the first part, our main thrust is that image contents should not be visible to the <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> Moreover, the watermarked image should be recoverable along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> watermark on the receiving end. Lastly any tampering in the image should be detectable. In this regard, we have proposed residue number system (RNS) along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chaotic key for the reversible watermarking of medical images by presenting five different schemes. In the first two schemes, watermark information and original image both are fragile, so that any tampering in the image contents can be easily indicated. In the rest of the schemes, image is kept fragile, while the watermark information is made robust so that it can withstand some reasonable amount of modifications. The second part is concerned with general images carrying hidden information. Our main focus is to optimize the three parameters of digital watermarking, namely capacity, imperceptibility and robustness. In this regard, we have proposed a fuzzy rule base system (FRBS) along with human visual system (HVS) in three different schemes. In first two schemes, FRBS for optimizing capacity or imperceptibility is proposed while keeping the other fixed. It is achieved by finding the HVS features of the image and then tradeoff is made between the imperceptibility and capacity using FRBS. In the third scheme, we have jointly optimized the three parameters using FRBS and HVS. In summary, efficient watermarking schemes are developed which can protect the medical images from <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reversibility and fragility. The proposed schemes for the second part can also either optimize the two parameters or jointly optimize the three parameters. The proposed schemes are compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> well known schemes of digital watermarking in the literature...|$|R

Valves excessively thin, brittle, transparent, colourless, smooth, but generally sinuous along the zones of growth, which are conspicuous: valves generally covered throughout by thin chitine membrane, which is thickly clothed, especially in the interspaces between <b>the</b> valves, <b>with</b> minute spines, barely visible to <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> Scuta <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lower part of the tergo-carinal margin extremely protuberant; occludent margin, more or less, but slightly reflexed, with a depressed line running from the umbo to the apex; basal margin much reflexed, but to a variable extent and at a varying angle, even up to a right angle,--an external rim or collar being thus formed. There are no distinct internal teeth, but the basal margin under the umbones, is more or less distinctly produced into a rounded disc or projection, which is generally not so much outwardly reflexed {{as the rest of the}} basal margin: there is no distinct internal basal rim. The primordial valves are generally visible, but they do not lie, as in all other species, close to the basal margin, but a little above it,--the lower reflexed portion having been subsequently developed. Terga flat, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> occludent margin slightly arched, and not, as in the foregoing species, formed of two sides; apex bent towards the carina; width of the lower half {{highly variable}}, owing to the varying extent to which the scutal margin is hollowed out; in some specimens, the whole lower half beneath the apex of the scuta is of nearly the same width throughout; in other specimens this lower part is spear-shaped.
