5|$|The {{final stage}} {{occurs when a}} massive star begins {{producing}} iron. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> net release of energy. To a very limited degree such a process proceeds, but it consumes energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, such energy cannot be released by fission.|$|E
5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death. Of the nine books he wrote, {{the first was a}} scholarly look at the methodology and scope of experimental psychology. The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology could be used to eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on this front did <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E

5|$|Presidential {{elections}} were held within {{three weeks after}} the departure of Musharraf. Zardari vowed to pursue an unpopular campaign against tribal militancy in Pakistan and had the support of the United States. He claimed he had a London business school degree to satisfy a prerequisite for the presidency, but his party did <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> certificate. He was endorsed by the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for the presidency. The PML-N nominated former justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, while the PML-Q put forth Mushahid Hussain Sayed. Zardari won a majority in the Electoral College with 481 of 702 votes. He was elected President on 6 September 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw for}} the semi-finals meant Manchester City played the away leg first in every round, {{this time in}} Germany, where Schalke 04 were the opposition. Manchester City lost the first leg by a single goal. Needing to win at Maine Road by at least two goals, Manchester City used a very attacking approach. It worked; City led 3–0 at half-time, and won the match 5–1. In the final, City faced Górnik Zabrze of Poland, who had progressed via a coin toss after three matches with AS Roma could <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> winner in the other semi-final.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa {{cylinders}} may {{be filled}} {{for commercial purposes}} by {{a person who is}} competent {{in the use of the}} filling equipment to be used, who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations, and has written permission from the owner of the cylinder to fill it. The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of the cylinder must be made, and specified details of the cylinder and fill must be recorded. If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer. If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty, as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of the yacht caused Heidemann financial problems, and in 1976 he agreed terms with Gruner + Jahr, Sterns parent company, to produce a book based on the conversations he was having with the former soldiers and SS men. When the book went unwritten—the material provided by the former SS officer was not sufficiently interesting or verifiable for publication—Heidemann borrowed increasingly large sums from his employers {{to pay for the}} boat's upkeep. In June 1978 he advertised the boat for sale, asking 1.1million DMs; he received no offers. Mohnke recommended that Heidemann speak to Jakob Tiefenthaeler, a Nazi memorabilia collector and {{a former member of the}} SS. Tiefenthaeler was not in a position to buy the yacht, but was happy to act as an agent; his endeavours did <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> sale. Realising Heidemann's financial circumstances, Tiefenthaeler provided him with names of other collectors in the Stuttgart area. The journalist made a trip to the south of Germany and met Stiefel, who purchased some of Göring's effects.|$|E

5|$|The smooth, {{thick-walled}} elliptical spores typically measure 7.5–10 by 5–7µm. They have {{a narrow}} germ pore. The mushroom does <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> spore print, but the spores are yellow-brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are hyaline (translucent), club-shaped, usually four-spored (some are two-spored), and measure 17–21 by 6–8.2µm. Pseudoparaphyses (cells that grow {{down from the}} roof of locules, and often end up connecting the roof and the floor of the locule) are abundant in the gleba; they measure about 16 by 12.5µm. Cystidia are yellowish to brownish, thin-walled, with dimensions of 60–100 by 15–25µm. The peridium is made of two distinct tissue layers. The epicutis comprises narrow, gelatinous interwoven hyphae in a layer that is 15–50µm. Underneath the epicutis is the subcutis, which consists of thin-walled hyphae up to 12µm in diameter. All hyphae are inamyloid, and all have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 1999, Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom, {{where they}} settled in Ealing, west London. They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, Acton, where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, Harlesden, in the London Borough of Brent. On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she {{paid no attention to}} them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible on the grounds of habitual residence. Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing. She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune, a social worker in Ealing's Acton referral and assessment team. She did <b>not</b> <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> written or electronic documentation of the referral, however, something which would have helped in double-checking the accounts that Kouao gave.|$|E
