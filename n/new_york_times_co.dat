5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. Sullivan (1964), and <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. United States (1971).|$|E

Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancers' work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.|$|E

The Houston Chronicle online editor Mike Read said that the Houston Chronicle decided to remove Houston Post articles from the website after the 2001 United States Supreme Court <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. Tasini decision; the newspaper originally planned to filter articles not allowed by the decision and to post articles that were not prohibited by the decision. The Houston Chronicle decided not to post or re-post any more Houston Post articles because of difficulties in complying with the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v.

500|$|In the 1964 Supreme Court case of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. Sullivan, {{the court}} ruled that speech about issues of public impact should be unrestricted, {{vigorous}} and public, even if such discussion communicates extreme negative criticism of public servants and members of government. Lewis praises this decision, and writes that it laid the groundwork for a press more able to perform investigative journalism concerning controversies, including the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War. He cites the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. Sullivan decision as an example of [...] "Madisonian" [...] philosophy towards freedom of speech espoused by James Madison. The author examines the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. United States, and endorses the court's decision, which allowed the press to publish classified material relating to the Vietnam War.|$|E
500|$|Justice Black {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a leading defender of First Amendment rights such as {{the freedom of speech}} and of the press. He refused to accept the doctrine that the freedom of speech could be curtailed on national security grounds. Thus, in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. United States (1971), he voted to allow newspapers to publish the Pentagon Papers despite the Nixon Administration's contention that publication would have security implications. In his concurring opinion, Black stated, ...|$|E
500|$|Harlan concurred in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. Sullivan, which {{required}} public officials suing newspapers for libel {{to prove that}} the publisher had acted with [...] "actual malice." [...] This stringent standard made it much more difficult for public officials to win libel cases. He did not, however, go as far as Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, who suggested that all libel laws were unconstitutional. In Street v. New York, Harlan wrote the opinion of the court, ruling that the government could not punish an individual for insulting the American flag. In 1969 he noted that the Supreme Court had consistently [...] "rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication." ...|$|E

500|$|The paper's {{involvement}} in a 1964 libel case helped bring {{one of the key}} United States Supreme Court decisions supporting freedom of the press, <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. Sullivan. In it, the United States Supreme Court established the [...] "actual malice" [...] standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff, and difficulty in proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.|$|E
500|$|In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), the Court drew on Thomas Jefferson's {{correspondence}} {{to call for}} [...] "a wall of separation between church and State", though the precise boundary of this separation remains in dispute. Speech rights were expanded significantly {{in a series of}} 20th and 21st-century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech, anonymous speech, campaign financing, pornography, and school speech; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections. The Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the burden of proof for defamation and libel suits, most notably in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. Sullivan (1964). Commercial speech, however, is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech, and is therefore subject to greater regulation.|$|E

This organization was named the [...] "Gandhi Society for Human Rights." [...] King served as honorary president for the group. Displeased with the pace of President Kennedy's addressing the issue of segregation, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document in 1962 calling on the President {{to follow in the}} footsteps of Abraham Lincoln and use an Executive Order to deliver a blow for Civil Rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation.

500|$|However, Near {{also noted}} an exception, {{allowing}} prior restraint in {{cases such as}} [...] "publication of sailing dates of transports or the number or location of troops". This exception was a key point in another landmark case four decades later: <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. United States (1971), in which the administration of President Richard Nixon sought to ban {{the publication of the}} Pentagon Papers, classified government documents about the Vietnam War secretly copied by analyst Daniel Ellsberg. The Court found, 6–3, that the Nixon administration had not met the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint. Justice Brennan, drawing on Near in a concurrent opinion, wrote that [...] "only governmental allegation and proof that publication must inevitably, directly, and immediately cause the occurrence of an evil kindred to imperiling the safety of a transport already at sea can support even the issuance of an interim restraining order." [...] Justices Black and Douglas went still further, writing that prior restraints were never justified.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court {{declined}} {{to rule on}} the constitutionality of any federal law regarding the Free Speech Clause until the 20th century. For example, the Supreme Court never ruled on the Alien and Sedition Acts; three Supreme Court justices riding circuit presided over sedition trials without indicating any reservations. The leading critics of the law, Vice President Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, argued for the Acts' unconstitutionality based on the First Amendment and other Constitutional provisions. Jefferson succeeded Adams as president, {{in part due to}} the unpopularity of the latter's sedition prosecutions; he and his party quickly overturned the Acts and pardoned those imprisoned by them. In the majority opinion in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. Sullivan (1964), the Court noted the importance of this public debate as a precedent in First Amendment law and ruled that the Acts had been unconstitutional: [...] "Although the Sedition Act was never tested in this Court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history." ...|$|E
500|$|In <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Co.</b> v. United States 403 U.S. 713 (1971)—better {{known as}} the Pentagon Papers case—the {{government}} had sought to prevent the publication of classified material by The New York Times. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 {{that the government had}} not reached the standard required by Near to justify prior restraint, but the concurring justices gave differing opinions about where the line should be drawn. In his opinion, Justice Potter Stewart wrote that while publication of The Pentagon Papers would likely harm the national interest, it would not result in [...] "direct, immediate or irreparable harm to our Nation or its people". Failure to provide a clear line inevitably meant that the court had to deal with prior restraint on a case-by-case basis. In Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539 (1976), the court was called upon to decide whether news reportage of a lurid mass murder case {{in a small town in}} Nebraska would justify prior restraint in order to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial. In this case, the court ruled unanimously that it would not. Most of the justices viewed Near as providing the only grounds for prior restraint, and declined to expand its scope any further.|$|E
