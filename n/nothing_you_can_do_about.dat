2500|$|Halladay {{was named}} the starter for Games One and Five during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I think the one thing I took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The buildup to Steven's exit {{involved}} in a bisexual love triangle storyline between him, Stacey and Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who is the gay brother of Jane. On-screen, Steven and Stacey's friendship progressed into something more serious in March 2008, when they shared a kiss. Steven later decided {{he was ready to}} lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice [...] "to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself," [...] which Sidwell has described as, [...] "a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show." [...] Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: [...] "Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and would do anything for her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality..." [...] On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; {{in an interview with the}} Daily Star he explained, [...] " [...] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [...] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [...] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it." [...] The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and [...] "out" [...] him. John Partridge, has commented, [...] "Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt." [...] After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him – a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot has been described as [...] "controversial" [...] and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: [...] "A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well." ...|$|E
