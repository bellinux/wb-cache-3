40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} an important cognitive bias in information processing, confirmation bias, in a political agency setting. When voters have this bias and when only the politician's actions are observable before the election, it decreases pandering by the incumbent, and can raise voter welfare as a consequence. This result {{is driven by the}} fact that the <b>noise</b> <b>aspect</b> of confirmation bias, which decreases pandering, dominates the bounded rationality aspect, which increases it. The results generalize in several directions, including to the case where the voter can also observe payoffs with some probability before the election. We identify conditions when confirmation bias strengthens the case for decision-making by an elected rather than an appointed official. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInterferometry {{is widely}} used in {{bathymetric}} applications to relate short time delays between two separate sensors to wavefront arrival angles. The main difficulty of this method concerns its sensitivity {{with regard to the}} distance between the two sensor receivers, commonly called baseline. Indeed, the baseline, which is only a few wavelengths long, is sufficient to triangulate the direction of an echo, which can be several hundred meters away. Due to the usual short baseline size, the direction of arrival (DOA) resulting from an interferometric measurement is very sensitive to noise, which can reduce accuracy and handicap the data for immediate use. Interferometric measurements are confined to a $ 2 pi $-length interval, and yet, the time-delay dynamic range can go beyond this length. As a result, the phase delay is estimated with a $ 2 pi $-modulo ambiguity. This study focuses on the accuracy problem and tries to make a bathymetric performance estimation. The statistical behavior of the interferometric signal is the keystone of the problem as it allows the bathymetric measurement error to be derived. Because of the very singular nature of the interferometric signal, the <b>noise</b> <b>aspect</b> is not analyzed as a classical additive perturbation, but as a decorrelation between receivers. Thus, a coherent error fusion (CEF) makes it possible to directly integrate the impact of several degrading phenomena into the interferometric-phase probability density function (pdf) and thus, to improve the bathymetric performance prediction compared with a classical root mean squared error (RMSE) integration. Finally, the CEF prediction model is tested on real data collected with a 455 -kHz sidescan sonar, and compared with the RMSE-based prediction approach...|$|E

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty high-functioning children with autism and twenty typically developing children were asked to recognize familiar objects while the presence, position, {{and shape of the}} cast shadow were systematically manipulated. Analysis of vocal reaction time revealed that whereas typically developing children used information from cast shadows to improve object recognition, in autistic children the presence of cast shadows [...] either congruent or incongruent [...] interfered with object recognition.

This vision defines an aircraft {{noise reduction}} goal of 15 dB per operation until 2020, which inherently requires a reduction of airframe noise, and thus of high lift devices noise, by this same amount during landing approach. Since high lift devices noise is known to be dominant by slat noise, the aerodynamic optimization of slat-wing configurations must also account for <b>noise</b> <b>aspects.</b> Therefore the effect of slat gap variations on slat noise generation was investigated through a scale model high lift devices experimental wind tunnel study. In parallel CFD calculations (2 D RANS) were performed for all test configurations to correlate measured slat noise characteristics with flow field data. Broadband slat noise levels were found to scale best with the local flow velocity at the pressure (cove) side close to the upper slat trailing-edge. Relative to the reference slat gap width a broadband noise reduction of up to 10 dB was achieved for reduced gap width (up to 15 %), accompanied by an up to 4 % degradation in maximum lift.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is based on}} data collected during a comprehensive field campaign focussing on air pollution and <b>noise</b> <b>aspects</b> in the lower Inntal valley (Austria) during winter 2005 / 2006. In this context, the evolution of snow {{plays an important role}} too, e. g. with respect to the strength and persistence of inversions. This is of particular interest in view of the exceptional situation during winter 2005 / 2006, which was characterized by an almost unbroken snow cover all over the country. A one-dimensional mass and energy balance model is successfully used to simulate the seasonal evolution of the snow pack and its interaction with the atmosphere and the underlying soil. Profiles of snow temperature and density, grain size, or liquid water content are predicted by numerically solving for the governing equations of the relevant processes. The model is driven by the basic meteorological parameters and validation of the simulation results is based on com-parison with a set of independent measurement data. The energy balance during the accumulation period was characterized by a net loss due to radiation and the prevalence of evaporation, which was offset by the positive contributions from turbulent sensible and conductive soil heat fluxes. During the melt period, the snow pack experienced enhanced energy input, which was mainly associated to the now positive radiation budget and the soil heat flux directed towards the surface. The initial ablation rates were significantly enhanced as soon as melt water and solar radiation approached the snow-soil interface...|$|R
40|$|Knowing {{the effect}} of the higher {{harmonics}} of the magnetic field on the magnetostrictive behavior of electrical steel is highly beneficial for the <b>noise</b> <b>aspects.</b> In this work, {{the effect of}} a third harmonic with a variety of amplitudes and phase delays is extensively studied. Magnetostriction measurements are performed on samples of grain-oriented and nonoriented electrical steel under sinusoidal excitations with a third harmonic component and are compared with those of a purely sinusoidal excitation. The frequency spectrum of the measured data, where the second and the fourth harmonic are the most significant ones are then calculated. The measured data show that only knowing the amplitude of the third harmonic is not sufficient to estimate the variations of the magnetostriction. In fact the phase delay of such third harmonic can significantly alter the results. The measurements are carried out on two grain-oriented and two nonoriented samples under a magnetization with a fundamental of 1. 3 T and 50 Hz, from which the following conclusions are drawn. Increasing the phase delay of a 8 % third harmonic ratio from 0 $^{circ}$ to 180 $^{circ}$ delay, causes a variation up to 55 % of the 100 Hz component for the two nonoriented materials. In the case of grain-oriented materials, up to 50 % change is obtained. The measured data of the 200 Hz components show an increase, as well. However, since their values are far lower than the 100 Hz component, their effect is considerably smaller on the magnetostrictive behavior. These results are highly important for the noise of electrical machines and transformers, due to the magnetostriction phenomenon...|$|R

Note that the equalizer has to operate on received signals which are corrupted by AWGN.

40|$|Cattle grids {{are used}} on roads and tracks to prevent grazing animals from leaving an open space without fencing onto a more {{controlled}} area where {{access to the}} road from surrounded land is more limited. They are widely used in the UK at the entrances to common and moorland areas where animals are free to roam, but also on private drive entrances. Typically, they consist {{of a series of}} metal bars across the road that are spaced so that an animal’s legs would fall through the gaps if it attempted to cross. Below the grid is a shallow pit that is intended to further deter livestock from using that particular crossing point. The sound produced as vehicles cross these devices is a characteristic low frequency “brrrr” where the dominant frequencies relates to the bar passage frequency under the tyres. The sound can be disturbing to riders and their horses and walkers and residents living close by as evidenced by press reports and the need to consider <b>noise</b> <b>aspects</b> in planning for new installations. For this reason and {{due to the lack of}} available information on the size and nature of the problem measurements and recordings have been made at a number of sites in Yorkshire in the UK. In addition, questionnaire surveys of residents living close by and façade measurements have also been used to gauge impact. Results show that there is a wide variation in the maximum noise level produced by cattle grids of apparently similar design. This can be related to impact noise produced by the movement of all or part of the grid as the frame comes under impulsive loading as the vehicle crosses. It was further established that some residents living close to the cattle grids were disturbed by the noise, and in some cases vibration, and wanted them removed or suitably modified...|$|R
40|$|Tools for {{simulating}} tyre/road noise {{are highly}} valuable in {{the efforts to}} limit {{the negative consequences of}} road traffic noise. A numerical tyre/road noise simulation tool was in this study used to investigate how the contact stiffness parameter affects the predicted tyre/road noise. It includes a contact model with contact springs that accounts for the effect of local small-scale tread deformation. Results showed that simulated noise was sensitive to the value of the spring stiffness, primarily as it affected the total contact force. A non-linear contact spring formulation resulted in a reduction of the high-frequency content in the contact forces and simulated <b>noise.</b> <b>Aspects</b> of small-scale tread dynamics were evaluated by simulating the detailed contact between an elastic layer and a rough road surface using a numerical time domain contact model including non-linear contact springs to account for small-scale roughness. Contact stiffness increased as the number of contact points grew as well as the deformation of their non-linear contact springs. The results imply that dynamic properties of the local tread deformation may be of importance when simulating contact details during normal tyre/road interaction conditions, but that effects of damping could, as a first approximation, be included as an increased stiffness in a quasi-static tread model. The speed dependency of measured and simulated tyre/road noise was analysed. A large part of the noise had a high speed exponent, traditionally connected with air-pumping. However, the results showed that tyre vibrations can generate noise with a speed exponent that verges on what is expected from air-pumping. Due to the overlap in the speed exponents of the main generation mechanisms, they cannot be distinguished through a speed exponent analysis. The most important contribution of this work is an increased understanding of how the contact spring formulation affects the simulated noise. The work has also provided insights into the speed dependency of tyre/road noise generation mechanisms...|$|R
