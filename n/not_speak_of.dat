5|$|During Roosevelt's fifteen months {{beyond the}} Atlantic, from March 1909 to June 1910, neither man wrote {{much to the}} other. Taft biographer Lurie {{suggested}} that each expected the other {{to make the first}} move to re-establish their relationship on a new footing. Upon Roosevelt's triumphant return, Taft invited him to stay at the White House. The former president declined, and in private letters to friends expressed dissatisfaction at Taft's performance. Nevertheless, he wrote that he expected Taft to be renominated by the Republicans in 1912, and did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> himself as a candidate.|$|E
25|$|Ammianus Marcellinus, on {{the other}} hand, claimed that the Burgundians were descended from Romans. The Roman sources do <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> any {{specific}} migration from Poland by the Burgundians (although other Vandalic peoples are more clearly mentioned as having moved west in this period), and so there have historically been some doubts about {{the link between the}} eastern and western Burgundians.|$|E

The trip to Inganok takes three weeks, but as they draw near, Carter spots a strange granite island. When he {{inquires}} about the mysterious isle, the captain explains {{that it is the}} nameless rock, and it is best to <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> it. That night, Carter hears strange howls from the nameless island.|$|E

25|$|From 1932 to 1935, White {{lived in}} England, {{studying}} French and German literature at King's College, Cambridge University. His homosexuality took {{a toll on}} his first term academic performance, {{in part because he}} developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.|$|E
500|$|LGBT {{themes in}} Hindu mythology involve Hindu deities or heroes whose {{attributes}} or {{behavior can be}} interpreted as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT), or as having elements of gender variance and non-heterosexual sexuality. Traditional Hindu literary sources do <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality directly, but changes of sex, homoerotic encounters, and intersex or third gender characters are often found both in traditional religious narratives such as the Vedas, [...] Mahabharata, Ramayana and Puranas as well as in regional folklore.|$|E
500|$|The next biblical quotation, verse 13 of the gospel, [...] "" [...] (But {{when that}} one, the Spirit of Truth, shall come, He shall lead you into all truth.) is {{rendered}} by the choir. It is divided in three sections, {{similar to a}} da capo form. All three parts are fugues, combined in motet style, the instruments playing mostly colla parte with the voices. The second section begins [...] "" [...] (For He will <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> His own accord); the third section expresses [...] "" [...] (and what is to come, He will foretell), on a fugue subject similar to the first, giving the movement a [...] "feeling of unity".|$|E

He also states, [...] "It was during my absence from France that Bonaparte, in the rank of chef de bataillon , performed his first campaign, and contributed so materially to the recapture of Toulon. Of this period of his life I have no personal knowledge, and therefore I shall <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> it as an eye-witness. I shall merely relate some facts which fill up the interval between 1793 and 1795, and which I have collected from papers which he himself delivered to me. Among these papers is a little production, entitled Le Souper de Beaucaire, the copies of which he bought up at considerable expense, and destroyed upon his attaining the Consulate." ...|$|E

No corresponding notion exists in the analytic theory of continued fractions [...] in other words, mathematicians do <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> an absolutely convergent continued fraction.

It was very sharp and could decapitate a man or horse. However, this does not address the mention of the Jaredite swords, because obsidian cannot rust.|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, after Einstein {{completed}} his foundational work on general relativity, Lorentz {{wrote a letter}} to him in which he speculated that within general relativity the aether was re-introduced. In his response Einstein wrote that one can actually speak about a [...] "new aether", but one may <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>of</b> motion in relation to that aether. This was further elaborated by Einstein in some semi-popular articles (1918, 1920, 1924, 1930).|$|E
