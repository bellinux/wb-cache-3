He said that at E3, they got to see where players were having issues with the camera system and said, [...] "we are doing extensive focus tests, and using data compiled from E3, to find and fix the problem areas" [...] of the cameras. He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game's release. However, he said if players [...] "hate cinematic camera systems, <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do will help you like the God of War cameras". The game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine, which they developed for their previous game, Kinetica (2001).|$|E
500|$|On the {{potential}} for [...] "superhero fatigue", Feige stated, [...] "This year , we've got Civil War and we've got Doctor Strange in November, two completely different movies. To me, and to all of Marvel Studios, that's what keeps it going. As long as we're surprising people, as long as we're not falling into things becoming too similar ... next year, , , [...] Those are three totally different movies ... {{as long as the}} only shared thing is they come from the same source material and they've got our Marvel logo in front of the movies. Other than that they can be very distinct. What other studios do, what other properties, <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke {{was critical of}} the release, saying: [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do about it. The work is really public property now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, {{and we wanted to}} do it, then it might have been good." [...] In August 2008, EMI reissued [...] "special editions" [...] of Radiohead's back catalogue as part of its [...] "From the Capitol Vaults" [...] series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.|$|E

500|$|The actress led {{an active}} private life, {{reportedly}} swimming and playing tennis every morning. In her eighties {{she was still}} playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary All About Me. She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life. When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, [...] "I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person." [...] The anti-Communist attitude in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, as she joined the Committee for the First Amendment. Her name was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee but Hepburn denied being a Communist sympathizer. Later in life, she openly promoted birth control and supported abortion. She practiced Albert Schweitzer's theory of [...] "Reverence for Life", but {{did not believe in}} religion or the afterlife. In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, [...] "I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> know except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people." [...] Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.|$|E
2500|$|The {{unrelated}} U.S. magazine Rolling Stone, {{called the}} newspaper's actions [...] "horrific" [...] {{and stated that}} Rolling Stone magazine has [...] "demanded they [...] cease using our name as a title". However, the magazine had little legal recourse because, despite copyrighting the name [...] "Rolling Stone" [...] in {{a large number of}} countries, they had not copyrighted it in Uganda. As publisher Jann Wenner stated, [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do. We never copyrighted the name in Uganda. We own the copyright for the name in many, many countries. But who would have thought we'd have to own the copyright in Uganda?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the safety}} {{copy of the}} Basement Tapes, this song was labeled [...] "Answer to Ode". Heylin interprets it as a parody of [...] "Ode to Billie Joe", which was a hit single for Bobbie Gentry in mid-1967 when the {{basement}} songs were being taped. He calls it [...] "as deadpan a deconstruction" [...] of the Gentry hit as the Blonde on Blonde track [...] "4th Time Around" [...] was of The Beatles' [...] "Norwegian Wood". (He adds that, in his view, Dylan generally parodied songs that he liked.) For Heylin, it illustrates Dylan's feeling that folk songs delivered [...] "the underground story". An event with potentially world-shaking implications—"The vice president's gone mad!"—is treated in a detached, stoic manner by the community: [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do about it". The narrative piles up both banal and surreal details, but [...] "Dylan delivers the 'saga' in the most laconic manner imaginable".|$|E

2500|$|With {{about four}} minutes {{to play in}} the first half, McCoy {{connected}} with Limas Sweed for an apparent five-yard (5m) touchdown pass. [...] However, Sweed was flagged for offensive pass interference which the Austin American-Statesman later suggested was [...] "questionable". [...] According to the Austin American-Statesman, the refs [...] "blew the call" [...] stating that replays showed that Sweed was involved in some [...] "spirited hand checking while the ball was in the air, but neither player appeared to push or be guilty of interference". [...] All three broadcasters working the game for ABC also initially spoke out against the penalty call, although later acknowledging that enough interference had occurred to justify the call. [...] In an ABC half-time interview, Mack Brown said [...] "I thought it was a bad call," [...] but added [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do about that. We should’ve done a better job on third down." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Imperial Conference {{on the night}} of August 13–14 at which the {{surrender}} finally was decided, Anami had two conversations in which he expressed opposition to the surrender. He asked Yoshijirō Umezu if [...] "the war should be continued even at the risk of launching a coup d'état," [...] to which Umezu concluded that, [...] "There is <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do now but to comply with the Emperor's decision." [...] Anami then confronted a Colonel Saburo Hayashi in a washroom and asked about [...] "the possibility of attacking a large American convoy rumored to be outside of Tokyo." [...] Hayashi dashed Anami's suggestion by reaffirming the Imperial decision while noting the presence of the convoy was only a rumor. Finally, his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Masahiko Takeshita confronted Anami first suggesting Anami resign, which would topple the government, then suggesting he support the coup. To the first, Anami noted that the fall of the government would not stop the Imperial edict, while to the second, he replied that he wished to go to the Army Ministry first.|$|E
60|$|It is an axiom {{in mental}} philosophy, {{that we can}} think of nothing which we have not perceived.
