25|$|Policy {{discourse}} in Singapore has largely overlooked {{the fact that}} the linguistic market consists of permeable boundaries and the value of linguistic capital for each language changes as internal and external factors interact together.

Language Policy and implementations need to consider bottom up processes (Individuals and Unofficial Institutions), and not just designed from the top (Government and Official Agencies). The population’s perceptions regarding prestige and image of Ethnic Languages are important parameters that need to be established and analysed in accordance with the Government’s Language Policies plans to account for a multicultural country like Singapore.|$|E

25|$|While WSS {{improvements}} were ongoing, {{the traditional}} water management approach did {{not account for}} domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and non-point sources pollution control resulting in the environmental degradation of water bodies. These systems were viewed as separate and the management strategy did not account for treatment facilities, local streams, and overall water quality within them. The philosophy is evolving however, and water resources management practice is becoming more of an integrated approach taking into account a multi-sectoral approach looking at water supply, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), drainage and irrigation as one entity. According to pollution control work presented {{by a team of}} researchers at the British Hydrological Society symposium in 2008, there is a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> sewer system, the WWTP, and the river as one system. These developments in the Bogotá water management system offer multiple opportunities to incorporate integrated methodologies both now and in the future.|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the town's sign ordinance was [...] "content-based on its face" [...] {{in light of the fact}} that the [...] "restrictions in the Sign Code that apply to any given sign [...] entirely on the communicative content of the sign". Because the church's signs were [...] "treated differently from signs conveying other types of ideas", there was [...] "no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> government’s justifications or purposes for enacting the Code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny". Justice Thomas rejected the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the ordinance was content-neutral because the regulations were not based on [...] "disagree with the message conveyed" [...] and the reasons for regulating the various categories of signs were [...] "unrelated to the content of the sign". Rather, he emphasized that [...] " [...] law that is content-based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government’s benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of 'animus toward the ideas contained' in the regulated speech". Justice Thomas explained that [...] "innocent motives" [...] do not eliminate the danger of censorship, because governments may one day use content-based laws to regulate [...] "disfavored speech".|$|E

2500|$|Option ARMs {{are often}} offered {{with a very}} low teaser rate (often as low as 1%) which {{translates}} into very low minimum payments {{for the first year}} of the ARM. During boom times, lenders often underwrite borrowers based on mortgage payments that are below the fully amortizing payment level. This enables borrowers to qualify for a much larger loan (i.e., take on more debt) than would otherwise be possible. When evaluating an Option ARM, prudent borrowers will not focus on the teaser rate or initial payment level, but will consider the characteristics of the index, the size of the [...] "mortgage margin" [...] that is added to the index value, and the other terms of the ARM. Specifically, they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> possibilities that (1) long-term interest rates go up; (2) their home may not appreciate or may even lose value or even (3) that both risks may materialize.|$|E
2500|$|Guided tissue {{regeneration}} (GTR) using PTFE membranes is favoured by some practitioners, {{despite its}} cost and complexity: [...] "GTR {{has a greater}} effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. However there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. As a result, {{it is difficult to}} draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of GTR. Whilst there is evidence that GTR can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. Therefore, patients and health professionals <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use." ...|$|E

Carley felt hurt at his apparent disinclination to confide in her. The strong cast of his face, as if it had been chiseled in bronze; the stern set of his lips and the jaw that protruded lean and square cut; the quiet masked light of his eyes; the coarse roughness of his brown hands, mute evidence of strenuous labors--these all gave a different impression from his brief remarks about himself. Lastly there was a little gray in the light-brown hair over his temples. Glenn was only twenty-seven, yet he looked ten years older. Studying him so, with the memory of earlier years in her mind, she was forced to admit that she liked him infinitely more as he was now. He seemed proven. Something had made him a man. Had it been his love for her, or the army service, or the war in France, or the struggle for life and health afterwards? Or had it been this rugged, uncouth West? Carley felt insidious jealousy of this last possibility. She feared this West. She was going to hate it. She had womanly intuition enough to see in Flo Hutter a girl somehow to be reckoned with. Still, Carley would not acknowledge to herself that his simple, unsophisticated Western girl could possibly be a rival. Carley did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>the</b> fact that she had been spoiled by the attention of men. It was not her vanity that precluded Flo Hutter as a rival.|$|E
