40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused to nickel {{coatings}} on magnesium alloys. At {{the introduction of}} this work is briefly commented phase composition of AZ 91 alloy, which is followed by detailed description of five very different theories of Ni-P coatings formation. Theoretical part is ended by review aimed to current states of development in areas of chemical nickel coating, influence of AZ 91 alloy microstructure to current less deposition and possibility of surfactants influence to decrease of surface roughness. In experimental part of this thesis was the morphology and composition of Ni-P coatings including interlayers dependence on chemical composition of <b>nickel-plating</b> <b>bath</b> and magnesium alloy surface pre-treatment investigated using scanning electron microscopy and inverted optical microscopy. Average phosphorus content was obtained using energy dispersive analysis. Closing part of experimental part was dedicated for mechanical properties of coatings by micro-indentation analysis...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of three}} {{different}} materials, 2 -mercaptobenzimidazole, 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole, and thioglycolic acid, was investigated to improve the performance of electroless <b>nickel-plating</b> <b>baths.</b> By changing the concentrations of these materials, sample plates were coated. Optical microscope images were obtained by selecting representative coated plates. From {{the results of the}} investigations, the effects of these materials on electroless nickel plating were observed, and the most appropriate amounts of these materials for nickel plating were determined. Moreover, the nickel plating speed observed with the bath solution containing 2 -mercaptobenzimidazole, 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole, and thioglycolic acid is higher than {{that in the case of}} traditional electroless plating baths, but the nickel consumption amount in the former case is lower. In order to minimize the waste water generated from electroless <b>nickel-plating</b> <b>baths,</b> we determined the lowest amounts of the chemicals that can be used for the concentrations reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Data from {{published}} and unpublished sources on electrolytic removal of small quantities of copper, zinc, and iron from <b>nickel-plating</b> <b>baths</b> have been compared. As expected the more noble copper plates out preferential ly {{at a rate}} limited only by diffusion to the cathode. Zinc ions increase the cathodic potential for nickel deposition {{to the point that}} zinc plates out with nickel at a diffusion-limited rate. Removal of iron may also be diffusion l imited but results are less clear than for copper and zinc. Nickel plating solutions become contaminated with metal ions, such as copper, zinc, and iron which are brought into a bath by solution clinging to the work or by dissolution of the surface of the work. A convenient and efficient way of removing these impurities is by low current density electrolysis (dummying), either directly in the plating bath during nonproductio...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} decomplexing and oxidation of two {{frequently used}} complexing agents in surface treatment and metal finishing - EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) - and of organic non-complexing additives used in <b>nickel-plating</b> <b>baths</b> were {{the subject of}} this study. Using a Ti-RuO 2 electrode, a partial indirect oxidation by in-situ electrochemical generation of chlorine compounds could be achieved for EDTA and NTA. At a boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode however, complete decomplexing and high COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and TOC (Total Organic Carbon) (up to 95 %) removal occurred at an average current density of 2 A dm- 2. It is shown that direct electrochemical oxidation at a BDD electrode resulted in lower energy consumption and higher treatment rates than indirect oxidation at a Ti-RuO 2 electrode. Decomplexing at the BDD electrode occurred at high current efficiencies ranging from 71 % to 95 % with decomplexing rates in the order of 3. 13 mmol (Ah) - 1 and 5. 02 mmol (Ah) - 1 for EDTA and NTA respectively. COD removal rates obtained were 0. 090 g (Ah) - 1 for EDTA, 0. 100 g (Ah) - 1 for NTA and 0. 205 g (Ah) - 1 for the nickel-plating additives. Electrochemical decomplexing and oxidation of common chelating agents can render the subsequent metal precipitation and biological wastewater treatment of surface treatment and metal finishing effluents more efficient.
