25|$|The term {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{miniature}} neon glow lamp, developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting. While neon tube lights are typically meters long, the neon lamps can be less than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights.

Through the 1970s, neon glow lamps were widely used for <b>numerical</b> <b>displays</b> in electronics, for small decorative lamps, and as signal processing devices in circuity.

Using a large corpus of PowerPoint slides projected during presentations at international applied linguistics conferences, the slides were analyzed to determine their visual typologies and rhetorical structure. The results highlight an array of visual modes (i. e., scriptural, graphical, figurative, <b>numerical),</b> <b>displaying</b> considerable variation in their distribution, while also largely following the traditional structure of written research articles.

50|$|The game only {{displays}} {{four digits}} of the player's score, {{yet it has}} a maximum value of 65,535. Scores of 10,000 and above are displayed as a combination of icons and the <b>numerical</b> <b>display.</b> For every 10,000 points, a sprite from the NES Super Mario Bros. game is shown below the numerical score. A fire flower is shown for 10,000 points, a mushroom for 20,000, and a starman for 30,000 points and above. The game stops changing the sprite after awarding the starman icon. As a result, the highest score that can be displayed is 39,999; however, the maximum score of 65,535 is shown as 35,535. Once the maximum score has been reached, the score will roll over only if the player completes a bonus stage. A roll over {{does not affect the}} recorded high score.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Information {{presentation}} {{on the monitor}} screen of ventilator machines affects nurses' response and decision-making during ventilation treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate whether a new GUI (graphical user interface) prototype, the so-called circular displayprototype can make deviations easy to detect. Method. A <b>numerical</b> <b>display</b> prototype was made and used as a reference displ ay in the evaluation. Six task scenarios that involved parameter changes were selected to simulate a real situation under volume control (VC) mode during ventilation treatment. Usability tests with the two display designs were carried out in a usability laboratory. Twenty medical nursing students participated as test subjects in the usability tests. Results. The objective results showed that the graphical circular display had an advantage over the <b>numerical</b> <b>display</b> in interpreting parameter changes, but not in reducing the error rates for detecting the number of parameter changes or for forming an overall picture of the patient's situation. Furthermore, the circular display prototype did not improve the detection time. Conclusions.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions for the pump is to accurately measure the amount of fuel pumped. Flow measurement is almost always done by a 4 stroke piston meter connected to an electronic encoder. In older gas pumps, the meter is physically coupled to reeled <b>numerical</b> <b>displays</b> (moving wheels or cylinders with numbers on the side), while newer pumps turn the meter's movement into electrical pulses using a rotary encoder. In the U.S. flow speed is limited to 10 gallons per minute for cars and 40 gallons per minute for trucks. This flow rate is based on the diameter of the vehicle's fuel filling pipe, which limits flow to these amounts.|$|R

40|$|Spin-crossover solids are photo-excitable materials, {{which are}} studied for future {{applications}} as optical memories or <b>numerical</b> <b>display.</b> The spin transition {{is a first}} order phase transition produced by variations of temperature, pressure or light. Cooperative effects constitute the basic mechanism for the spin crossover transition. They induce instability in the thermodynamic competition between the two states of the spin-crossover molecules: high-spin (HS) and low spin (LS). We investigate here the photo-excitation process and the relaxation of the photo-excited state in photo-switchable solids, such as spin transitions systems [(FexM 1 -x) (btr) 2 (NCS) 2] H 2 O, with M=Co, Ni, Zn. We follow the competition between the relaxation and the photo-excitation processes (up and eventually down).
