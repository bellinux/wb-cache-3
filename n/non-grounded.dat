40|$|Finding {{satisfying}} assignments for {{the variables}} {{involved in a}} set of constraints can be cast as a (bounded) model generation problem: search for (bounded) models of a theory in some logic. The state-of-the-art approach for bounded model generation for rich knowl- edge representation languages like Answer Set Programming (ASP) and FO(·) and a CSP modeling language such as Zinc, is ground-and-solve: reduce the theory to a ground or propositional one and apply a search algorithm to the resulting theory. An important bottleneck is the blow-up {{of the size of the}} theory caused by the grounding phase. Lazily grounding the theory during search is a way to overcome this bottleneck. We present a theoretical framework and an implementation in the context of the FO(·) knowledge representation language. Instead of grounding all parts of a theory, justifications are derived for some parts of it. Given a partial assignment for the grounded part of the theory and valid justifications for the formulas of the <b>non-grounded</b> part, the justifications provide a recipe to construct a complete assignment that satisfies the <b>non-grounded</b> part.

40|$|Although {{there is}} an ongoing {{controversy}} in philosophy of science about so called ceteris paribus laws that is, roughly, about laws with exceptionsóa fundamental question about those laws has been neglected (ß 2). This {{is due to the}} fact that this question becomes apparent only if two different readings of ceteris paribus clauses in laws have been separated. The first reading of ceteris paribus clauses, which I will call the epistemic reading, covers applications of laws: predictions, for example, might go wrong because we do not know all the relevant factors which are causally effective in relevant situation. The second reading, which I will call the metaphysical reading, is concerned with the laws themselves and their possible exceptions (ß 3). It is this latter readingóand the funda- mental question associated with itówhich has been neglected due to the confusion of the two readings (ß 4) : if we leave epistemic issues aside is there at all conceptual space left for a notion of laws of nature which allows the laws themselves to have exceptions? I call a law with exceptions in this sense, if such there is, a real ceteris paribus law. To tackle this question, I distinguish grounded laws from <b>non-grounded</b> laws (ß 5). A grounded law is, roughly, a law about structured entities where the properties of the parts of that structure figure themselves in laws of nature (ß 6).

Hence, they are candidates to be real (metaphysical) ceteris paribus laws in the sense of my central question. I will discuss grounded laws and their exceptions in detail (ß 7, ß 8, ß 9). For reasons of space, the further question whether we can even have a notion of fun- damental (<b>non-grounded)</b> laws that allows for exceptions cannot be discussed here.

Planar isometries and group theory are used in the developmental of the inverse kinematics (IK) algorithm. Kinematic mapping and Grobner bases are important for the forward kinematics (FK) algorithm. After six important geometric properties of the manipulator are identified, the IK algorithm is developed. It is based on the decomposability and commutativity of planar displacements. The four step algorithm provides closed form analytic solutions. The algorithm may be used on similar parallel manipulators with any number of 2 R legs, and hence, applies to a whole class of manipulators.

I intend to look specifically at The Book of Urizen, with minimal reference to any works outside of this by Blake or otherwise; as such, I will occasionally point to outside sources but will primarily use my own instincts to unveil the larger structure of the poem and images and I invite other readers to do the same. While this is a strategy of mine, it is equally supported by the poem itself, which makes up its overarching claims to reality. In fact, the claims that follow confine themselves to the world created by Urizen in order to illumine, using the text and images themselves as guidelines, the above challenges. In other words, one should consider Urizen to be a self-enclosed, self-illuminating work, the substance of which need only be encountered by an informed, or uninformed, reader for illumination as to the ultimate moral for readers to take from Urizen. These above challenges, and the answers obtained, will shed light on the ultimate type of work that Urizen is. As Mitchell writes, "Urizen is not a man 'representing' reason, or a man dominated by the faculty of reason: he is reason, a particular mode of consciousness. Blake's peculiar genius was not in dramatizing the human behavior associated with mental and emotional states, but in exploring the contours of various modes of consciousness as such. " Likewise, I will refrain from dramatizing Blake's narrative of Urizen with externally-obtained sources and various knowledge, but will instead explore the contours of Urizen as they stand in themselves...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} project introduces {{perception in}} motion as a design method for grounded transport networks – roads, pedestrian/ bike paths, and rail systems. To design for circulation networks that dictate the layout and lifestyle of a city, architects and planners {{need to understand}} the affects of current mobilescapes, which are environments that evolve from transport networks. In order to identify current issues of mobility this project documents a particular mobilescape in Honolulu, Hawai‘i – the elevated condition. I refer to the elevated condition as a type of transport system - such as the elevated highway, elevated mass transit system, and skyway - composed of two or more levels of movement. The strategy of overlapping is used to separate various modes of mobility that travel at different speeds and in different directions. Although the elevated access network can be an effective solution to organizing mobility, there is a modest understanding of the “experience” of moving through an elevated condition. Because Honolulu will begin to construct a 20 mile long elevated rail system in 2009, I wanted to understand what the experience could be. What will rail riders see and feel? How will the speed 4 of the rail affect what riders perceive? How will an understanding of the rail experience alter the way designers approach mobilescapes? In order to develop further understanding of mobilescape design, this project investigates mobility in two parts. Part one is a historical critique that explores the evolution of mobility in architecture and planning; inquiring about the effects that the automobile and other modes of surface transport have had on the urban environment. The goal is to understand how past approaches to mobilescapes have benefi ted or hindered the experience of urban cities. This exploration is not intended to address the issues of mobility within virtual space, vertical circulation in high-rise developments, nor does it include <b>non-grounded</b> transportation types such as air and sea travel. The fi ndings in the evolution of mobility supplement the second portion of this project that focuses on Honolulu’s elevated rail proposal. The elevated condition, within the existing context of Honolulu, is analyzed and documented in video format. The video is intended to be a simulated understanding of Honolulu’s transit experience; capturing the perception of the elevated condition at both upper and lower levels. The video documentary also highlights the issues of the projected experience and begins to introduce design suggestions that could enhance the elevated condition. The goal of the fi lm is to present planners and architects with a design tool, based on perception in motion, that can inform and influence the Honolulu rail system...|$|E
