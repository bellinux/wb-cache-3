The legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.

They met in Foz de Iguaçu in November 1990, when they signed the Declaration of Common Nuclear Policy (Declaração de Política Nuclear Comum). The document created the Common System for Accountability and Control (Sistema Comum de Contabilidade e Controle – SCCC), which would coordinate reciprocal inspections of nuclear facilities. This declaration also stated both countries’ willingness to commence negotiations with the IAEA on the implementation of nuclear safeguards and later join the regional regime of a <b>nuclear-weapon-free</b> <b>zone</b> of Latin America and the Caribbean as laid out by the Treaty of Tlatelolco.|$|E

The Treaty of Tlatelolco (1967) prohibited any production or deployment of nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Treaty of Pelindaba (1964) prohibits nuclear weapons in many African countries.

China fully understands the desire of Ukraine for security assurance. The Chinese Government has always maintained that under no circumstances will China use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States or <b>nuclear-weapon-free</b> <b>zones.</b> This principled position also applies to Ukraine.

5000|$|The {{preamble}} of the treaty, {{international human}}itarian law, {{international human rights}} law among other humanitarian principles, explains the motivation by the [...] "catastrophic consequences" [...] of a use of nuclear weapons, by the risk of their sheer existence, by {{the suffering of the}} hibakusha (the surviving victims of the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and the victims of nuclear tests, by [...] "the slow pace of nuclear disarmament" [...] and by [...] "the continued reliance on nuclear weapons in military and security concepts" [...] like deterrence. It recognizes [...] "the disproportionate impact of nuclear-weapon activities on indigenous peoples". It expresses compliance with existing law: the very first UN resolution adopted on 24 January 1946, the NPT, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its verification regime, as well as <b>nuclear-weapon-free</b> <b>zones.</b> Furthermore, the [...] "inalienable right" [...] of a peaceful use of nuclear energy is emphasized. Finally, social factors for peace and disarmament are recognized: participation of both women and men, education, public conscience, [...] "international and regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, religious leaders, parliamentarians, academics and the hibakusha".|$|R
40|$|<b>Nuclear-Weapon-Free</b> <b>Zones</b> (NWFZs) are binding {{agreements}} {{to prevent the}} acquisition and stationing of nuclear weapons within a particular region, and to secure guarantees from nuclear states not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against the zone. In the context of developing dialogues on nuclear proliferation and security issues in the Asian region, the existing Southeast Asian NWFZ (Bangkok Treaty), the current negotiations towards a Central Asian NWFZ, and proposals for NWFZs in South Asia and Northeast Asia, are examined and assessed {{from the viewpoint of}} their contributions to regional arms control and security, scope, and prospects for implementation. It is concluded that such zones provide an important avenue, in conjunction with the Nonproliferation Treaty, for regional groups of states in Asia to reduce nuclear proliferation threats within their own regions, to gain security assurances from the nuclear powers, and to facilitate wider confidence-building and cooperative security approaches to nuclear and weapons-of-mass destruction threats across the Asian region. Proposed ways forward include enhanced cooperation between existing NWFZ states, further international conferences in UN studies on NWFZ initiatives, and civil society pressures to establish NWFZ...|$|R
