5|$|Short {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} within proteins often act as recognition sites for other proteins. For instance, SH3 domains typically bind to short PxxP motifs (i.e. 2 prolines , separated by 2 unspecified amino acids , although the surrounding amino acids may determine the exact binding specificity). A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> motifs has been {{collected in the}} Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) database.|$|E

5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that were raised in Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} {{can also be}} found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of the}} smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{empirical}} study {{investigates the}} potential effects of “direct democracy ” on the voter participation rate. Direct democracy {{is assumed to}} take three forms: the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> statewide initiatives, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> statewide popular referenda, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> statewide legislative referenda. This study tests the hypothesis that greater <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> initiatives and referenda increase voter turnout because they elevate the expected gross benefits of voting by “empowering voters ” while not significantly increasing the expected gross costs of voting. Using state-level data for the 2004 Presidential election, and after allowing {{for a variety of}} economic and demographic factors, this study finds compelling evidence that greater <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> statewide ballot measures act to elevate the voter participation rate in the U.

5|$|Numerous climatological factors {{influence}} {{the formation of}} hurricanes in the Pacific basins. The North Pacific High and Aleutian Low, usually present between January and April, cause strong wind shear and unfavorable conditions {{for the development of}} hurricanes. During its presence, El Niño results in increased numbers of powerful hurricanes through weaker wind shear, while La Niña reduces the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> hurricanes through the opposite. Global warming may also {{influence the}} formation of tropical cyclones in the Pacific basin. During a thirty-year period with two sub-periods, the first between 1975 and 1989 and the second between 1990 and 2004, an increase of thirteenCategory4 or 5 storms was observed from the first sub-period.|$|E
5|$|On {{the facts}} of Lines International, the judge held that the policy {{satisfied}} all four conditions and that {{the adoption of the}} guidelines was valid. On the fourth consideration relating to fettering of discretion, the judge found that the PSA and STPB had not rigidly enforced the guidelines as they had made it clear at the meeting attended by the plaintiff that they would consider representations from cruise operators, and, in fact, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> concessions were made. Hence, the guidelines had been flexibly applied and the PSA had not fettered its discretion by rigidly adhering to a policy. The Lines International conditions were approved by the Court of Appeal in JD Ltd. v. Comptroller of Income Tax (2005).|$|E
5|$|Stone keep {{construction}} required skilled craftsmen. Unlike {{timber and}} earthworks, {{which could be}} built using unfree labour or serfs, these craftsmen had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect, due to {{the limitations of the}} lime mortar used during the period – a keep's walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred had been built by 1216.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} a region depends {{on a number of}} factors, {{especially}} latitude. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} is generally rural, with no towns approaching {{the size of}} Hull. There are a few market towns such as Beverley, Driffield, Goole, Market Weighton and Pocklington, and the coastal towns of Bridlington, Hornsea and Withernsea. In the south the district contains areas such as Hessle which {{are part of the}} Hull urban area but outside the city boundaries. Rural areas tend to have a greater business stock than urban areas, reflecting the number of agricultural businesses and small businesses in rural areas. 20% of all VAT registered businesses in the East Riding are in agriculture and related sectors, although the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> businesses fell by 40% between 1997 and 2003.|$|E

5|$|When {{speakers}} of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge {{to become more}} similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this {{may lead to the}} formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> language areas have been documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.|$|E
5|$|While {{working as}} photojournalists, the Joneses {{continued}} to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain, and in 1956 they began {{working as a}} freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works. At the time the Ministry {{was responsible for the}} upkeep of Ancient Monuments and, by extension, the large volume of rescue archaeology required to document archaeological sites before they were destroyed by the postwar construction boom. A small workforce of itinerant archaeologists were employed to excavate these sites in advance of development. Between 1956 and 1965, Margaret Jones directed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> excavations in Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (including Old Sleaford).|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, spiders' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae. Pedipalps carry a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne smells, such as female pheromones. Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors {{are more important than}} the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E
5|$|Because Ariel, like Uranus, orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side {{relative}} to its rotation, its northern and southern hemispheres face either directly towards or directly away from the Sun at the solstices. This means it is subject to an extreme seasonal cycle; just as Earth's poles see permanent night or daylight around the solstices, so Ariel's poles see permanent night or daylight for half a Uranian year (42 Earth years), with the Sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the 1986 southern summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was dark. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>such</b> events occurred in 2007–2008, including an occultation of Ariel by Umbriel on 19 August 2007.|$|E
5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's {{equatorial}} plane, they (including Titania) {{are subject to}} an extreme seasonal cycle.
