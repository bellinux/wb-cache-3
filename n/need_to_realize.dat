Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women's lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with [...] "ethical sensibility", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, [...] "To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision {{as she tries to}} reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{understand}} why Quirey says [...] "The {{advent of the}} Waltz in polite society was quite simply the greatest change in dance form and dancing manners {{that has happened in}} our history" [...] we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that all European social dances before the waltz were communal sequence dances. Communal, because all the dancers on the floor took part in a pre-set pattern (often chosen by a Master of Ceremony). Dancers separately, and as couples, faced outwards to the spectators as much as they faced inwards. Thus all present took part as dancers or as onlookers. This was the way with the country dance and all previous popular dances. With the waltz, couples were independent of each other, and were turned towards each other (though not in close contact). Lord Byron wrote a furious letter, which precedes his poem The Waltz, in which he decries the anti-social nature of the dance, with the couple [...] "like two cockchafers spitted on the same bodkin." ...|$|E
