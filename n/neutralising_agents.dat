40|$|The {{present study}} aims for the {{possibilities}} to use industrial oxidic by-products as <b>neutralising</b> <b>agent</b> in biooxidation. <b>Neutralising</b> <b>agent</b> is required to neutralise the acid produced during the biooxidation. Possibilities to replace conventionally used limestone with by-products based on their neutralising capacities and possible harmful effects were investigated. Ten different by-products were used with reference to slaked lime. Batch bioleaching of a pyrite concentrate were conducted in 1 -L reactor using mesophilic microorganisms at 35 º C. The by-products used were different types of steel slags, ashes, dust and mesalime. The neutralising capacities of the by-products were determined {{by the amount of}} by-products needed for neutralisation during biooxidation. The amount of steel slags, EAF dust, Mesalime and Bioash needed for neutralisation ranged from 16 - 37 g, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash needed 81 g and 57 g, respectively, while the slaked lime reference needed 22 g. The experiment with Waste ash gave the lowest pyrite oxidation of 59 %, while the other by-products had similar or better pyrite oxidation compared to slaked lime, ranging from 69 - 80 %. Fluoride, chromium and vanadium were potentially toxic elements present in some of the by-products, but had no negative impact on the bacterial activity. A chloride concentration of 11 %, eventually together with other potentially toxic elements, in the Waste ash caused a negative effect, observed by low redox potential and pyrite oxidation. Stainless steel slags should be avoided for environmental reasons due to the presence of chromium. High content of zinc in EAF dust would enrich the zinc tenor, if used as <b>neutralising</b> <b>agent</b> in bioleaching of zinc sulphides, but chloride should be removed before its use. Replacement of limestone with by-products in biooxidation processes could save operating costs without negative impact on the biooxidation efficiency and conserve virgin limestone deposits.

40|$|Zincor's average zinc {{recovery}} was 90. 29 % (for {{the period of}} 1 January 2009 to 30 September 2011), which was well below the industry standard of 96 %. Due to limitations in Zincor's iron removal technology, the maximum achievable recovery was 94 %. The zinc loss through the iron residue was the second biggest contributor to the overall zinc losses, {{so that there was}} much room for improvement. The calcine used for neutralisation in the Iron Removal Stage contained a portion of insoluble zinc ferrite. The insoluble zinc loss through the iron residue was associated with the presence of the insoluble zinc ferrite, as well as the phenomenon of coating of unleached neutralising agent by iron precipitate. The soluble zinc loss was a function of the dewatering characteristics of the precipitate. The work included the evaluation of alternative <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> to supplement or replace calcine, as well as the implementation of a seed recycle. A review of literature found that the use of an alternative neutralising agent that contained little or no zinc could potentially reduce the insoluble portion of the zinc loss. Secondly, the presence of seed could potentially reduce both the soluble and insoluble zinc losses by promoting agglomeration growth and providing additional surface area for precipitation to occur (thereby reducing coating of zinc-rich <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents).</b> The laboratory work evaluated a number of alternative <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents,</b> but focused on the use of DRC oxide and limestone for neutralisation.

40|$|Abstract: Studies were {{conducted}} to investigate the possibilities to use combustion ashes, electric arc furnace (EAF) dust and lime sludge as neutralising agent with reference to a commercial grade slaked lime. To maintain optimum pH during biooxidation of pyrite the acid produced has to be neutralised. Batch bioleaching was performed on a pyrite concentrate in 1 -L reactors, using a mixed mesophilic culture at a temperature of 35 ºC. <b>Neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> were added regularly to ad-just pH to the desired level of 1. 5. The ashes used were Bioash, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash, representing ashes gen-erated from combustion of biomass, a mixture of wood chips and municipal waste, and a mixture of coal and tyres. The dust used was an EAF dust produced in a scrap-based steel plant, while the sludge used was Mesalime produced in a pa-per and pulp plant. The study aimed to investigate the possibility to replace the conventionally used lime or limestone with by-products, based on their neutralising capacity and to observe eventual toxic effects on the bacterial activity. The bioleaching effi-ciency was similar for all the <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> used except Waste ash, when compared with slaked lime.

40|$|The {{neutralisation}} cost in bioleaching {{operations is}} one of the biggest operation costs and therefore the aim of the present study has been to replace the generally used lime/limestone with industrial oxidic by-products. A comparative study on the potential use of some selected industrial by-products as <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> during biooxidation and their influence on subsequent gold recovery was carried out with reference to a commercial grade Ca(OH) 2. The by-products used comprised of an electric arc furnace slag (EAF slag), and a slag from ladle refining (Ladle slag) both from scrap based steel production, an EAF dust and a lime sludge from paper and pulp industry (Mesa lime). Continuous biooxidation of a refractory gold concentrate was performed in single stage reactor at a retention time of 56 h with a mixed mesophilic culture. Biooxidation results as well as gold recoveries were good for all by-products investigated and similar to the results obtained with the slaked lime reference. However, cyanide consumption was elevated in the experiments with steel slags and the EAF dust partly because of a higher content of S° in the bioresidues in these experiments. It is however expected, that in a bioleaching operation with several reactors in series, that sulphur oxidation would be more complete, thereby possibly decreasing cyanide consumption.

40|$|Abstract Background Lupus {{anticoagulants}} prolong clotting {{times in}} phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests. Lupus Ratio assays are integrated tests for lupus anticoagulants {{that may be}} based on APTT, RVVT or dPT clotting times. If a patient is being treated with unfractionated heparin, however, the heparin prolong clotting times and the diagnosis of lupus anticoagulant is invalidated. Commercial assays may have heparin <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> added to their reagents. However, the type and efficacy of the heparin neutralisation is often not documented. We wanted to test the influence and efficacy of heparin neutralisers in the Lupus Ratio assay. Methods Several heparin neutralisers were tested, and polybrene was chosen for further testing. Unfractionated heparin and/or polybrene were added to normal plasma and to plasma from patients with or without lupus anticoagulant and clotting times compared {{before and after the}} additions. Lupus anticoagulant-positive patients were given 5000 IU i. v. of unfractionated heparin and plasma was collected just before and five minutes after the injection. Lupus Ratios were calculated after polybrene was added to the postinjection samples. Results The Lupus Ratio became slightly lower when polybrene was added to plasma without heparin. Plasma heparinised in vitro and plasma from patients that had received heparin, both had Lupus Ratios nearly identical to the Lupus Ratios calculated before any additions. Conclusion By addition of polybrene to a final concentration of 7. 9 μg/ml in test plasma, Lupus Ratio may be determined in lupus anticoagulant-negative as well as positive plasmas irrespective of the presence of heparin 0. 0 – 1. 3 U/ml. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{basis for}} this {{research}} project was that copper is lost in the Leaching Plant of the Nyrstar Budel zinc smelter. In {{the section of the}} Leaching Plant copper is lost, iron and aluminium are precipitated. Sampling of this process showed that the removal of copper from the solution is a function of pH and is mainly linked to the removal of aluminium. Tests with process fluids at stable pH levels showed that ferric ion and aluminium are mainly removed as jarosites at pH = 2 and pH = 2, 5. Copper is also removed at those pH values and is thus precipitated in jarosite form. This is the actual loss of copper. At pH = 3 and 3, 5 more aluminium was removed, but now also in the form of aluminium hydroxides. It was found that copper is adsorbed onto these hydroxides and hence more copper is removed from the solution. At these pH values also jarosites are formed which permanently remove copper, but it is assumed that the adsorption onto aluminium hydroxides prevails. The result of the adsorption of copper onto these hydroxides is that it eventually returns to the FeP in which it has another chance to get lost to jarosites. Hence the only way to prevent copper from being lost is to prevent copper from reaching the FeP. One way to prevent copper from reaching the FeP is not using calcine to neutralise the acid from the SiHALO, but with alternative <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> which do not contain copper. Another way is to prevent copper from leaving the SiHAL. Copper cementation is a method which can totally remove the copper dissolved in the SiHALO.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study on bioleaching of a pyrite concentrate using ten different industrial oxidic by-products as <b>neutralising</b> <b>agent</b> has been performed with a commercial grade slaked lime chemical serving as reference material. The acid produced during oxidation of pyrite was neutralised by regular additions of <b>neutralising</b> <b>agent</b> whenever {{needed to maintain}} a pH of 1. 5. Bioleaching was conducted as batch experiments in 1 -L scale reactors, with a mixed mesophilic culture at a temperature of 35 º C. The different industrial oxidic by-products used were steel slag, ashes, dust and lime sludge. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the possibility to replace normally used lime or limestone with oxidic by-products, considering their neutralising capacities and possible negative impact on the bacterial activity. The bioleaching efficiency was found to be equally good or better, when by-products were used for neutralisation instead of slaked lime, and the bioleaching yields of pyrite were in the range 69 - 80 %, except the Waste ash, which had a leaching yield of 59 %. Some of the by-products used contained potentially toxic elements for the bacteria, like fluoride, chromium and vanadium, but no negative effect of these elements could be observed on the bacterial activity. The Waste ash contained a large number potentially toxic elements and a high chloride concentration of 11 %, which had a negative effect as observed on the lower redox potential and leaching yield. Slags originating from stainless steel production should be avoided for environmental reasons, due to the presence of chromium. The electric arc furnace (EAF) dust has a good potential to be used as <b>neutralising</b> <b>agent</b> in bioleaching processes for zinc recovery from zinc sulphides, due to the high content of zinc, however the chlorides present should be removed prior to its use. The neutralising capacity, as determined by the amount needed for neutralisation during bioleaching, were rather high for all the steel slags, EAF dust, Bioash and Mesalime with a range of 16 - 37 g as compared with 22 g needed for slaked lime. However, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash had lower neutralising capacities with 81 g and 57 g needed, respectively. Hence, it is concluded that considerable savings in operational costs can be obtained by replacement of lime or limestone with steel slag, ash, dust or sludge without negative impact on bioleaching efficiency. Use of industrial oxidic by-products would provide opportunities to recycle elements present in them as for example zinc rendering an eco-friendly process and a means for sustainable use of natural resources.

40|$|The {{prospects}} of peak oil, {{climate change and}} the dependency of fossil carbon have urged {{research and development of}} production methods for the manufacture of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources (biomass). To date, the primary emphasis has been placed on the replacement of oil for transportation fuels. A highly significant subset of petroleum usage is the production of chemicals, which represents 10 - 15 % of the petroleum usage. White biotechnology, also called industrial biotechnology, is a fast evolving technology with a large potential to have a substantial impact on the industrial production of fuels and chemicals from biomass. This work addresses the issue of chemical production by investigating the production of bio-based succinic acid, which {{can be used in a}} wide range of applications to replace petroleum based chemicals. Succinic acid can be produced by fermentation of sugar by a number of organisms; one is Escherichia coli (E. coli). It is known that E. coli under anaerobic conditions produces a mixture of organic acids. In order to obtain a cost-effective production it is necessary to metabolically engineer the organism to produce succinic acid in greater yield than the other acids. In the current work, E. coli mutant AFP 184 was used. AFP 184 originates from a near wild type strain, the C 600 (ATCC 23724), which can ferment both five and six carbon sugars and has mutations in the glucose specific phosphotransferase system (ptsG), the pyruvate formate lyase system (pfl) and in the fermentative lactate dehydrogenase system (ldh). The previous studies using different organisms have all used cultivation mediums supplemented to some degree with different nutrients like biotin, thiamine and yeast extract. In order to apply the technology to large scale, production must be cost-effective and it is important to minimise the use of additional supplements. The first part of this work aimed to investigate the fermentation characteristics of AFP 184 in a medium consisting of corn steep liquor, inorganic salts and different sugar sources without supplementation of other additional nutrients. It addresses questions regarding the effect of different sugars on succinic acid kinetics and yields in an industrially relevant medium. In order to gain a sustainable production of succinic acid from biomass feedstocks (sugar from biomass) it is important to investigate how well the organism can utilise different sugars in the biomass. The sugars studied were sucrose, glucose, fructose, xylose and equal mixtures of glucose-fructose and glucose-xylose at a total initial sugar concentration of 100 g L- 1. AFP 184 was able to utilise all sugars and sugar combinations except sucrose for biomass generation and succinate production. Using glucose resulted in the highest yield, 0. 83 (g succinic acid per g sugar consumed anaerobically). Fructose resulted in a yield of 0. 66 and xylose of 0. 5. Using a high initial sugar concentration made it possible to obtain volumetric productivities of almost 3 g L- 1 h- 1, which is above estimated values for feasible economic production. Succinic acid production ceased at final concentrations greater than 40 g L- 1. In order to further increase succinic acid concentrations, this inhibitory effect was studied in the second part of the present work. The inhibitory effects can be two-fold including pH-based inhibition and an anion specific effect on metabolism. It has been reported that high concentrations of ammonia inhibit E. coli growth and damage cell membranes. In order to limit toxic and inhibitory effects different <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> were tested. First the use of NH 4 OH was optimised with respect to fermentation pH and it was found that the best results were obtained at pH 6. 5 - 6. 7. Optimal pH was then used with NaOH, KOH, and Na 2 CO 3 as <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> and it was shown that NaOH, KOH, and Na 2 CO 3 neutralised fermentations could reach succinic acid concentrations of 69 and 61 and 78 g L- 1 respectively without any significant decrease in succinic acid productivity. It was observed that cells lost viability during the cause anaerobic phase. It resulted in decreasing succinic acid productivities. It is believed that the viability decrease is a combined effect of organic acids concentration and the osmolarity of the medium. The work done in this thesis is aimed towards increasing the economical feasibility of a biochemical succinic acid production. Godkänd; 2007; 20070305 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Aqueous polyuethane (PU) colloids, like many other water-borne polymer colloids, have become an increasingly important class of materials in the surface coating industry. Three processing stages, the pre-dispersion, dispersion and postdispersion stages, are generally involved {{in the production of}} aqueous PU colloids. However, existing researches have neglected the importance of the dispersion stage. The present study aims to develop better understanding of the dispersion stage during the production of aqueous PU colloids. Non chain-extendable PU pre-polymer (PUp) is used to enable independent study of the dispersion stage and the phase inversion process is chosen due to its widespread industrial usage. Valid drop size characterisation techniques and phase inversion detection methods have been developed in this project. Three different dispersion regions have also been identified by changing the ionic group content of PUp. Each dispersion region is associated with a particular dispersion type. Those are (I) Stable aqueous emulsions that contain small PUp-in-water drops. They were produced using PUp with more than 0. 2 mmole/g of ionic groups. (2) Aqueous PUp colloids with 0. 05 0. 2 mmole/g of ionic groups. These emulsions contain a mixture of drop structures, including simple drops and different multiple drops. (3) Aqueous PUp dispersions containing less than 0. 05 mmole/g of ionic groups. These dispersions are not stable and the resultant dispersions separated when agitation was stopped. Modified phase inversion maps are introduced to represent the occurrence of all three dispersion regions. The modified phase inversion maps are partly analogous to those of conventional non-ionic-surfactant-water (nSOW) systems. The three dispersion regions have also been "reproduced" successfully using external surfactants as substitutes for the internal stabilising groups. A new catastrophic phase inversion mechanism is proposed to explain the existence of all three dispersion regions. Other variables studied during this project include different <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents.</b> different amount of carboxylic acid groups, operating temperatures and material addition rates. In conclusion, this project shows that the phase inversion process is a feasible route for producing aqueous polymer dispersions with little or no added external surfactants. Stable PUp-W dispersions can also be produced below the minimum ionic group content reported in existing literatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} cost of {{effluent treatment}} in the wool scouring industry is rapidly becoming a determining factor in the viability of existing scouring operations and new installations alike. This thesis details {{the development of an}} integrated effluent treatment process capable of treating the worst polluted effluent from a wool scour "heavy flow-down", {{to the point where it}} can either be economically discharged to local trade waste sewer, or directly discharged to river or ocean outfall with minimal environmental impact. The existing proprietary chemical flocculation process, Sirolan CF™, was improved by the addition of a bio-flocculation stage and turbidity monitoring and control, and the product from this process fed to an aerobic biological treatment system based upon the traditional activated sludge process. The biological treatment process was found to remove up to 98 % of the BOD 5 loading from the pre-treated liquor with a hydraulic residence time of at least 50 hours being required in the aerobic digestion vessels. A residual biorefractory COD of approximately 3, 600 mg/L was identified which could not be removed by biological treatment. When operating continuously, the biological process was observed to metabolically neutralise the pH 3. 0 - 4. 5 feed from the chemical flocculation system to pH > 7. 0 without the need for supplemental addition of <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> such as sodium hydroxide. This in itself provides a significant economic incentive for implementation of the process. Kinetic analysis of the biological process carried out under controlled laboratory conditions using a Bioflo 3000 continuous fermentor showed that the bio-chemical process followed substrate inhibition kinetics. An appropriate kinetic model was identified to represent the behaviour of the substrate degradation system, and modified by inclusion of a pseudo toxic concentration to account for the effect of pH inhibition upon the biological growth rate. The process was verified both at pilot plant scale and at demonstration plant scale at an operational wool scour. The demonstration plant was of sufficient size to handle the full heavy effluent flow-down from a small wool scour. At the time of publishing three full-scale effluent treatment systems based on this research had been sold to both domestic and international clients of ADM Group Ltd. who funded the research...|$|E

40|$|Premixes for {{medicated}} feedstuffs {{are considered}} to be veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) prepared in advance with a view to the subsequent manufacture of medicated feedstuffs. Medicated feedstuffs should be prepared only from market authorized premixes and premixes for medicated feedstuffs can be used only as prescribed medicines. Apart from active substances, premixes contain carriers which have a role in the homogenization of medicated feedstuffs. Wheat bran as a carrier may be a source of different, potentially harmful or toxic substances e. g. afl atoxin. In our study, 15 different batches of premixes with a wheat bran component were tested for afl atoxin B 1 (AFB 1) by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The samples tested showed contamination with AFB 1 ranging from 1. 5 to 35 ng/g (mean = 18. 79 ng/g). However, no correlation between AFB 1 levels and the month of collection or season of production was observed. Considering the composition of the premix, the only possible source of contamination with AFB 1 was wheat bran. Contamination probably occurred before the production of the premix, probably in the fi eld or during storage. Concentrations of active substances and citric acid (a <b>neutralising</b> <b>agent</b> for mycotoxins) were in accordance with the producer’s declaration.

40|$|When a {{hazardous}} chemical agent has soaked into a porous medium, such as concrete, {{it can be difficult}} to neutralise. One removal method is chemical decontamination, where a cleanser is applied to react with and <b>neutralise</b> the <b>agent,</b> forming less harmful reaction products. There are often several cleansers that could be used to <b>neutralise</b> the same <b>agent,</b> so it is important to identify the cleanser features associated with fast and effective decontamination. As many cleansers are aqueous solutions while many agents are immiscible with water, the decontamination reaction often takes place at the interface between two phases. In this paper, we develop and analyse a mathematical model of a decontamination reaction between a neat agent and an immiscible cleanser solution. We assume that the reaction product is soluble in both the cleanser phase and the agent phase. At the moving boundary between the two phases, we obtain coupling conditions from mass conservation arguments and the oil–water partition coefficient of the product. We analyse our model using both asymptotic and numerical methods, and investigate how different features of a cleanser affect the time taken to remove the agent. Our results reveal the existence of two regimes characterised by different rate-limiting transport processes, and we identify the key parameters that control the removal time in each regime. In particular, we find that the oil–water partition coefficient of the reaction product is significantly more important in determining the removal time than the effective reaction rate...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} sulfide oxidation in 4 {{physically and}} mineralogically diverse acid sulfate soil (ASS) materials collected from coastal floodplain sites in north-eastern New South Wales. The {{aim of this}} study is to gain further understanding of the process of sulfide oxidation in ASS materials, which will allow improved and more effective management strategies to be applied to these materials. The process of sulfide oxidation was examined using laboratory incubation experiments. The oxidation of pyrite was the primary cause of initial acidification of the ASS materials studied. Although the acid volatile sulfur fraction increased in concentration by an order of magnitude over the initial 8 days of incubation, the subsequent oxidation of this fraction did not result in substantial acidification. Sulfate (SO 42 -) was the dominant sulfur species produced from sulfide oxidation, however, water-soluble SO 42 - was a poor indicator of the extent of sulfide oxidation. The sulfoxyanion intermediates thiosulfate (S 2 O 32 -) and tetrathionate(S 4 O 62 -) were only detected in the early stages of incubation, and their relative abundance appeared to be pH dependent. The diminishing presence of these 2 sulfur species as oxidation progressed was indicative that ferric iron (Fe 3 +) and bacterial catalysis were driving the oxidation processes. The rate of sulfide oxidation, and consequent rate of acidification, was highly dependent on the soil pH and oxygen availability. Accelerated sulfide oxidation was only observed at low pH (i. e. pH 3 ̆c 4. 0) when oxygen availability was not limited. The application of sub-optimal amounts of <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> prevented severe soil acidification in the short-term (i. e. up to 2 months), but had little effect on decreasing the rate of sulfide oxidation and acidification in the long-term. Sub-optimal amounts of CaCO 3 accelerated sulfide oxidation and acidification of the peaty marcasitic ASS material resulting in elevated soluble Fe and Al concentrations. For some of the ASS materials, sub-optimal applications of seawater-neutralised bauxite refinery residue (SNBRR) also resulted in elevated soluble Al concentrations. The response of partially-oxidised ASS materials to the exclusion of oxygen was variable. The rate of sulfide oxidation, acidification and the production of soluble oxidation products generally decreased markedly when subjected to anoxia. However, especially in highly acidic ASS materials (i. e. pH 3 ̆c 3. 5), sulfide oxidation and acidification generally occurred (albeit at much slower rates), most probably due to oxidation by Fe 3 +. Rapid sulfide re-formation occurred in the peat ASS material that had been oxidised for 63 days, with 0. 47...|$|E
40|$|The {{prospects}} of peak oil, {{climate change and}} the dependency of fossil carbon have urged {{research and development of}} production methods for the manufacture of fuels and chemicals from renewable resources (biomass). The present thesis illustrates different aspects of biobased succinic acid production by a metabolically engineered E. coli strain. The main areas of the thesis are sugar utilisation and feedstock flexibility, and fermentation inhibition, both due to toxic compound derived from the raw material and the fermentation products themselves. The first part of this thesis aimed to investigate the fermentation characteristics of AFP 184 in a medium consisting of corn steep liquor, inorganic salts and different sugar sources without supplementation with high-cost nutrients such as yeast extract and peptone. The effects of different sugars, sucrose, glucose, fructose, xylose, equal mixtures of glucose-fructose and glucose-xylose, on succinic acid production kinetics and yields in an industrially relevant medium were investigated. AFP 184 was able to utilise all sugars and sugar combinations except sucrose for biomass generation and succinate production. Using glucose resulted in the highest yield, 0. 83 (g succinic acid per g sugar consumed anaerobically). Using a high initial sugar concentration resulted in volumetric productivities of almost 3 g L- 1 h- 1, which is above estimated values for economically feasible production. However, succinic acid production ceased at final concentrations greater than 40 g L- 1. To further increase succinic acid concentrations, fermentations using NH 4 OH, NaOH, KOH, K 2 CO 3, and Na 2 CO 3 as <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> were performed and compared. It was shown that substantial improvements could be made by using alkali bases to neutralise the fermentations. The highest concentrations and productivities were achieved when Na 2 CO 3 was used, 77 g L- 1 and 3 g L- 1 h- 1 respectively. A gradual decrease in succinate productivity was observed during the fermentations, which was shown to be due to succinate accumulation in the broth and not {{as a result of the}} addition of neutralising agent or the subsequent increase in osmolarity. To maintain high succinate productivity by keeping a low extracellular succinic acid concentration fermentations were interrupted and cells recovered and resuspended in fresh media. By removing the succinate it was possible to maintain high succinic acid productivity for a prolonged time. Cells subjected to high concentrations of succinate were also able to regain high productivity once transferred into a succinate-free medium. In the last part of the thesis succinic acid production from softwood dilute acid hydrolysates was demonstrated. This study involved establishing the degree of detoxification necessary for growth and fermentation using industrial hydrolysates. Detoxification by treatment with lime and/or activated carbon was investigated and the results show that it was possible to produce succinate from softwood hydrolysates in yields comparable to those for synthetic sugars. The work done in this thesis increases the understanding of succinic acid production with AFP 184, illustrate its limitations, and suggests improvements in the current technology with the long term aim of increasing the economical feasibility of biochemical succinic acid production.

40|$|Sustainable use {{of forest}} and {{agricultural}} resources will {{play an important}} role for solving urgent global challenges such as the enhanced green house effect and increasing demand for fossil fuels. The development of processes where lignocellulosic biomass can be refined to several different end-products in the same plant, i. e. a biorefinary, will be important in the development towards a more sustainable society where fossil fuels are replaced. To be able to compete with fossil resources, an efficient production of biomass based products is required in order to maximize overall process economics and to minimize negative environmental impact. One solution to increase profitability for forest biomass based plants can be production of value added derivatives produced through fermentation of sugars from hemicelluloses, extracted from lignocellulosic material. The first part of this thesis investigate the impact of hemicellulose pre-extraction on birch Kraft pulp properties. White liquor and water extractions of hemicelluloses from birch wood chips were performed under conditions compatible with Kraft pulping. The chips from select extractions were subject to subsequent Kraft pulping and the refined pulps were made into hand sheets. Several metrics for hand sheet strength properties were compared with a reference pulp made without an extraction step. This work also includes a demonstration of enzymatic hydrolysis and biological conversion of extracted xylan to succinic acid, a metabolite with the potential of a platform chemical. The study demonstrated that white liquor can be utilized to extract xylan from birch wood chips prior to Kraft cooking without decreasing the pulp yield and paper strength properties, while simultaneously impregnating cooking alkali into the wood chips. Alkaline conditions tested above pH 10 significantly degraded xylan and very low concentrations of xylose were obtained using any of the alkaline extractions. Water extractions resulted in the highest final concentration of xylose, 29. 1 g/L; yielding fermentable liquor, but were found to negatively impact some pulp properties including decreases in compression strength, bursting strength, tensile strength and tensile stiffness while exhibiting minimal impact on elongation and slight improvement in tearing strength index. Since hot water extractions gave fermentable liquors, the next study was to integrate the production of green chemicals via hot water hemicellulose extraction of birch wood into a small-scale combined heat and power plant, in this case an externally fired gas turbine. The results show that the extracted wood chips would serve very well as a fuel for combustion and gasification processes due to the relatively high heating value. Most important, the extracted wood chips had low ash content and significantly lower concentrations of alkali metals. In addition a fermentable stream with a xylose concentration of 65 g/L was produced. The second part of this thesis was to optimise the production of the dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, which can be produced via bioconversion as a renewable building block molecule for production of biodegradable solvents and polyesters. In this study the E. coli strain AFP 184, which can ferment both five and six carbon sugars with a limited production of other organic acids was used. Earlier work using a high initial sugar concentration resulted in volumetric productivities of almost 3 g/L h, which is above estimated values for economically feasible production, and final succinic acid concentration was around 40 g/L. To further increase succinic acid concentrations, fermentations using NH 4 OH, NaOH, KOH, K 2 CO 3, and Na 2 CO 3 as <b>neutralising</b> <b>agents</b> were performed and compared. It was shown that substantial improvements could be made by using alkali bases to neutralise the fermentations. The highest concentrations and productivities were achieved when Na 2 CO 3 was used, 77 g/L and 3 g/L h, respectively. A gradual decrease in succinate productivity was observed during the fermentations, which was shown to be due to succinate accumulation in the broth and not {{as a result of the}} addition of neutralising agent or the subsequent increase in osmolarity.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{acid rock drainage}} (ARD) places extraordinary financial burdens on governments and companies worldwide, and an improved efficiency in treatment by as little as 1 % can save many {{millions of dollars in}} rehabilitation. We investigated a system for treating Fe-rich ARD using a three-stage reactor design. In the first reaction cell, Fe-rich ARD was partially neutralised using rapid periodic carbonate resuspension with a rotating axial mixer. This was followed by an air-sparged oxidation chamber and then a second reaction cell, with more carbonate periodically resuspended until a pH of 6. 3 was reached, which was followed by a settlement chamber. This reactor design has a high capacity for neutralisation, with an efficiency of ≈ 70 % of acidity neutralised by the acid neutralising capacity (g of CaCO 3 equivalent) added to the reactor. Axial mixers were tested because of their low-energy requirements and their high reliability. The intermediate chamber effectively removes Fe by oxidising Fe(II) to Fe(III). Given the amount of acidity neutralised, the sludge volume produced was low compared to other technologies, providing further potential savings in sludge handling. Waste carbonate rock proved to be an effective <b>neutralising</b> <b>agent,</b> even though it was about 60 % dolomite and 40 % magnesite, with minor calcite, {{and despite the fact that}} magnesite has substantially slower dissolution kinetics compared to the more dominant dolomite. The mixed waste carbonates were capable of raising the pH sufficiently to reduce the heavy metal loadings in Fe-rich ARD by more than two orders of magnitude. The final settlement stage of the process was shown to be essential for metal precipitation, for the carry-over of fine carbonates, and CO 2 loss. This was associated with a rise in pH, from 6. 3 to 7. 5. In addition, residual slow-reacting magnesite from the mixed carbonate remains in the sludge from the first reactor and provides acid buffering capacity within the sludge, which is commonly lacking in the ARD neutralisation sludge of other systems...|$|R
