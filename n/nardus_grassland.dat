500|$|Recent place-name {{studies have}} {{accepted}} the [...] "yellow moorland" [...] derivation, but have struggled to understand how Helvellyn {{can be regarded as}} a yellow mountain. Colour, in the Celtic languages, is perceived differently from the way it is seen and described in modern English. For example, in Scottish Gaelic the spectrum of colours was [...] "pastel rather than primary, gentle rather than bold." [...] Colours were related to a landscape context in which blues, greens, greys and whites in particular were both more diverse and more differentiated than in English. People who relied on the system of transhumance for their livelihood gained the ability to assess the nutritional value of upland grasses from a distance before moving their stock to a summer shieling, and used appropriate colour terms for grasses which would become progressively more green as the spring advanced. Yellow, at least in Gaelic hill names, is not a bright colour. It describes hills which are distinguished by grasses such as Nardus stricta and Deschampsia flexuosa, both of which appear pale and bleached in winter. These grasses are common on the Helvellyn range, in an area where transhumance also used to be practiced. Nardus stricta in particular is an unpalatable and unproductive grass, and the Flora of Cumbria specifically notes a possible connection between areas of late snow cover and <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland</b> at high altitudes in the Helvellyn range. A name describing the mountain as [...] "pale yellow moorland" [...] is therefore meaningful in a Celtic context.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Successful {{establishment}} of species-rich Nardus grasslands on ex-agricultural land requires identification and removal of barriers to effective seed germination and seedling survival. Therefore, we investigate how germination and early development {{are affected by}} soil conditions from different restoration phases and how this relates to their specific plant strategies. Location: Grasslands and experiments in northern Belgium. Methods: We selected three grassland restoration phases (Lolium perenne grasslands, grass–herb mix grasslands and species-rich Nardus grasslands), which were characterized by a distinct plant community and soils with contrasting abiotic and biotic properties (respectively, eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic soils). In a first germination experiment we investigated the species-specific responses (germination, lag time and emergence rate) of 70 grassland species (that typically occur along the restoration gradient) {{in each of the}} selected soils. Second, a mesocosm experiment was set-up in which a mixture of 19 species (representative of the distinct grassland restoration phases) was grown together in the respective soils. Here, we analysed the intraspecific variation of plant growth, SLA and identified changes in community assembly. Results: Irrespective of soil influences, <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland</b> species had significantly lower germination potentials and longer germination lag times than L. perenne grassland species. Germination (and its lag time) of grass–herb mix grassland species were negatively affected by the oligotrophic soils. Soil factors determined early growth patterns during the emergence and establishment phase. L. perenne grassland species exhibited a more plastic growth response and were highly dependent on soil type. <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland</b> species exhibited large intraspecific variation in SLA, which was found to be significantly lower in the oligotrophic soils. Even though the difference in bio-available P between mesotrophic and oligotrophic soils was minor, <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland</b> species were only able to compete in the oligotrophic soils (no significant difference in biomass between communities). Mesotrophic mesocosms exhibited the highest species richness after 200 d of growth. Conclusion: Plant species from the three grassland restoration phases display distinct germination strategies, irrespective of soil type. Interactions between growth strategies and soil factors determine competitive asymmetry and therefore shape community assembly in the distinct grassland phases. </p...|$|E
40|$|Past {{intensive}} {{land use}} complicates the successful restoration of oligotrophic species-rich grassland types. One {{of the major}} bottlenecks are the elevated nutrient levels due to fertilization, especially residual phosphorus (P). Aiming to deplete nutrients, managers often reintroduce traditional haymaking management, sometimes combined with grazing. Here, we evaluate whether this technique restores the abiotic and biotic boundary conditions for restoration of <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland.</b> Seven grasslands were selected in Flanders, Belgium, which had elevated nutrient levels after the cessation of intensive agriculture 16 to 24 years ago, and which have been mown and grazed since. We compared soil and vegetation data of these post-fertilization grasslands with 34 well-developed oligotrophic Nardus grasslands. Mowing and grazing did not cause community composition to resemble that of <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland.</b> Furthermore, bioavailable P-concentrations were significantly higher in the post-fertilization grasslands and P-limitation was not obtained. Restoring P-poor soil conditions through continued mowing and grazing management would take at least decades. Phosphorus-mining can shorten the restoration time by increased P-removal. Given our results, we propose a decision framework to aid planners and managers in their choice of interventions. Cost-effective efforts for restoration should be well-prepared including measurements of important initial soil characteristics. This allows for an evaluation of “distance to target” and the selection of an effective restoration technique. These techniques may involve cutting with mowing tradition and utilizing P-mining or topsoil removal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Floristic {{composition}} {{and environmental factors}} vary widely among plant communities in the alpine belt. Thus far no study has attempted to measure all relevant site conditions in {{a larger number of}} alpine communities. Here we show (1) which environ-mental factors were highly correlated with the floristic composition of the 14 plant com-munities investigated in the Swiss Alps and (2) which plant communities have similar environmental affinities. In every plant community investigated, the main factors poten-tially having an impact on plant life were measured and the floristic composition was defined. We used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to determine linkage between plant communities and complex environmental gradients. The first axis of the NMDS corresponds to a climate gradient (temperature/wind speed), and the second axis corresponds to a soil gradient (soil suction/pH/Ca content). With the exception of the <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland</b> and Carex curvula turf, plant communities belonging to the same phy-tosociological class are exposed to very similar combinations of environmental factors. Our study shows that the variation between phytosociological classes is much larger than within classes. Still, the variation of environmental factors within individual classes leads to a further differentiation of the floristic composition. Thus, our study reinforces the valid-ity of the phytosociological classification.

40|$|To restore species-rich {{terrestrial}} ecosystems on ex-agricultural land, establishing nutrient limitation for dominant {{plant growth}} is essential, because in nutrient-rich soils, fast-growing species often exclude target species. However N-limitation {{is easier to}} achieve than P-limitation (because of a difference in biogeochemical behavior), biodiversity is generally highest under P-limitation. Commonly-used restoration methods to achieve low soil P-concentrations are either very expensive or take a very long time. A promising restoration technique is P-mining, an adjusted agricultural technique that aims at depleting soil-P. High biomass production and hence high P-removal with biomass is obtained by fertilizing with nutrients other than P. A pot experiment {{was set up to}} study P-mining with Lolium perenne L. on sandy soils with varying P-concentrations: from an intensively-used agricultural soil to a soil near the soil P-target for species-rich <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland.</b> All pots received N- and K-fertilization. The effects of biostimulants on P-uptake were also assessed by the addition of arbuscular mycorrhiza (Glomus spp.), humic substances or phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas spp.). In our P-rich soil (111 μg POlsen/g), P-removal rate was high but bioavailable soil-P did not decrease. At lower soil P-concentrations (64 and 36 μg POlsen/g), bioavailable soil-P had decreased but the P-removal rate had by then dropped 60 % despite N- and K-fertilization and despite that the target (< 10 μg POlsen/g) was still far away. None of the biostimulants altered this trajectory. Therefore, restoration will still take decades when starting with ex-agricultural soils unless P-fertilization history was much lower than average...|$|E
40|$|Species-rich alpine grasslands with Nardus stricta are {{important}} communities for both animal production and environmental conservation in Europe. We selected two contrasting types of Nardus grasslands (mesic and wet) within a rangeland of northern Spain and measured annual above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), botanical components, forage utilization {{and their respective}} seasonal patterns, during a 5 -year period. We analysed their chemical properties and recorded soil moisture and temperature in order to construct models able to explain grassland productivity. Mean annual ANPP of mesic <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland</b> was about half (216 gDMm- 2 year- 1; ± 29 · 8 s. e.) that of the wet grassland (406 g DMm- 2 year- 1; ± 54 · 3 s. e.), with significant intra- and interannual variability. Mesic grassland, with a more important contribution of forbs and legumes over graminoids in its botanical composition, was the preferred forage source of grazing livestock and showed better chemical properties in spring and early summer. In summer and autumn, wet grassland had a higher utilization owing to its ability to maintain high biomass production. This was partially explained by soil moisture, a limiting factor of mesic grassland productivity. Our results provide new and relevant information on key aspects of species-rich alpine Nardus grasslands, potentially useful for the definition of management options for these habitats of priority conservation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

For spruce forests thinning over a broad range of diameters and maintenance of veteran trees would provide habitats for indicator species such as Olisthaerus substriatus. The populations of a number of bird species would be increased by strip-harvesting slopes: species such as  Tetrao urogallus, Bonasia bonasia  and  Ficedula parva  prefer forest margins.

40|$|Question: How does {{semi-natural}} grassland diversify after 65 {{years of}} differential application of Ca, N, P, and K fertilizers? Is fertilizer application adequately {{reflected by the}} Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs) ? Location: Eifel Mountains, West Germany. Methods: The Rengen Grassland Experiment (RGE) was established in an oligotrophic grassland in 1941. Six fertilizer treatments (Ca, CaN, CaNP, CaNP- KCl, CaNP-K 2 SO 4, and unfertilized control) were applied annually in five complete randomized blocks. Species composition of experimental plots was sampled in 2006 and compared with constancy tables representing grassland types in a phytosociological monograph of a wider area. Each plot was matched to the most similar community type using the Associa method. Mean EIVs were calculated for each treatment. Results: The control plots supported oligotrophic <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland</b> of the Polygalo-Nardetum association (Violion caninae alliance). Vegetation in the Ca and CaN treatments mostly resembled montane meadow of Geranio-Trisetetum (Polygono-Trisetion). Transitional types between Poo-Trisetetum and Arrhenatheretum (both from the Arrhenatherion alliance) developed in the CaNP treatment. In the CaNP- KCl and CaNP-K 2 SO 4 treatments, vegetation corresponded to the mesotrophic Arrhenatheretum meadow. Major discontinuity in species composition was found between control, Ca, and CaN treatments, and all treatments with P application. EIVs for both nutrients and soil reaction were considerably higher in P treatments than in Ca and CaN treatments. Surprisingly, the control plots had the lowest EIVs for continentality and moisture, although these factors had not been manipulated in the experiment. Conclusions: Long-term fertilizer application can create different plant communities belonging to different phytosociological alliances and classes, even within a distance of a few meters. Due to their correlated nature, EIVs can erroneously indicate changes in factors that actually did not change, but co-varied with factors that did change.

40|$|Species-rich {{semi-natural}} <b>Nardus</b> <b>grassland</b> is a {{high priority}} European habitat type (6230) that decreased dramatically in area due to agricultural intensification. Restoration is often difficult {{because of the high}} soil nutrient content, resulting from the heavy fertilization in an agricultural context. Since phosphorus (P) is one of the least mobile mineral nutrients, many agricultural soils have large reserves. High bioavailable P-concentrations homogenize the vegetation due to the dominant growth of a few competitive species. Standard restoration techniques consist of mowing and removal of cuttings in order to deplete the soil P-pool. As a consequence of nitrogen and potassium limitation, after few years the biomass production and consequently the removal of nutrients decrease. Therefore, mowing appears to be a time-consuming (several decades) management technique. A second method by which nutrients are rapidly removed is excavation of the P enriched topsoil. This is a very expensive operation where also the soil buffering components and soil biota are exported which might be crucial for successful reestablishment of species-rich grasslands. In this oral presentation, we elaborate on a third technique for removal of nutrients from the soil: the technique of P mining. This is a promising technique by which soils are depleted of P by cultivating crops with a non-P fertilization to maintain high biomass production, providing a gradual transition from agricultural to nature management on former agricultural soils. However, little knowledge is available on how much P can be removed and which crops should be used during the transition from phosphorus rich to phosphorus poor soil conditions. We present data of both greenhouse and field experiments in which crops were cultivated in sandy soils with different bioavailable soil P levels ranging from 155 to 6 mg Olsen P kg- 1 dry soil (soil-P-chronosequence). Reference sites of Nardus grasslands are reported to have very low soil P-concentrations (< 10 mg Olsen P kg- 1 dry soil). Across the total soil-P-chronosequence, P-extraction decreased with soil-P-concentration, indicating retardation of the P-extraction process. Different crops were found to have specific P-extraction patterns depending on the soil-P-level. For each soil-P-level, the best suited crops and potential crop rotations resulting in maximum P-extraction will be presented...|$|E

Although it is well established that this species loss is not trait neutral, a thorough analysis of the effects of nutrient addition on trait based functional diversity and functional composition, independently of species loss, is lacking so far. We compiled data on the plant species abundance (relevé’s) of 279 <b>Nardus</b> <b>grasslands</b> from nine European countries, across a gradient of soil N and P content. Functional diversity (Petchy and Gaston’s FDc, weighted FDc and quadratic entropy) and mean trait composition were calculated for each relevé, based on 21 functional traits. Differences in functional diversity and functional composition were related to differences in soil N, atmospheric N deposition, soil P and pH, while controlling for geographic location and species richness. All functional diversity measures decreased with increasing soil N, with wFDc also decreased by soil P, independent of species loss. This was accompanied by clear shifts in functional trait composition, associated with shifts from below-ground competition for nutrients to above-ground competition for light. This resulted in a decrease in insect-pollinated therophytes and chamaephytes and an increase in long-lived, clonal graminoids and hemicryptophytes under increasing soil N and P. These functional community changes can be expected to alter both ecosystem functioning and service provisioning of the studied grasslands.

40|$|The {{northwest}} European heathland {{landscape with}} its characteristic communities of nutrient-poor and acidic soils {{has a high}} nature value, because of its locally high biodiversity and the distinct site conditions. In order to conserve and restore the heathlands, numerous rehabilitation projects have been performed, although with varying success.

Therefore, we performed a statistical survey on the main communities and their soil characteristics. In addition, we analyzed the data for key factors determining biodiversity in the heathland landscape. Data from previous studies and surveys was used to compile a dataset of 267 vegetation relevés (classified as EUNIS habitat types) with extensive soil measurements (22 parameters). A canonical discriminant analysis revealed that soil acidity explained most of the differences between the habitat types, while soil moisture content and soil fertility were less important.

A stratified resampling approach {{was used to}} investigate {{the potential impact of}} changing levels of {{atmospheric nitrogen}} deposition and climate change on species composition of nutrient-poor acid grasslands within the French Atlantic Domain (FAD). The study was based on a comparison, over a period of 25 years, of 162 past and present vegetation records assigned to the species-rich <b>Nardus</b> <b>grasslands</b> and distributed in regional community types (CTs). Similarly, the characterization of N deposition and climate was stratified according to (i) past (1980 - 1990) and present (1995 - 2005) periods, and (ii) FAD and CT scales. Despite the relatively short time span between sampling periods, significant N deposition and climate changes were detected as well as vegetation changes. Correspondence analysis showed that the relative importance of N deposition and climate in explaining vegetation changes depended on the spatial scale of investigation (FAD vs. local CTs) and the CT. At the FAD scale, the increase of annual mean temperature and decrease of water availability were clearly related to the changes in floristic composition. At the local scale, the most stable CT experienced no significant climate change and a stable load of N deposition, whereas the CTs characterized by the largest floristic changes were associated with dramatic climate changes and moderate loads in both oxidized and reduced N deposition. Despite the narrow gradient of deposition investigated, N deposition was related to significant grassland community changes, depending on the region, i. e. climate context, and on whether N deposition was in the oxidized or reduced form. Our results suggest that N deposition drives grassland composition at the local scale, in interaction with climate, whereas climate changes remain the predominant driver at the FAD scale...|$|R

Vegetation assemblages and additional environmental variables were sampled at the same locations. Vegetation restoration aided the reassembly of moorland insects to a variable extent. Hemiptera restoration success was greatest at mechanically restored sites dominated by C. vulgaris. In addition to treatment, latitude best explained variation in the Hemiptera assemblage. A range of plant species, all either dwarf shrubs or graminoids, acted as further determinants. Lepidoptera restoration success was correlated most closely with the success of restoring the full diversity of the vegetation assemblage and was highest at sites restored by grazing control. The results demonstrate that vegetation restoration brings wider biodiversity benefits and that the form these take may depend on the restoration method used and consequent characteristics of the resultant vegetation assemblage.

The {{effects of}} varied grazing {{management}} on epigeal spiders, harvestmen and pseudoscorpions of <b>Nardus</b> stricta <b>grassland</b> in upland Scotland. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 86 (1), 39 - 57. A hypothesis that epigeal arachnid assemblages benefit more from greater vegetation structure than botanical species composition in upland grasslands was tested. The test {{was carried out}} within a grazing experiment, initiated in 1991, to investigate vegetation dynamics in response to stocking with mixed livestock at varied rates. The experimental treatments comprised: no livestock, sheep only or sheep with cattle. Livestock treatments were grazed to maintain either 4. 5 or 6. 5 cm average sward heights between tussocks. Two replicates of each treatment were used and allocated to 10 plots across 22 ha of <b>Nardus</b> stricta-dominated <b>grassland.</b> The effects on epigeal arachnids (excluding acarines) of the botanical and structural differences of the grassland between treatments during April?October 1993 and 1994 were assessed. Epigeal arachnid species composition was estimated using continuous pitfall trapping and the densities of mainly money spiders (Araneae: Linyphiidae) were estimated from monthly suction sampling and visual counts of spider webs in micro-habitats. These data were later compared with stocking rate, botanical species composition and vegetation structure. Forty of the 84 sampled species occurred in all experimental treatments. There was a significant effect of treatment {{on the number of}} arachnid species in suction but not in pitfall samples. There was also a significant effect of treatment on the relative abundance of 26 % of these arachnid species. For most species of spider, harvestmen and pseudoscorpion, abundance was greater in the ungrazed and taller, grazed swards although a few species were captured in greater numbers in the treatments with shorter swards. Botanical composition, mean vegetation height and grazing intensity accounted for 48. 5 ? 53. 2 % of the variability in the species composition/relative abundance of these arachnids, calculated by direct gradient analysis. Almost half of the species were randomly distributed across the experimental treatments and are recorded as widespread in upland heathland or grassland habitats and lowland grassland. More spider webs were counted during July?September 1993 ? 1994, with greater numbers (dominated by the linyphiid species, Lepthyphantes mengii) counted in tall, ungrazed swards compared with taller grazed swards created by sheep alone or sheep with cattle. In the treatments with fewer webs, these were occupied by more linyphiid species. Suction sampling detected greater diversity of arachnids in the ungrazed N. stricta. This was related to increased plant litter below the leaf stratum where webs were counted. Vegetation structure and not botanical species composition within the N. stricta plant community determined arachnid species composition and abundance. Furthermore, no single grazing treatment supported the total number of arachnid species represented across the entire grazing experiment. It is concluded that varied grazing management, including some temporary ungrazed areas, is necessary to maintain the structural variability of grassland patches so as to maintain a spatial mosaic that favours the optimum arachnid fauna of upland grasslands.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} soil charcoal analyses {{in order to identify}} the origin of a <b>Nardus</b> stricta <b>grassland</b> in a mountain system (Mont Lozere, France), and the use of environmental resources and the construction of a cultural landscape. Two opposing theories have been proposed to explain the origin of this open landscape (1450 e 1700 m altitude) : natural or anthropogenic. The identification and radio- carbon dates of charcoal fragments of Fagus sylvatica, which were found in all of the pits located in the current grassland area and dated to 3695 e 3633 cal BC, demonstrate that this species has been present on the upper part of Mont Lozere since the Middle Neolithic. In addition, the presence of pioneer species (Betula, Salix, Corylus avellana), as well as mid- (Prunus cf avium) and late-successional species (F. syl- vatica) supports the hypothesis that the grassland contained both pioneer and mature phases of forest landscapes. The 14 C dates, ranging from c. 4200 cal BC to 1200 cal AD, show that fire events occurred with different climatic influences. Fire events may correspond to one or several fires in a short period at the scale of the slope. Moreover, the dates coincide with the early and extensive human impact detected in the Massif Central and Mont Lozere. To explain the regular occurrences of fire events from the Middle Neolithic to the Central Middle Ages, agro-pastoral clearings have been postulated, as have been iden- tified in other areas in the Pyrenees and in the Alps. Such human impact may have been magnified, or least facilitated, by climatic conditions. Comparison with additional data (pollen, archaeology, ecology) demonstrates that this grassland area is not natural and corresponds to an ancient forested system that has been used and transformed by societies since the Neolithic, although climate change may have certainly affected this transformation. The aim of this research is to promote this cultural heritage in collaboration with the National Park of the Cevennes in order to protect its future...|$|R

Early results of the experiment have been reported previously but it was not known if these results were an indication of the longer-term restoration success. Here we evaluate the success of the restoration methods (disturbance, seeding treatments and grazing regime) eight years after the treatments began. In seeded plots, young C. vulgaris plants had greatest above-ground height, dry weight and shoot length if grazing was excluded or the cattle-only regime was applied. C. vulgaris cover was greatest, and increased most, in plots that had been disturbed, seeded and ungrazed or subjected to the cattle-only regime.

Microbial biomass and activity were significantly higher in podzolic soils with Nardus dominated vegetation, than in brown earth soils with Agrostis-Festuca vegetation. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLEA) revealed differences in microbial community structure between soils. The ratio of fungal-to-bacterial fatty acids was higher in the brown earth than in the podzolic soil, whereas the diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of PLFAs was greater in the podzolic soil. A {{large proportion of the}} microbial biomass (50 %) and activity (40 - 70 %) was within the surface 0 - 5 cm soil, with reduced amounts at lower depths of 5 - 10 cm and 10 - 15 cm. Microbial biomass and activity and nematode abundance showed pronounced summer maxima and winter minima. The long-term removal of sheep grazing from both grassland types resulted in significant reductions in microbial biomass and activity in the surface soil. The abundance of active soil fungi, measured as the fungal fatty acid 18 : 2 omega 6, was significantly reduced by the removal of sheep grazing, as was the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial fatty acids. Bacterial fatty acids were unaffected by the removal of sheep grazing. Possible mechanisms for these changes are discussed. Numbers of soil nematodes were significantly lower in the ungrazed sites. The effects of removing sheep grazing on nematodes and microbial community structure were most pronounced in brown earth soils. Factors responsible for these changes are discussed.

40|$|The {{presentation}} aims {{to compare}} {{the origin of the}} open landscapes of pastoral mountain systems located in the Mediterranean Basin (France: Mont Lozère, Spain: Sierra de Gredos, Italy: Tosco-Emiliano Apennines) since the Neolithic period. Even if the three mountains selected show several differences linked to the climate, vegetation types, altitude, they are characterized by the change from an intense agro-pastoral and industrial exploitation to a gradual abandonment which leads to an open landscape part of the heritage identity. Until 2011, date of the construction of the network AGRESPE (Gestion de Ressources Environnementales passéeS et Patrimonialisation paysagèrE, dir. Bal et Allée) these three mountain systems were studied with a strong difference in the scientific interest. For example, the Mont Lozère was considered very early as an anthroposylvosystem. Therefore, the palaeoecological and archaeological studies were developed with the same importance. Unlike the Sierra de Gredos (Spain) and the Monte Cimone (Italy) for which {{there is a lot of}} pastoral structures but the archaeological study was inexistent. The objective of the Agrespe network is to apply the same geographical approach and the same scientific methodology in all of these European mountains. Pedoanthracology is a potent method allows study of the composition of past plant woody communities and to highlight the history of the ligneous landscape at a high spatial scale (the scale of the slope). In order to increase the knowledge of these open landscapes and to obtain new data at a high spatial scale, the pedoanthracology was applied according to an altitudinal transect and compared with preliminary data (pollen, subfossil wood, historical sources, pastoral archaeology) concerning each area. Even if these mountains shared some similarities in the use of the environmental resources, the construction and the management of the open spaces reveal some dissimilarities. At the Mont Lozère, the soil charcoal data extracted from the <b>Nardus</b> stricta <b>grassland</b> located at above 1400 m altitude, permit to identify this open area like a mountain belt recovered by an ancient open beech forest that has been used and transformed by societies since the Neolithic period. At the Sierra de Gredos (Spain), the pedoanthracological data reveal an ancient Pinus timberline located at around 1700 m a. s. l., and above 1700 m a. s. l. a natural open space dominated by Fabaceae since the last 9000 year BP. At the northern Apennines, the preliminary pedoanthracological results demonstrate that the ancient timberline was probably located at higher altitude (around 1800 m asl.) than the actual (1550 m asl.). The increase of the knowledge of these landscapes help us to propose future management of these open spaces in collaboration with parks and heritage associations at the scale of each country and at the scale of Europe...|$|R

However, contrary to the prevailing paradigm of N driven speciesloss, we have identified P enrichment to be the main culprit. Indeed, we foundthat nearly 30 % of characteristic grasslands species may be at risk of decline followingincreased soil P, whereasonly 8 % may be at risk following increased N. Furthermore, we found that soil P explained between five- and twenty-fold morevariation inplant species richness as opposed to soil N. We also presentednovelevidence that P limited grasslands exhibit an higher average speciesrichness compared with N limited grasslands. Furthermore, our results confirmedthat the deleterious influence of increased soil P is consistent across threecommon types of semi-natural grasslands in Europe. In this respect, we wereable to characterize clear thresholds of soil P availability below whichbiodiversity can be maintained. Nevertheless, our results do not excludedetrimental effects of N enrichment on biodiversity, particularly through highrates of atmospheric N deposition. However, we found that these effects mainlyoperate by lowering soil acidity, as opposed to species loss following eutrophication. Indeed, plant trait analyses and observations of above-ground biomass productionindicated that eutrophication, i. e. the change in the competitive environment fromlimited supply of nutrients to light limitation, is primarily related to Penrichment. However, P eutrophication could not explain all observed patternsof species loss as it was only applicable in P limited sites. In addition,experimental manipulation of the light and nutrient supply showed that at leastone characteristic grassland species still exhibited a negative response to P enrichment,despite alleviation of light limitation. Therefore, we suspect that other mechanismsmay be at work in this context. Indeed, we alsoidentified mycorrhizal dependencyas an important risk factor when confronted with P enrichment. Unfortunately, wewere unable to exploredisruption of mutualism with arbuscular mycorrhizalfungi as an alternative explanation for plant species loss due tomethodological difficulties. 35. 45 pt 160. 5 pt"> 200 %;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold" lang="EN-US"> 35. 45 pt 160. 5 pt"> 200 %;mso-bidi-font-family:"TimesNew Roman";mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold" lang="EN-US">We conclude by stressing the need to develop environmental policies and managementefforts to simultaneously reduce both N and Pinputs as a prerequisite foreffective conservation of plant diversity in European grasslands. Whereasseveral pieces of environmental legislation have been developed to reducecurrent levels of N pollution, already resulting in a gradual decrease ofatmospheric N depositionin Europe, far less attention has been paid toreducing P enrichmentof terrestrial ecosystems (as opposed to aquaticecosystems). Nevertheless, we have shown that soil P will constrains animportant part of plant diversity conservation, despite efforts reducing Npollution. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to the management of processesinvolved in P enrichment, including groundwater sulfurous pollution, inundationwith P polluted water, P deposition as particulate dust from agriculture andrunoff of excess P fertilizer. Finally, we strongly advocate agro-environmentalschemes including areas permanently free from P fertilization, as added Pcauses long-term enhanced soil P owing to P sequestration in soil. As speciesrich grasslands maintain high levels of insects for essential pollination servicesand rock-P reserves for manufacturing P fertilizers dwindle worldwide, ourrecommendations may serve both biodiversity conservation and economicallysustainable agricultural practice in European grasslands.
