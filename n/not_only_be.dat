5|$|Aside from {{overseeing}} the new clergy, Soegijapranata {{continued to work}} towards Catholic education and prosperity, similar to his pre-war work. He emphasised that students must <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> good Catholics, but also good Indonesians. The Church began further development of its schools, ranging from elementary schools to universities. Soegijapranata also began reforming the Church in his apostolic vicariate, making it more Indonesian. He advocated the use of local languages and Indonesian during mass, allowing it throughout his diocese beginning in 1956. In addition, he pressed {{for the use of}} gamelan music to accompany services, and agreed to the use of wayang shows to teach the Bible to children.|$|E
5|$|Things {{remained}} {{quiet in}} the Khe Sanh area through 1966. Even so, Westmoreland insisted that it <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> occupied by the Marines, but that it be reinforced. He was vociferously opposed by General Lewis W. Walt, the Marine commander of I Corps. Walt argued heatedly that the real target of the American effort should be the pacification and protection of the population, not chasing NVA and the NLF in the hinterlands. Westmoreland won out, however, and the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment (1/3 Marines) was dispatched to occupy the camp and airstrip on 29 September. By late January 1967, 1/3 returned to Japan and was relieved by Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9 Marines). A single company was replacing an entire battalion.|$|E

5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E

25|$|Dentition is {{particularly}} useful in tracking ancient populations' movements, {{because there are}} differences in the shapes of incisors, the number of grooves on molars, presence/absence of wisdom teeth, and extra cusps on particular teeth.

25|$|Conservation – As {{with the}} {{intraspecific}} relationship, the interspecific O–A relationship implies that species will <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> {{at risk of}} extinction due to low abundance, but because species with low abundance {{are expected to have}} restricted distributions, they are at risk of local catastrophe leading to global extinction. This may be confounded by the difficulty in surveying locally rare species due to both their low detectability, and restricted distribution (see above). Finally, because rare species are expected to have restricted distributions, conservation programmes aimed at prioritizing sites for multi-species conservation will include fewer habitats for rare species than common species.|$|E

25|$|Water {{losses in}} the {{distribution}} network have been estimated at only 7 percent in 2001, down from 11 percent in 1991.

These would <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> the lowest water {{losses in the}} four countries, {{but also in the}} world. The study states that its methodology allows for an accurate comparison, including water used to flush pipes and for firefighting.

The employee had a contractual right not to be dismissed. It was also held that, for a successful claim based on constructive dismissal, the employer must <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the circumstances which induce the employee to resign; it must also be to blame for those circumstances.|$|E
