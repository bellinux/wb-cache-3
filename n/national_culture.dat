5|$|According to Teeuw, {{after the}} {{publication}} of Atheis Mihardja immediately became famous. Maier notes that the fame and warm reception to which Atheis was released was influenced not only by the novel's strengths, but also by Mihardja's personality and stature. These qualities were in-line with the nascent government's need to use literature, as the most developed of the new <b>national</b> <b>culture,</b> for nation-building; in 1969, Atheis received a literary award from the government of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Andrée's heroic motives {{have been}} questioned, {{beginning}} with Per Olof Sundman's bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, The Flight of the Eagle. Sundman portrays Andrée as {{the victim of}} the demands of the media and the Swedish scientific and political establishment, and as ultimately motivated by fear rather than courage. Sundman's interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind spots of the Swedish <b>national</b> <b>culture,</b> {{and the role of the}} press is reflected in the film adaptation, Flight of the Eagle (1982), based on his novel and directed by Jan Troell. It was nominated for an Oscar.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} effects of {{globalization}} {{is the creation of}} a new and identifiable class of persons who belong to an emergent global culture. As membership in this new global culture rises, many critics find a distinct threat to <b>national</b> <b>cultures,</b> resulting quite possibly in their eventual obsolescence. In this paper, we consider the trends driving the growth of this newly emerging global culture, the process by which new members are socialized into it, the characteristics, or features, that appear to be descriptive of its members, and the impact of this emerging global culture on the obsolescence of <b>national</b> <b>cultures.</b> Finally, while it is unrealistic to expect that the emerging global <b>culture</b> will replace <b>national</b> <b>cultures,</b> we nevertheless conclude that <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> must be adaptable and able to emphasize the attractiveness of their core elements if they wish to remain relevant in some viable fashion.

40|$|Extract] <b>National</b> <b>cultures</b> and {{cultural}} identities are {{the foundations of}} cultural tourism. We can diminish the threats to <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> {{and cultural}} tourism by abandoning {{the pursuit of a}} common understanding of globalisation and become genuinely committed to the value of globalisation. Globalisation conventionally understood as an homogenous process is not possible. A conceptualisation of globalisation based on a theory of cultural diversity and uniqueness is desirable because it does not homogenise cultural differences but respects <b>national</b> <b>cultures,</b> cultural differences and identities and thus encourages cultural tourism...|$|R

5|$|The riots {{caused a}} major change in the government's {{approach}} to racial issues, and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays, the New Economic Policy (NEP). The <b>National</b> <b>Culture</b> Policy, also introduced in 1970, emphasised an assimilation of the non-Malays into the Malay ethnic group. However, during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach, with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state. During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again, and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} {{is the creation of}} a <b>national</b> <b>culture,</b> frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} there could be ‘relative’ {{meanings}} of design in organizations, according to the different <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> in which the organizations predominantly reside, due to the different organizational vocabulary that is used in the design of a ‘complex product’. The paper suggests that under complex conditions, different meanings of design according to <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> could influence, not only the development of an organization, but also the design of these complex products. The author contends that much research on the meaning of design and its use in design-led innovation takes a Western perspective; however this paper discusses how different <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> influence the construction of product design and how different <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> could influence the meaning of design in complex organizations. This is achieved by examining a case study in Samsung, which has been involved in a global dispute regarding its product design patents with Apple. This paper explores how this lens might help to understand how design-led innovation is viewed differently and how the resulting product design is influenced by national and derived organizational cultures...|$|R
5|$|Throughout the 14th century, French kings {{sought to}} expand their {{influence}} {{at the expense of}} the territorial holdings of the nobility. They ran into difficulties when attempting to confiscate the holdings of the English kings in southern France, leading to the Hundred Years' War, waged from 1337 to 1453. Early in the war the English under Edward III (r. 1327–77) and his son Edward, the Black Prince (d. 1376), won the battles of Crécy and Poitiers, captured the city of Calais, and won control of much of France. The resulting stresses almost caused the disintegration of the French kingdom during the early years of the war. In the early 15th century, France again came close to dissolving, but in the late 1420s the military successes of Joan of Arc (d. 1431) led to the victory of the French and the capture of the last English possessions in southern France in 1453. The price was high, as the population of France at the end of the Wars was likely half what it had been at the start of the conflict. Conversely, the Wars had a positive effect on English national identity, doing much to fuse the various local identities into a national English ideal. The conflict with France also helped create a <b>national</b> <b>culture</b> in England separate from French culture, which had previously been the dominant influence. The dominance of the English longbow began during early stages of the Hundred Years' War, and cannon appeared on the battlefield at Crécy in 1346.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on an Anglo-German {{research}} project of two research groups in both countries. It {{is based on}} data collected by qualitative research in the three largest multinational corporations (MNCs) in the lift and escalator industry. The headquarters (HQs) of the three corporations are based in the United States, Finland and Germany, respectively, and all three MNCs each have subsidiaries in Germany and Britain. Our main objects of analysis were change processes in the work systems of these three MNCs. We chose the lift and escalator industry as an example because it has been characterized by strong concentration processes during the last 10 years. Most of these corporations have grown by acquisition and there are strong tendencies in the market towards standardized, globally uniform products. <b>National</b> <b>cultures</b> and institutions, first of all play a role on the HQ level. Important areas were the standardization of products and production technology, the design of management systems and location and relocation decisions for R&D and manufacturing. Second, MNCs take differences in <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> into account and deliberately "use" them in allocating resources and investment within the multinational group. <b>National</b> <b>cultures</b> and institutions massively shape the very formulation of manufacturing strategies within the multinational groups, as well as the R&D strategies [...] a particular important field in an industry still relying heavily on small-batch and unit production. <b>National</b> <b>cultures</b> also {{play a significant role in}} implementing the global strategies of MNCs in different host countries.

40|$|Abstract. The ERP {{adoption}} rate {{in developing}} countries in Asia is very low. Apart from obvious differences in relative wealth of organizations in Western versus most Asian countries, the literature suggests that <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> of the Asian countries, which are quite different {{to the culture of}} the Western world—the birth place of ERP—may be one reason for such low adoption rates {{in developing countries}} in Asia. This paper explores and confirms that view by contrasting dimensions of the cultural practices embedded in ERP software and the <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> in Asia. The analysis is grounded theoretically on Hofstede’s dimensions of <b>national</b> <b>cultures.</b> The cultural differences identified by Hofstede are explored through six case studies carried out in Sri Lanka, a developing country in Asia. The case studies reveal a clash of cultural forces between the culture embedded in Western ERP products and the culture of Asian ERP adopters. ...|$|R

This article focuses on the question of under what conditions managers grant a subordinate’s request to telework and what role <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> play herein. By looking into managers’ willingness to delegate power and to trust home-based teleworkers we try to explain the slow adoption of home-based telework and the reported differences across Northern and Southern European countries. In doing so we will make use of Hofstede’s writings on <b>national</b> <b>cultures</b> and of the propositions made by the telework literature on how to mitigate the potential trust problem associated with distance working. The purpose of the article is to develop new hypotheses regarding factors that influence managerial decision-making concerning telework and how these interact with <b>national</b> <b>cultures.</b> To test the hypotheses, a cross-national vignette study is proposed. ...|$|R
