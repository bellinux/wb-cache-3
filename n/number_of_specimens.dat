40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{summarize}} actual results of the field research of invasive neophytes' occurrence in the riverbank vegetation of selected water courses in the Czech Republic. In total approximately 850 km of the riverbank vegetation was mapped using author's own method. The occurrence of invasive neophytes (17 taxons) was registered {{for each of the}} 500 m long segments (in total 1693 segments was mapped). The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimen</b> was registered using a logarithmical scale. Segments were defined using river navigation or important points of orientation (e. g. bridges or weirs). Total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> taxons, total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimen,</b> simple index <b>of</b> invasive neophytes load (Is) and weighted index of invasive neophytes load (Iw) were calculated for each segment. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimen</b> was derived from registered values such as the mean value of the interval. The weighted index of invasive neophytes' load takes into account plant size, it's life history and potencial risk for indigenous flora or people and human activities. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimen</b> <b>of</b> each taxon is weighted by certain coefficient.

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, from {{a limited}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens,</b> {{suggested that there}} was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago. This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred.

5|$|By tabulating the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> of each age group, Erickson and {{his colleagues}} were able to draw {{conclusions}} about life history in a population of Albertosaurus.

While this {{could be due to}} preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two.

5|$|The hoopoe {{starling}} {{was kept}} as a cagebird on Réunion and Mauritius, {{and although the}} bird was becoming scarcer, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> were obtained during the early 19th century. It is unknown whether any live specimens were ever transported from the Mascarenes. Cordemoy recalled that captive birds could be fed {{a wide variety of}} food, such as bananas, potatoes, and chayote, and wild birds would never enter inhabited areas. Many individuals survived on Mauritius after escaping there, and it was thought that a feral population could be established. However, the Mauritian population lasted less than a decade; the final specimen on the island (the last definite record of a live specimen anywhere) was taken in 1836. Specimens could still be collected on Réunion during the 1830s and, possibly, the early 1840s.|$|E
5|$|By tabulating the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> of each age group, Erickson and {{his colleagues}} were able to draw {{conclusions}} about life history in tyranosauridae populations. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. Over half of the known T. rex specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern that is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, {{partly due to the}} stresses of reproduction. While this could be due to preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals, like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two.

25|$|The bog {{chemical}} environment involves a completely saturated acidic environment, where considerable concentrations of organic acids and aldehydes are present. Layers of sphagnum and peat assist in preserving the cadavers by enveloping the tissue {{in a cold}} immobilizing matrix, impeding water circulation and any oxygenation. An additional feature of anaerobic preservation by acidic bogs {{is the ability to}} conserve hair, clothing and leather items. Modern experimenters have been able to mimic bog conditions in the laboratory and successfully demonstrate the preservation process, albeit over shorter time frames than the 2,500 years that Haraldskær Woman's body has survived. Most of the bog bodies discovered showed some aspects of decay or else were not properly conserved. When such specimens are exposed to the normal atmosphere, they may begin to decompose rapidly. As a result, many specimens have been effectively destroyed. As of 1979, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> that have been preserved following discovery was 53.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens,</b> {{statistical}} analysis {{can be used to}} investigate this problem. In 2008 Chiappe et alii published a morphometrical study of 106 fossils. The population showed a clear bimodal distribution {{of the size of the}} animals with two weight classes. However, there was no correlation between size and the possession of the long tail feathers. From this it was concluded that either the sexes did not differ in size or both sexes had the long feathers. The first case was deemed most likely which left the size distribution to be explained. It was hypothesised that the smaller animals consisted of very young individuals, that the large animals were adults and that the rarity of individuals with an intermediate size was caused by Confuciusornis experiencing a growth spurt just prior to reaching adulthood, the shortness of which would have prevented many becoming fossilised during this phase. This interpretation was criticised by Dieter S. Peters who pointed out that, as the smaller animals were not neonates, the young of Confuciusornis had to grow very fast immediately after hatching regardless. This would then imply two growth spurts, which assumption was not very parsimonious. He thought the data would be more simply explained by assuming that both sexes had the long feathers and one of them was the largest. He favoured the possibility that these were the females, having observed such a pattern with the modern pheasant-tailed jacana (Hydrophasianus chirurgus), a water-bird in which both sexes have long tails and the female sex is the heaviest. He accounted for the fact that most specimens show no tails at all by the possibility that Confuciusornis shed the feathers as a defence mechanism, a method used by several extant species, which would have been triggered by the stress induced by the very volcanic explosion that buried the animals.|$|E
