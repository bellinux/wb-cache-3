40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} apical leakage using dye {{penetration}} and electrochemical methods each successively {{used on the}} same teeth. Methods: 31 freshly extracted anterior single root human teeth with straight root canals were selected. The specimens were divided randomly, respectively into experimental group, two positive and two negative controls. Root canal of the case group and negative group were filled, and positive group were left unfilled. The external surface of each tooth was coated with two layers of the <b>nail</b> <b>polisher,</b> except for the apical 2 mm and coronal portion. Leakage of each tooth was measured by using electrochemical test. Two copper wires were used as electrodes and normal saline solution was used as electrolyte. Then coronal portion of root were filled {{with the aid of}} ZOE cement and coated with two layers of the <b>nail</b> <b>polisher.</b> The teeth immersed in 2 % basic fuchsine for 48 hours and were washed in tap water. The roots were then split longitudinally and dye leakage was assessed for each tooth. Results: No correlation was found among the results obtained with the two methods (P-Value=. 297). Conclusions: Several studies are necessary before evaluation of the marginal leakage...|$|E
40|$|Nano-sized lead {{has many}} {{versatile}} applications {{that could be}} applied in daily life. In the current study, we report a comprehensive study for preparation of nanosized lead oxide using the co-precipitation method and optimization of reaction parameters to obtain lead oxide (PbO) nanoparticles with homogeneously distributed size, shape and structure. When aqueous solution of lead (II) acetate reduced with sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures, alpha form of lead oxide nanoparticles, with spherical shape were achieved. Decreasing the ratio of sodium hydroxide to lead (II) acetate concentration at moderate temperatures resulted with a gradual change in crystal structure from quasi -spherical α-PbO nanoparticles and two dimensional nanoflakes of beta PbO with a thickness below 100 nm was synthesized for the first time. The obtained particles in both α and b forms were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering equipment (Zetasizer), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Finally, thin layers of freeze-dryer α-PbO and β-PbO particle powder on glass and filter paper were formed by the help of <b>nail</b> <b>polisher</b> and conductivity measurements were performed using four-point probes method. Produced layers β-PbO particles with a below 100 nm showed higher conductivity on both supports {{as compared to the}} ones produced from spherical α-PbO nanoparticles. This altered conductivity of the material in the semiconducting zone, which is probably due to a more effective electron transfer facilitated by 2 D alignment of the molecules, could rose the potential use of this material in voltaic and catalysis...|$|E
