25|$|<b>New</b> <b>this</b> {{year was}} a dual master-cylinder braking system and {{optional}} front disc brakes along with Rally II wheels. Also new for 1967 was an energy-absorbing collapsible steering column. Plus, Pontiac added an 8-track Stereo tape player.|$|E
25|$|On February 2, 1942, {{a massive}} fire swept through a garage on the base. This fire {{destroyed}} 125 vehicles, including 40 which were <b>new.</b> <b>This</b> {{was the only}} massive fire to ever occur at the base.|$|E

25|$|In 1901 the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company struck oil on Spindletop Hill in Beaumont. Though {{petroleum}} {{production was}} not <b>new,</b> <b>this</b> strike {{was by far}} the largest the world had ever seen. The find led to widespread exploration throughout Texas and neighboring states. By 1940 Texas was firmly established as the leading oil producer in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The {{space around}} the trestle {{could be used}} for storage, but was open to the weather. Mill owners started to build {{roundhouse}}s around the trestles, and later mills were built with a roundhouse from <b>new.</b> <b>This</b> had the dual advantage of creating a covered storage area and protecting the trestle from bad weather. In Suffolk, millwrights would build post mills mounted on tall, two or three storey roundhouses, as at Saxtead Green.|$|E
50|$|The program {{originally}} debuted {{under the}} title ABC <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning on July 5, 1982. In early 1983, the program was retitled ABC World <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning. The program was initially 60 minutes in length and anchored by Steve Bell and Kathleen Sullivan at the network's Washington, D.C. newsroom-studio (as was most ABC News programming at the time).|$|R
50|$|Sullivan {{joined the}} CBS team in 2006 and {{anchored}} CBS 2 <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning at WCBS-TV in New York. In addition to anchoring CBS 2 <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning with Maurice DuBois and CBS 2 News at Noon, she co-hosted and filled {{in as the}} newsreader at CBS' The Saturday Early Show with Chris Wragge, Lonnie Quinn, and Erica Hill.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, WHBF {{announced}} morning newscasts would be coming to the station. Meredith Dennis anchored and Travis Michels provided weather information as of September 12, 2011. Also, the 6:00 p.m. news returned after a 14-year absence on September 26, 2011. The local morning newscast, known as CBS4 <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning (now known as Local 4 <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning), was aired from 5:30 to 7:00 AM. The CBS Morning News was moved back to 5:00 a.m. and the station's daily paid early morning religious programming was discontinued. As of Spring 2012, CBS4 <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning airs from 5:00-7:00 a.m., while the CBS Morning News airs at 4:30 a.m.|$|R
25|$|Only a minor {{facelift}} with revised grille and taillight trim {{marked the}} 1970 Electra 225. The big news {{was under the}} hood, where a new 370-horsepower 455 cubic-inch V8 replaced the 430 V8 used from 1967 to 1969. This was the final year for the Electra convertible, finned aluminum brake drums and high compression engines. <b>New</b> <b>this</b> year was a concealed radio antenna, which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield.|$|E
25|$|Interiors were mildly revised {{with minor}} {{changes to the}} {{instrument}} panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls {{to the left of the}} steering wheel, which was <b>new</b> <b>this</b> year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.|$|E
25|$|The Viva {{remained}} on sale {{until the end}} of 1979, when the Opel Kadett D was launched. It was intended that this car would also be produced in America and the UK, as the second generation Chevette, but due to various industrial issues at the time GM decided to shelve most of the Ellesmere Port Plant, retaining only the assembly shop to build the new car. These would be produced from 'knock-down' kits shipped from Opel's Russelsheim plant. Due to the huge loss of workforce which this would cause, representations were made which resulted in the decision to continue production of existing models alongside the <b>new.</b> <b>This</b> meant that a new name would have to be found for Vauxhall's version of the new Opel Kadett, and so in March 1980 the Vauxhall Astra was born, replacing the Viva in the Vauxhall range, while the Chevette {{remained on}} sale until 1984. At this time, the planned mothballing of the major proportion of the Ellesmere Port Plant went ahead as originally planned.|$|E
5000|$|Production of {{the program}} was moved to ABC's {{headquarters}} in the Lincoln Square district of New York City on July 11, 1988, when Forrest Sawyer and Paula Zahn debuted as co-anchors. In mid-1992, production of World <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning was combined with that of the network's then recently launched overnight news program World News Now, with the same anchor team appearing on both programs. Initially, some elements from World News Now were brought over to World <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning including the [...] "Morning Papers" [...] segment and that program's Yanni-composed theme music (played over the original World <b>News</b> <b>This</b> Morning opening graphics) as well as the laid-back attitude.|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something <b>new.</b> <b>This,</b> too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also <b>new</b> <b>this</b> year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the house, {{there are}} {{numerous}} love quotes written by Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In {{the dining room and}} kitchen, the furniture are in bright red and yellow colors, and logs stacked against each other fill up a wall. The walkway to the Head of Household room evokes a giant library. The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis. The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks. The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds. Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink bedspreads fill another room. The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace. A red colored room connected directly to the living room by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds. <b>New</b> <b>this</b> season is a Spa room complete with a massage table, two-person sauna and lounge. The spa room would be featured in numerous subsequent seasons. Outside, there is a hot tub and pool, a billiards table and lounge area. The lounge area features a fire pit and heated lamps. Along with work-out equipment, there are lawn chairs to lay out in the sun. The outside also includes the washing machine and clothes dryer, both of which are covered overhead.|$|E

500|$|Years later, Wintour {{admitted}} the photo {{had never been}} planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when Vogue put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, [...] "I just said, 'Well, let's just try this.' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, 'This is something <b>new.</b> <b>This</b> is something different.' [...] The printers called {{to make sure that}} was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made." [...] In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. [...] "t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for Vogue." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{theatrical}} poster {{for the film}} was released in early August 2013. Kirsten Acuna of Business Insider criticized the poster for its lack of originality, noting its similarities {{to one of the}} posters of Iron Man 3, both of which included the female lead clinging to the male lead, with both looking in opposite directions, antagonists prominently displayed in the background and supporting characters featured [...] "on the side". Additionally, Marvel released a second trailer for the film as part of YouTube's Geek Week. Forbes said, [...] "this 150-second trailer is basically just an extended version of last April's 106-second teaser" [...] and that [...] "this trailer fails to showcase what's <b>new</b> <b>this</b> time around... making audiences question if they really don't have much else to offer." [...] The Los Angeles Times said, that the trailer suggests [...] "an ominous, epic scale for the sequel" [...] and that [...] "the collaboration between Thor and Loki promises to be especially interesting." [...] Later in the month, producer Kevin Feige and cast members Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins presented additional footage at Disney's D23 Expo.|$|E

Later that year a sheet-steel pilot was fitted to it and several other locomotives to replace the boiler-tube pilot installed from <b>new.</b> <b>This</b> featured a swing-up coupler. As well as giving a more attractive, streamlined look, this had a serious safety aspect; a sheet-steel pilot without a protruding coupler {{was more likely to}} deflect an obstacle without catching on it in e.g. a grade crossing accident.|$|E

2500|$|The Fabian Society {{considers}} the term to be offensive and regards it as [...] "sneering and patronising" [...] to a largely voiceless group. On describing {{those who use}} the word, the society stated that [...] "we all know their old serviette/napkin, lounge/living room, settee/sofa tricks. But this is something <b>new.</b> <b>This</b> is middle class hatred of the white working class, pure and simple." [...] The Fabian Society have been {{highly critical of the}} BBC in using the term in broadcasts. Use of the term 'chav' was reported in The Guardian in 2011 as [...] "class abuse by people asserting superiority".|$|E
2500|$|For 1951, the 88 {{was now the}} {{entry-level}} Olds {{with the}} discontinuation of the six-cylinder 76 line, which meant that all Oldsmobiles were powered by Rocket V8s. <b>New</b> <b>this</b> year was the more upscale Super 88 line on the new GM B-body which included restyled rear body panels, a more luxurious interior, and a slightly longer [...] wheelbase {{as opposed to the}} [...] wheelbase which had been standard since the 88's introduction. The station wagon was discontinued and would not reappear until the 1957 model year. New was an I-beam frame. Hydraulic power windows and seats were optional.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, musically and dramatically, The Arcadians and {{the other}} Edwardian musical comedies sit between the fading world of British comic opera, like the Gilbert and Sullivan works, and the later styles of musical comedy and music hall.
