A Lieutenant Gonzales {{on the other end of}} the line claims there's no one in their records called O'Brien.

Lawyer Julian Falconer argued in court that [...] "When Chief Fantino declared {{there were only a}} few bad apples, he did not deliver the straight goods," [...] and shut down the investigation before it expanded as part of a damage-control campaign.|$|E

2500|$|Although Cash {{cultivated}} {{a romantic}} outlaw image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors, he stayed only one night on each stay. On May 11, 1965, {{he was arrested}} in Starkville, Mississippi, for trespassing late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (He used this to write the song [...] "Starkville City Jail", which he discussed on his live At San Quentin album.) While on tour that year, he was arrested October 4 in El Paso, Texas by a <b>narcotics</b> <b>squad.</b> The officers suspected he was smuggling heroin from Mexico, but found instead 688 Dexedrine capsules (amphetamines) and 475 Equanil (sedatives or tranquilizers) tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a suspended sentence.|$|E
2500|$|After an {{involved}} police surveillance operation, Fiedler {{was arrested}} in 1967 on the charge of maintaining premises where banned substances were being used. Following six weeks of surveillance, the <b>narcotics</b> <b>squad</b> obtained a search warrant. With only one day left in the warrant, the police raided the house and [...] "found" [...] small quantities of marijuana and hashish. Marsha Van der Voort later testified under oath that she had planted the illegal substances {{just prior to the}} entrance of the police. Even though they had no direct evidence that Fiedler himself had used them, the evidence was sufficient for an arrest. The scandal was disastrous for Fiedler; his home insurance was canceled by two different providers, and the University of Amsterdam reversed their decision to have him as a Fulbright lecturer. While the legal case was ongoing, Fiedler managed to secure a position as visiting professor in the University of Sussex.|$|E

40|$|Between the mid- 1960 s and early- 1970 s, the {{genres of}} folk and rock music were often {{culturally}} subversive forces that, at times, supported such countercultural mores as illegal drug use, obscenity, and a hedonistic sexuality which offended some governmental agencies {{and law enforcement}} authorities in the United States. Although the countercultural subversion frequently attributed to such music was neither the same as nor necessarily inclusive with revolutionary, leftist political ideologies and movements, such music commonly provided the soundtrack and inspiration for various counter-hegemonic political groups as the antiwar movement, the Youth International Party, the Black Panther Party, and the Weather Underground (all of which challenged government authorities which they condemned as imperialist, racist, and oppressive). Consequently, a variety of officials, including FBI agents, the U. S. Military, {{and local law enforcement}} officers, including municipal <b>narcotics</b> and vice <b>squads,</b> instituted various forms of repression or harassment against certain musical performers, promoters, or concertgoers. Frequently working as independent actors or bureaus, these political officials and law enforcement agents imposed varying degrees of repression or harassment upon musicians, depending on {{the degree to which they}} felt threatened. Targeted by such acts, musicians sometimes witnessed a deleterious effect on their emotional state, careers, and even the general direction of the music industry. Others, however, seemed little affected by police harassment or political repression, suggesting that the thought of dealing with law enforcement authorities did not completely deter all musicians from writing, recording, or performing whatever they wished...|$|R
