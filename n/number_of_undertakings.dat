40|$|This article {{reports on}} the use <b>of</b> {{enforceable}} <b>undertakings</b> by the Australian employment standards enforcement agency, the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO), and its predecessor, the Workplace Ombudsman. Enforceable undertakings are used by the FWO as an alternative enforcement tool to court litigation in relation to breaches of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth), which regulates wages, working hours and other minimum employment conditions. Proponents <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> argue that they deliver value to regulatory agencies as a responsive alternative to traditional, punitive enforcement action. On the other hand, critics have raised concerns about the accountability and effectiveness of this enforcement tool. The authors provide a critical analysis of the FWO&# 039;s use <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> including consideration <b>of</b> the decision-making process, content, monitoring and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> The analysis {{is based on a}} review <b>of</b> all enforceable <b>undertakings</b> concluded in the period from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2012, as well as qualitative interviews with approximately 60 inspectors, managers and lawyers of the FWO, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> specialist workplace relations lawyers. The article reveals that the FWO has made limited but promising use <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> in the review period. Through deployment <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> the FWO has demonstrated that it has a mix of regulatory approaches available to it that are consistent with the key principles of responsive regulation. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings</b> accepted by the FWO, however, remains fairly limited. We set out a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ways in which the regulator may maximise the utilisation <b>of</b> enforceable <b>undertakings,</b> and more fully realise the regulatory benefits of this particular compliance tool...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{evolution}} of international policy on bioprospecting, Colombian regulations on the matter still lack uniformity with these international policies. Here we examine the effectiveness of Colombian policy on bioprospecting and its consonance with international guidelines and treaties. To this end, we requested information from the environmental authorities regarding study permits issued for scientific research on biodiversity and access granted to genetic resources. We also examined the number of research groups in Colombia registered under national directives. We found that scientific bioprospecting has increased {{in the last five}} years both in number of research groups (30 %) and in the number of registered projects (8 times); however, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> does not match the number of permits issued, suggesting a margin of informality (70 %) in the execution of these activities.

The article points out the economic and environmental aspects of water losses. The possibilities of using international water loss assessment standards have been analysed. The reflections presented in the paper refer to the current trends and world standards in the field of {{water distribution}} systems management. The article presents the results and analysis of water losses for the water supply network operated by the Water Supply and Sewerage Company in Gliwice (Przedsiębiorstwo Wodociągów i Kanalizacji w Gliwicach, PWiK). The losses were determined on the basis of numerous indicators and compared with other distribution systems. At present, most indicators of water loss are at a very good or good level. The Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI), {{as one of the most}} reliable loss indicators for the surveyed distribution system, assumed values from 3. 33 in 2012 to 2. 06 in 2015. The recent drop in ILI values indicates the effectiveness of the Company's strategy for water leakage reduction.

40|$|Through {{the current}} public {{enforcement}} powers, the Commission has {{the possibility to}} request information and perform inspections in order to collect such evidence that can prove an infringement of Article 101 TFEU. However, undertakings involved in cartels, {{that are willing to}} inform the Commission of the existence of such activity, should not be deterred from doing so by the high fines which they might face. Voluntary assistance from cartel participants is of great importance since cartels are secret and therefore by their very nature extremely difficult to detect and investigate without the cooperation of {{at least one of the}} participants. Immunity and reduction of fines for ‘whistle blowers’ has been considered justified with regard to the great reduction of cartels that follows. The EU has introduced the Leniency Notice, which aim is to fulfil these goals, and at the same time fulfil the overriding aims of competition law enforcement. The Leniency Notice has been considered necessary as a tool for the Commission to enforce competition law and has proven to be a great success. The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether it may be justified to modify and extend the Leniency Notice further by introducing Leniency Plus. Leniency Plus is a method with the primary objective to detect more cartels. It functions by rewarding cartel participants with additional lenient treatment for disclosing other cartels. Leniency Plus have to be able to fulfil the goals of effective public enforcement of competition law, and at the same time operate under the general principles of EU law, mainly the principles of proportionality, equal treatment, effectiveness and legal certainty. It will be argued that an introduction of Leniency Plus in the Leniency Notice should be welcomed, subject to certain further modifications for it to function in the EU, such as limitations in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> eligible for immunity, increase the standard of evidence provided, or to complement it with a negative sanction to enforce disclosure...|$|E

The intention {{of this paper is to}} explore, through an in-depth case-study approach, the wider issues concerning employment relations and experience of work in the context <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> This paper argues that TUPE provides only limited protection for the rights of the transferred workers with the transferee.

The theatre of Mannheim was at that period {{one of the best in}} Germany; he felt proud of the share which he had in conducting it, and exerted himself with his usual alacrity in promoting its various objects. Connected with the duties of his office, was the more personal duty of improving his own faculties, and extending his knowledge of the art which he had engaged to cultivate. He read much, and studied more. The perusal of Corneille, Racine, Voltaire, and the other French classics, could not be without advantage to one whose exuberance of power, and defect of taste, were the only faults he had ever been reproached with; and the sounder ideas thus acquired, he was constantly busy in exemplifying by attempts of his own.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the social implications <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> is a topic that has made its way in the European law with quite enough difficulty, but became in time an increasingly discussed topic. Since the {{transfer of an undertaking}} from an employer to another could not be achieved with disregard of its human capital, the European legislator has established a legal framework ensuring the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings.</b> Currently, the main legal basis in the field consists of Council Directive 2001 / 23 /EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event <b>of</b> transfers <b>of</b> <b>undertakings,</b> businesses or parts <b>of</b> <b>undertakings</b> or businesses - the Transfer Directive.

The scope of the Transfer Directive, the obligation to inform and consult employees in advance and the transfer of rights and obligations arising from the contract of employment as a result of a merger are being approached.

40|$|The European {{transport}} market has confronted several changes {{during the last}} decade. Due to European Union legislative mandates, the railway freight market was deregulated in 2007. The market followed the trend started by other transport modes {{as well as other}} previously regulated industries such as banking, telecommunications and energy. Globally, the first country to deregulate the railway freight market was the United States, with the introduction of the Staggers Rail Act in 1980. Some European countries decided to follow suit already before regulation was mandated; among the forerunners were the United Kingdom, Sweden and Germany. The previous research has concentrated only on these countries, which has provided an interesting research gap for this thesis. The Baltic Sea Region consists of countries with different kinds of liberalization paths, including Sweden and Germany, which have been on the frontline, whereas Lithuania and Finland have only one active railway undertaking, the incumbent. The {{transport market}} of the European Union is facing further challenges in the near future, due to the Sulphur Directive, oil dependency and the changing structure of European rail networks. In order to improve the accessibility of this peripheral area, further action is required. This research focuses on topics such as the progression of deregulation, barriers to entry, country-specific features, cooperation and internationalization. Based on the research results, it can be stated that the Baltic Sea Region’s railway freight market is expected to change in the future. Further private railway undertakings are anticipated, and these would change the market structure. The realization of European Union’s plans to increase the improved rail network to cover the Baltic States is strongly hoped for, and railway freight market counterparts inside and among countries are starting to enhance their level of cooperation. The Baltic Sea Region countries have several special national characteristics which influence the market and should be taken into account when companies evaluate possible market entry actions. According to thesis interviews, the Swedish market has a strong level of cooperation {{in the form of an}} old-boy network, and is supported by a positive attitude of the incumbent towards the private railway undertakings. This has facilitated the entry process of newcomers, and currently the market has numerous operating railway undertakings. A contrary example was found from Poland, where the incumbent sent old rolling stock to the scrap yard rather than sell it to private railway <b>undertakings.</b> The importance <b>of</b> personal relations is highlighted in Russia, followed by the railway market’s strong political bond with politics. Nonetheless, some barriers to entry are shared by the Baltic Sea Region, the main ones being acquisition of rolling stock, bureaucracy and needed investments. The railway freight market is internationalizing, which is perceived via several alliances as well as the increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> mergers and acquisitions. After deregulation, markets seem to increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> railway <b>undertakings</b> at a rather fast pace, but with the passage of time, the larger operators tend to acquire smaller ones. Therefore, it is expected that in a decade’s time, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> railway <b>undertakings</b> will start to decrease in the deregulation pioneer countries, while the ones coming from behind might still experience an increase. The Russian market is expected to be totally liberalized, and further alliances between the Russian Railways and European railway undertakings are expected to occur. The Baltic Sea Region’s railway freight market is anticipated to improve, and, based on the interviewees’ comments, attract more cargoes from road to rail...|$|R
