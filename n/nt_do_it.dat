NT repudiated the project of abolishing capitalism, ascribing the failure of Bolshevism to 'voluntarism.' NT held instead to a decidedly reformist project: the left should adapt to the world, rather than seeking to change it.|$|R

40|$|Visceral fat {{accumulation}} is a {{major risk}} factor {{for the development of}} obesity-related diseases, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. Stimulation of lipolytic activity in adipose tissue or inhibition of fat synthesis is one way to prevent these serious diseases. Lactic acid bacteria have an anti-obesity effect, but the mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the administration of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus gasseri NT) on lipid metabolism and fat synthesis in a mouse high-fat-diet model, focusing on visceral fat. Balb/c mice were fed a 45 kcal % fat diet for 13 weeks with and without a freeze-dried preparation of L. gasseri NT (109 CFU/g). An ex vivo glycerol assay with periovarian fat revealed that L. gasseri <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not stimulate lipolytic activity. However, L. gasseri NT decreased the mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and its target gene fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the liver and decreased free fatty acid (FFA) in the blood. In conclusion, these findings indicated that administration of L. gasseri <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not enhance lipid mobilization but can reduce fat synthesis, suggesting its potential for improving obesity-related diseases.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} endogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin (NT) {{in the control}} of thymocyte proliferation has been investigated in vivo in the immature rat. For this task, we have studied {{the effects of the}} administration of selective antagonists of the receptors of the three neuropeptides on the mitotic index (% of metaphase-arrested cells after vincristin injection) of thymocytes. Both CCK- and TN-receptor antagonists were ineffective. In contrast, two VIP receptor antagonists (VIP-As) enhanced the mitotic index of thymocytes. VIP reversed the effect of VIP-As, but when administered alone <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not alter the mitotic activity of thymocytes.

40|$|The Aqedah in Jewish {{tradition}} is an alleged theology for {{the sacrifice of}} Isaac which has an atoning concept and has influenced the atonement theology of the New Testament (NT), {{but it has not}} been proved by the NT. The {{purpose of this article is}} to investigate all verses in the NT that are alleged to refer to Abraham’s offering of Isaac. The reflections of Genesis 22 in the <b>NT</b> verses <b>do</b> not grant atoning power to the sacrifice of Isaac. Abraham’s portrait suggests Christ as the Beloved Son, but the vicarious death of Jesus on the Cross is unrelated to Isaac in Genesis 22. Isaac is the type of Christ only in the preparation of death. Jesus as the Tamid lamb (not as the Paschal lamb) refers to Genesis 22 without granting expiation of sin by Isaac. The resurrection motif as well as the promise-fulfilment scheme referring to Genesis 22 also does not validate the Aqedah. Thus, the <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> not assume the Aqedah.

40|$|BMPs {{have been}} shown {{to play a role in}} neural tube {{development}} particularly as dorsalizing factors. To explore the possibility that BMP 2 could play a role in the developing neural tube (NT) beyond the lethality of Bmp 2 null embryos, we created Bmp 2 chimeras from Bmp 2 null ES cells and WT blastocysts. Analysis of Bmp 2 chimeras reveals NT defects at day 9. 5 (E 9. 5). We found that exclusion of Bmp 2 null ES cells from the dorsal <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not always prevent defects. For further comparison, we used a Bmp 2 mutant line in a mixed background. Phenotypes observed were similar to chimeras including open NT defects, postneurulation defects, and abnormal neural ectoderm in heterozygous and homozygous null embryos demonstrating a pattern of dose-dependent signaling. Our data exposes BMP 2 as a unique player in the developing NT for dorsal patterning and identity, and normal cephalic neural tube closure in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|The peptide {{transmitter}} neurotensin (NT) exerts diverse neurochemical {{effects that}} resemble those seen after acute administration of antipsychotic drugs (APDs). These drugs also induce NT {{expression in the}} striatum; this and other convergent findings {{have led to the}} suggestion that NT may mediate some APD effects. Here, we demonstrate that the ability of the typical APD haloperidol to induce Fos expression in the dorsolateral striatum is markedly attenuated in NT-null mutant mice. The induction of Fos and NT in the dorsolateral striatum in response to typical, but not atypical, APDs has led to the hypothesis that the increased expression of these proteins is mechanistically related to the production of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). However, we found that catalepsy, which is thought to reflect the EPS of typical APDs, is unaffected in NT-null mutant mice, suggesting that <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> not contribute to the generation of EPS. We conclude that NT is required for haloperidol-elicited activation of a specific population of striatal neurons but not haloperidol-induced catalepsy. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous NT mediates a specific subset of APD actions...|$|R
40|$|While {{the outer}} {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter is very dynamic, powered ultimately by mass loading at the moon, 10, {{the magnitude of}} the magnetic field in the inner and middle magnetospheres is very steady. Small deviations with orbit to orbit variations of typically 5 <b>nT</b> <b>do</b> occur, presumably caused by variations in the magnetodisk current. We develop an index of the magnetodisk current from models of the interior and exterior field subtracting these models from the observations, adjusting for long term effects while leaving the orbit to orbit variations. While we use the radial range from 11 to 12 jovian radii for computing our index, the same values for the index would be obtained over a wide range of radial distances. The present internal field as deduced from the Galileo fluxgate magnetometer data differs somewhat from earlier models. Whether this is due to secular variation or due to errors in the original models is difficult to determine. We obtain a dipole longitude of 160. 0 ’+ 0. 6 ” and a tilt of 9. 8 “ + 0. 1 ”...|$|R

40|$|In the {{red blood}} cell membrane, sodium-proton {{exchange}} (NHE- 1) exchanges intracellular H+, Li+, and Na+ with extracellular Na+. In hypertensives (HT), the maximal velocity of translocation (V(max)) of Na+/H+ and of Na+/Li+ exchange modes are higher, while apparent affinity for external Na+ of Na+/Li+ exchange and Hill's coefficient for H+ activation of Na+/H+ exchange are lower than in normotensive subjects (NT). We have therefore {{examined the effects of}} protein kinase C (PKC) and insulin on {{red blood cell}} membrane phosphorylation and on the kinetic properties of cation heteroexchange. In red cell from NT, PMA-induced activation of PKC reduced K(m) for H+ of NHE but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not affect V(max) and K(m) for Na+. In red cell from HT, PMA induced a greater PKC stimulation and membrane phosphorylation of band 3, 4. 1, 4. 9 than in <b>NT</b> and <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not significantly reduce K(m) for H(i). On the contrary, in HT PKC activation significantly increased Hill's coefficient of NHE. The larger activation of PKC in HT could be due to downregulation secondary to higher membrane calpain activity. Incubation of red cells with insulin decreases K(m) for external Na+ and increases V(max) of Na+/Li+ exchange. Therefore, we have examined the relationships between Na+-activation kinetics of Na+/Li+ exchange and fasting insulin levels. Na+-stimulated Li+ efflux was studied by raising Na+ up to 300 mM isoosmotically to measure K(m) for Na+ and V(max). Li+ efflux saturated at 150 mM external Na+ in NT but not in HT because in HT it exhibited a two fold higher Na+ K(m). V(max) was higher in HT than in NT. In hyperinsulinemic (fasting insulin > 10 μU/ml) HT, V(max) and Na+ K(m) were higher than in normoinsulinemic HT. In NT, hyperinsulinemia was not associated to abnormal kinetic properties of Na+/Li+ exchange. Stepwise multiple regression analysis confirmed that the main determinants of a high K(m) were blood pressure and insulin. Our results show that posttranslational effects of PKC and insulin affect the kinetic properties of NHE- 1 in red blood cells and suggest that the differences observed between hypertensives and normotensive subjects can be accounted for by PKC activation and insulin exposure...|$|R
