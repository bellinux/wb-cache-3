However, there were <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> between the coaches. The two kept in cordial phone contact and Carroll made light of Harbaugh's comments several times during the season.|$|E

It was co-produced by Wells and De Soto for ATI Records and Mushroom Records.

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, shortly {{after the release of}} the first demo, Seppälä and Kuri began searching for a female vocalist with high {{technical}} skills to replace Goodman, feeling he wasn't right for the music. Around the time they placed an ad, they found another for soprano vocalist Heidi Parviainen, who had grown tired of her keyboard duties of Iconofear. After listening to her samples, they decided to set up a demo with her and the band. It turned out that she was exactly what they were looking for, due to her ability to both sing and contribute lyrics, after writing the lyrics to Passing Bells. This completed the band's lineup, now under the name of Amberian Dawn, the result of a day of brainstorming. In spite of having Goodman leave his position as singer, there were <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> between him and the band, and he has made minor appearances on all three Amberian Dawn albums since.|$|E

When asked how she heard she was let go from The Young and the Restless from Phelps, Francis {{said that she had}} <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>feelings,</b> stating that she observed Phelps to be [...] "mortified". She explained: [...] "There are no bad feelings. Look, she's a very accomplished, powerful producer and she couldn’t get there by being petty and bitchy. Her back is to the wall. She had to cut people out because she had to balance her budget." [...] In January 2013, Francis returned to the role of Laura Spencer on General Hospital.|$|E

50|$|After the 1912 British Open, McDermott lost {{heavily on}} investments. Then, {{following}} his 1913 win at Shawnee over Vardon and Ray, he boasted excessively, was criticized by his fellow {{players and the}} crowd for this, and had to apologize; it seems there were <b>no</b> lasting <b>hard</b> <b>feelings.</b> As the defending champion, he finished four strokes behind the leaders at the 1913 U.S. Open at The Country Club in Boston, in a tie for 8th place. He tied for 9th place in the 1914 U.S. Open, as Walter Hagen won over the Midlothian Club near Chicago.|$|R

He also said he was angry at being unable to live at Ickworth, as the remaining lease had been sold to the National Trust. His half-sister Victoria shared similar sentiments, and stated that she has avoided drugs {{as a result of}} her relationship with John.

500|$|Thanks to Watson's influence, Belle is {{not only}} a bookworm but also an {{inventor}} like her father - she uses her inventions for everyday chores such as laundry, which in turn provides her with time to pursue her passion for reading. It is also revealed that Belle's mother died of a disease plague during Belle's infancy, consequently Maurice is somewhat overprotective of Belle and does not allow her to leave the village. For instance, Maurice creates [...] "music boxes playing tunes from faraway places, in a bid to sate her thirst for exploration", as he is unwilling to let Belle be adventurous due to her mother's death, although Belle harbors <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> about this. Watson's portrayal of Belle won her the MTV Movie Award for Best Performance at the 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards.|$|E
500|$|The title California is {{representative}} of the band's home state, and was picked after the band members realized that they had written multiple songs relating to its cities and culture. The title was also inspired by the season and Feldmann's studio: [...] "It was a perfect California winter, and it was sunny and hot every single day. John's studio, it's basically indoor-outdoor with palm trees everywhere." [...] Though he refrained from dubbing it a concept album, Skiba considered the songs linked thematically: [...] "big and bright and huge and dark and twisted, everything that California is." [...] "The title of this album {{was one of the most}} difficult things I've done in my entire life," [...] said Hoppus. Alternate titles for the album included No Future, which was dropped because it seemed too negative, and the joke titles OB-GYN Kenobi, Nude Erection, and <b>No</b> <b>Hard</b> <b>Feelings.</b> D*Face also reported that the titles Los Angeles and Riot were nearly used.|$|E

500|$|Initial first-run {{pressings}} of {{the international}} version of the Come On Over album during March 1998 featured White on the song, while subsequent pressings began featuring the song as a solo recording. [...] In early 1998, Mercury executives were informed that White {{would be unable to}} promote the song alongside Twain; therefore, Twain had to return to the studio to re-record White's parts on her own. According to White's spokesman at Asylum Records, [...] "We've certainly heard knocking on our door about [...] "From This Moment On" [...] being too contemporary for Bryan's sake; therefore, it is fine if they {{want to go to the}} Top 40 without him." [...] White later claimed that he had <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> towards Twain for him being excluded from the international version of the song, stating, [...] "They're releasing this song as a pop record, and I'm not a pop artist, so my feelings aren't hurt." ...|$|E

Ralf Schumacher did not comment and stated that he would watch a video of the incident before he would say anything. Their father, Rolf talked to the pair {{in an effort to}} get them reconciled. One week after the race, Ralf Schumacher said that tensions between him and his brother had eased and that there were <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> for each other, saying, [...] "It's a lot of fun when we are out there on the track duelling against each other."

500|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Owen stayed active {{as a solo}} act, Cook with his Allstar Goodtime Band and Gentry as a {{producer}} and with his band Rockit City. Herndon and the other group members had had a difficult relationship during the band's career. While he was present in each press photo and a photo of him once hung at Alabama's fan club and museum, Owen contended that he was never an official member of the group. He claimed his inclusion in photos was the label's idea, and that Herndon was a paid employee of the band, rather than a member. In May 2008, {{the other members of}} the group sued drummer Mark Herndon for $202,670 in money allegedly overpaid to him three years earlier after the band's farewell tour concluded. This money was factored into the net profit and given to Herndon before accounting was completed, an allegation Herndon has denied. The band did not sue Herndon until he requested money from the multiple live albums and songs that the band had released but never paid Herndon for playing on. Owen stated that RCA desired Herndon in the band so their image could be comparable to the Beatles. Despite their troubles, he stated they had <b>no</b> <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> in an interview years later: [...] "I don’t have one thing against him in any way in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 on British television, Mona Best, {{with her}} son present, said of his dismissal: [...] "From the point of clash of personalities, well, {{probably}} that may be it because Peter did have a terrific fan club, you know, compared to the others. [...] I'll leave that for other people to say but {{from my point of}} view we haven't come here to sort of throw sticks and stones at the boys because there is <b>no</b> really <b>hard</b> <b>feeling.</b> There was at first, but it's just the way that it was done that has annoyed us. If it had been done a bit more straightforward it would have been more to the mark." [...] Hunter Davies, in his authorised Beatles biography published in 1968, agreed: [...] "There is some justification for a little of Mrs. Best's anger. The sacking of Pete Best is one of the few murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done." ...|$|R

How are the nights are they still lonely? Are you still struggling the way that I am?" [...] However, the meeting begins to turn sour, with the singer saying, [...] "I know you're making all the same mistakes", but then adds, [...] "Still no offence, <b>no</b> more <b>hard</b> <b>feelings</b> left on silly sentiment.
