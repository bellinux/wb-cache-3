25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the war, the government recalled the silver pengő coins (deadline: 31 January 1942) to prevent personal hoarding. These were replaced by newly designed aluminium coins.

25|$|Badnarik {{was viewed}} as {{unlikely}} to win the Libertarian presidential nomination, facing challenges from talk-show host Gary Nolan and Hollywood producer Aaron Russo. At the 2004 Libertarian National Convention, Badnarik gained substantial support following the candidates' debate (broadcast live on C-SPAN). In the closest presidential nomination race in the Libertarian Party's 32-year history, all three candidates polled within 12 votes of {{each other on the}} first ballot (Russo 258, Badnarik 256, Nolan 246). When the second ballot placed the candidates in the same order, Gary Nolan was eliminated and threw his support to Badnarik; Badnarik won the nomination on the third ballot 417 to 348, with <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Above</b> receiving six votes.

500|$|While {{promoting}} the novel, Neil Gaiman {{said that it}} was [...] "unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last 70 years", a statement which has most often been read hyperbolically. However, as Clute explains, what Gaiman meant was that Jonathan Strange is [...] "the finest English novel of the fantastic since Hope Mirrlees's great Lud-in-the-Mist (1926), which is almost certainly the finest English fantasy about the relationship between England and the fantastic yet published" [...] (emphasis in original). Clute writes that [...] "a more cautious claim" [...] would be: [...] "if Susanna Clarke finishes the story she has hardly begun in Strange...she may well have then written the finest English novel of the fantastic about the myth of England and the myth of the fantastic and the marriage of the two ever published, bar <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above,</b> including Mirrlees." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1965, {{the single}} [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] peaked {{at two in}} the U.S. and at four in the UK charts. At over six minutes, the song altered what a pop single could convey. Bruce Springsteen, in his speech for Dylan's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that on first hearing the single, [...] "that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind". In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, [...] named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans. The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. [...] "Desolation Row", backed by {{acoustic}} guitar and understated bass, offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as [...] "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which {{takes the form of a}} Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical (Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse." ...|$|E

These proportions are explained as an aesthetic consideration, as the palaces are large, and the flags are thus viewed from far below, which makes them look more normal due to foreshortening.|$|R

500|$|A further {{charter of}} Alan Durward is dated 1250 [...] announces {{that he has}} granted to the {{brothers}} of the hospital at Kincardine O'Neil two davachs of land called Sudluyth and Kincardine O'Neil (together with two lands within the davach of Kincardine O'Neil, called Pathkellok and Garslogay). An interpretation of the text is that Alan Durward {{is the founder of}} the hospital, and the boundaries of the lands are described in detail, mainly by reference to streams. It also mentions that with the consent of Bishop Peter of Aberdeen and the Cathedral chapter the hospital has received a grant of the church of Kincardine O'Neil with all its pertinents, and two acres containing the church of Lumphanan, with the right of patronage and its chapel of Forthery. These grants are apparently made in return {{for the establishment of a}} chantry for the salvation of Alan himself, his forebears and heirs. Alan undertakes a forinsec service to the King for these lands, for which the remainder of his land of O'Neil is to answer in perpetuity. He also prescribes brief rules for replacing the brothers and the master of the hospital (leaving it largely to them, but subject to subsequent presentation to himself for his heirs). The document is sealed at Inverurie. A subscription by Alexander, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1330 on the creation of a cathedral prebend, states that he understands <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> to have been vitiated or abolished ('non viciatam nec in aliqua sui parte abolitam').|$|E
2500|$|Under his administration, a {{healthcare}} reform bill was approved. Rosselló's Health Reform made Puerto Rico {{one of the}} few jurisdictions in the entire world to have had virtually 100% of its population covered by health insurance. [...] Additionally, under this Reform, Puerto Rico became the only jurisdiction in the USA to have nearly 100% of its infants under the age of 2 vaccinated. [...] He led two campaigns for Puerto Rican statehood in 1993 and 1998 in which locally enacted plebiscites were held to consult the Puerto Rican electorate on the political status with the United States. He supported the congressional Young Bill, which sought to carry out a referendum in Puerto Rico to define the political status of the island. However, the bill died in committee in the Senate of the United States. Nevertheless, Rosselló carried out a non-binding plebiscite in 1998 which gave electors four options and a fifth <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Above</b> column. The opposing Popular Democratic Party led a campaign to boycott the plebiscite and called the electorate to vote for the <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Above</b> column. The boycott was successful, as the <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Above</b> column – which did not represent any kind support for any status option – garnered 50.3% of the total votes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> was {{publicly}} known until 1985, when Slade Gorton {{put out a}} {{press release}} stating [...] "He was now the occupant of this desk and would carry on the rich traditions started by Murphy."

From 1994, the överhovmästarinna are <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King rather than the Queen, while <b>the</b> court <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen is headed by the statsfru.

25|$|Methods for <b>the</b> {{identification}} <b>of</b> {{summary statistics}} that could also simultaneously assess the influence on <b>the</b> approximation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior {{would be of}} substantial value. This is because <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> summary statistics and <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> tolerance constitute two sources <b>of</b> error in <b>the</b> resulting posterior distribution. These errors may corrupt <b>the</b> ranking <b>of</b> models and may also lead to incorrect model predictions.

50|$|A reanalysis {{of these}} studies at an {{individual}} level, however, showed that typically about half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants consistently followed the recognition heuristic in every single trial, even in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> up to three contradicting cues. Furthermore, in response to those criticisms, Marewski et al. pointed out that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studies <b>above</b> formulated and tested a compensatory strategy against the recognition heuristic, leaving the strategies that participants relied on unknown. They tested five compensatory models and found that none could predict judgments better than <b>the</b> simple model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recognition heuristic.|$|R
