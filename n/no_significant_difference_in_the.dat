5|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, around 10 Mya, the bovids rapidly diversified, {{leading to the}} {{creation}} of 70 new genera. This late Miocene radiation was partly because many bovids became adapted to more open, grassland habitats. The Aepycerotinae first appeared in the late Miocene, and <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sizes of the primitive and modern impala has been noted. Fossils of obivines, a tribe of Caprinae, in Africa date back to the late Miocene. The earliest Hippotragine fossils date back to the late Miocene, and were excavated from sites such as Lothagam and Awash Valley. The first African fossils of Reduncinae date back to 6-7 Mya. Reduncinae and Peleinae probably diverged in the mid-Miocene.|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed {{from one generation to the}} next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E

Two control groups composed of random samples of the university student population reponded to the Self-Cathexis Scale Body-Cathexis Scale: one group responded to the pre-test one group responded to the post-test. Test administrations were separated by a six to seven wee!: interval, An ANOVA groups x trial and subjects x trials design indicated that: (a) <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pre-test mean scores of self-cathexls or body-catheix existed. among the groups; (b) <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test can scores of sefcatnexis or body-cathoxls existed among the experimental groups; (c) <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test mean self-cathexis scores existed among the experimental groups and the control group; (d) no significantt <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test mean cores existed among the backpacking-orienteering, mountaineering, and control groups; (e) a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> post test mean body-cathexis scores existed between the scuba diving group and the control group; and (f) <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> Existed between the pre- and post-test measures of self-cathexis or body-cathexis {{of any of the}} groups. Stepwise discriminant analysis was utilized to compare tha cathexis profiles among the groups. Results of the discriminant analysis indicated that: (a) groups which demonstrated <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pre-test mean self-cathexis scores exhibited <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pretest self-cathexis profiles; (b) groups which demonstrated <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pre-test mean body-cathexis scores exhibited a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> pre-test body-cathexis profiles; (c) groups which demonstrated <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test self-cathexis or body-cathexis mean scores exhibited a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> both cathexis profiles; and (d) groups which demonstrated a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test body-cathexis mean scores exhibited a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> post-test body-cathexisprofiles...|$|R
25|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{study examined the}} extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their native language. Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nonsense frame condition. This finding suggests that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language. In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic knowledge, they incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.|$|E
25|$|The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, {{conducted}} by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen, had {{indicated a significant}} 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12-month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any {{significant difference in the}} rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass).|$|E
25|$|Concern {{regarding}} the immunogenicity of IPS cells arose in 2011 when Zhou et al. performed a study involving a teratomaformation assay and demonstrated that IPS cells produced an immune response {{strong enough to}} cause rejection of the cells. When a similar procedure was performed on genetically equivalent ES cells however, Zhou et al. found teratomas, which indicated that the cells were tolerated by the immune system. In 2013, Araki et al. attempted to reproduce the conclusion obtained by Zhou et al. using a different procedure. They took cells from a chimera that had been grown from IPSC clones and a mouse embryo, this tissue was then transplanted into syngenic mice. They conducted a similar trial using ES cells instead of IPSC clone and compared the results. Findings indicate that there was <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immunogenic response produced by the IPS cells and the ES cells. Furthermore, Araki et al. reported little or no immunogenic response for both cell lines. Thus, Araki et al. was unable {{to come to the}} same conclusion as Zhou et al.|$|E

25|$|Several {{studies of}} prayer {{effectiveness}} have yielded null results. A 2001 double-blind {{study of the}} Mayo Clinic found <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them {{and those who were}} not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the American Heart Journal in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications {{than those who did not}} know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} HG on the fetus are mainly due to {{electrolyte}} imbalances caused by HG in the mother. [...] Infants {{of women with}} severe hyperemesis who gain less than 7kg (15.4lb) during pregnancy tend to be of lower birth weight, small for gestational age, and born before 37 weeks gestation. In contrast, infants of women with hyperemesis who have a pregnancy weight gain of more than 7kg appear similar to infants from uncomplicated pregnancies. There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neonatal death rate in infants born to mothers with HG compared to infants born to mothers {{who do not have}} HG. Children born to mothers with undertreated Hyperemesis have a fourfold increase in neurobehavioral diagnoses.|$|E
2500|$|Results {{showed that}} there was <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{distribution}} of left and right hemisphere lesions between amusic and non-amusic groups, but that the amusic group had a significantly higher number of lesions to the frontal lobe and auditory cortex. Temporal lobe lesions were also observed in patients with amusia. [...] Amusia is a common occurrence following an ischemic MCA stroke, {{as evidenced by the}} 60% of patients who were found to be amusic at the one-week post-stroke stage. While significant recovery takes place over time, amusia can persist for long periods of time. Test results suggest that acquired amusia and its recovery in the post-stroke stage are associated with a variety of cognitive functions, particularly attention, executive functioning, and working memory.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{experts on the}} disease {{are members of the}} U.S. Department of Agriculture or are of Texas A University. Much {{research}} has been put into the phylogenetic relationship between P. sacchari and P. philippinensis. Experiments have shown that of twenty-six species, only three species that can be infected by P. philippinensis show little infection by P. sacchari. [...] This difference is minimalized when comparing host ranges of isolates of the same species. [...] One isolate of P. philippinensis can infect seven more than another. [...] There is <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of nuclei per spore for these two species, and they have almost identical banding patterns when analysed through a Southern blot. [...] When looking at their genomes, using simple sequence repeats as markers, there is shown to be lack of uniqueness between P. philippinensis and P. sacchari. [...] Because of these similarities, many scientists question that initial distinction that Weston placed on them in 1920.|$|E
2500|$|In most early studies, {{researchers}} did {{not find}} clear RT differences between test items (interlexical homographs or cognates) and control items. For example, in Gerard and Scarborough’s word recognition research with English monolinguals and Spanish-English bilinguals, cognates, homograph non-cognates and nonhomographic control words were used. [...] The cognates and control words were either high frequency or low frequency in both English and Spanish. The homographic non-cognates were high frequency in English and low frequency in Spanish or vice versa. The results generally supported the language-selective hypothesis. [...] Even {{though there was a}} significant main effect of word type for the bilingual group, it was mainly caused by the slow response to homographic noncognates which were of low frequency in the target language but of high frequency in the non-target language. Finally, there was <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reaction time between bilinguals and monolinguals, which suggested that the lexical access for bilinguals in this research was restricted to only one language.|$|E
