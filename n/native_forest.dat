5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the forest areas around Pichilemu are covered with pine and eucalyptus plantations, a <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> (now the Municipal Forest) remains. It contains species such as Litres, Quillayes, Boldos, Espinos, and Peumos.|$|E
5|$|The <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> in the Canberra {{region was}} almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species {{and provided a}} resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.|$|E
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner {{is one of the}} main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.|$|E

5|$|In 1793, cattle {{were brought}} by George Vancouver {{as a tribute}} to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped {{confinement}} and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended KamehamehaI, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> for the construction of sugarcane plantations and houses.|$|E
5|$|Open country species, which {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.|$|E
5|$|Whilst the Mont Blanc massif {{does not}} contain any species that are endemic to it, there are many rare and legally {{protected}} species found within its four major habitat zones. These are the: montane forests, sub-alpine, alpine and nival zones. The major habitats are coniferous forests, moors, rock and talus slopes, plus glacial moraines. The biological richness is further influenced by the {{different aspects of the}} faces, by the geology, and by the influence of man on the lower and middle slopes where forest clearance has created open grassland. The <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> habitats are essential for the survival of many species, with the key conifer species including larch, pine, stone pine and red pine.|$|E

5|$|Subfossil {{deposits}} and midden remains {{suggest that the}} huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> throughout the North Island, extending from the northernmost tip at Cape Reinga to Wellington and the Aorangi Range in the far south. Only a few huia are known from the extensive pitfall deposits in the karst of the Waitomo Caves area and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and Hawke's Bay; {{it seems to have}} preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present. Its range appears to have contracted following Māori settlement in the middle 12th century. By the time of European settlement in the 1840s, the bird was found only in the forests of the southern North Island, south of a line from the Raukumara Range in the east, across the Kaimanawa Range, to the Turakina River in the Rangitikei in the west. In the south, its range extended to the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Range east of Wellington. Reports collected by Walter Buller and a single waiata (Māori song) suggest that the huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the South Island; however, it has never been identified in the rich fossil deposits south of Cook Strait, and there is no other evidence of the species' presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is host {{to a huge}} number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E

25|$|The {{region is}} one of the most {{significant}} forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawatu since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private <b>native</b> <b>forest</b> has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.|$|E
40|$|Plantation {{forestry}} {{contributes to}} the economic growth of many regions, but may also produce ecological impacts (e. g. on biodiversity) that can be reduced with proper management. We assessed the value of eucalypt plantations to favor habitat connectivity at the landscape scale by determining their ability to provide habitat for species associated with the natural vegetation. For this purpose, we compared diversity and composition of understory vegetation in low-management eucalypt plantations in young, intermediate (ready for harvest) and mature stages with pine plantations, <b>native</b> <b>forests</b> and shrublands. We estimated the true species richness with Chao 2 estimators and compared among habitats the average species richness (at two different local scales: per plot and per site), Shannon indices and biovolume of herbs, shrubs and trees in the understory using ANOVAs or GLZs, depending on data distributions. Differences among habitats in understory species composition and functional types were compared with PERMANOVA, and were graphically represented using NMDS ordinations. At local scales, diversity tended to be higher in <b>native</b> communities (<b>native</b> <b>forests</b> and shrublands) and lower in plantations (lowest in intermediate eucalypt plantations). Diversity across all study sites was again lowest in eucalypt plantations in intermediate age, but was relatively high in other plantations, due to a high species turnover in young and mature eucalypt plantations. Eucalypt plantations were similar to shrublands in understory species composition and functional types when young, becoming more distant to them when older, and more similar to pine plantations and <b>native</b> <b>forests.</b> <b>Native</b> <b>forests</b> were the most distinctive community, with pine plantations being the most similar to them. <b>Native</b> <b>forests</b> harbored the rarest species and were also associated with seed dispersal by vertebrates (internally). Ant- and wind dispersal were the most common in shrublands and eucalypt plantations. Given the prevalence of eucalypt plantations in some regions, determining (and improving, if feasible) their ability to harbor biodiversity of native communities becomes a crucial goal, {{in order to increase}} landscape connectivity and favor species persistence at regional scales. In the study region, eucalypt plantations provide habitat for species typical of shrublands when young but do not contribute significantly to the maintenance of the understory biodiversity associated with <b>native</b> <b>forests.</b> Considering the distinctiveness of <b>native</b> <b>forests,</b> we favor protection and, where feasible, restoration of <b>native</b> <b>forests</b> over managing eucalypt plantations for biodiversity to best improve conservation outcomes...|$|R
