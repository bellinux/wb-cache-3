25|$|Late 20th century domestic/studio models {{typically}} use up to 200 latch-hook needles to {{hold the}} stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or cam box is passed across the bed of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or {{be held in the}} <b>needle</b> <b>hook</b> (tuck stitch). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping. In the most modern machines, punchcards have been replaced by computer control.|$|E

Comparison {{tests of}} needles made in abroad and {{domestic}} on chemical composition, microstruture, mechanical property and so on, the main influence factors of the wear resistance were analysed. Approaches {{of improving the}} wear resistance of needles are given,such as hot process,surface treatment,local strengthening. Combined with finite element analysis, the stress and the strain of the <b>needle</b> <b>hook</b> were analysed. Comparative results of both abroad and domestic show that the carbide in the microstructure and structural design of needles are regarded as the main influence factors of the wear resistance...|$|E
40|$|Key words: basalt fiber; weft-{{knitted fabrics}}; knittability; fiber damage degree Abstract. The knittability of basalt fiber yarn for knitted fabrics was {{estimated}} from two aspects. Firstly {{the effect of}} 3 kinds of head size of <b>needle</b> <b>hook</b> on the loop strength of basalt fiber yarn was analysis by the experimental data. Then the basalt fiber yarn was knitted into plain, 1 * 1 rib and all needle rib knitted fabrics in 5 different loop lengths in a flat knitting machine. The influence of loop length, fabric stitch and fiber fineness on the fiber damage degree were studied {{by means of the}} tensile strength of the yarn taken from the fabrics for all kinds of fabrics. The experimental results show that for these 3 kinds of basalt weft knitted fabrics there is a best loop length in which the fiber damage degree caused by the knitting process is the smallest and the value is different for each stitch...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to observe}} the effects of total {{flavonoids}} of Radix Ilicis pubescentis on mouse model of cerebral ischemia reperfusion. Mice were orally given different doses of total flavonoids of Radix Ilicis pubescentis 10  d, and were administered once daily. On the tenth day after the administration of 1  h in mice after anesthesia, we used needle to hook the bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) for 10  min, with 10  min ischemia reperfusion, 10  min ischemia. Then we restored their blood supply, copy the model of cerebral ischemia reperfusion; We then had all mice reperfused for 24  h, and then took their orbital blood samples and measured blood rheology. We quickly removed the brain, {{with half of the}} brain having sagittal incision. Then we fixed the brains and sectioned them {{to observe the}} pathological changes of brain cells in the hippocampus and cortex. We also measured the other half sample which was made of brain homogenate of NO, NOS, Na+-K+-, ATP enzyme Mg 2 +-ATPase and Ca 2 +-ATPase. Acupuncture <b>needle</b> <b>hook</b> occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries can successfully establish the model of cerebral ischemia reperfusion. After comparing with the model mice, we concluded that Ilex pubescens flavonoids not only reduce damage to the brain nerve cells in the hippocampus and cortex, but also significantly reduce the content of NO in brain homogenate, the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and increases ATP enzyme activity (P <  0. 05, P <  0. 01). In this way, cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury is improved. Different dosages of Ilex pubescens flavonoids on mouse cerebral ischemia reperfusion model have good effects...|$|E

50|$|In Acanthus both {{adults and}} {{children}} were buried {{in the same area}} according to ancient burial customs. Various grave types have been discovered - some are simple dirt holes, others coated with clay or undecorated or painted clay urns, yet others are shaped like boxes, covered in clay or jug-shaped (jug-shaped most probably constituted the majority of infant or child burials). The grave goods, usually placed in the graves next to or above the dead, are varied and sometimes in earthen containers. Often they were personal or related to their occupation (such as jewels, pins, buckles, mirrors, weapons - though these are rare -, <b>needles,</b> <b>hooks,</b> bill-hooks, knives or - very often in female and child graves - clay figurines representing various animals, foodstuffs, or human forms, such as actors). Some of the goods are locally made whilst some are from other commercial centres and workshops of the ancient world. Burial customs, and similar types of graves which have been discovered, resemble many other cemeteries in other ancient Greek cities of Macedonia and Thrace. This Reveals the connection they had through trade with them {{as well as with the}} other well-known centres of southern Greece (especially Euboea, Athens, Corinth and Boeotia).|$|R

5000|$|A typical {{method of}} sniggling is {{to tie a}} fishing line {{to the middle of}} a large <b>needle</b> or fish <b>hook.</b> The <b>needle</b> is then {{inserted}} along the body of an earthworm which is used as bait. The needle is then stuck into a slender sniggling pole such as a hazel wand, eight to ten feet long. This is used to insert the bait into promising holes or crannies in which eels tend to lurk. When an eel takes the bait then, after a minute or two, the bait will have been swallowed whole and the line is then pulled to rotate the <b>needle</b> or <b>hook</b> within the body of the eel so snagging and catching it. [...] Eels of two or three pounds weight may be caught by this method but may require a protracted tug of war to pull them from their hole. This provides better sport and amusement than the use of traps or clod-fishing and is a good alternative for the angler when game fish such as trout will not rise.|$|R

50|$|To {{make one}} stitch, the machine lowers the {{threaded}} needle through the cloth into the bobbin area, where a rotating hook (or other hooking mechanism) catches the upper thread {{at the point}} just after it goes through the <b>needle.</b> The <b>hook</b> mechanism carries the upper thread entirely around the bobbin case, so that it has made one wrap of the bobbin thread. Then the take-up arm pulls the excess upper thread (from the bobbin area) back to the top, forming the lockstitch. Then the feed dogs pull the material along one stitch length, and the cycle repeats.|$|R

50|$|The U.S. bearing {{industry}} {{by this point}} was a $1 billion business, having tripled in size since World War II. As a leading producer of a broad line of anti-friction bearings, including needle, ball, roller, and specialty bearings, Torrington had benefited immeasurably from the prolific growth of the bearing industry, while the company's host of other products buttressed its financial performance. In addition to bearings, Torrington's eight domestic plants were devoted to the manufacture of nuts, screws, bolts, metal specialties, spokes and nipples, drill bits, surgeon <b>needles,</b> <b>hooking</b> and felting <b>needles,</b> swaging machines, and a special purpose sewing machine, lending a diversity to the company's business lines that insulated it from cyclical economic conditions to a large extent. Beyond U.S. borders, the Torrington empire comprised manufacturing facilities in England, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, and in Japan, giving the company a sizeable presence in key international markets. The domestic and international operations created a solid manufacturing entity that flourished during the 1960s. Sales, which stood at $33.6 million in 1950, totaled $67.5 million in 1960, then shot upward to $93.4 million in 1965. The following year, Torrington celebrated two century marks by reaching its 100th anniversary in business as well as reaching over $100 million in sales. By all accounts, Torrington was a thriving manufacturer—a company that had earned the respect of competitors—and now, as it mapped its course for its second century of business, it began {{to attract the attention}} of a handful of suitors intent on acquiring the venerable manufacturing concern.|$|R

50|$|As one crochet guidebook explains:Whenever you are {{following}} a crochet pattern {{you will notice}} that a gauge is included. This is an all-important guide to obtaining the proper size of the square or garment you are working on. If you don't get the proper gauge, the item will not fit properly and you may run out of yarn before finishing.Several factors affect fabric gauge including <b>hook</b> or <b>needle</b> size, although sometimes a crafter may change tool size deliberately {{in order to achieve}} a certain gauge. Accurate <b>needle</b> and <b>hook</b> sizing reduces the number of variables that affect these decisions. Additionally, if substitute tools are needed {{during the course of the}} project a hook gauge can determine whether a given tool is appropriate in advance of actual work.|$|R
50|$|Miura shibori is {{also known}} as looped binding. It {{involves}} taking a <b>hooked</b> <b>needle</b> and plucking sections of the cloth. Then a thread is looped around each section twice. The thread is not knotted; tension {{is the only thing that}} holds the sections in place. The resulting dyed cloth is a water-like design. Because no knot is used, miura shibori is very easy to bind and unbind. Therefore, this technique is very often used.|$|R
50|$|Toi whakairo (art carving) or just whakairo (carving) is a Māori {{traditional}} art of carving in wood, {{stone or}} bone.

50|$|Labels on yarn for {{handicrafts}} {{often include}} information on gauge, {{known in the}} UK as tension, which is a measurement of how many stitches and rows are produced per inch or per cm on a specified size of knitting <b>needle</b> or crochet <b>hook.</b> The proposed standardization uses a four-by-four inch/ten-by-ten cm knitted or crocheted square, with the resultant number of stitches across and rows high made by the suggested tools on the label to determine the gauge.|$|R
50|$|The most {{commonly}} performed method {{is with a}} monopolar <b>needle</b> or <b>hook</b> because of the equipment's availability and simple installation. Other common instrumentation consists {{of the use of}} a bipolar electrical surgical electrodes or a CO2, argon, or ND-YAG laser. This instrumentation has the ability to produce the intended results with a very focal approach. Typically, a 100 W electrical cautery dissector is first used to cross the ovarian cortex, then electrocoagulation is performed at 40 W, however rates range from 30 to 400 W. The surgical punctures are performed on the ovarian cortex and are usually 4-10 mm deep and 3 mm wide. The number of punctures is related to subsequent ability to conceive - it has been found that five to ten punctures are more likely to produce the intended conception. Ovarian drilling is performed laparoscopically and either transumbilical (culdoscopy) or transvaginal (fertiloscopy).|$|R
2500|$|The word crochet {{is derived}} from the Old French crochet, a {{diminutive}} of croche, in turn from the Germanic croc, both meaning [...] "hook".

Although the fabric is not known to be crochet in the present sense, a genealogical relationship between the techniques sharing that name appears likely.|$|R

Materials used for this include natural fibers such as cotton, jute, sisal, linen, and hemp which all come from plants and herbs and synthetic cords such as yarn, rayon, rattail, and nylon. Finally, they are processed into strands in which the fibers lay parallel to each other.|$|R
