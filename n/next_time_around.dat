500|$|The Liber Regalis was {{translated}} into English {{for the first time}} for the coronation of JamesI in 1601, {{partly as a result of}} the reformation in England requiring services to be understood by the people, but also an attempt by antiquarians to recover a lost English identity from before the Norman Conquest. In 1685, James II, who was a Catholic, ordered a truncated version of the service omitting the Eucharist, but this was restored for later monarchs. Only four years later, the service was again revised by Henry Compton for the coronation of William III and Mary II. The Latin text was resurrected for the 1714 coronation of the German-speaking George I, since it was the only common language between the king and the clergy. Perhaps because the 1761 coronation of George III had been beset by [...] "numerous mistakes and stupidities", the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>around,</b> spectacle overshadowed the religious aspect of the service.

2500|$|The Indians were {{organized}} into kinship and clan networks, and marrying {{a woman from}} one of these kinship networks would make a fur trader into a member of these networks, thereby ensuring that Indians belonging to whatever clan the trader had married into {{were more likely to}} deal only with him. Furthermore, the fur traders discovered that the Indians were more likely to share food, especially during the hard months of winter, to those fur traders who were regarded as part of their communities. One fur trader who married a 18-year old Ojibwa girl described in his diary his [...] "secret satisfaction at being compelled to marry for my safety". The converse of such marriages was that a fur trader was expected to favor whatever clan/kinship network that he had married into with European goods, and a fur trader who did not would ruin his reputation. For the Ojibwa, like the other Indians, saw all life in this world being based upon reciprocal relationships, with Ojibwa women leaving behind [...] "gifts" [...] of tobacco when harvesting plants to thank nature for providing the plants while when a bear was killed, a ceremony was held to thank the bear for [...] "giving" [...] up its life to them. The Ojibwa believed if the plants and animals were not thanked for [...] "giving" [...] themselves to them, then the plants and animals would be less [...] "giving" [...] the next year, and the same principle applied to their relations with other peoples such as the fur traders. The Ojibwa, like other First Nations, always believed that animals willingly allowed themselves to be killed, and that if a hunter failed to give thanks to the animal world, then the animals would be less [...] "giving" [...] the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>around.</b> As the fur traders were predominately male and heterosexual while there were few white women beyond the frontier, the Indians were well aware of the sexual attraction felt by the fur traders towards their women, who were seen as having a special power over white men. From the Ojibwa viewpoint, if one of their women gave herself to a fur trader, it created the reciprocal obligation for the fur trader to give back. Fur-trading companies encouraged their employees to take Indian wives, not only to built long-term relationships that were good for business, but also because an employee with a wife would have to buy more supplies from his employer, with the money for the purchases usually subtracted from his wages. White decried the tendency of many historians to see these women as simply [...] "passive" [...] objects that were bartered for by fur traders and Indian tribal elders, writing that these women had [...] "exert influence and be active communicators of information" [...] to effective as the wife of a fur trader, and that many of the women who married fur traders [...] "embraced" [...] these marriages to achieve [...] "useful purposes for themselves and for the communities that they lived in". One study of the Ojibwa women who married French fur traders maintained {{that the majority of the}} brides were [...] "exceptional" [...] women with [...] "unusual ambitions, influenced by dreams and visions-like the women who become hunters, traders, healers and warriors in Ruth Landes's account of Ojibwa women". Out of these relationships emerged the Métis people whose culture was a fusion of French and Indian elements.|$|E

40|$|The {{poems in}} We’re Not Going To Do Better <b>Next</b> <b>Time</b> are {{anchored}} <b>around</b> the biblical parable of Samson and Delilah (spelled “Dalila” here). Approaching {{the story from}} a secular contemporary perspective, the poems focus on the two characters themselves, rather than the religious elements of the traditional narrative. We’re Not Going To Do Better explores the dynamics of a flawed relationship and how two people relate (or fail to relate) to one another. Instabilities in the narrative’s consistency reflect Dalila and Samson’s dueling perspectives and the fallibility of memory, {{as well as how}} the choices made in a relationship can lead to many possible outcomes. The work falls into four sections: Prequels (to root the work in its source text), Encounters (relaying the relationship’s beginnings and progression), Fallout (how the relationship disintegrates), and Cleanup (the characters’ lives beyond each other). While the individual poems should be able to stand on their own, this collection is intended to be read as a narrative...|$|R

Flow <b>around</b> a stationary cylinder at ReD D 20, 40, and 3900 (based oncylinder diameter D) is first studied to validate the immersed boundary solver based on the finite volume scheme using a staggered grid. Then, a harmonically oscillating cylinder at ReD D 10 000 is considered to test the solver after the Lagrangian method is implemented to interpolate the solution in the freshly cleared cells. Finally, this approach is used to study flows around a stationary flat-plate at several angles of attack and fast pitching flat-plate. The rapidly pitching plate creates a dynamic LEV {{that can be used to}} improve the efficiency of flapping wings of micro air vehicle and to determine the optimum flapping frequency...|$|R
