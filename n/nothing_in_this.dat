[...] Anderson thought that setting the film in an urban environment like New York City would break continuity with the Alien series as the protagonist, Ellen Ripley, had no knowledge the creatures existed.

500|$|Morison and Gill had {{met with}} some {{resistance}} within Monotype while developing Perpetua and while Morison was an enthusiastic backer of the project, Monotype's engineering manager and type designer F.H. Pierpont was deeply unconvinced, commenting that he could [...] "see <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> design to recommend it and much that is objectionable". (Pierpont was the creator of Monotype's previous mainstay sans-serif, a loose family now called Monotype Grotesque. It is a much less sculptured design inspired by German sans-serifs.) Morison also intervened {{to insist that the}} letters [...] "J" [...] and [...] "Q" [...] be allowed to elegantly descend below the baseline, something not normal for titling typefaces which were often made to fill up the entire area of the metal type.

Scott of The New York Times opined, [...] "'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, {{but for the most part}} this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean". David Ansen of Newsweek wrote, [...] "Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> [...] "Hulk" [...] sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ...

[...] He spent time preaching at Northampton, but soon came into conflict with the bishop's chancellor, Dr. James Ellis, who was on a mission to suppress any nonconforming clergy. [...] After two short imprisonments, Marbury was directed to leave Northampton and not return. [...] He disregarded this order, and was then brought to trial in the consistory of St. Paul's in London before the high commission on 5 November 1578. [...] Here he was examined by the Bishop of London, John Aylmer, and by Sir Owen Hopton, Dr. Lewis, and Archdeacon John Mullins. [...] Marbury made a transcript of this trial from memory and used it to educate and amuse his children, he being the hero, and the Bishop being portrayed as somewhat of a buffoon, and the transcript can be found in Benjamin Brook's study of notable Puritans. [...] Historian Lennam finds <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> transcript that is either [...] "improbable or inconsistent with the Bishop's testy reputation." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2013, Saran {{appeared}} in an item {{number in the}} film Zila Ghaziabad. This was her first item number in a Hindi film. On 7 June, Saran's Pavitra was released, in which she played a prostitute. At {{a press conference in}} Hyderabad, she said that the film is very special for her, and that she was touched by the sensitivity that director/writer Janardhana Maharshi gave to the topic. According to a review from The Times of India, the most cinematic part of the film is a sensual number [...] "Sukumara Ra Ra..." [...] in which the camera shows in the curves of the main character. He summed up the review saying: [...] "Besides Shriya Saran's curves there is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> movie that's worth watching per se." [...] Her bi-lingual film Chandra, directed by Roopa Iyer, was simultaneously made in Kannada and Tamil languages. She played the role of a princess in the film opposite Kannada actor Prem Kumar. The film released in Kannada on 27 June 2013, and in Tamil on 14 February 2014. It became a moderate success at the Kannada box office. The film marked Saran's return to Tamil cinema after more than five years.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series.

[...] He gave the episode a score of two out of ten, remarking that [...] "it's rarely a good idea to do an episode where everyone acts out of character as only the second one out of the gate, since we don't know enough about these people for their acting strange to be meaningful." [...] Cast member Wil Wheaton re-watched the episode for AOL TV, and summed it up saying [...] "whether it was the worst episode ever or not probably rested upon the viewer's expectations. Trekkies who were looking for reasons to hate The Next Generation found plenty" [...] while [...] "viewers who were willing to watch it with an open mind saw flashes of things they came to love watching," [...] and gave it a score of D+.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E

500|$|On the film's initial release, the French critics' general {{response}} was moderate, ranging from mild enthusiasm to general disdain or disappointment, claiming {{it to be}} either a repetition of German expressionism or simply a disappointment of the director's leap from documentary filmmaker to a genre film-maker claiming the film {{to be in a}} [...] "minor genre, quite unworthy of his abilities". Franju responded to these comments claiming the film was his attempt to get the minor genre to be taken seriously. In England, Isabel Quigly, film critic for The Spectator, called it [...] "the sickest film since I started film criticism", while a reviewer who admitted that she liked the film was nearly fired. A review in Variety was negative, noting specifically that the [...] "stilted acting, asides to explain characters and motivations, and a repetition of effects lose the initial impact" [...] and an [...] "unclear progression and plodding direction give [...] an old-fashioned air". The Monthly Film Bulletin opined that [...] "when a director as distinguished as Georges Franju makes a horror film...one cannot but feel tempted to search for symbols, an allegory, layers, or interpretation. Unhappily there is practically <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> inept work to offer any encouragement for doing so." [...] The review noted [...] "a strange and poetic opening" [...] and that Schuftan's [...] "haunting camerawork allies itself perfectly to Maurice Jarre's obsessive score" [...] while" [...] Brasseur and Valli were [...] "sadly wasted" [...] and that they [...] "do what they can with almost non-existent characters" ...|$|E
