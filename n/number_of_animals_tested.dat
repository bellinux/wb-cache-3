40|$|Serologic {{testing for}} porcine {{parvovirus}} {{was used to}} illustrate the difficulties of interpreting results of an imperfect test performed on a sample from a herd. Herd seroprevalence and true prevalence levels were classified as low (< 40 %), medium (40 – 79. 9 %) or high (≥ 80 %). Results obtained from simulating herd-level testing, assuming various test sensitivities and specificities and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested,</b> often deviated from what would be expected based on individuallevel test results. Herd-level test results were evaluated as herd-level predictive values (HPV) and herd-level sensitivities (HSE) {{for each of the}} three seroprevalence and true prevalence categories, respectively. HPV responded differently, as test sensitivity and specificity and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> changed, depending on the herd seroprevalence category. An increase in sensitivity resulted in an increased HPV (low) and HPV (medium), but a reduced HPV (high). An increase in specificity resulted in an increased HPV (medium) and HPV (high), but a decreased HPV (low). As the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> increased, the HPV (low) and HPV (high) increased, while HPV (medium.) only had a minor or inapparent change, especially when the sensitivity was ≤ 90 %. HSE also responded differently to changes in test sensitivity and specificity and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested,</b> depending on the herd true prevalence category. As sensitivity increased, HSE (low) and HSE (medium) decreased, while HSE (high) increased. On the other hand, as specificity increased, HSE (low) and HSE (medium) increased, while HSE (high) decreased. Increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> resulted in increases in HSE (low) and HSE (medium), but a decrease in HSE (high), especially when the test sensitivity was ≤ 90 %. Findings from this study illustrate the difficulties associated with extrapolating individual animal test results to the herd level. Also, it emphasizes the importance of knowing the herd-level seroprevalence and true prevalence in the population prior to estimating herd-level predictive values and sensitivities, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{tolerability}} {{and safety}} of hyaluronan-based three-dimensional scaffolds as a culture vehicle for mesenchymal progenitor cells was investigated in this pilot study. The proliferation patterns and extracellular matrix production of rabbit and human mesenchymal, bone-marrow-derived progenitors first were characterized in vitro. Subsequently rabbit autologous {{cells were cultured in}} this hyaluronan-based scaffold and implanted in a full-thickness osteochondral lesion. In vitro histologic findings showed that mesenchymal progenitor cells adhered and proliferated onto the hyaluronan-derived scaffold. Human stem cells were shown to produce the main extracellular matrix molecules, accompanied by an occasional synthesis of mature type II collagen. In vivo data demonstrated that the biomaterial, with or without mesenchymal progenitors, did not elicit any inflammatory response and was completely degraded within 4 months after implantation. With regard to the efficacy of this cell therapy, even among the small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> there was histologic evidence that lesions filled with the biomaterial, either seeded or unseeded with cells, achieved a faster and better healing compared to empty controls.

The following text develops a number of issues for consideration by ICCVAM. In addition, we we refer to ICCVAM the following overarching question: Is the most appropriate course of action to (1) use the guideline without the modifications proposed; (2) use the guideline with the revisions proposed; or (3) delay further use of the guideline until critical issues (to be identified by ICCVAM) can be resolved?

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} is intended to determine the accuracy of various limit dose tests. A limit dose test involves dosing a number of animals with a chemical at a single dose, the limit dose. All animals may be dosed at once or animals may be dosed one or two at a time. The test outcome {{is a series of}} deaths and survivals. A set of rules associates a test outcome with a decision as to whether the median lethal dose or LD 50 is above or below the limit dose. An example of a decision rule would be to classify the LD 50 as over the limit dose when more than half the animals die. The {{analysis in}} this paper uses a computer model to evaluate the accuracy of these decision rules. A decision rule is defined to be correct when the LD 50 is correctly classified as above or below the limit dose. This classification is probabilistic because it depends on the deaths and survivals observed in the limit dose test. In assessing the test accuracy, the model begins by assuming the existence of a probit dose-response curve with a known LD 50 and slope. This curve is used to estimate the probability that an animal will die or survive at a given dose. The computer model then extends this result to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> by calculating the probability of each possible sequenc...|$|E
40|$|Pork {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the public health disease burden caused by Salmonella infections. During the slaughter process pig carcasses can become contaminated with Salmonella. Contamination at the slaughter-line is initiated by pigs carrying Salmonella on their skin or in their faeces. Another contamination route could be resident flora present on the slaughter equipment. To unravel the contribution of these two potential sources of Salmonella a quantitative study was conducted. Process equipment (belly openers and carcass splitters), faeces and carcasses (skin and cutting surfaces) along the slaughter-line were sampled at 11 sampling days spanning a period of 4 months. Most samples taken directly after killing were positive for Salmonella. On 96. 6 % of the skin samples Salmonella was identified, whereas a lower <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested</b> positive in their rectum (62. 5 %). The prevalence of Salmonella clearly declined on the carcasses at the re-work station, either on the cut section or on {{the skin of the}} carcass or both (35. 9 %). Throughout the sampling period of the slaughter-line the total number of Salmonella per animal was almost 2 log lower at the re-work station in comparison to directly after slaughter. Seven different serovars were identified during the study with S. Derby (41 %) and S. Typhimurium (29 %) as the most prominent types. A recurring S. Rissen contamination of one of the carcass splitters indicated the presence of an endemic 'house flora' in the slaughterhouse studied. On many instances several serotypes per individual sample were found. The enumeration of Salmonella and the genotyping data gave unique insight in the dynamics of transmission of this pathogen in a slaughter-line. The data of the presented study support the hypothesis that resident flora on slaughter equipment was a relevant source for contamination of pork...|$|E

To improve drug screening efficacy and minimize <b>animal</b> <b>testing,</b> recent efforts have been dedicated to developing cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) platforms that can provide more relevant in vivo biological information than biochemical assays and thus reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>tests</b> and accelerate the drug discovery process. Today, cell-based assays are used {{in more than half}} of all high-throughput drug screenings for target validation and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicity) in the early stage of drug discovery. In this review, we discuss the uses of different types of cells and cell culture systems, including 2 D, 3 D and perfusion cell cultures, in cell-based HTS for drug discovery. Optical and electrochemical methods for online, non-invasive detection and quantification of cells or cellular activities are discussed. Recent progresses and applications of 3 D cultures and microfluidic systems for cell-based HTS are also discussed, followed with several successful examples of using cell-based HTS in commercial development of new drugs.

40|$|Palytoxin (PLTX) is {{a highly}} toxic {{hydrophilic}} polyether detected in several edible marine organisms from intra-tropical areas, where seafood poisoning were reported. Symptoms usually start with gastro-intestinal malaise, often accompanied by myalgia, muscular cramps, dyspnea and, sometimes, arrhythmias. Monitoring programs in the Mediterranean Sea have detected PLTX-like molecules in edible mollusks and echinoderms. Despite the potential exposure of the human population and its high toxic potential, the toxicological profile of the molecule is still an issue. Thus, the effects of repeated oral administration of PLTX in mice were investigated. Seven days of PLTX administration caused lethality and toxic effects at doses ≥ 30 μg/kg/day. A NOAEL was estimated equal to 3 μg/kg/day, indicating a quite steep dose-response curve. This value, due to the limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>tested,</b> is provisional, although represents a sound basis for further testing.

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} review aims {{to focus}} attention on the effect of specific surgical and host factors on implant fixation, and the importance of accounting for them in experimental and numerical models. These factors affect (a) eventual clinical applicability and (b) reproducibility of findings across research groups. Proper function and longevity for orthopedic joint replacement implants relies on secure fixation to the surrounding bone. Technology and surgical technique has improved over the last 50 years, and robust ingrowth and decades of implant survival is now routinely achieved for healthy patients and first-time (primary) implantation. Second-time (revision) implantation presents with bone loss with interfacial bone gaps in areas vital for secure mechanical fixation. Patients with medical comorbidities such as infection, smoking, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and diabetes have a diminished healing response, poorer implant fixation, and greater revision risk. It is these more difficult clinical scenarios that require research to evaluate more advanced treatment approaches. Such treatments can include osteogenic or antimicrobial implant coatings, allo- or autogenous cellular or tissue-based approaches, local and systemic drug delivery, surgical approaches. Regarding implant-related approaches, most experimental and numerical models do not generally impose conditions that represent mechanical instability at the implant interface, or recalcitrant healing. Many treatments will work well in forgiving settings, but fail in complex human settings with disease, bone loss, or previous surgery. Ethical considerations mandate that we justify and limit the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>tested,</b> which restricts experimental permutations of treatments. Numerical models provide flexibility to evaluate multiple parameters and combinations, but generally need to employ simplifying assumptions. The objectives of this paper are to (a) to highlight the importance of mechanical, material, and surgical features to influence implant-bone healing, using a selection of results from two decades of coordinated experimental and numerical work and (b) discuss limitations of such models and the implications for research reproducibility. Focusing model conditions toward the clinical scenario to be studied, and limiting conclusions to the conditions of a particular model can increase clinical relevance and research reproducibility...|$|E

It was detected in wild native frogs in the critically endangered Leiopelma archeyi in 2001 on the Coromandel Peninsula and has been suggested as responsible for a mass decline (88 %) in that population between 1994 and 2002. We report the current distribution, host species and prevalence, where known, of Bd in New Zealand, which is essential for conservation management of New Zealand native frogs (Leiopelma spp.).

Our data included all regions in New Zealand and six offshore islands at 135 sites with 704 records from 23 contributors spanning collection dates 1930 – 2010. We report 54 positive sites from 132 positive individuals. We also detail negative findings, but declaring an area free from disease should consider the sensitivity of the test used and numbers of individuals tested. The data also included a comprehensive museum survey testing 152 individuals from five species (20 L. archeyi, 50 L. hochstetteri, 15 L. aurea, 40 L. ewingii, and 27 L. raniformis) from 1930 – 1999 using histology and Bd-specific immunohistochemistry.

Under the assay conditions and with a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> diabetic <b>animals,</b> the <b>test</b> was {{not found to be}} of value for dogs or cats...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the presence of recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in a group of twenty Colombian native horses with respiratory symptoms. Each animal underwent a clinical examination in order to corroborate the respiratory disturbance and later perform the BAL. The results obtained showed that 65 % <b>of</b> the <b>animals</b> under study <b>tested</b> positive for RAO, based on the clinical and BAL results, and that, among the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> that <b>tested</b> positive, 61. 5 % suffered a severe form of such condition. We also found an association between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> neutrophils and the color of the BAL fluid, and an inverse relationship between cell cytology of macrophages and neutrophils. It is concluded that the Colombian native horse, like other horse breeds, suffers from RAO, sometimes severely, related to predisposing factors such as accommodation and stabling...|$|R
40|$|For decades, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{guinea pig}} tests {{have been used}} to {{identify}} human contact allergens in workplace and consumer products, but these tests have limitations. In addition to using large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>animals,</b> they also provide only subjective measurements, because the allergic activity is measured by watching the skin for redness. Furthermore, coloring in some chemicals that are evaluated may mask reddening of the skin, thus obscuring the results. Since the 1980 s, investigators have sought alternative test methods that would reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> required and address the limitations of current tests...|$|R
40|$|Continuing {{efforts to}} improve the University of San Francisco/NASA {{toxicity}} screening test method have included the addition of exercise wheels to provide a different measure of incapacitation, and oxygen replenishment to offset any effect of oxygen depletion by the <b>test</b> <b>animals.</b> The addition <b>of</b> exercise wheels limited the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in each <b>test</b> and doubled the required <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tests without any significant improvement in reproducibility. Oxygen replenishment appears to have an effect on survival in the last 5 minutes of the 30 -minute test, but the effect is expected to be similar for most materials...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} 50 years, quality control and safety tests {{have been used}} to {{evaluate}} vaccine safety. However, conventional <b>animal</b> safety <b>tests</b> need to be improved in several aspects. For example, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> used needs to be reduced and the test period shortened. It is, therefore, necessary to develop a new vaccine evaluation system. In this review, we show that gene expression patterns are well correlated to biological responses in vaccinated rats. Our findings and methods using experimental biology and genome science provide an important means of assessment for vaccine toxicity...|$|R
40|$|The goal of ZEBET is {{to promote}} {{primarily}} the replacement <b>of</b> legally required <b>animal</b> experi-ments with valid alternative test methods, to reduce the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> used to the absolutely necessary level, and to alleviate their pain and suffering. ZEBET’s tasks are the docu-mentation, assessment and promotion of alterna-tive methods to animal experiments on a national and international level, and the initiation of research and development, including the funding of smaller research projects. The Expert Meeting on alternative methods for Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) potency testing {{was held at the}} BfR {{as the result of a}} decree from th...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of teratogenic effects of chemicals is generally performed using in vivo teratogenicity assays e. g., in rats or rabbits. Following the 3 R principles, {{the development of}} alternative methods is encouraged to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>tests.</b> From this perspective, we have developed an in vitro assay (mDarT) using the zebrafish Danio rerio embryo teratogenicity assay (DarT) combined with an exogenous mammalian metabolic activation system (MAS), able to biotransform proteratogenic compounds. Cyclophosphamide, ethanol, benzo[a]pyrene and thalidomide were used as test materials to assess the efficiency of this assay. Briefly, the zebrafish embryos were co-cultured at 2 hpf (hours post fertilization) with the test material at varying concentrations, mammalian liver microsomes from different species and NADPH for 60 min at 32 °C under moderate agitation in Tris buffer. The negative control (test material alone) and the MAS control (MAS alone) were incubated in parallel. For each test group, 20 eggs were used for statistical robustness. Afterwards fish embryos were transferred individually into 24 -well plates filled with fish medium for 48 hours at 26 °C with a 12 hour-light cycle. Teratogenicity was scored after 24 and 48 hpf using morphological endpoints. The test {{was considered to be}} valid if a minimum of 90 % of fish eggs developed normally for the two controls (test material alone and MAS alone). For each test material, the experiment was repeated three times with the controls satisfying the validation criteria (≤ 10 % impaired embryos). Indeed, no significant teratogenic effects were observed compared to controls in fish embryos exposed to the proteratogens alone (i. e., without metabolic activation) or the MAS alone. In contrast, the four test materials induced significant abnormalities in fish embryos when co-incubated with animal liver microsomes. For cyclophosphamide, ethanol and thalidomide a concentration-response relationship was shown and the qualitative nature of the malformations was similar between fish embryos and humans. Benzo[a]pyrene was demonstrated to be significantly teratogenic in fish embryos in spite of no concentration-response and unspecific teratogenic fingerprints. We conclude that the application <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> liver microsomes will improve and refine the DarT as a predictive and valuable alternative method to screen teratogenic substances...|$|R
