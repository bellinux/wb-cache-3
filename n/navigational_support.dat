In this paper there has been made an attempt of presenting the aims and assignments of <b>navigational</b> and hydrographic <b>support,</b> provided to secure special actions, especially these connected with planning, selecting locations, designing foundation and usage of hydraulic engineering off-shore structures, such as drilling platforms and wind power stations.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the rationale for}} a <b>navigational</b> system that <b>supports</b> context-based exploration of the urban environment. While many <b>navigational</b> tools <b>support</b> wayfinding, {{they are based on}} targeted search, requiring the user to have a predetermined destination. Existing applications do not offer navigational mechanisms that base their recommendations on the user’s unique context information. Customised recommendations present the user with relevant routes they may not have discovered on their own. In this paper, a parallel is drawn between wayfinding in the physical world and the virtual, with web surfing acting as a metaphor for a particular style of interaction with the physical environment. Similarly, the framework for this system presents suggested routes to the user according to their unique contextual setting, which is anticipated to allow a more explorative engagement with their physical environment...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{financial}} feasibility analysis and design of an on-board-assisting system for a hybrid solar–diesel-powered boat. The major components of this boat are solar panel, battery bank, speed and direction controller for dc motor, brushless dc motor, diesel engine generator (DEG), and intelligent-assisting system (IAS) to assist the sailor. A DEG is considered to maintain the ability to run the system even during night-time, cloudy, and partially cloudy days. The energy demand posed by the electrical system requires maintaining an appropriate balance between the energy sources-done by an on-board-processing element which facilitates the system to run automatically. The capacity of the battery bank is considered large enough to satisfy electrical power requirement of the system for a whole day during non-charging periods. The optimal configuration for the hybrid system is selected from HOMER simulation results, whereas a financial feasibility analysis of the proposed hybrid solar and DEG-powered boat is performed using a clean energy management software called RETScreen. The IAS also provides solutions to the common naval hazards, such as over-weight and inclement weather by employing depth of submergence detector and GSM network interface. Financial analysis reveals that the proposed system is financially feasible, while tests showed that IAS successfully provides <b>navigational</b> <b>supports</b> to sailors.|$|R

50|$|Intranet portal {{can help}} {{employees}} find information more easily and perform their jobs better, though few portal designs are optimal just out-of-the-box. In fact, especially in smaller companies, designers can realize some features found in off-the-shelf portal software through simpler (do-it-yourself) means. Most intranets have become completely unwieldy and present a highly fragmented and confusing user experience, with no consistency and little <b>navigational</b> <b>support.</b> Portals aim {{to correct this}} problem by presenting a single gateway to all corporate information and services. One benefit of creating this consistent look and feel is users need less time {{to learn how to}} use the environment. They also more easily recognize where they are in the portal and where they can go—no small feat when navigating a large information space. By integrating services and presenting personalized snippets on the initial screen, intranet portals also reduce the need for users to browse far and wide to obtain needed information, thus making it easier for them to perform their jobs.|$|E

The Russian government estimates that annual cargo traffic could reach 85 million metric tons, and shipping along the Route could account for a quarter of cargo between Europe and Asia by 2030. However, using the Northern Sea Route extensively will require vast expansion of Russia's current infrastructure in the Arctic, especially ports and naval vessels. In August 2011 Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of Russia's Security Council, stated that the poor condition of infrastructure in the Arctic hinders development there, reducing the attractiveness of the region's resources for development. The infrastructure is worse {{in the eastern part of}} Russia, which also contains more resources. Recent economic sanctions imposed on Russia have additionally weakened the NSR's viability for foreign investors and in 2014 the overall number of voyages across the passge has fallen dramatically from 71 to 53.|$|E
30|$|Most of the {{disorientation}} research {{state that}} users experience such disorientation in web-based environments, and further suggest that users employ several strategies to prevent themselves from getting lost, among which are using linear navigation (McDonald and Stevenson, 1996); utilizing <b>navigational</b> <b>support</b> such as bookmarks, history lists or maps (Dias et al., 1999).

40|$|As {{hypertext}} {{learning environments}} (HLE) {{are widely used}} in education, {{it is important to}} study and know the effects and consequences of its use. HLEs are non-linear which means that students have to develop ways of navigating through them. Thus, developing interfaces that facilitate and even guide navigation is important for learning. Research showed that successful learning in HLEs depends on both learner characteristics and HLE features. This study investigated an HLE navigation feature (<b>navigational</b> <b>support</b> with either a tag-cloud or conventional hierarchical menu), task complexity (fact-finding vs. information-gathering task) and a user characteristic (gender). Results show that neither <b>navigational</b> <b>support</b> nor gender is associated with differences in task performance. However, there are differences in information processing. Participants using a tag clouds looked longer at the <b>navigational</b> <b>support</b> and shorter at the overview pages. Combined with fewer revisits of webpages in the tag cloud condition, this indicates a more focused selection of pages. The deeper processing of information needed for the information-gathering task was reflected in fewer visits to, but longer viewing times of pages. As no differences in task performance were found, tag clouds seem to be as effective for performance as more traditional navigation structures for <b>navigational</b> <b>support...</b>|$|E

The theory of learning styles, and more specifically the model of Felder and Silverman, has been considered and applied. The developed framework has two main functions. First, it automatically identifies the learners' learning styles by tracking their behaviours and interactions with the provided learning objects. Secondly, it provides adaptive <b>navigational</b> <b>support</b> based on the identified learning styles. Sorting learning materials based on learners' preferences and hiding the least preferred materials are the two techniques of <b>navigational</b> <b>support</b> that have been applied in the proposed framework.
