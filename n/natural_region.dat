40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>regions</b> of Japan were devised through multivariate {{analysis}} using several databases {{related to the}} natural environmental elements, the preparation of which has rapidly progressed in recent years. The analysis was performed by making each sample area approximately 1 km 2 and using ten environmental elements. Firstly the sample areas were classified separately {{on the basis of}} climatic elements, land characteristics, and vegetation types. Then these three classifications were integrated to identify <b>natural</b> <b>regions.</b> For qualitative data, Hayashi's quantification theory III was applied while factor analysis was applied for quantitative data to understand the structure of the natural environment. Sample scores and factor scores were classified into groups by cluster analysis. The result of classification obtained from this was used to make a map of integrated <b>natural</b> <b>regions.</b> The relationship between integrated <b>natural</b> <b>regions</b> and three basic regions was analyzed to clarify the characteristics of each region. As a result, the Whole of Japan was classified into ten <b>natural</b> <b>regions,</b> in which the functional relationships of natural environmental elements were clarified...|$|R
25|$|The Milk River Natural Area {{is part of}} the Grasslands <b>Natural</b> <b>Region,</b> one of six natural {{regions in}} Alberta. Within the Grasslands Region, it {{is part of the}} Dry Mixedgrass Natural Subregion, {{characterized}} by the most arid conditions in Alberta, with hot summers, cold winters with little snow cover, and high evaporation leaving a large moisture deficit in the growing season. Annual precipitation averages less than 300mm (12 inches). Soils of the area are primarily solonetzic and brown chernozemic. At the next sub-level, {{it is part of the}} Northwestern Glaciated Plains Ecoregion, the predominant ecoregion throughout the Milk River watershed. With its diverse landscape of grasslands, shrubs, badlands, wetlands, and riparian woodlands, the Milk River Natural Area supports a large number of rare, threatened, and endangered species in a relatively small amount of space. Overall, 80% of Alberta's species at risk are concentrated in the Milk River Watershed area as a whole. Fire is a significant ecological process, with the last large wildfire having occurred in August 2007. It was caused by a lightning strike in Montana and crossed the international border, but was quickly suppressed after burning 125 hectares of the natural area and 38 hectares in neighboring Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve. As a relatively large and undisturbed representation of natural mixedgrass containing rare or unique landforms, habitat for focal species, and intact riparian areas, it has been identified as an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) with national significance.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{belonging}} to the Lost River Ranch lease, the land that now comprises the Milk River Natural Area was grazed infrequently and was therefore deleted from the grazing lease under the Public Lands Act in 1978 and 1979. Some resource exploration has occurred {{over the years and}} several wells were drilled but have subsequently been abandoned. Coal was also briefly mined but due to the area's remoteness was also abandoned. The Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve were established with the intent [...] "to protect and maintain the ecological and aesthetic character of a representative example of the Mixed Grassland <b>Natural</b> <b>Region</b> with minimal human interference;" [...] specifically, protecting ecological diversity and processes, native species and habitats, rare and significant natural features, recreation, education, and scientific research. Management interference is intended to be minimal and [...] "let nature take its course" [...] wherever possible, while managing some ecological processes such as fires and controlled grazing. A balance of grazing regimes is important to maintain the combination of short and medium grasses defining the dry mixedgrass natural subregion. Cattle do not graze {{in the same way as}} the now-extirpated bison did, but have been used to simulate natural processes. Grazing management maintains the grassland ecosystem in its climax state, but overgrazing must be avoided to prevent soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Rangeland health assessments aid this goal by periodically evaluating the area's ecosystem health, including measuring factors such as grazing intensity, weed occurrence, species composition, site stability, and soil and plant health. The 2011 rangeland survey concluded that the Milk River Natural Area overall is in excellent health and meeting its management goals, and that plant community health and grazing management were found to be far exceeding provincial standards.|$|E
