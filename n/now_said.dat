25|$|Physical {{inactivity}} as a {{child could}} result in physical inactivity as an adult.

Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as fat. Researchers studied 16 men over a 14-day period and fed them 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and carbohydrates. They discovered that carbohydrate overfeeding produced 75–85% excess energy being stored as body fat and fat overfeeding produced 90–95% storage of excess energy as body fat.|$|E

500|$|As noted before, {{the monastery}} was {{built around the}} Taktsang Senge Samdup (stag tshang seng ge bsam grub) cave, where custom holds that the Indian Guru Padmasambahva meditated in the 8th century.

Later, Padmasmbahva visited Bumthang district to subdue a powerful deity offended by a local king. Padmasambhava's body imprint is stated to be imprinted on the wall of a cave near Kurje Lhakhang temple. In 853, Langchen Pelkyi Singye came to the cave to meditate and gave his name of Pelphug to the cave, [...] "Pelkyi's cave".

500|$|Stone Rollin {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} was one of the year's best reviewed records. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 20 reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Kellman deemed it not just a [...] "period-piece" [...] but also [...] "the high point of Saadiq’s career, his exceptional output with Tony! Toni! Toné! included", while Kevin Ritchie of <b>Now</b> <b>said</b> he exhibited [...] "the electrifying fervour and meticulous musicianship typical of his stage show" [...] on the record. Steve Horowitz from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "shows off Saadiq's genius as a singer, writer, instrumentalist, and producer of modern rhythm and blues that pays homage to its traditions", adding that it does not have [...] "a false step or even a dull note". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau said Saadiq [...] "plays with himself to beat the band" [...] like Prince and [...] "makes these 10 tracks bump and pulse. And then you notice even the less pneumatic ones connecting as songs." [...] However, he perceived a drop-off from The Way I See It in terms of songwriting and catchiness, singling out [...] "Go to Hell", [...] "Day Dreams", and [...] "Good Man" [...] as the highlights. Slant Magazines Matthew Cole was more critical, finding the record too involved in fabricating retro sensibilities [...] "to leave a lasting impression of its own ... even the highlights are complacent genre exercises".|$|E
500|$|Chris Kelly of Fact said, [...] "By {{embracing}} the codeine-weed-molly trifecta, hashtag-friendly hooks, and — perhaps most significantly — ascendant producers, the 38-year-old rapper has maintained rap relevance, even as {{that has become}} more difficult than ever." [...] Peter Marrack of Exclaim! stated, [...] "For all its vulgarity, predictability, repetitiveness and reckless musings on drugs, Juicy J's trippy music succeeds because of its spirit." [...] Julia LeConte of <b>Now</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The whole thing isn't about disrespecting women, though. Some songs merely weave the misogyny around simple-pleasure narratives: popping molly, making money. On his third solo record, the Three 6 Mafia rapper signed to Wiz Khalifa's Taylor Gang is 'getting high like he's 18.' At 38, though, it's not super-amusing, like J is the hip-hop Peter Pan refusing to grow up among a crew of younger emcees." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today stated, [...] "Stay Trippy can be musically compelling. Granted, the words are hard to miss. [...] "Stay motivated, stay high, stay hustling, (forget) everything else," [...] he intones on [...] "So Much Money", a title that sums up the highest virtue in J's world." [...] David [...] "Rek" [...] Lee of HipHopDX said, [...] "Some Rap is tailor made for headphone listening and careful analysis of every word. Then there are songs that {{are meant to be}} played loud in public settings, and the lyrics don't matter so much. If you haven't already figured it out, Stay Trippy is the latter. And for as much flack as it receives, there is entertainment value there and it serves its purpose as a soundtrack to the 'trippy' lifestyle." ...|$|E
500|$|Ready {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} professional critics, which received an aggregate score of 67 out of 100. The score, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] {{was based on}} six reviews from website Metacritic. It received many comparisons {{to the work of}} R artist R. Kelly, while several critics noted it as inconsistent. David Jeffries of Allmusic said that [...] "Even at a whopping 17 like-minded tracks, all-night lovers wouldn't be caught dead complaining about how overly long it all is", commenting that Ready [...] "is as entertaining and frivolous as a one-night stand should be." [...] Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe said that Songz had developed as a vocalist stating his voice was more [...] "elastic" [...] and he used his falsetto [...] "judiciously." [...] Capobianco commended tracks like [...] "Be Where You Are," [...] and [...] "Love Lost", commenting that [...] "tracks like that show that he is indeed ready for the next step." [...] Andrew Rennie of <b>Now</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "slight deviations from R classic formula allow Trey Songz wiggle room to play with his multi-octave voice. This offering sets him apart from other acts and may secure his spot in the canon of bedroom crooners." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that after making his name for singing hooks on rap songs, that he [...] "shows his smooth R vocals can hold the spotlight all on their own." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 3½ out of 5 stars and wrote that Songz [...] "takes cues from R. Kelly, slyly mocking the self-parodying excesses of boudoir R while supplying the utilitarian goods: the sumptuous vocal harmonies and sultry beats upon which long nights beneath ceiling mirrors depend". A writer for USA Today said the album reflects his broad appeal, and that Songz's proves [...] "he's comfortable as a rogue or romantic. Even though the review pointed out that [...] "he occasionally falls back on booty-call clichés," [...] it did point out that [...] "his song craft shines on the edgy [...] "Black Roses" [...] and regretful [...] "Love Lost." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said, [...] "'Ready' is one of the year’s most promising R albums, and a curious one at that", commenting, [...] "the results are bawdy but never lecherous; sometimes all his enthusiastic bedroom talk has an air of childlike goofiness to it, as if he were thrilled to get away with boasting so freely." [...] Sean Fennesssy of The Village Voice called the album [...] "one of the year's best..." ...|$|E
