5|$|Even {{though the}} battle of San Lorenzo is {{acknowledged}} in Argentine historiography as an important battle for Argentine independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought in it, as {{the size of the}} forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the Argentine War of Independence. This victory did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 and yet another one at San Fernando on August 22. William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.|$|E
5|$|Manstein did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> {{the killing}} of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{has called}} for the {{continuation}} of the line to Melrose and Hawick, and eventually to Carlisle. According to the group, Hawick suffered more than any other town in the Borders from the closure of the Waverley Route, and only the return of the railway could halt the area's economic decline. At the time of the closure of the Waverley Route, Hawick was a 70-minute journey from Edinburgh. At Melrose, the southbound station platform and building exist alongside the Melrose Bypass. Network Rail has confirmed that there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the extension of the line beyond Tweedbank, although commentators have remarked that the Bypass could pose problems. A major realignment of the road would be required, as well as the reinstatement of embankments and bridges.|$|E

6000|$|It would appear, therefore, {{that there}} is <b>nothing</b> {529} <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> our believing that the record, from Abraham upward, {{consists}} of stories {{in the strict sense}} unhistorical, and that the pre-Abrahamic narratives are mere moral and religious [...] "types" [...] and parables.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the high}} German population, and resentment of them by {{supporters}} of the Know Nothing party, Butchertown was where the [...] "Bloody Monday" [...] riots of August 1855 began as Know <b>Nothings</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Germans and Irish from voting in an election. The riots killed 22 people.|$|R
5|$|In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire {{signed the}} Treaty of Bucharest, {{bringing}} the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled {{to take an}} oath of loyalty to Russia in the hope that this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding the minutiae of the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.|$|E
5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of the database could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} database. The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database would do <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E

25|$|Lack of {{democratic}} legitimacy: The monarchy's apparent popularity has only ever been measured in opinion polls, {{never in a}} formal referendum, the ultimate expression of democracy.

25|$|An Al Jazeera {{correspondent}} {{covering a}} protest on 20 July had a mixed {{reaction to the}} way security forces handled the situation, noting that while police and gendarmes respected all attendees' {{freedom of speech and}} acted quickly and effectively to prevent clashes between pro-reform demonstrators and government supporters, police also did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> verbal harassment and intimidation of the former group by vocal loyalists.|$|E

(North Carolina Railroad owns no rolling stock, but leases tracks to Amtrak and Norfolk Southern Railway.)

25|$|For {{more than}} 50 years, there were oil spills {{every year in}} the Niger Delta, with <b>nothing</b> done <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> new spills. The {{contamination}} was never cleaned, thereby leaving the water undrinkable, the lands infertile and causing the death of wildlife and aquatic lives. The conditions were compared to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R

25|$|In 1792, French revolutionary armies overran the Palatinate; in 1795 the French, under Moreau, invaded Bavaria {{itself and}} {{advanced}} to Munich {{where they were}} received with joy by the long-suppressed Liberals, and laid siege to Ingolstadt. Charles Theodore, who had done <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> wars or to resist the invasion, fled to Saxony and abandoned a regency whose members signed a convention with Moreau, by which he granted an armistice {{in return for a}} heavy contribution (7 September 1796).|$|E
25|$|The act for {{the most}} part simply reiterates {{existing}} provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have just seen. Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a debtor {{from having}} his estate sequestrated by an amicable creditor. The debtor may, for instance, arrange {{with a friend}} to whom he owes a debt, and whom {{he is unable to}} pay, that he (the debtor) will commit an act of insolvency. (He will, for instance, write a letter saying that he cannot meet the debt.) The friend will then apply for {{compulsory}} sequestration on the strength of this act of insolvency. An application for compulsory sequestration brought by a creditor who is not at arm’s length is generally referred to as “friendly” sequestration.|$|E
25|$|With {{the capture}} of Reading {{on the next day}} (26 April) the Parliamentarians were now masters of the Thames valley. <b>Nothing</b> {{remained}} <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> them carrying out their original idea of a dash on Oxford, provided Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller joined forces. <b>To</b> <b>prevent</b> them doing this was the task now set for Prince Rupert; this entailed his marching to the West of England.|$|R

25|$|On 16 March 1190 {{a mob of}} townsfolk {{forced the}} Jews in York to flee into Clifford's Tower, which was {{under the control of}} the sheriff. The castle was set on fire and the Jews were massacred. It is likely that various local magnates who were debtors of the Jews helped {{instigate}} this massacre or, at least, did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> it. It came during a time of widespread attacks against Jews in Britain. The Jewish community in York did recover after the massacre and a Jewish presence remained in York until the expulsion of Jews from England in 1290.|$|E
25|$|Detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Christie, she is {{not overly}} fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creating–in Ariadne's case, Finnish sleuth Sven Hjerson.

She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats.

25|$|An inquest {{into the}} deaths of the six men was opened in March 2006 in Oxfordshire.

The inquest heard detailed reports into the men's injuries {{at the hands of the}} mob with multiple gunshot wounds to hands, legs arms and faces. Relatives at the inquest demanded an apology from Dr Nicholas Hunt, the government appointed pathologist, as he had used photographs of the dead men in a seminar in how to set up temporary mortuaries in disaster zones without permission from the families.|$|E

25|$|Threatened by Jourdan's incursion, Clerfayt {{shifted his}} army north to oppose him. This {{movement}} gave Pichegru {{the opportunity to}} move his army against the weakened rear guard of Clerfayt's force. Despite having a 9,200-man Bavarian garrison, Baron von Belderbusch turned over Mannheim and its 471 guns to the Army of Rhine and Moselle after negotiations. The Austrians were furious at their ally but could do <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> their enemies from gaining this valuable bridgehead. At this point, {{the commander of the}} southern French army, Jean-Charles Pichegru, proved uncooperative. This allowed Clerfayt to move the bulk of the Austrian forces against Jourdan. Clerfayt crossed the Main to the east, gaining a dangerously exposed position on the French left flank. After being repulsed at Höchst, the French withdrew northward, eventually abandoning the east bank of the Rhine altogether.|$|E
25|$|On 8 September 1795, Jourdan got {{his army}} across the Rhine north of Düsseldorf. By the 20th, the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse swept south {{as far as}} the Lahn River. Hemmed in by General of Division François Joseph Lefebvre and 12,600 French troops, Count Hompesch {{surrendered}} the Bavarian garrison at Düsseldorf on 21 September. After agreeing not to fight the French for one year, the 2,000 Bavarians were permitted to march home, but the city and 168 fortress guns fell into French hands. Threatened by Jourdan's incursion, Clerfayt began shifting his army north to oppose him. This movement gave Pichegru an opportunity. Despite having a 9,200-man Bavarian garrison, Baron von Belderbusch turned over Mannheim and its 471 guns to the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle after negotiations. The Austrians were furious at their ally but could do <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> their enemies from gaining this valuable bridgehead.|$|E
25|$|The Russians had {{advanced}} considerably {{but they had}} also gained the long and vulnerable coastline with it. After the sea would be clear of ice there would be <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Swedish forces from landing troops on the shore. With the Royal Navy supporting the Swedish battle fleet there was little the Russian battle fleet could accomplish. Capture of {{the main body of}} the Swedish archipelago fleet had resulted in a real advantage to the Russians since it allowed them to gain superiority in the narrow waters of the Finnish archipelago where large ships of the line could not operate. Even the powerful explosion at Sveaborg which destroyed several of the captured ships did little to change Russian superiority in the Finnish archipelago. The Russians utilized the guns from the burned ships, and of those which burned during the winter, and constructed several fortifications on the coast, both in Hangö as well as along narrow passages leading to Åbo.|$|E
