In this work a neutron beam has been used as the probe in order to obtain tomographic images, in transmission and emission modes, of the internal structure and elemental composition of test objects respectively. Various methods of neutron transmission tomography were studied and developed. A collimated He- 3 proportional counter, a conventional combination of film/Gd-converter in a single cassette and a 35 inm camera were employed as the detecting systems. A computerised video camera-based microdensitometer was used to digitise the radiographs obtained and a method to improve image noise was developed and tested. The technique of computerised tomography has also been applied to image elemental distributions, in the section of interest, employing delayed gamma-rays emitted by the object following neutron irradiation. The technique is not suitable in the case when very long-lived, very short-lived or stable isotopes are produced therefore a technique novel employing prompt gamma-rays emitted by the object during irradiation was developed and tested in this work.

This technique is beginning to be applied in heritage science [34, 35]. The phantoms were imaged with a TeraPulse 4000 system (Teraview Ltd, Cambridge, UK) at the University of Western Australia. The pulses of THz are generated in this system by the excitation of a low temperature grown GaAs wafer with a gold deposited bow-tie antenna with a 780  nm near infrared laser with a pulse width ~  100  fs. The image is formed by raster scanning the beam across the sample in x and y directions. This is a time-domain imaging system, in which each pixel contains the reflected THz pulse signal (amplitude and phase). Thus a three dimensional dataset (x,y,t) is obtained where the third dimension is time which, if the structure and refractive index of the sample are known, can be converted into depth. A reference measurement is acquired from an optically flat metallic mirror, and is deconvolved from the sample pulse prior to further analysis of the signal.|$|R
40|$|Non-ionizing {{radiation}} (NIR) is {{the term}} given to radiation {{in the part of}} the electromagnetic spectrum that does not have enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules directly. The NIR includes electric and magnetic fields up to 300 GHz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet radiation (UV). People are exposed to non-ionizing radiation by several man-made sources every day. From highest to lowest energy, this includes for example microwave ovens, cell phones, baby monitors, cordless phones, garage-door openers etc. Extremely low frequency (ELF) waves are produced by high voltage power lines and indoor electrical wiring systems. Radiofrequency (RF) waves can cause tissue heating at high intensities. Some forms of non-ionizing radiation can induce damage of tissues if exposed to high intensity fields. For instance, exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun for a prolonged period of time is known to cause skin cancers (Narayanan et al., 2010); even moderate amounts can cause skin burns. There is a big concern amongst the public and authorities regarding possible adverse health effects from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), in particular the radiation generated by power lines and wireless communication devices. In 2002 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that extremely low frequency magnetic fields (from power lines) are possibly carcinogenic (Group 2 B of IARC classification). The same conclusion was reached in 2011 with respect to radiofrequency fields from mobile phones. UVB and UVA radiation has been classified by IARC as Group I: the agent is carcinogenic to humans. It is therefore not surprising that a lot of research was (and still is) devoted to the investigation of biological effects of non-ionizing radiation. In many cases the link has been established between genotoxicity and carcinogenicity and the possibility that <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiations</b> including EMFs are carcinogenic so it follows that studies on the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of such agents are also important issues. In our laboratory we use comet assay for testing genotoxicity of non-ionizing radiation for more than ten years. In the experiments we use whole blood samples (human or dog), cell lines (e. g. H 295 R cell line) or 3 dimensional in vitro skin tissue (epidermis) models. In our protocol a slightly modified alkaline Comet assay method of Singh et al. (1988) is used. On our poster there will be presented a brief summary of our experiments with exposure to different types of radiation (ELF, RF, and intermediate frequency). In our protocols the non-ionizing radiation was often combined with ionizing radiation to see whether the non-ionizing radiation can influence the repair of the DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation. For the evaluation of the slides mainly Komet 4. 0 image analysis system software (Kinetic Imaging, Liverpool, UK) was used, but as we got familiarized with other methods for slide evaluation like grading the comets by visual scoring into 5 categories or the CaspLab software, the comparison of these three methods will be also presented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIonising {{radiation}} {{can transfer}} sufficient energy to ionise molecules, {{and this can}} lead to chemical changes, including DNA damage in cells. Key evidence for the carcinogenicity of ionising radiation comes from: follow-up studies of the survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan; other epidemiological studies of groups that have been exposed to radiation from medical, occupational or environmental sources; experimental animal studies; and studies of cellular responses to radiation. Considering exposure to environmental ionising radiation, inhalation of naturally occurring radon is the major source of radiation in the population – in doses orders of magnitude higher than those from nuclear power production or nuclear fallout. Indoor exposure to radon and its decay products is an important cause of lung cancer; radon may cause approximately one in ten lung cancers in Europe. Exposures to radon in buildings can be reduced via a three-step process of identifying those with potentially elevated radon levels, measuring radon levels, and reducing exposure by installation of remediation systems. In the 4 th Edition of the European Code against Cancer it is therefore recommended to: “Find out if you are exposed to radiation from naturally high radon levels in your home. Take action to reduce high radon levels”. <b>Non-ionising</b> types of <b>radiation</b> (those with insufficient energy to ionise molecules) – including extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields as well as radiofrequency electromagnetic fields – are not an established cause of cancer and are therefore not addressed in the recommendations to reduce cancer risk...|$|R

In this thesis experimental measurement of the reflection coefficient in complex frequency domain is obtained from Vector Network Analyzer (VNA E 5071) when the antenna is exposed to the environment and when the antenna is exposed to breast phantom. The tumor is simulated with different materials to investigate the effectiveness of the Confocal Microwave Imaging Algorithm for breast cancer detection. In addition, we used the materials at different depths to determine the effect of antenna distance to that of the tumor response. The Confocal Microwave Imaging (CMI) Algorithm for breast cancer detection is an easy and robust technique for tumor detection, which is used to approximate the precise location of the tumor. CMI is based on illuminating the breast with the UWB pulse from different antenna locations. The relative arrival times & amplitudes of the backscatter signals is used to estimate the location of the tumor.

40|$|This {{research}} report has its {{origin in the}} notion that classical risk assessment paradigms no longer suffice to deal with complex, uncertain and ambiguous risks. Risk assessment was developed as a scientific tool to tackle uncertain consequences of human activities by organizing, evaluating, integrating and presenting scientific information to inform decision-making. Over the years, this type of risk assessment has proved effective in protecting {{public health and the}} environment from major environmental hazards with high relative risks. In the modern „risk society‟ classical risk assessment fails to handle complex risks characterized by radical uncertainty and a plurality of legitimate perspectives and values. Public authorities have to deal with issues/risks were facts are uncertain and values are contested. To answer to the increased demands of policymakers and the public for guidance on risk management new processes for the governance of these risks need to be developed. Weberian bureaucratic structures and forms of cooperation are working in a logic of specialisation of work, where distribution of information and knowledge, structures of decisions and allocation of responsibilities are organised ab initio in a stable organisational frame. Such a structure is not capable of resisting to the emergence of new risks which are often not identified as such at start and require a more integrative form of assessment, integrating inter-disciplinary collaboration on a specific policy problem that is complex, uncertain, perhaps unlimited in temporal and spatial scale, and interlinked with other phenomena. If the frame of reflexivity (Beck, 2003) is adopted, we thus have to recognise that a global mastering of these risks is not possible. What is now requested is the settlement of conditions for another type of open debate. Experiments in new forms of public participation in the management of technological developments (like e. g. citizen panels on long-term storage of nuclear waste 1, or on cars and health 2) already inspired the public administrators in their search for new procedural forms of decision making in areas of uncertainty. For a certain category of risks inclusion of the public, next to industrial stakeholders, organised environmental interest groups and governmental agencies and administrations is warranted, to integrate different opinions and values and to develop adequate policies. Network governance should be developed, where stakeholders are invited to speak up and where power structures are reconsidered and flattened. Here the authorities are recommended to exercise their capacities not as a centre of knowledge and top-down decision, but as a facilitator for communication and collaboration within networking structures, mobilising numerous experts and stakeholders, including the population itself (Gilbert, 2002), to develop new options which are socially acceptable and technically efficient (Fallon et al., 2008 a & b). This requires a different mindset where the plurality of frames and fluidity of boundaries; the need for contextualisation; the construction of unstable temporary networks, the plurality of rationalities and the inherent uncertainties, social and technical (Callon, 1986) of the issues considered. As uncertainties are recognised, scientists are not anymore expected to close the controversy but rather to contribute to the technical quality of the process. The public decision-making process (DMP) should be designed to organise the conditions for an optimal tradeoff between scientific soundness and social acceptability of decisions, in a context where the precautionary principle is relevant. The key issue, framing or “structuring the research questions”, is a method for deciding how to manage scientific uncertainty. From literature review and past studies, we posit that a better quality DMP could be achieved by using tools for an integrated and comparative risk assessment and management. These approaches rely on interdisciplinary risk assessment – relevant soft and hard sciences are engaged together into the knowledge production process rather than mobilized side by side. Concretely, it involves designing the steps or sequences of the process and selecting/developing/adapting risk assessment and management tools. More specific, within the environment and health arena there is limited experience with these new concepts of integrated assessments (Briggs, 2008). Therefore case studies on various environment and health issues were performed to evaluate current integrated risk assessment practices, multi-level precautionary approaches and communication of complex risks. Different tools as Delphi, scenario workshop, etc. were used to analyse the issues at stake. The development of an integrated approach in risk assessment requires cooperation across policy domains and hierarchical structures. In the field of air pollution a science-policy workshop confirmed that in the domain of air quality policy, public servants communicate well with researchers from scientific institutions. The protagonists in Flemish air quality policy have a common scientific background and are technical experts. This observation puts into question a common discourse postulating that there is a „communication problem' or 'gap' between 'researchers' and 'policymakers'. This discourse as a description of a state of affairs does not suit empirical reality, and needs to be reformulated in more precise terms. If there is a communication gap, it is not to be situated between public administration („policymakers‟) and researchers („scientists‟), who share the same overall concerns, but between public administrations and ministerial cabinets. The analysis of risks related to electromagnetic fields (EMF), showed how the precautionary principle is reinterpreted differently at each different political level (European, Belgian, Wallonia, Regional) in order to better integrate the local institutional and political environment. In most cases, when this principle is put at the foreground, its use is mainly symbolic and incantatory. When implementing policies it does not seem to respond to some precautionary approach, but rather to the institutional dynamics which characterise each political level. We observed the reinforcement of the European role in the field of health & environment: in attempts to underline institutional cooperation at the federal level in Belgium and to reinforce the authority of the regional government on the Walloon territory. From this case study it is learnt that the new deliberative spaces to be developed should not be embedded in the dominant institutional structures. A structure such as promoted in the wake of "Technology assessment" (Delvenne, 2011) is capable of conciliating production of knowledge and uncertainties (the science pole) with the plurality of social perceptions (the civic pole) and the specific dynamics of the relevant polity (the political pole). New deliberative spaces should be capable of developing the basis for integrated and comparative approach for emerging issues with due attention to its political and institutional dimensions, while maintaining enough distance with the dominant frames and logics. Recently the Flemish administration on Environment, Nature & Energy proposed a note (framework) to deal with uncertain risks. The proposed framework will be tested in a pilot study for potential risks related to <b>non-ionising</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation,</b> and can later be extended to other risks. In a case study on Bisphenol-A (BPA), multi-level political communication was analysed. Political decisions were taken without socio-technical debate (Callon, 1986). The BPA issue was not very high on the social or political agenda in Belgium. There was no crisis, no strong pressure form NGO's. The question was managed first by the European authorities (EFSA & European Commission). The Belgian institutions were waiting for the European position. As the political decision did not encounter a strong contestation from the industry, this was an easy step for the political authorities, in Belgium and at the European level, to symbolically address the issue while avoiding considering the real uncertainties. When the decision was taken to ban the use of BPA in polycarbonate baby bottles, it was a political decision taken with the support of the scientific bodies (Superior Health Council) but without being embedded in any social debate (what about risks related to the chemicals which may substitute BPA?). It meant that the whole of uncertainties on the extent of risks related to the multiple exposures to different endocrine disruptors could not be put at the foreground in a public socio-technical debate. These case studies on the interplay with science, policy and stakeholders, on the framing of an environmental health policy problem, and on the management of complex risks (air pollution, EMF, BPA) contribute to recommendations on their governance. The question then becomes: is it possible to organize a precautionary decision making process to deal with different legitimate frames and the necessary trade-offs when considering policy alternatives? Concretely it is advised to pay attention to the role of a focal point in the process, potentially taken up by public administrations, to the co-production, availability and organisation of knowledge and information, and to the progress of the process. Above all it is important to set up a platform for issue framing and problem definition to highlight key factors that need to be assessed: - Examine the policy and stakeholder learning network related to a specific issue, with special attention to policy domains that are affected by or are affecting the environmental and health issue at stake. Specify who has interests in the issue and who should be involved. An efficient stakeholder network analysis is important for the further progress of the DMP. define who is allowed to take part in the process across different policy areas - Examine the information database before setting up a more integrative approach, both from a scientific (including uncertainties) and technical (alternatives, CBA analysis) point of view and from the side of concerned stakeholders. Policy makers acquire information from different inputs from science, stakeholder organisations, socio-economic actors and the public at large, as well as from administrations and staff members, and are conscious of the structural and constitutional constraints. It is clear that a balanced process of information gathering that is transparent, contributes to better decision making. - Initiate and manage the process: find out who will carry the process, set up a series of interactions between administrations, between administrations and cabinets, between administrations and research, between administrations, research and the public. Usable and meaningful available information on the issue should be communicated clearly to all stakeholders. It is innovative to look at how stakeholders increase their knowledge through different inputs and through communication, information and interaction. - Iterate where needed: information gained in one dialogue should be fed back into other fora. An equilibrium between acceptability – tolerability – uncertainty should be established. - Move forward / conclude. In the total policy cycle the conclusion or decision may be revised, when (1) monitoring of implementation and following evaluation is considered as negative; (2) new knowledge / experience / issues have to take into account. - Ensure an efficient and socially appropriate allocation of the resources and an adequate management of residual risks. Last but not least, in a precautionary approach it is also required, to contribute to the public trust in the decision making process and to construct social acceptance of the final decision. Generally, a precautionary decision making process should be considered as a double-pronged learning dynamics: on one side, the authorities are required to better take into account the multiple frames which abound in our pluralist societies when organising the conditions of political trade-offs for the governance of risks. On the other side, the citizens should have the possibility to, not only understand, but also adopt the decision and its consequences and to conform to its implementation. It is important to develop specific communication processes to successfully implement these two faces of a precautionary approach in the governance of risks, while ensuring this dual learning process. New procedures are currently developed which could support the communication dynamics for promoting multiple frames and comparing openly different alternatives (e. g. open process workshop; atelier scenarios; Delphi) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> {{to human health}} {{has been a great}} concern. In the case of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, this {{apprehension}} is especially significant, since it concerns students and university staff who study, work and live in the university compound. This worry is further justified with the existence of several Mobile Telephone Base Stations (MTBS), television and radio broadcast towers, high-voltage electric cables and electrical substations which are known to be sources of electromagnetic fields ranging from the Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) to the Radiofrequency (RF) range. This creates a serious quandary, since there are no safety guidelines focusing on limiting the non-ionizing radiation exposure dose to students and staff members. The objectives of this study are two-fold: 1) to monitor the <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> level at various locations within the university compound to provide current data compared with exposure limits suggested by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) and International Non-Ionizing Radiation Committee (INIRC) of the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA) and 2) to develop a <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> policy for Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) from both the administrative and technical aspects. Six locations were chosen for monitoring based on the presence of radiation sources and/or student/staff occupancy, determined {{with the assistance of the}} Office of Occupational Safety and Health, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. Three of these locations contain sources which emit radiation in the ELF range, while the remaining three emit RF radiation. Results showed that the ratio percentage between the RF and ELF exposures at these locations, in comparison to the MCMC and IRPA/INIRC exposure limits,were 0. 2 % and 2. 8 %, respectively. These results showed that for the time being, the exposures at all identified <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> hotspots does not exceed the exposure limit suggested by both MCMC (which adopts the recommendation of ICNIRP, 1998) and IRPA/INIRC. However, a <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> policy for UKM is still imperative, to serve as a reference and guideline for future activities that may contribute to the <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> capacity. Subsequently, concerns were raised during the monitoring activities, especially amongst students who highlighted the necessity of a subject that introduces <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> and its possible biological risk, as was offered by the Nuclear Science Department, before the restructuring of the Faculty of Physics and Applied Science in 2001...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{discussed}} ever since among the scientific communities, whether <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> can alter or harm biological systems. While the mechanisms of underlying effects of ionising radiation are well understood and described here, there is less understanding in the effects caused by <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> except for heating effects. Recent results have been interpreted, that numerical chromosome aberrations may be induced by exposure to RF radiation. Our own experiments employing the &micro;TEM cell yield results similar to findings observed for aneugenic-inducing chemical agents which can cause spindle disturbances. For comparison purpose to the effects caused by those agents we used the well established human-hamster hybrid (AL) cell line to evaluate the biological effects after exposure to RF radiation (835 MHz) ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the use of <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> in health services and the effects on patients and on public health in general. It points out the controllable problems where (policy-) measures are possible. In health services the use of <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> for therapeutic and diagnostic means increases. The controllable problems are in the field of UV-therapy, the use of RF in physiotherapy and ultrasound in prenatal diagnostics. Also in non-medical environments people can be exposed to <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation.</b> Protection against overexposure from UV radiation (both solar and from artificial sources) can effectively contribute to a significant reduction of the total dose. Also information and education about the negative effects can lead to adaptation of behaviour and a reduction of skin cancer incidence on the long term. Exposure to laser radiation (e. g. in disco's) can lead to eyedamage. Further research should indicate if surveillance or regulations for the use of these high power lasers are necessary. Technical (PTT) standards for exposure from RF-emitters protect against health hazards. Exposure to RF radiation from hand held telephones (GSM) and theft-prevention equipment can possible interfere with medical implants like pacemakers or insulin pumps. Radio- and tv-broadcasting emitters in the Netherlands do not exceed standards and do not lead to acute health hazards. Exposure to radiation from powerlines in the Netherlands is below the limits, but for certain domestic apparatus they can be exceeded. Specific information can create clarity on the actual exposure and contribute to reducing the concern among people...|$|E
40|$|A {{major concern}} when using Charge-Coupled Devices in hostile {{radiation}} environments is radiation induced Charge Transfer Inefficiency. The displacement damage from <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> incident on the detector creates defects within the silicon lattice, these defects can capture and hold charge {{for a period}} of time dependent on the operating temperature and the type of defect, or “trap species”. The location and type of defect can be determined to a high degree of precision using the trap-pumping technique, whereby background charges are input and then shuffled forwards and backwards between pixels many times and repeated using different transfer timings to promote resonant charge-pumping at particular defect sites. Where the charge transfer timings used in the trap-pumping process are equivalent to the nominal CCD readout modes, a simple “trap-map” of the defects that will most likely contribute to charge transfer inefficiency in the CCD array can be quickly generated. This paper describes a concept for how such a “trap-map” can be used to correct images subject to <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> damage and provides initial results from an analytical algorithm and our recommendations for future developments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the regulatory acts in <b>non-ionising</b> <b>radiation</b> in the world, with a special emphasis on basic guidelines issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). ICNIRP Guidelines are implemented in many countries worldwide. Croatia has also implemented them indirectly through the European Recommendation 1999 / 519 /EC. The Croatian regulatory acts include the <b>Non-Ionising</b> <b>Radiation</b> Protection Act, Ordinance on Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Protection, and the Ordinance on Basic Requirements for Devices which produce Optical Radiation and Measures for Optical Radiation Protection. Dosimetry and densitometry are compliant with relevant international and European standards. The paper presents an example of densitometric human exposure assessment in complex indoor exposure conditions. In spite of a high number of indoor and outdoor sources and the “worst-case exposure assessment”, the results are within the limits defined by the Croatian EMF Ordinance. KEY WORDS: densitometry, dosimetry, electromagnetic field, regulatory acts Fast-paced application of new wireless technologies makes electromagnetic fields (EMF) ever more present in human society, increasing their total level in the environment.
