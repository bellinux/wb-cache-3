40|$|Options {{have become}} {{extremely}} popular, {{so popular that}} in many cases more money is invested in them in the underlying assets. Options are extremely attractive to investors, both for speculation and for hedging. The investors can make a greater profit relative to their original payout than you would do by simply purchasing the shares. A financial institution that sells an option to a client in the over-the-counter-markets is faced with the problem of managing its risk. Some strategies for facing this problem are <b>naked</b> <b>position</b> strategy, covered position strategy, stop loss strategy and delta hedging strategy. It can be seen from this article that delta hedging strategy is more powerful than other strategies because this strategy can be done for any condition, in the money or out of the money...|$|E
40|$|In {{the most}} common {{mechanism}} for price stabilization in IPOs, the underwriter distributes stocks in excess of what was contracted (overallotment) and eventually covers this short <b>naked</b> <b>position</b> by purchasing stocks in the secondary market (Aftermarket short covering, ASC). This mechanism {{can be used to}} avoid price drop or price volatility. This article provides a description of such activity in Brazil. We investigate the determinants of price stabilization in three aspects: amount overallotted, occurrence of ASC and its intensity. Our results indicate that price stabilization is an important activity in Brazilian IPOs and quite similar to that occurring in the US. The three different aspects of price stabilization have different determinants. The amount overallotted depends only on the ex-ante demand conditions. ASC occurs mostly on IPOs characterized by high risk, low ex-ante demand and carried by reputable underwriters. The intensity of the ASC increases with the riskiness and decreases with the ex-ante demand. None of the existing models fully explain these results...|$|E
50|$|The {{only option}} the {{underwriting}} syndicate has for closing a <b>naked</b> short <b>position</b> is to purchase {{shares in the}} aftermarket. Unlike shares sold short related to the greenshoe option, the underwriting syndicate risks losing money by engaging in naked short sales. If the offering is popular and the price rises above the original offering price, the syndicate may {{have no choice but}} to close a <b>naked</b> short <b>position</b> by purchasing shares in the aftermarket at a price higher than that for which they had sold the shares. On the other hand, if the price of the offering falls below the original offer price, a <b>naked</b> short <b>position</b> gives the syndicate greater power to exert upward pressure on the issue than the greenshoe option alone, and this position then becomes profitable to the underwriting syndicate.|$|R
40|$|This master's thesis aims at {{studying}} {{the impact of}} naked sovereign CDS trading by establishing a sequential trading model where {{the evolution of the}} market microstructure bid-ask spread is taken into account. The underlying-asset-covered positions as welle as the <b>naked</b> <b>positions</b> are distinguished according to their different motifs in trading CDS. The main findings of our model suggest that the naked traders always prefer to deviate from the covered traders' equilibrium strategies in pursuit of the maximum profit, by manipulating following traders' belief and deceiving them into the wrong informational cascade. Consequently, an earlier start of a more possible wrong cascading effect occurs, resulting in a less accurate market estimation of the underlying country's default risk. sovereign CDS covered and naked trading microstructure cascading effect liar equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for managing international investment portfolios. There are two different risk factors affecting this problem; the market risk and the currency risk. We develop models that address these risk factors in an integrated manner. Our framework has three fundamental components. The first component is the scenario generation procedure. The scenarios are generated so that the first four marginal moments and correlations of our random variables, which are the asset returns and exchange rates, match prespecified target values. These target values are the historical moments and correlations. The second component is {{the development and implementation}} of scenario-based stochastic programming models for international portfolios, where selective hedging strategies are used to control the exposure to the risk factors. Forward contacts are used to hedge the currency risk, while stock options hedge the market risk of the positions. Thus, the third component is the pricing of these options consistently with the postulated scenarios of the underlying assets, and their incorporation in stochastic programming models. Two classes of options are considered. The unhedged and fully protected options (quantos). We investigate the ex ante and ex post performance of international portfolios. The results indicate that increasingly integrated views towards risks are more effective compared to totaly <b>naked</b> <b>positions.</b> Overall, incorporating derivative securities is an efficient way of minimizing the downside risk, while improving the performance of international portfolios. ...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{types of}} gold [...] "{{accounts}}" [...] are available. Different accounts impose varying types of intermediation between {{the client and}} their gold. One {{of the most important}} differences between accounts is whether the gold is held on an allocated (fully reserved) or unallocated (pooled) basis. Unallocated gold accounts are a form of fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of a}} run on the issuer's gold on deposit. Another major difference is the strength of the account holder's claim on the gold, in the event that the account administrator faces gold-denominated liabilities (due to a short or <b>naked</b> short <b>position</b> in gold for example), asset forfeiture, or bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|Until 1967, the {{interior}} was a magnificent art-deco auditorium, with a ribbed ceiling, concealing stripped lighting. Two bas relief sculptures of <b>naked</b> nymphs were <b>positioned</b> on the side walls, as if leaping towards the screen. All the seats were covered in a faux-leopard skin material. A modernisation in 1967 destroyed most of this grandeur, although since the 1980s, restoration programmes have restored much of the detail, including the figures, seating pattern {{and much of the}} ribbed effect on the ceiling.|$|R

[...] He was found in a compromising <b>position,</b> <b>naked</b> in the shower with Susannah, who escaped with minor injuries. Her brother Jason was killed by falling rubble trying to rescue her father. Nikki took the tragedy well, however her mother Margi didn't and moved to Brussels, while her younger sister Emily also took it badly and started a hate-campaign against Susannah.|$|R
5000|$|Mu Virginis (μ Vir, μ Virginis) {{is a star}} in {{the zodiac}} {{constellation}} of Virgo. It was listed in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket as rijl al-‘awwa’, Arabic رجل العوى, meaning [...] "The foot of the barking (dog)". With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.88, it is bright enough to be seen with the <b>naked</b> eye. The <b>position</b> of the star near the celestial equator means it is visible from most of the Earth. Based upon parallax measurements, Mu Virginis is located some 59.6 light years from the Sun.|$|R
5000|$|The SEC {{permits the}} {{underwriters}} {{to engage in}} naked short sales of the offering. The underwriters create a <b>naked</b> short <b>position</b> either by selling short more shares than the amount stated in the greenshoe option, or by selling short shares {{where there is no}} greenshoe option. It is theoretically possible for the underwriters to naked short sell {{a large percentage of the}} offering. The SEC also permits the underwriting syndicate to place stabilizing bids on the stock in the aftermarket. However, underwriters of initial and follow-on offerings in the United States rarely use stabilizing bids to stabilize new issues. Instead, they engage in short selling the offering and purchasing in the aftermarket to stabilize new offerings. [...] "Recently, the SEC staff has learned that in the US, syndicate covering transactions have replaced (in terms of frequency of use) stabilization as a means to support post-offering market prices. Syndicate covering transactions may be preferred by managing underwriters primarily because they are not subject to the price and other conditions that apply to stabilization." ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the risk and}} return {{of a wide variety}} of trading strategies involving options on the S&P 500. We consider <b>naked</b> and covered <b>positions,</b> straddles, strangles, and calendar spreads, with different maturities and levels of moneyness. Overall, we ﬁnd that strategies involving short positions in options generally compensate the investor with very high Sharpe ratios, which are statistically signiﬁcant even after taking into account the non-normal distribution of returns. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the strategies’ returns are substantially higher than warranted by asset pricing models. We also ﬁnd that the returns of the strategies could only be justiﬁed by jump risk if the probability of market crashes were implausibly higher than it has been historically. We conclude that the returns of option strategies constitute a very good deal. However, exploiting this good deal is extremely diffcult. We ﬁnd that trading costs and margin requirements severely condition the implementation of option strategies. Margin calls force investors out of a trade precisely when it is losing money. Taking margin calls into account turns the Sharpe ratio of some of the best strategies negative...|$|R
5000|$|The many self-portraits of Egon Schiele set new {{standards}} of openness, or perhaps exhibitionism, representing him <b>naked</b> in many <b>positions,</b> sometimes masturbating or with an erection, as in Eros (1911). Stanley Spencer was to follow somewhat in this vein. Max Beckmann was a prolific painter of self-portraits [...] as was Edvard Munch who made great numbers of self-portrait paintings (70), prints (20) and drawings or watercolours (over 100) throughout his life, many showing him being badly treated by life, and especially by women. Obsessively using the self-portrait {{as a personal}} and introspective artistic expression was Horst Janssen, who produced hundreds of self-portraits depicting him {{a wide range of}} contexts most notably in relation to sickness, moodyness and death. The 2004 exhibition [...] "Schiele, Janssen. Selbstinszenierung, Eros, Tod" [...] (Schiele, Janssen: Self-dramatisation, Eros, Death) at the Leopold Museum in Vienna paralleled the works of Egon Schiele and Horst Janssen, both heavily drawing on sujets of erotica and death in combination with relentless self-portraiture. Frida Kahlo, who following a terrible accident spent many years bedridden, with only herself for a model, was another painter whose self-portraits depict great pain, in her case physical as well as mental. Her 55-odd self-portraits include many of herself from the waist up, and also some nightmarish representations which symbolize her physical sufferings.|$|R
