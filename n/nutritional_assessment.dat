A care plan tailored for specific circumstances is prepared after a comprehensive assessment has taken place, and is continuously monitored and modified as needed.A comprehensive geriatric care assessment is thorough and can take anywhere from 2 to 5 hours in length, this of course is broken down into 2 or 3 assessment visits with the patient/family members. The comprehensive assessment is really a compilation of smaller individual assessments with the first one being a primary intake assessment which includes demographic type data {{as well as a}} health history, social history, and legal/financial history. From there, a medication profile assessment is included, as well as an assessment of ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) and IADLs (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living).

DESIGN: Prospective study. SUBJECTS: 65 (21 males) patients older than 65 years. SETTING: Sub-acute care facility. MEASUREMENTS: The Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment,</b> standard <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment,</b> 'rapid screen' and discharge outcome. RESULTS: The prevalence of under-nutrition was high, ranging from 35. 4 % to 43. 1 %, depending on the screening method used. Compared to the standard <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment</b> the 'rapid screen' consisting of (1) body mass index 7. 5 % over the previous 3 months and the two-tiered Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment</b> process (at risk subjects (46 % of total) further evaluated using standard <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment)</b> had sensitivities of 78. 6 and 89. 5 % and specificities of 97. 3 and 87. 5 % respectively in diagnosing under-nutrition. Under-nourished patients as identified by the standard <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment</b> (50. 0 % (under-nourished) versus 21. 6 % (nourished); P = 0. 017), the two-tiered Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment</b> process (50. 0 % (under-nourished) versus 21. 6 % (nourished); P = 0. 017) and the rapid screen (56. 5 % (under-nourished) versus 21. 4 % (nourished); P = 0. 004) {{were more likely to}} be discharged to an acute hospital or an accommodation with increased support (poor discharge outcomes) than nourished patients. CONCLUSION: All screening methods identified patients more likely to have a poor discharge outcome. The highly specific but less sensitive 'rapid screen' may be the best method in facilities with limited resources as it can be easily incorporated into nursing/medical admissions and avoids biochemical investigations in all patients.

Aim: To assess the concordance of the mini <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment</b> with body mass index and dietary parameters in Chilean free living elders. Material and methods: Subjects aged 70 years old or more, coming from four public outpatient clinics were studied. In all, the mini <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment,</b> dietary intake using 24 h recalls and anthropometric parameters, were measured. Energy intake was evaluated using FAO/WHO/UNU guidelines.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Nutritional</b> <b>assessment</b> is a {{prerequisite}} for nutritional delivery. Patients in intensive care suffer from under-nutrition and nutritional failure due to poor assessment. Nursing ability to early detect nutritional failure is the key for minimizing imparities in practice and attaining nutritional goals. Aim {{of this article is to}} examine the ability of Jordanian ICU nurses to assess the nutritional status of critically ill patients, considering biophysical and biochemical measures. Methods: This cross sectional study recruited nurses from different health sectors in Jordan. ICU nurses from the governmental sector (two hospitals) and private sectors (two hospitals) were surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire. Nurses' knowledge and responsibility towards <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment</b> were examined. Results: A total of 220 nurses from both sectors have completed the questionnaire. Nurses were consistent in regard to knowledge, responsibility, and documentation of <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment.</b> Nurses in the governmental hospitals inappropriately perceived the application of aspiration reduction measures. However, they scored higher in applying physical examination and anthropometric assessment.   Although both nurses claimed higher use of biochemical measurements, biophysical measurements were less frequently used. Older nurses with longer clinical experience exhibited better adherence to biophysical measurement than younger nurses. Conclusion: Nursing <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment</b> is still suboptimal to attain nutritional goals. Assessment of body weight, history of nutrition intake, severity of illness, and function of gastrointestinal tract should be considered over measuring albumin and pre-albumin levels.   A well-defined evidence-based protocol as well as a multidisciplinary nutritional team for <b>nutritional</b> <b>assessment</b> is the best to minimize episodes of under-nutrition...|$|E
40|$|The study {{determined}} {{whether a}} new version of the Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment</b> that adopted population-specific anthropometric cut-points would improve the mortality-predicting ability in institutionalised Taiwanese older people. Routine screening is the key for detecting emerging malnutrition, but the tool must be simple, reliable and easy-to-use to be well accepted. The Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment</b> can meet these requirements, but for non-Western populations, modifications based on anthropometric considerations are needed. The study purposively sampled 208 residents, aged > 65 [*]years, of a long-term care institution in Central Taiwan. Subjects were free of acute infection/disease and able to communicate. A university human-subject-study ethics committee approved the protocol. The study included biochemical measurements and a structured questionnaire for eliciting personal data and answers to questions in the Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment.</b> Follow-up survival/mortality was tracked for two consecutive six-month periods and analysed according to nutritional statuses graded with the original or a modified Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment.</b> The modified version adopted population-specific anthropometric cut-points and was without body mass index. The modification improved the mortality-predictive ability. Mortality rates for the first six months were 8 · 7, 3 · 9 and 0 % according to the original Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment</b> and 10 · 6, 3 · 4 and 0 % according to the modified version for subjects rated malnourished, at risk of malnutrition and normal, respectively. The mortality-predictive ability of both versions weakened after six months. Both versions can predict follow-up mortality, but the modified version has improved ability. For best results, the tool should be applied every six months or less (shorter for more frail older people) to screen for new cases of at-risk individuals. The Mini <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Assessment</b> that adopts population-specific anthropometric cut-points may have improved nutritional-risk and mortality-risk predictive abilities.
