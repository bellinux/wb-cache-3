30|$|The {{notion of}} {{provenance}} had been originally introduced {{to document the}} origin, history, chain of custody, derivation, or process of art objects. When we use provenance {{in the field of}} information technology, the dual of the art object is the data. Usually, when data item is processed and transmitted across large-scale systems, the provenance size may largely exceeds the size of the data themselves; for example, Jayapandian et al. report that in the MiMI system, for data with size of 270 MB, the provenance for the data is approximately equal to 6 GB [12]. Therefore, in order to limit the provenance size, different provenance systems retain only certain provenance information. In the context of WSNs, the provenance of a data packet refers to where the packet is produced and how it is delivered, e.g., forwarded and/or aggregated, to the base station (BS) [14]. It is important to notice that in WSNs provenance is useful not only for data trustworthiness assessment, but also for <b>network’s</b> <b>troubleshooting.</b>|$|R

By combining passive network monitoring data (trace based) with user or terminal location, quality measures such as coverage and quality maps can be generated. Compared to wired networks, management and monitoring of WLANs have additional challenges because the performance is heavily dependent on variable and unpredictable characteristics of the physical media (i. e. the air link). Consequently, there is an increasing {{need to understand how}} wireless technology will affect <b>network</b> management, <b>troubleshooting</b> and performance monitoring...|$|R
