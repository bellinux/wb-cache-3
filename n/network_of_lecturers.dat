40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} way of educating nature management students, in which students are trained to solve relatively simple and technical problems, is no longer sufficient. Societies are changing towards a network society, which makes nature management more complex. This asks for new competences and new learning strategies in nature management education. Therefore, VHL University of Applied Sciences started two pilots in 2012. The goal of these pilots {{was to create a}} <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>lecturers</b> and students, nature conservationists and local stakeholders to create sustainable and innovative nature management strategies within a local context. Network learning was the leading learning strategy in both these pilots. In this paper we use these pilots for an evaluation of network learning as an educational principle for higher education. The pilot will be assessed on criteria based on three perspectives: 1) the changing society, 2) educational theories and 3) a theory on learning networks. The paper results in recommendations for further use of network learning as an educational principle in general...|$|E

At her birth she had a caul over her face, a {{membrane}} [...] "veil" [...] which is thought in some folk religions to indicate special powers. Her parents, though initially Presbyterian, {{became interested in the}} Universalist religion, and in early 1851 joined the Hopedale Community, an intentional community in Hopedale, Massachusetts. Led by Adin Ballou, the community was committed to abolitionism, temperance, socialism, and nonviolence. Finding Hopedale too crowded, the Scott family moved to Waterloo, Wisconsin later that year to found a similar intentional community, with the blessings of Adin Ballou. It was there, in early 1852, that Cora first exhibited her ability to fall into a trance and write messages and speak in ways very unlike herself. Her parents soon began to exhibit her to the surrounding country, and in this way she became a part <b>of</b> the <b>network</b> <b>of</b> trance <b>lecturers</b> that characterized the Spiritualist movement.|$|R

This activity was carried out {{within the framework of}} the ERASMUS programme for lecturers; the first author, who is a lecturer at the University of Granada (Spain), travelled to the TFH George Agricola University in Bochum (Germany), with the aim of teaching Engineering Geology undergraduates for a week. The theme of the course was Geological Hazards and Risk Management, which is a “hot topic” due to the great number of disasters that have been happening around the world and the importance of their consequences (human and material losses). This course was considered very appropriate, as it is broadly related to the Engineering Geology Degree and there were no contents concerning Natural Hazards in these studies. We describe the parts of the intensive course and present the evaluation-test results. This test was focused on the students’ opinion and acquired knowledge, in terms of connecting the course contents with other topics and real life. Moreover, the innovative didactical method used was much appreciated, including the techniques that stimulate responsibility, group cooperation, educational self-management and the students’ awareness and control over their own knowledge. The planning and development of the course led to productive and interesting debates among several lecturers from different European universities who attended the classes. As a result, an international <b>network</b> <b>of</b> university <b>lecturers</b> was also constituted and currently continues working...|$|R
