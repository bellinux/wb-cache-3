5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} group 17 elements, tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior {{common to the}} halogens. For example, the extant {{members of the group}} routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable electronic configuration of a noble gas, one having eight electrons (octet) in its valence shell. This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; tennessine would be the least willing to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it is predicted to form, −1 {{is expected to be the}} least common. The standard reduction potential of the Ts/Ts− couple is predicted to be −0.25V; this value is negative and thus tennessine should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> the −1 oxidation state under standard conditions, unlike all {{the previous}} halogens.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{orthodox}} Marxists or economists {{inspired by}} Marx (including Karl Kautsky, Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky, Nikolai Bukharin, Rudolf Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg, Vladimir Lenin, Otto Bauer, Fritz Sternberg, Natalia Moszkowska, Paul Sweezy, Kozo Uno and Makoto Itoh) provided alternative crisis theories, focusing variously on the anarchy of capitalist production, sectoral disproportions, underconsumption and realization problems, labor-shortage and population pressures, credit insufficiency, excess capital and wages squeezing profits. According to Professor Costas Lapavitsas, [...] "both Hilferding and Lenin – indeed {{most of the}} leading Marxists of their time – treated crises as complex and multifaceted phenomena that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> a simple theory of the rate of profit to fall. The notion that the normal state of capitalist production is to malfunction due to a persistently excessive organic composition of capital, or even due to falling 'surplus' absorption, would have been alien to classical Marxists." [...] Implicitly or explicitly, it was argued by these Marxist economists that economic crises, although they are a fairly regular occurrence {{in the last two}} centuries of capitalist development, do not all have exactly the same causes. There are all sorts of things that can go wrong with capitalism, throwing the markets out of kilter.|$|E
2500|$|Franz Boas founded modern American {{anthropology}} {{with the}} establishment of the first graduate program in anthropology at Columbia University in 1896. [...] At the time the dominant model of culture was that of cultural evolution, which posited that human societies progressed through stages of savagery to barbarism to civilization; thus, societies that for example are based on horticulture and Iroquois kinship terminology are less evolved than societies based on agriculture and Eskimo kinship terminology. [...] One of Boas's greatest accomplishments was to demonstrate convincingly that this model is fundamentally flawed, empirically, methodologically, and theoretically. Moreover, he felt that our knowledge of different cultures was so incomplete, and often based on unsystematic or unscientific research, {{that it was impossible to}} develop any scientifically valid general model of human cultures. Instead, he established the principle of cultural relativism and trained students to conduct rigorous participant observation field research in different societies. Boas understood the capacity for culture to involve symbolic thought and social learning, and considered the evolution of a capacity for culture to coincide with the evolution of other, biological, features defining genus Homo. [...] Nevertheless, he argued that culture could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> biology or other expressions of symbolic thought, such as language. Boas and his students understood culture inclusively and resisted developing a general definition of culture. Indeed, they resisted identifying [...] "culture" [...] as a thing, instead using culture as an adjective rather than a noun. Boas argued that cultural [...] "types" [...] or [...] "forms" [...] are always in a state of flux. His student Alfred Kroeber argued that the [...] "unlimited receptivity and assimilativeness of culture" [...] made it practically impossible to think of cultures as discrete things.|$|E

Initially, a private-key cryptosystem is built over Zn (n being an RSA modulus).

This private-key cryptosystem <b>is</b> <b>not</b> homomorphic {{in the sense that}} the vector sum <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a homomorphic operator. Non-linear homomorphic operators are then developed. The security relies on the difficulty of solving systems of nonlinear equations (which is a NP-complete problem).

As the inclinations and circumstances of consumers can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> any rule, so neither can the proportions {{in which the two}} commodities will be interchanged. We know that the limits within which the variation is confined are the ratio between their costs of production in the one country and the ratio between their costs of production in the other. Ten yards of cloth can not exchange for more than twenty yards of linen, nor for less than fifteen. But they may exchange for any intermediate number. The ratios, therefore, in which the advantage of the trade may be divided between the two nations are various. The circumstances on which the proportionate share of each country more remotely depends admit only of a very general indication.” ...|$|E

But when the derivative law results not from different effects of one cause, but from effects of several causes, we can not be certain that it will be true under any variation in the mode of co-existence of those causes, or of the primitive natural agents on which the causes ultimately depend. The proposition that coal-beds rest on certain descriptions of strata exclusively, though true on the earth, so far as our observation has reached, can not be extended to the moon or the other planets, supposing coal to exist there; because we can not be assured that the original constitution of any other planet was such as to produce the different depositions in the same order as in our globe.

60|$|True {{it is that}} in {{the case}} of the {{practical}} inquirer, who is endeavoring to ascertain facts not for the purposes of science but for those of business, such, for instance, as the advocate or the judge, the chief difficulty is one in which the principles of induction will afford him no assistance. It lies not in making his inductions, but in the selection of them; in choosing from among all general propositions ascertained to be true, those which furnish marks by which he may trace whether the given subject possesses or not the predicate in question. In arguing a doubtful question of fact before a jury, the general propositions or principles to which the advocate appeals are mostly, in themselves, sufficiently trite, and assented to as soon as stated: his skill lies in bringing his case under those propositions or principles; in calling to mind such of the known or received maxims of probability as admit of application to the case in hand, and selecting from among them those best adapted to his object. Success is here dependent on natural or acquired sagacity, aided by knowledge of the particular subject, and of subjects allied with it.

Thus, by confining to themselves the knowledge of the foundation of all men's lives and properties, they have reduced all mankind into the most abject and servile dependence.

6000|$|These laws being observed, it {{will not}} only be in the power, it will be the duty,--the {{imperative}} duty,--of the landscape painter, to descend to the lowest details with undiminished attention. Every herb and flower of the field has its specific, distinct, and perfect beauty; it has its peculiar habitation, expression, and function. The highest art is that which seizes this specific character, which develops and illustrates it, which assigns to it its proper position in the landscape, and which, by means of it, enhances and enforces the great impression which the picture is intended to convey. Nor is it of herbs and flowers alone that such scientific representation is required. Every class of rock, every kind of earth, every form of cloud, must be studied with equal industry, and rendered with equal precision. And thus we find ourselves unavoidably led to a conclusion directly opposed to that constantly enunciated dogma of the parrot-critic, that the features of nature must be [...] "generalized,"--a dogma whose inherent and broad absurdity would long ago have been detected, if it had not contained in its convenient falsehood an apology for indolence, and a disguise for incapacity. Generalized! As if it were possible to generalize things generically different. Of such common cant of criticism I extract a characteristic passage from one of the reviews of this work, that in this year's Athenæum for February 10th: [...] "He (the author) would have geological landscape painters, dendrologic, meteorologic, and doubtless entomologic, ichthyologic, every kind of physiologic painter united in the same person; yet, alas, for true poetic art among all these learned Thebans!
