5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} of Native Americans in the United States has been problematic since the initial European colonization of the Americas.

25|$|Speculating that {{production}} and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered.</b> First, in the annihilation of antimatter, {{much of the}} energy is lost as high-energy gamma radiation, and especially also as neutrinos, so that only about 40% of mc2 would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally. Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of mc2 yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.|$|E

25|$|Of course, {{not all of}} the {{possible}} states of a multi-state molecule or complex will necessarily be populated. Indeed, in systems where the number of possible states is far greater than that of molecules in the compartment (e.g. the cell), they cannot be. In some cases, empirical information can be used to rule out certain states if, for instance, some combinations of features are incompatible. In the absence of such information, however, all possible states <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a priori. In such cases, computational modeling can be used to uncover to what extent the different states are populated.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{examination}} of laws by the Council is compulsory. Organic bills, those which fundamentally affect government and treaties, {{need to be}} assessed by the Council before they are considered ratified (Article 61-1 and 54). Amendments concerning the rules governing parliamentary procedures <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> by the Council, as well. Guidance may be sought from the Council in regard to whether reform should come under statute law (voted by Parliament) or whether issues are considered as règlement (regulation) to be adopted with decree of the prime minister. The re-definition of legislative dispositions as regulatory matters initially constituted a significant share of the (then light) caseload of the Council.|$|E
25|$|It is {{very hard}} to uniquely {{identify}} neutrino interactions among the natural background of radioactivity. For this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel was chosen to facilitate the identification: the interaction of an antineutrino with one of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur within a heavier nucleus, don't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> for the detection experiment. Within a cubic metre of water placed right outside a nuclear reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the setup is now used for measuring the reactor's plutonium production rate.|$|E

25|$|During normal use, a UDDT {{is just as}} {{hygienic}} {{and safe}} to use as {{any other type of}} toilet. However, health aspects <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> during removal and emptying of the urine and feces containers of a UDDT. These health risks during emptying of the feces vault or container are significantly lower when compared to emptying the pit of pit latrines or the buckets of some types of dry toilets without urine diversion. However, the health risks are somewhat higher when compared to a flush toilet where the user does not have to carry out any emptying or maintenance tasks at the household level unless the flush toilet plugs, back-flows or otherwise experiences operating problems.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the serious}} {{consequences}} that plagiarism has for students, {{there has been}} a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism. This is especially important when students move to a new institution that may have a different view of the concept when compared with the view previously developed by the student. Indeed, given the seriousness of plagiarism accusations for a student's future, the pedagogy of plagiarism education may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> ahead of the pedagogy of the discipline being studied. The need for plagiarism education extends to academic staff, who may not completely understand what is expected of their students or the consequences of misconduct.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} {{haemostasis}} evaluating method, TEM (and thrombelastography) have limitations which <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> when interpreting the results. The typical assays are not responsive {{for the effect}} of von Willebrand factor or platelet antagonists such as aspirin or thienopyridines (e.g. clopidogrel), and only supratherapeutic doses of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists may influence results. The sensitivity for coagulation factor deficiencies, including those induced by oral anticoagulation, is less pronounced as compared to clotting assays. Therefore, TEM {{is not meant to}} replace laboratory assays such as prothrombin time (PT) or factor assays. However, due to the rapid availability of differential diagnostic information, TEM has become an established method in surgical procedures where blood losses can be expected.|$|E
