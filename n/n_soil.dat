The Illinois <b>N</b> <b>Soil</b> Test values for each sample depth and sample timing were not related to com yield response to applied N, and could not be calibrated on the soils studied.

40|$|Microbial {{metabolism}} plays a {{key role}} in regulating the biogeochemical cycle of forest ecosystems, but the mechanisms driving microbial growth are not well understood. Here, we synthesized 689 measurements on soil microbial biomass carbon (C mic) and nitrogen (N mic) and related parameters from 207 independent studies published up to November 2014 across China's forest ecosystems. Our objectives were to (1) examine patterns in C mic, N mic, and microbial quotient (i. e., C mic / C soil and N mic / <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> rates) by climate zones and management regimes for these forests; and (2) identify the factors driving the variability in the C mic, N mic, and microbial quotient. There was a large variability in C mic (390. 2 mg kg − 1), N mic (60. 1 mg kg − 1, C mic : N mic ratio (8. 25), C mic / C soil rate (1. 92 %), and N mic / <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> rate (3. 43 %) across China's forests. The natural forests had significantly greater C mic (514. 1 mg kg − 1 vs. 281. 8 mg kg − 1) and N mic (82. 6 mg kg − 1 vs. 39. 0 mg kg − 1) than the planted forests, but had less C mic : N mic ratio (7. 3 vs. 9. 2) and C mic / C soil rate (1. 7 % vs. 2. 1 %). Soil resources and climate together explained 24. 4 – 40. 7 % of these variations. The C mic : N mic ratio declined slightly with C soil : <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> ratio, and changed with latitude, mean annual temperature and precipitation, suggesting a plasticity of microbial carbon-nitrogen stoichiometry. The C mic / C soil rate decreased with C soil : <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> ratio, whereas the N mic / <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> rate increased with C soil : <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> ratio; the former was influenced more by soil resources than by climate, whereas the latter was influenced more by climate.

Although ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) coexist in most non-acidic agricultural soils, the factors that influence their relative contributions to soil nitrification activity remain unclear. A 2 - to 4 -d whole soil microcosm assay was developed, utilizing the aliphatic C₈ alkyne 1 -octyne to inactivate AOB-driven nitrification activity without impacting AOA nitrification activity. Responses of AOA- and AOB-supported net nitrification activities (accumulation of NO₂⁻ + NO₃⁻) to different concentrations of extractable NH₄⁺ were examined in four diverse, paired cropped and non-cropped Oregon soils sampled in summer and winter. Maximum AOA-supported net nitrification rates were significantly higher in non-cropped (3. 7 mg <b>N</b> kg⁻¹ <b>soil</b> d⁻¹) than in cropped soils (0. 9 mg <b>N</b> kg⁻¹ <b>soil</b> d⁻¹) and in summer (3. 1 mg <b>N</b> kg⁻¹ <b>soil</b> d⁻¹) compared with winter soils (1. 6 mg <b>N</b> kg⁻¹ <b>soil</b> d⁻¹).

40|$|One of the {{environmental}} concerns associated with mining waste is the contamination of soil. This study addresses the decontamination of soil, particularly of Co and Ni using Berkheya coddii (B. coddii). B. coddii is a hyperaccumulater plant that is able to decontaminate Co and Ni from the contaminated land. The use of B. coddii to decontaminate soil or waste {{must be based on}} a cognizance of the complicated, integrated effects of pollutant sources and soil-plant variables. Phytoextraction pot trials using B. coddii were carried out under green house condition, with controlled watering. A contaminated metallurgical waste residue known as Rustenburg Base Mine Refineries waste (RBMR waste soil) collected from Rustenburg while a serpentine (native) soil (<b>N</b> <b>soil)</b> where B. coddii grows naturally was collected from Mpumalanga. The experiment involved the addition of sulfur doses to both soils in order to test whether acidification and higher sulfur availability could enhance the uptake of both Co and Ni by B. coddii. The results indicate that the addition of sulfur from 2. 0 to 8. 0 g per kilogram decreased pH in both substrates. RBMR waste soil pH was found to have decreased from 7. 8 to 7. 4 while the <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> pH was found to have decreased from 6. 4 to 4. 7. The reduction oxidation potential (redox potential) in both substrates was observed to have decreased along with the increase in sulfur dosage. The mean redox potential for RBMR waste soil was found to be 350 mV and 506 mV for the <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> after the addition of sulfur. Conductivity increased along with the increase in sulfur dosage in both substrates. The mean conductivity for the <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> was found to be 961 μS/cm while that of the RBMR waste soil was found to be 1453 μS/cm after the addition of sulfur. The decrease in soil pH was significant (p = 0. 00115) in the <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> than RBMR waste soil. Despite the increase in sulfur dosage and decrease in soil pH in both substrates, B. coddii observed growing. Although it was evident that B. coddii is able to grow in the RBMR waste soil, it was observed that the RBMR waste soil limits the root depth of the B. coddii, reducing chances for the roots to penetrate into the ground especially when dry. The RBMR waste soil becomes more compacted than the <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> when dry. It is therefore crucial to ensure that there is enough moisture to allow for the B. coddii being able to survive effectively in the RBMR waste soil. B. coddii plant height in the RBMR waste soil after four months was observed to be in the range of 190 to 200 mm tall. This was found to be less than the height observed for the B. coddii planted in the <b>N</b> <b>soil,</b> which was in the range of 350 to 400 mm. Nonetheless, plants grown in both substrates were able to absorb Ni and Co into their tissues. More Co and Ni were found to have accumulated into the leaf tissues than {{in other parts of the}} plant. This could be an advantage since one would harvest only the leaf part or the canopy (shoots) and allow B. coddii to resprout in order to continue taking up more Co and Ni from the same waste substrate to remediation levels that could be stipulated by Government as desirable for the ecosystem and the protection of human health. Although the accumulated Ni and Co can be recovered from biomass, this alone might not provide sufficient economic justification for phytoextraction due to the low concentrations that could be recovered. B. coddii was found to absorb higher concentrations of Co and Ni from the <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> than from the RBMR waste soil. However, the results found in this study may not be conclusive. This could be due to many variables that could control metal uptake which were not investigated. These include mycorrhizal fungi and metal forms in the soil. Moreover, this study was performed in a green house and not in the outdoor environment. Ni is generally toxic to most plants, hyperaccumulators (i. e. B. coddii) contain elements that nullify the toxic effect of nickel, and in this case the accumulated nickel is bound to malate to form a harmless nickel complex which could be absorbed by the plants as nutrients...|$|E

In this study, we quantified the regional <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> storage, spatial and vertical density distributions, and related climatic controls using 183 soil profiles sampled from 61 sites across the Northeast Tibetan Plateau shrublands during the period of 2011 – 2013. Our analysis revealed a <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> storage value of 132. 40 Tg at a depth of 100 cm, with an average density of 1. 21 kg m− 2. <b>Soil</b> <b>N</b> density was distributed at greater levels in alpine shrublands, compared with desert shrublands.

Methodology/Principal Findings: A field manipulation experiment was conducted {{to examine the effects of}} warming and <b>N</b> addition on <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> cycling in a temperate grassland of northeastern China from 2007 to 2009. Soil samples were incubated at a constant temperature and moisture, from samples collected in the field. The results showed that both warming and N addition significantly stimulated <b>soil</b> net <b>N</b> mineralization rate and net nitrification rate. Combined warming and N addition caused an interactive effect on N mineralization, which could be explained by the relative shift of soil microbial community structure because of fungal biomass increase and strong plant uptake of added N due to warming. Irrespective of strong intra- and inter-annual variations in <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization, the responses of N mineralization to warming and N addition did not change during the three growing seasons, suggesting independence of warming and N responses of N mineralization from precipitation variations in the temperate grassland.

A experiment under controlled conditions was conducted in Piracicaba, Brazil, to assess N 2 fixation of 25 genotypes of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). BNF was measured by 15 N isotope dilution using a non-N 2 fixing bean genotype as a reference crop.

Nitrogen mineralization in the soil used was insensitive to the range of moisture fluctuations that were inevitable during plant growth. Pots were planted to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or left unplanted and received no straw, straw added in one central layer, or straw added uniformly through the whole soil volume. Through the addition of 15 N-labelled nitrate, initial soil inorganic N was increased to 17 μg g− 1 in unplanted treatments and to 17 μg g− 1 and 72 μg g− 1 in planted treatments. Straw addition increased microbial immobilization of labelled <b>N</b> (<b>soil</b> inorganic N at planting), but did not reduce net mineralization of unlabelled soil <b>N</b> (<b>soil</b> organic N at planting), indicating that straw decomposers immobilized N early in the growth period.

Since leaf δ 15 <b>N,</b> <b>soil</b> δ 15 N and Δ δ 15 N leaf-soil (Δ δ 15 N leaf-soil [*]=[*] leaf δ 15 N − soil δ 15 N) could reflect the N cycling characteristics, we put forward a hypothesis that leaf δ 15 <b>N,</b> <b>soil</b> δ 15 N and Δ δ 15 N leaf-soil should differ between the two slopes. However, such a comparative study between two slopes has never been conducted. In addition, environmental effects on leaf and soil δ 15 N derived from studies at global scale were often found {{to be different from}} those on a regional scale. This led to our argument that environmental effects on leaf and soil δ 15 N could depend on local environment. To confirm our hypothesis and argument, we measured leaf and soil δ 15 N on the south and north slopes of Tian Shan. Remarkable environmental differences between the two slopes provided an ideal opportunity for our test. The study showed that leaf δ 15 <b>N,</b> <b>soil</b> δ 15 N and δ 15 N leaf-soil on the south slope were greater than those on the north slope, although the difference in soil δ 15 N was not significant.

40|$|Cheatgrass is an {{invasive}} weed {{that has}} come to dominate large areas of the western United States. Once an ecosystem has been converted to a cheatgrass monoculture, it is extremely difficult to restore native vegetation.

Understanding how cheatgrass so effectively invades western ecosystems is essential to turning the tide of invasion. One possible key to cheatgrass’ success is alteration of soil nutrient cycling. The goal {{of this study is to}} explore how nitrogen (N) may accumulate in cheatgrass soils via redistribution of <b>N</b> within <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> pools. To accomplish this we investigated <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> cycling in <b>soils</b> underneath cheatgrass and crested wheatgrass.

The results indicate the following: (1) <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> 03 -N alone was an efficient indicator of residual soil N; (2) there was a linear increase of <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> 03 -N with N applied four months previously at the beginning of the dry season crops; (3) soil sampled to the 30 cm depth was sufficient to estimate availability of the residual N; (4) corn yields increased linearly with the increase of <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> 03 -N; (5) the measurement of residual <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> 03 -N can be used as a soil text index in connection with N prediction equations for estimating fertilizer N requirements. The measurements of <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> 03 -N can, therefore, increase the efficiency of fertilizer use in a wet-dry tropical climate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to study the genetic control of grain yield (GY) and nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE, grain yield/N applied) and its primary components, N uptake efficiency (NUpE, N uptake/N applied) and N utilization efficiency (NUtE, grain yield/N uptake), in maize grown in environments with high and low N availability. Experiments with 31 maize genotypes (28 hybrid crosses and three controls) were carried out in soils with high and low N rates, in the southeast {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil. There was a reduction of 23. 2 % in average GY for maize grown in soil with low N, in comparison to that obtained with high N. There were 26. 5, 199 and 400 % increases in NUtE, NUpE, and NUE, respectively, for maize grown with low N. The general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) were significant for GY, NUE and NUpE for maize grown in high <b>N</b> <b>soil.</b> Only GCA was significant for NUpE for maize grown in low <b>N</b> <b>soil.</b> The GCA and SCA for NUtE were not significant in either environment. Additive and non-additive genetic effects are responsible for the genetic control of NUE and GY for maize grown in soils with high N availability, although additive effects are more important.

40|$|Iron {{reduction}} {{is an important}} biogeochemical process in paddy soils, yet {{little is known about}} the microbial coupling between nitrogen and iron reduction. Here, we investigated the shift of acetate-metabolizing iron-reducers under long-term nitrogen fertilization using C- 13 -acetate-based ribosomal RNA (rRNA) -stable isotope probing (SIP) and pyrosequencing in an incubation experiment, and the shift of putative iron-reducers in original field samples were investigated by 16 S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing. During SIP incubations, in the presence of iron(III) oxyhydroxides, more iron(II) formation and less methane production were detected in nitrogen-fertilized (N) compared with non-fertilized (NF) soil. In C- 13 -rRNA from microcosms amended with ferrihydrite (FER), Geobacter spp. were the important active iron-reducers in both soils, and labeled to a greater extent in N (31 % of the bacterial classified sequences) than NF soils (11 %). Pyrosequencing of the total 16 S rRNA transcripts from microcosms at the whole community level further revealed hitherto unknown metabolisms of potential FER reduction by microorganisms including Pseudomonas and Solibacillus spp. in <b>N</b> <b>soil,</b> Dechloromonas, Clostridium, Bacillus and Solibacillus spp. in NF soil. Goethite (GOE) amendment stimulated Geobacter spp. to a lesser extent in both soils compared with FER treatment. Pseudomonas spp. in the <b>N</b> <b>soil</b> and Clostridium spp. in the NF soil may also be involved in GOE reduction. Pyrosequencing results from field samples showed that Geobacter spp. were the most abundant putative iron-reducers in both soils, and significantly stimulated by long-term nitrogen fertilization. Overall, for the first time, we demonstrate that long-term nitrogen fertilization promotes iron(III) reduction and modulates iron-reducing bacterial community in paddy soils...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the dynamics of}} <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization in the experimental intensive dairy farming system ‘De Marke’ on a dry sandy soil in the Netherlands. We hypothesized that knowledge {{of the effects of}} crop rotation on <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization and of the spatial and temporal variability of <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization in a farming system can be used to better synchronize N application with crop N requirements, and hence to increase the recovery of applied N and to reduce <b>N</b> losses. <b>Soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization was recorded continuously in the soil layer 0 – 0. 30 m, from 1992 to 2005, using a sequential in situ coring technique on six observation plots, of which two were located in permanent grassland and four in crop rotations with a 3 year grassland phase and an arable phase of 3 or 5 years, dominated by maize. Average annual <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization was highest under permanent grassland: 381 kg ha- 1 and lowest under = 3 rd years arable crops: 184 kg ha- 1. In temporary grassland, <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization increased in the order: 1 st year, 2 nd year, 3 rd year grassland and in arable crops after grassland mineralization decreased in the order: 1 st year, 2 nd year, = 3 rd years. Total mineral N input, i. e. the sum of N mineralization and mineral <b>N</b> supply to <b>soil,</b> exceeded crop <b>N</b> requirements in 1 st year maize and was lower than the requirements in 1 st year temporary grassland. N mineralization in winter, outside the growing season, was 77 kg ha- 1 in maize and 60 kg ha- 1 in grassland. This points at the importance of a suitable catch crop to reduce the susceptibility to N leaching. Temporal and spatial variability of <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization was high and could not be related to known field conditions. This limits the extent to which N fertilization can be adjusted to <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization. Variability increased with the magnitude of <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization. Hence, situations with high <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> mineralization may be associated with high risks for N losses and to reduce these risks a strong build-up of <b>soil</b> organic <b>N</b> should be avoided. This might be achieved, for instance, by fermenting slurry before application on farmland to enhance the fraction mineral N in slurry at the expense of organic N...|$|R
40|$|In forest ecosystems, {{a change}} of <b>soil</b> {{nitrogen}} (<b>N)</b> cycling after disturbance is regulated by various factors. Sasa dwarf bamboo (hereafter referred to as Sasa) is an understory plant that grows thickly {{on the forest floor}} in northern Hokkaido, Japan. However, the ecosystem function of Sasa after disturbances in the <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> cycling is not fully understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the short-term response of Sasa to {{a change of}} <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> fertility. Biomass, litterfall, litter decomposition, <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> pool, and <b>N</b> leaching from <b>soil</b> were measured in control, and low- (5 g N m− 2 year− 1) and high-N (15 g N m− 2 year− 1) addition plots. Sasa immobilized much <b>N</b> as the <b>soil</b> <b>N</b> fertility increased. However, the leaf N concentration in aboveground biomass did not increase, suggesting that the N in leaves was maintained because of the increase of leaf biomass. As a result, the decomposition and mineralization rates of the produced litter before and after N addition were comparable among plots, even though the <b>soil</b> inorganic <b>N</b> fertility increased greatly.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Litter {{decomposition}} {{is a critical}} process in terrestrial ecosystems and understanding the effects of soil fertility on the litter decay rate is of great ecological relevance. Here we test the hypothesis that <b>N</b> transfer from <b>soil</b> to litter will promote the decay rate of N poor but not N rich litter types. Methods Ten organic substrates, encompassing {{a wide range of}} biochemical quality in terms of C/N and lignin/N ratios, were decomposed in microcosms over three soil types with different N content, but inoculated with the same microbiome. Organic substrates were characterized for mass loss, C and N content to assess <b>N</b> transfer from <b>soil</b> to litter. Results The decay rate response to soil fertility was related to their initial N content: positive for substrates with little initial N content and not significant for N rich plant residues. A significant N transfer, generally larger from <b>N</b> rich <b>soil</b> to <b>N</b> poor substrates, was found. Litter C/N and lignin/N ratios showed variable relationships with the litter decay according with the soil fertility gradient, with positive and negative correlations in N rich and <b>N</b> poor <b>soils,</b> respectively. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the decomposition of N rich litter proceeded irrespective of soil fertility while the decay rate of N poor substrates, either lignin poor or rich, was controlled by soil fertility likely as a result of N transfer. Litter C/N and lignin/N ratios were reliable indicators of litter quality to predict their decay rate in <b>N</b> poor <b>soil,</b> but not in <b>N</b> rich <b>soils...</b>|$|R
