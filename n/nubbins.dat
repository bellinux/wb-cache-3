Although his role is brief, {{there was going to}} be an {{additional}} scene exploring his family that was removed for budgetary reasons. <b>Nubbins</b> Sawyer, the older brother of Leatherface known simply as [...] "The Hitchhiker" [...] in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, is played by Dejan Angelov. Lorina Kamburova fills the role of Hal Hartman's daughter, whose death sets the plot into motion, while Boris Kabakchief plays Jedidiah Sawyer in his child years.

2500|$|Serving as {{a direct}} prequel to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Leatherface was written by Seth M. Sherwood to also act {{as a prelude to}} the series as a whole. Sherwood {{intentionally}} distanced the film from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and its prequel , while respecting the fictional events of the original film and its various sequels. Leatherface's characterisation is based on Gunnar Hansen's performance from the original film. Certain character names, such as Drayton, <b>Nubbins,</b> and the Sawyer surname, were pulled from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. The creation of the deranged lawman Hal Hartman was inspired by Lefty Enright, a Texas Ranger that appeared in the second film, while Clarice was originally conceived as a tribute to Chop Top Sawyer. Hal Hartman is the father of Burt Hartman, a vigilante character that first appeared in Texas Chainsaw 3D. The character Verna Sawyer (Lili Taylor) was played by Marilyn Burns in Texas Chainsaw 3D. Sherwood confirmed that the Texas Chainsaw film canon followed by Lionsgate Pictures and Millennium Films consists of, chronologically, Leatherface, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and Texas Chainsaw 3D: [...] "While there’s plenty of things for fans, one could also go into [...] blind as their first TCM film and effectively see the beginning of the story." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{testicular}} <b>nubbin</b> is {{the residual}} tissue {{of the human}} testis after a supposed perinatal vascular accident involving the testicular blood supply. The blood supply of the testis twists (called torsion) thereby cutting off the blood supply to the testis and results in testicular atrophy (shrinking). The <b>nubbin</b> is usually identified in childhood {{by the absence of}} a palpable testis in the scrotal sac. The tissue remnant usually includes fibrous tissue and signs of old infarction with hemosiderin deposition identified histologically. The controversy involves whether these should be removed and whether there is a risk of future malignancy. These are typically removed surgically by pediatric urologists or pediatric general surgeons through either a scrotal or ingiunal (or both) incision.|$|R

5000|$|Three weeks later, Jeff {{begins to}} train <b>Nubbin</b> {{and his other}} young hounds to locate {{raccoons}} by following their scent. At first Jeff uses a raccoon skin as bait, but when he switches to Weecha, <b>Nubbin</b> refuses to work and fights off all the other dogs. Several months later, Jeff is invited on a coon hunt in a neighboring valley and leaves with his favorite hound, Rounder. <b>Nubbin</b> and Weecha are now full grown although Weecha is still a captive in the rabbit hutch. However, the hound helps his friend to escape and Weecha, having learned how to manipulate the latches on the hutches, releases all of Jeff's rabbits. Unfortunately, he steps on the trigger of a shotgun and the shot alerts the hounds, who break out of their enclosure to chase the rabbits. Weecha hides inside a barrel, which the dogs roll over just as Jeff returns with Rounder. Weecha manages to escape but is pursued by Rounder. While fighting in a pond, Weecha grabs Rounder by the neck and almost drowns him, then escapes. By autumn, Weecha has completely reverted to the wild and survives by stealing duck eggs, as well as nuts and berries from pine squirrel nests.|$|R

Type B varies from a nubbin to an extra, non-functional little finger part on a pedicle.
