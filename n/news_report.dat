40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the business {{challenges faced by}} journalists and traditional <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations {{in light of the}} increasing presence and rising popularity of multiple, personal and ‘amateur’ digital news channels. Our discussion focuses on the differences in value creation that are found in the contrasting ‘traditional’, ‘digital’ and self-organising models of <b>news</b> <b>reporting.</b> The aim of this discussion is to identify the ways in which <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations have previously and can continue to create value in light of the challenges brought by social media technologies. We argue that it is the popularising of digital channels including the increasing realisation and legitimation of crowdsourcing, co-creation and user generated content that directly threatens the traditional practices of <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations, and therefore the business models of these organisations. The threats posed by digital media technologies to traditional <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> is further reinforced by popular acceptance of specific social media actions including ‘tagging’, ‘re-posting’ and ‘liking’. In light of these activities we consider the shifting role that audience-contributed and non-traditional content - what we describe as ‘non-news’ and ‘anti-news’ - plays in relation to <b>news</b> <b>reporting.</b> We argue that two pivotal aspects of value creation for <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisations has been, and continues to be, their ability to efficiently synthesise diverse sources of complex information and their ability to construct legitimacy and authority around the brand of the <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> organisation itself...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} papers, we {{have presented}} a logic-based framework for merging structured <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> [14, 16, 15]. Structured <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> are XML documents, where the text entries {{are restricted to}} individual words or simple phrases, such as names and domain-specific terminology, and numbers and units. We assume structured <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> do not require natural language processing. In this paper, we present propositional fusion rules {{as a way of}} implementing logic-based fusion for structured <b>news</b> <b>reports.</b> Fusion rules are a form of scripting language that define how structured <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> should be merged. The antecedent of a fusion rule is a call to investigate the information in the structured <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> and the background knowledge, and the consequent of a fusion rule is a formula specifying an action to be undertaken to form a merged report. It is expected that a set of fusion rules is defined for any given application. We give the syntax and mode of execution for fusion rules, and explain how the resulting actions give a merged report. ...|$|R

40|$|IT {{project failure}} is an {{enduring}} problem which {{has often been}} associated with bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> and escalation of commitment. The literature in bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> has focused on identifying factors (e. g., organizational climate of silence) that could influence one’s reporting decision. Similarly, the de-escalation literature has primarily investigated conditions or activities (e. g., changes in top management) which promote de-escalation. Nonetheless, what is missing in our understanding is how affect can influence bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> and de-escalation decisions within IT projects. This represents a significant gap in bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> and de-escalation research, as affect (i. e., mood and emotions) is recognized as a fundamental aspect of human life which strongly influences individual perceptions, judgment, and decision making. The aim of this dissertation to provide new insights regarding how affect can influence bad <b>news</b> <b>reporting</b> decisions and de-escalation of commitment {{within the context of}} troubled IT projects...|$|R
5|$|Via a live <b>news</b> <b>report,</b> a {{high-speed}} car chase {{comes to an}} end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging her head against the car window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window.|$|E
5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni thought it would be a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 <b>news</b> <b>report</b> contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E

Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening they decide to let him go. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled and killed by a falling kitchen knife.|$|E
40|$|By taking Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG) as {{research}} approach, this study analyzes and discusses two <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> {{related to the}} event that a Uyghur man {{was sentenced to death}} by the Intermediate People’s Court in Xinjiang, a western province of China. Both <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> on that event are taken respectively from two newspapers published in English language but with clearly opposed ideology, CNN and China Daily. We have found that, however, these two <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> are quite different and even completely opposite in making use of three saliently patterned linguistic features, that is, transitivity, naming of news actor and quotation patterns. We argue that the different even opposite selection in the three aspects in the two <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> are not arbitrary, but rather are ideologically motivated. Finally, we suggest that teachers are supposed to teach and help students read <b>news</b> <b>reports</b> with critical eyes. </p...|$|R

Gale, who survived the crash, intervenes, and Sidney takes {{advantage}} of this to turn the tables on her attackers, killing Stu. Randy is revealed to be wounded but alive.

The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being taken advantage of by a doctor who visited their ailing mother. This episode demonstrates that corruption and malice exist not just in the capital city but also in rural villages.|$|E
