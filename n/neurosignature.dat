50|$|The {{neuromatrix}} theory {{proposes that}} there is an extensive network connecting the thalamus and the cortex, and the cortex and the limbic system. It is a theory that extends beyond body schema theory and incorporates the conscious awareness of oneself. This theory proposes that conscious awareness and the perception of self are generated in the brain via patterns of input that can be modified by different perceptual inputs. The network is genetically predetermined, and is modified throughout one’s lifetime by various sensory inputs to create a <b>neurosignature.</b> It is the <b>neurosignature</b> of a specific body part that determines how it is consciously perceived. The input systems contributing to the <b>neurosignature</b> are primarily the somatosensory, limbic, and thalamocortical systems. The neuromatrix theory aims to explain how certain activities associated with pain lead to the conscious perception of phantom pain. The persistence of the <b>neurosignature,</b> even after limb amputation, may be the cause of phantom sensations and pain. Phantom pain may arise from abnormal reorganization in the neuromatrix to a pre-existing pain state.|$|E
40|$|Phantom limb pain is {{an often}} severe and {{debilitating}} phenomenon {{that has been}} reported in up to 85 % of amputees. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Peripheral and spinal mechanisms are thought {{to play a role in}} pain modulation in affected individuals; however central mechanisms are also likely to be of importance. The neuromatrix theory postulates a genetically determined representation of body image, which is modified by sensory input to create a <b>neurosignature.</b> Persistence of the <b>neurosignature</b> may be responsible for painless phantom limb sensations, whereas phantom limb pain may be due to abnormal reorganisation within the neuromatrix. This study assessed the clinical outcome of deep brain stimulation of the periventricular grey matter and somatosensory thalamus for the relief of chronic neuropathic pain associated with phantom limb in three patients. These patients were assessed preoperatively and at 3 month intervals postoperatively. Self-rated visual analogue scale pain scores assessed pain intensity, and the McGill Pain Questionnaire assessed the quality of the pain. Quality of life was assessed using the EUROQOL EQ- 5 D scale. Periventricular gray stimulation alone was optimal in two patients, whilst a combination of periventricular gray and thalamic stimulation produced the greatest degree of relief in one patient. At follow-up (mean 13. 3 months) the intensity of pain was reduced by 62 % (range 55 - 70 %). In all three patients, the burning component of the pain was completely alleviated. Opiate intake was reduced in the two patients requiring morphine sulphate pre-operatively. Quality of life measures indicated a statistically significant improvement. This data supports the role for deep brain stimulation in patients with phantom limb pain.

40|$|Considerable {{evidence}} supports that pain is encoded in a large, widespread network {{that consists of}} the thalamus, cortex, as well as limbic system. However, the temporal properties of the neural matrix in pain processing were largely unknown. In the present study, we simultaneously recorded thalamic and cortical neuronal discharges elicited by brief noxious or innocuous electrical stimulus in awake rats. The discrimination performance of the neural ensembles in differentiating noxious from innocuous inputs was calculated using different window sizes at the millisecond and second level, respectively. The results demonstrated that coding information emerged in a quantum-like manner; the minimum spike-train length for discriminating noxious from innocuous inputs was 40 ms. The nociceptive coding activity was temporally dynamic, and could be preserved for a relatively long time (3 - 4 s) within the thalamocortical loops, independent of the initial brief stimuli.

40|$|Abstract: The {{neuromatrix}} {{theory of}} pain proposes that pain is a multidimensional experience produced by characteristic “neurosignature ” patterns of nerve impulses {{generated by a}} widely distributed neural network—the “body-self neuromatrix”—in the brain. These <b>neurosignature</b> patterns may be triggered by sensory inputs, but {{they may also be}} generated independently of them. Acute pains evoked by brief noxious inputs have been meticulously investigated by neuroscientists, and their sensory transmission mechanisms are generally well understood. In contrast, chronic pain syndromes, which are often characterized by severe pain associated with little or no discernible injury or pathology, remain a mystery. Furthermore, chronic psychological or physical stress is often associated with chronic pain, but the relationship is poorly understood. The neuromatrix theory of pain provides a new conceptual framework to examine these problems. It proposes that the output patterns of the body-self neuromatrix activate perceptual, homeostatic, and behavioral programs after injury, pathology, or chronic stress. Pain, then, is produced by the output of a widely distributed neural network in the brain rather than directly by sensory input evoked by injury, inflammation, or other pathology. The neuromatrix, which is genetically determined and modified by sensory experience, is the primary mechanism that generates the neural pattern that produces pain. Its output pattern is determined by multiple influences, of which the somatic sensory input is only a part, that converge on the neuromatrix...|$|E
