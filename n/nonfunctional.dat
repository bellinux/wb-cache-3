5|$|A small {{percentage}} of golden tilefish {{is known to be}} intersexual, having opposite <b>nonfunctional</b> sex tissues. Male tilefish specimens also inhibited a cavity that came from ovarian tissue and sperm sinuses. Tilefish of both genders in the Gulf of Mexico exhibited a higher rate of intersex characteristics than other populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} source of new genes in {{eukaryotic}} lineages is gene duplication, which creates copy number variation {{of an existing}} gene in the genome. The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family. Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent {{a major source of}} evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, gene duplication may result in a <b>nonfunctional</b> copy of a gene, or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such <b>nonfunctional</b> genes are called pseudogenes.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{retrospective}} study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use {{for more than}} one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them <b>nonfunctional.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{compartmentalization}} {{allows the}} cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns {{that must be}} removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and <b>nonfunctional</b> proteins.|$|E
5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the <b>nonfunctional</b> original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|He {{begins the}} section with an {{analysis}} of the temporal opening found in the skull of many extant birds. After a thorough comparison, he rejects the notion, which was common at the time, that this temporal opening was homologous with the supratemporal fenestra in reptiles. Instead, he concludes that it is a recent feature. Next he makes some observations on the wing structure of modern nestling birds. He finds that some species of extant birds have claws on their first and second fingers when very young, and some, like the hoatzin, will even use these temporary claws to climb about, including in the branches of trees. He also discovers that far more nestlings have a <b>nonfunctional</b> claw on the first digit, and some adult birds do as well.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of rudimentary and <b>nonfunctional</b> clavicles in ceratopsians, {{it was assumed that}} these shoulder bones were reduced in all dinosaurs that did not have true furculae. Robert Bakker (1987) suggested that this would have allowed the shoulder blades to swing with the forelimbs in quadrupedal dinosaurs, increasing their functional forelimb length. This would have reduced the discrepancy of length between fore- and hindlimbs in a quadrupedal Massospondylus. However, a recent discovery shows that Massospondylus possessed well-developed clavicles that were joined in a furcula-like arrangement, acting like a clasp between the right and left shoulder blades and prohibiting any rotation of these bones. This discovery indicates that the clavicle reduction is limited to the evolutionary line leading to the ceratopsians. It also indicates that the furcula of birds is derived from clavicles.|$|E
5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce the perception that lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with <b>nonfunctional</b> features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
5|$|A National Army relief column {{including}} the detachments under Husher, Fleetwood and Devine assembled at Lurkers' Ridge {{during the morning}} of 12 February. Under the command of Captain Tony Clark, it flanked through the townships south of the Alamo, engaging ZIPRA guerrillas along the way, then turned north to relieve Dyck. The Elands led the way, with Devine himself standing upright in the turret {{of one of them}} with a machine gun. At one point this was shot out of his hands, prompting him to briefly stop the advance so he could jump down into the street to collect it. By the time the relief column reached the Alamo at 13:00, C Company had been pocketed for 16 hours. Four wounded 1RAR soldiers were evacuated, and Dyck left the building to point out targets for Devine's armoured cars. During the afternoon, A Company relieved D Company at Lurker's Ridge, and the ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas withdrew into the townships and the surrounding country, sporadically exchanging fire. Devine was sent to Essexvale to engage the rest of ZIPRA's armoured battle group, which surrendered when he arrived; the T-34 tanks were later found by the Zimbabwe National Army to be <b>nonfunctional.</b> By the evening of 12 February, the rebellion was over.|$|E
5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry was {{the fourth}} child {{in a family of}} six. He grew up in the north St. Louis {{neighborhood}} known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry William Berry (1895–1987), was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha Bell (Banks) (1894–1980), was a certified public school principal. Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berry's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a <b>nonfunctional</b> pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa, near Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to their}} extinction, the Wrangel Island mammoths had {{accumulated}} numerous genetic defects {{due to their}} small population, consistent {{with the concept of}} genomic meltdown; in particular, a number of genes for olfactory receptors and urinary proteins became <b>nonfunctional,</b> possibly because they had lost their selective value on the island environment. It is not clear whether these genetic changes contributed to their extinction. The disappearance coincides roughly in time with the first evidence for humans on the island. The woolly mammoths of eastern Beringia (modern Alaska and Yukon) had similarly died out about 13,300 years ago, soon (roughly 1000 years) after the first appearance of humans in the area, which parallels the fate of all the other late Pleistocene proboscids (mammoths, gomphotheres and mastodons), as well as {{most of the rest of}} the megafauna, of the Americas. In contrast, the St. Paul Island mammoth population apparently died out prior to human arrival due to habitat shrinkage resulting from the post-ice-age sea-level rise, perhaps in large measure as a result of a consequent reduction in the freshwater supply.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the other}} {{functional}} mutations are believed to result in hypoexcitability. The R859C mutation, for example, has a more depolarized voltage dependence of activation, meaning that the membrane must be more depolarized for the channel to open. This mutant also recovers more slowly from inactivation. The <b>nonfunctional</b> channels are believed to produce similar changes in cell excitability. Likewise, many of the nonsense mutations likely result in <b>nonfunctional</b> channels and hypoexcitability, though this {{has yet to be}} tested. It is also unclear how this membrane hypoexcitability leads to the GEFS+ phenotype.|$|E
25|$|In {{the female}} the Wolffian bodies and ducts atrophy. The <b>nonfunctional</b> {{remains of the}} Wolffian tubules are {{represented}} by the epoophoron, and the paroöphoron, two small collections of rudimentary blind tubules which are situated in the mesosalpinx.|$|E
25|$|Some binding sites show {{excellent}} conservation, {{but just}} in a shorter region than the ones were looked for. Such short motifs (e.g., GC-box) often occur by chance in <b>nonfunctional</b> sequences and detecting these motifs can be challenging.|$|E
25|$|Most XY {{children}} are so undervirilized {{that they are}} raised as girls. The testes are uniformly <b>nonfunctional</b> and undescended; they are removed when the diagnosis is made due {{to the risk of}} cancer development in these tissues.|$|E
25|$|The {{contraindications}} for biceps-to-triceps transfer {{relate to}} the muscle balance surrounding the elbow. The m. supinator and m. brachialis function {{is a prerequisite for}} this surgery. If one of these muscles is <b>nonfunctional</b> the patient will lose forearm supination and elbow flexion if the tendon is transferred.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to keep in mind that not all conserved sequences are under selection pressure. To eliminate false positives statistical analysis must be performed that will show that the motifs reported have a mutation rate meaningfully less than that of the surrounding <b>nonfunctional</b> sequence.|$|E
25|$|Heterozygous {{carriers}} (individuals who inherit one mutant allele) show abnormal {{enzyme activity}} but manifest no disease symptoms. This phenomenon is called dominance; the biochemical reason for wild-type alleles' dominance over <b>nonfunctional</b> mutant alleles in inborn errors of metabolism comes from how enzymes function. Enzymes are protein catalysts for chemical reactions; as catalysts, they speed up reactions without being used {{up in the}} process, so only small enzyme quantities are required {{to carry out a}} reaction. Someone homozygous for a <b>nonfunctional</b> mutation in the enzyme-encoding gene has little or no enzyme activity, so will manifest the abnormal phenotype. A heterozygote (heterozygous individual) has {{at least half of the}} normal enzyme activity level, due to expression of the wild-type allele. This level is normally enough to enable normal function and thus prevent phenotypic expression.|$|E
25|$|Missense {{mutations}} or nonsynonymous mutations are {{types of}} point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution {{of a different}} amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein <b>nonfunctional.</b> Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa, sickle-cell disease, and SOD1-mediated ALS.|$|E
25|$|Although {{generally}} {{considered part of}} the process of puberty, pubarche is distinct and independent of the process of maturation of the gonads that leads to sexual maturation and fertility. Pubic hair can develop from adrenal androgens alone and can develop even when the ovaries or testes are defective and <b>nonfunctional.</b>|$|E
25|$|In mutant yellow-orange {{mice and}} human redheads, both with <b>nonfunctional</b> MC1R, both genotypes display reduced {{sensitivity}} to {{noxious stimuli and}} increased analgesic responsiveness to morphine-metabolite analgesics. These observations suggest a role for mammalian MC1R outside the pigment cell, though the exact mechanism through which the protein can modulate pain sensation is not known.|$|E
25|$|Genital {{reconstructive}} surgery {{at that time}} was primarily performed on older children and adults. In the early 1950s, it consisted primarily of the ability to remove an unwanted or <b>nonfunctional</b> gonad, to bring a testis into a scrotum, to repair a milder chordee or hypospadias, to widen a vaginal opening, and to remove a clitoris.|$|E
25|$|Zen, {{voiced by}} Peter Tuddenham (series 1–3). The main {{computer}} aboard Liberator, Zen controls the craft's secondary systems, including the battle and guidance computers. It {{is susceptible to}} interference from outside influences, such as Orac. It is considered a character in its own right. It is rendered <b>nonfunctional</b> after Liberator is damaged by fluid particles, and is destroyed with the ship.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{can sense}} heat via cells in their lips, though {{they lack the}} labial pits {{surrounding}} these receptors seen in {{many members of the}} Boidae family. Boa constrictors also have two lungs, a smaller (<b>nonfunctional)</b> left and an enlarged (functional) right lung to better fit their elongated shape, unlike many colubrid snakes, which have completely lost the left lung.|$|E
25|$|PKU is {{characterized}} by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene for the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), rendering it <b>nonfunctional.</b> This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to the amino acid tyrosine (Tyr). When PAH activity is reduced, phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylpyruvate (also known as phenylketone), which can be detected in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Four of the unplaced genera, and {{all three}} of the unplaced {{families}} of APG II consist of achlorophyllous holoparasites. In these, the chloroplast genes that are usually used in phylogenetic studies of angiosperms have become <b>nonfunctional</b> pseudogenes. If these evolve rapidly, they may be saturated with repeated mutations at the same site and consequently not be useful for phylogenetic reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} {{a device}} plugged into an {{electrical}} outlet of a wall {{becomes part of the}} building, but is <b>nonfunctional</b> while the switch is off; turning it on would then constitute building (category 35) and turning it off would be demolishing (category 34). Some schools of thought consider the use of electricity to be forbidden only by rabbinic injunction, rather than because it violates one of the original categories.|$|E
25|$|Pseudogenes are {{inactive}} {{copies of}} protein-coding genes, often generated by gene duplication, {{that have become}} <b>nonfunctional</b> through the accumulation of inactivating mutations. Table 1 shows {{that the number of}} pseudogenes in the human genome is on the order of 13,000, and in some chromosomes is nearly the same as the number of functional protein-coding genes. Gene duplication is a major mechanism through which new genetic material is generated during molecular evolution.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme {{replacement}} therapy techniques {{have been investigated}} for lysosomal storage disorders, and could potentially be used to treat Tay–Sachs as well. The goal would be to replace the <b>nonfunctional</b> enzyme, a process similar to insulin injections for diabetes. However, in previous studies, the HEXA enzyme itself has been thought to be too large {{to pass through the}} specialized cell layer in the blood vessels that forms the blood–brain barrier in humans.|$|E
25|$|Columns {{of varying}} height {{supported}} upper floors on the Potomac River {{side of the}} complex, creating an extremely narrow, <b>nonfunctional</b> portico. The capital atop each column was vaguely Corinthian in style, made of shaped sheet metal, and contained concealed lighting fixtures. The {{south side of the}} complex also featured brick piers, pilasters, and pilaster/column combinations. Flying buttresses were used on the upper floors. The glass curtain wall behind which was the Potomac restaurant was decorated with ornamental metalwork similar to that found in Victorian cast-iron pavilions.|$|E
25|$|The most {{difficult}} management decisions are {{posed by the}} more ambiguous genetic (XY) males. Most who are severely undervirilized, looking more female than male, are raised as females with surgical removal of the <b>nonfunctional</b> testes. If raised as males, a brief course of testosterone can be given in infancy to induce growth of the penis. Surgery {{may be able to}} repair the hypospadias. The testes should be salvaged by orchiopexy if possible. Testosterone must be replaced in order for puberty to occur and continued throughout adult life.|$|E
25|$|The CYP21A2 {{gene for}} the P450c21 enzyme (also known as 21-hydroxylase) is at 6p21.3, amid genes HLA B and HLA DR coding {{for the major}} human {{histocompatibility}} loci (HLA). CYP21A2 is paired with a <b>nonfunctional</b> pseudogene CYP21A1P. Scores of abnormal alleles of CYP21A2 have been documented, most arising from recombinations of homologous regions of CYP21A2 and CYP21A1P. Differences in residual enzyme activity of the various alleles account for the various degrees of severity of the disease. Inheritance {{of all forms of}} 21-hydroxylase CAH is autosomal recessive.|$|E
25|$|On the TV series Firefly, a cast bronze pistol was used, but for {{the film}} Serenity, a more {{detailed}} replica was created which had moving action and a blank pistol hidden inside, {{so that it could}} be fired in close-ups. Since this version was quite heavy, a resin replica was also constructed, which in addition to being less tiring for the actors to carry, could be thrown or dropped with less fear of injury. <b>Nonfunctional</b> replicas of the gun are commercially available for fans and collectors.|$|E
25|$|Most notable {{among the}} changes in DNA are the 1,2-intrastrand cross-links with purine bases. These include 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) adducts which form nearly 90% of the adducts and the less common 1,2-intrastrand d(ApG) adducts. 1,3-intrastrand d(GpXpG) adducts occur but are readily excised by the {{nucleotide}} excision repair (NER). Other adducts include inter-strand crosslinks and <b>nonfunctional</b> adducts that have been postulated to contribute to cisplatin's activity. Interaction with cellular proteins, particularly HMG domain proteins, has also been advanced as a mechanism of interfering with mitosis, although this is probably not its primary method of action.|$|E
25|$|The McClellan Gate (sometimes {{known as}} the McClellan Arch) is a {{memorial}} to Major General George B. McClellan located inside Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States. Constructed about 1871 on Arlington Ridge Road (then the eastern boundary of the cemetery), it served as a main gate until about 1879 when the Sheridan Gate was constructed. The McClellan Gate became <b>nonfunctional</b> in 1966 when the road closed, and expansion of the cemetery eastward in 1971 left the gate deep inside Arlington. It is the only gate constructed on the cemetery's eastern boundary in the 1800s that survives.|$|E
25|$|One {{class of}} {{mutations}} affects the gene CDKN2A. An alternative reading frame mutation in this gene {{leads to the}} destabilization of p53, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis and in fifty percent of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a <b>nonfunctional</b> inhibitor of CDK4, a cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell division. Mutations that cause the skin condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) also increase melanoma susceptibility. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell's ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are highly penetrant (the chances of a carrier to express the phenotype is high).|$|E
