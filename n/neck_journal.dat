40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{the past}} {{bilateral}} neck exploration was {{the gold standard}} for successful surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism. More restricted procedures have been introduced recently thanks to imaging techniques and intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay confirming eradication of hyperfunctioning tissue. METHODS: Thirty patients operated for parathyroid adenoma were submitted to intraoperative PTH determination with Quick Pack immunochemiluminescent assay (Nichols lab.) prior to excision and 5, 10 and 20 minutes after removal of the presumed hyperactive gland. Eleven patients were operated on by a minimally invasive procedure with videoassistance. RESULTS: Response to excision of the hyperfunctioning gland was evidenced by a significant decrease of PTH levels (50 % of initial value) in 26 patients. Plasma PTH levels decreased by at least 80 % of pre-excisional value after 20 minutes, 70 % after 10 minutes and by 50 % after 5 minutes. In 2 cases, significant decrease of PTH was obtained after 45 and 60 minutes respectively. In 2 other cases, the adenoma could not be found and there was no decrease of PTH even after extensive exploration of the neck. In the 11 patients who underwent minimal invasive surgery, 2 were converted to open neck surgery: in one case the adenoma was not accessible in {{the upper part of the}} neck, in the other case the hyperfunctioning gland remained undiscovered. CONCLUSION: intraoperative measurement of PTH should be considered a reliable and reproducible method for evaluation of the secreting activity of a parathyroid gland. The Quick Pack method has the advantage of confirming that the hyperactive gland has really been eradicated and consequently of considerably reducing operating time and avoiding extensive exploration of the <b>neck.</b> <b>Journal</b> Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The density matrix {{renormalization}} group (DMRG) has {{an underlying}} variational ansatz, the matrix product state (MPS). The accuracy of this ansatz {{is controlled by}} its virtual dimension. In most applications for quantum chemistry this parameter is very large, and the high-accuracy or FCI regime is studied. With a good orbital choice and ordering, and by exploiting the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, DMRG then allows to retrieve highly accurate results in active spaces {{beyond the reach of}} FCI [1, 2]. However, DMRG can also be of use with smaller virtual dimensions. I will discuss how fundamental ideas from Hartree-Fock (HF) theory are transferable to DMRG. Both methods have a variational ansatz. The time-independent variational principle leads for HF and DMRG to a self-consistent mean-field theory in the particles and lattice sites, respectively. The time-dependent variational principle results in the random-phase approximation (RPA). RPA reveals the elementary excitations: particle and site excitations for HF and DMRG, respectively. Exponentiation of these excitations provides a nonredundant parameterization of the ansatz manifold, formulated by Thouless’ theorem. A Taylor expansion in the nonredundant parameters leads to the configuration interaction expansion [3, 4]. References [1] S. Wouters, W. Poelmans, P. W. Ayers and D.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify relevant quality of life (QOL) issues in patients with head and neck cancer receiving multimodal and/or targeted therapies. METHODS: The literature was searched for QOL issues reported after multimodal and/or targeted therapies resulting in a list of potentially relevant issues. These were discussed within a multiprofessional expert group, revised, and subsequently rated for relevance by patients and health care providers. RESULTS: Twenty-seven issues were extracted that are not covered by the current version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaires. Interviews (96 health care providers from 13 countries, 137 patients from 8 countries) revealed that 26 of these issues were relevant for patients with head and neck cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Studies investigating targeted and/or multimodal therapy should consider that some QOL issues specific to these treatments are not covered by the current version of the EORTC instruments. Consequently, the EORTC head and neck cancer module is currently in revision. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head <b>Neck,</b> 2012. <b>JOURNAL</b> ARTICLEFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

This version is reproduced with permission from Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and <b>Neck</b> Surgery. <b>Journal</b> also known as: Australian Journal of Oto-laryngologyThere is considerable evidence that the brain translates (encodes) the frequency of a sound into both place of excitation (place encoding), and the pattern of intervals between action potentials (temporal encoding). Furthermore, temporal encoding is now thought to be due to a temporal as well as spatial pattern of action potentials in a small group of neurons. This pattern needs to be reproduced with a cochlear implant for improved speech processing. Our recent research has also demonstrated that the timing of excitatory postsynaptic potentials seen with intracellular recordings from brain cells, rather than extracellularly recorded action potentials, correlates better with the frequency of sound. These excitatory postsynaptic potentials are likely to be the link between the patterns of action potentials arriving at nerve cells and the biomolecular activity in the cell. This response also needs to be replicated with improved speech processing strategies. Open Acces...|$|R

The cue-extraction or speech-feature strategies used with the multiple-channel implant have also been shown to provide postlinguistically and prelinguistically deaf children (two to 17 years of age) with significant help in communication.

40|$|Background & Objectives: The {{most common}} {{etiology}} of neck pain is degenerative disc disease, however non-degenerative disease can be important cause of neck pain. This study aims {{to study the}} non-degenerative findings in cervical MRI in symptomatic patients with neck and radicular pain. Materials & Methods: The study was a institutional record based retrospective study performed {{for the duration of}} 3 years. MRI performed for patients with neck pain and/ or radiculopathy were reviewed. Patients with post operative findings were excluded from the study. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 21. 0. Results: A total of 721 MRI were performed for neck pain and radiculopathy, among which 91 (12. 13 %) cases had non-degenerative changes. Most common non degenerative change was traumatic lesions followed by neoplastic lesions and syrinx. Traumatic lesions were more common in males as compared to females. Infection was more common in females as compared to males. C 5 and C 6 vertebrae were most common vertebra involved in trauma and infection. Some cases like signal change in spinal cord, and syrinx were also noted in our study. Conclusion: Non degenerative cause of neck pain were less common but important cause of neck pain.

Given the incidence of pneumococcal otitis media in young children, there has been concern that cochlear implantation could increase the possibility of otitis media, leading to labyrinthitis in this age group. Clinical experience has not indicated an increase in the frequency of otitis media and labyrinthitis in implanted adults or children over two years. However, labyrinthitis has occurred in implanted animals with otitis media. In order {{to assess the impact of}} cochlear implants on the occurrence of labyrinthitis, pneumococcal otitis media was induced in 21 kittens. Thirty-two kitten cochleas were implanted, of which 9 had a fascial graft and 9 a Gelfoam® graft. Nine control cochleas were unimplanted. Labyrinthitis occurred in 44 % of unimplanted controls. 50 % of implanted ungrafted cochleas, and 6 % of implanted grafted cochleas.

This version is reproduced with permission from Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and <b>Neck</b> Surgery. <b>Journal</b> also known as: Australian Journal of Oto-laryngologyBinaural hearing improves speech reception in noise, and is necessary for sound localisation. Normal hearing subjects use both interaural time, and intensity, differences to localise sound. This study investigates why sound localisation in bilateral cochlear implantees is insensitive to interaural time differences (Hoesel 1993). We looked for evidence of neural degeneration in the auditory brainstem involved in binaural sound localisation, since this may have degraded the neural circuitry required to accurately code interaural time delays. Method: The brainstem of a bilateral cochlear implantee was prepared for light microscopy by embedding it in paraffin, sectioning at 10 mm and staining sections with thionine or Luxol fast blue (LFB). The histological sections were digitised with NIH Image and 3 -dimensional reconstructions made of the cochlear nucleus (CN) and superior olivary complex (SOC) with AnalysePC. Within the CN and the SOC, cell number and size were estimated by the physical dissector technique following thionine staining, and myelination of the nerve fibres was estimated using the optical density method following LFB staining. Results: A reduction in cell size (from thionine staining) and myelination (from LFB staining) was seen in both the CN and the SOC. Conclusions: These finding are consistent with neural degeneration within the auditory pathways. This may have lead to a degradation of the neural circuitry required to accurately detect interaural time delays. Open Acces...|$|R

The aim of the implant procedure is to provide adequate hearing for speech and language development through auditory input. This contrasts with the situation for adults with acquired deafness where the cochlear implant aims to restore hearing for someone with well-developed auditory processing and language skills. As with adults, results vary over a wide range for children using the Multi-channel implant. Many factors have been suggested that may contribute to differences in speech perception for implanted children. In an attempt to better understand these factors, the speech perception results for children implanted in Melbourne were reviewed and subjected to statistical analysis. This has indicated that the amount of experience with the implant and the length of sensory deprivation are strongly correlated with perceptual results. This means that younger children are likely to perform better with an implant and that a number of years of experience are required for children to reach their full potential. The results have also indicated that educational placement and management {{play a crucial role in}} children reaching their potential. Overall, 60 % of the children and adolescents in the study have reached a level of open-set speech understanding using the cochlear implant without lipreading. Open Acces...|$|R

The device is intended to be used in combination with lipreading and aided residual hearing, to assist the greatest potential range of users. Sound detection and speech reception threshold levels for a group of 14 congenitally hearing-impaired children were shown to be lower when using the Tickle Talker than for hearing aids across the speech frequency range. Tactile-alone feature contrast testing with adults demonstrated that both segmental and suprasegmental speech feature information was available from the tactual display presented by the Tickle Talker. Clinical results from an ongoing program involving fourteen hearing-impaired children demonstrate benefits in speech perception achieved through use of the Tickle Talker. The children have a range of degree of hearing impairment and educational setting. Results show improvements in discrimination scores for vowel and consonant speech features, and increased scores for recognition of closed-set words and for open-set words and sentences. In addition, anecdotal evidence indicates changes in speech production which may be attributed to perceptual input from the device (both from perception of other speakers, and from voice self-monitoring). Results from a group of 4 adult patients show that tactile input may be effectively combined with either aided residual hearing, or aided residual hearing and lipreading to improve speech discrimination across a similar range of closed and open-set word and sentence tests and on speech tracking. The results indicate that some specific tailoring of the speech information provided through the device for the needs of users with differing degrees of hearing-impairment may be required to optimize potential benefits to speech discrimination.

High mobility and relatively low load which is the subject's neck (own weight, the weight of the head, tension arising from the work of the shoulder girdle) that make it vulnerable injuries and overload resulting from adverse external conditions. Neck pain is a common issue in modern society but the sources of its development can be many. According to many researchers, long-lasting neck pain disturbs afferent nerve conduction perpetuating the abnormal muscle tone in the occiput, neck and shoulder girdle, thus adversely affecting the proprioceptive sensibility in the cervical spine. Stability small disorders can occur many years before the onset of other clinical symptoms, dry as disc protrusions or radiologically confirmed features of disc degeneration, significantly hindering the functioning of patients and Potentially limiting the maximum performance of an athlete. Study objective: The aim of this study is to present possibilities of using a Laser Tracker, a simple and compact device which is intended to examine and train proprioception within the head and neck. Conclusion: In the light of the roles that the cervical spine plays for the posture of the whole body and of the fact That proper proprioception is the main pillar of prevention of overload injuries and determines normal neuromuscular control, it is worth assisting the therapy with a visual feedback. That possibility is given to the Laser Tracker. In the therapeutic practice, it seems to have an invaluable role and further top unlimited options for use.
