40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} were to determine whether: (1) playability features differed across walkable and non-walkable school <b>neighborhoods,</b> and (2) physical activity differed in {{children living in}} walkable and non-walkable school <b>neighborhoods.</b> A total of 3912 grade 6 – 8 students from 132 school <b>neighborhoods</b> were studied. There was more developed park space in high walkability <b>neighborhoods</b> than low walkability <b>neighborhoods.</b> Other playability features were more preferable in the low (e. g., undeveloped treed and water areas) and moderate (e. g., physical disorder/esthetics) walkability <b>neighborhoods.</b> Children from low walkability <b>neighborhoods</b> {{were more likely to}} engage in free-time physical activity outside of school and to achieve recommended levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity than were children from high walkability <b>neighborhoods...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many social {{problems}} in urban <b>neighborhoods</b> {{are rooted in}} high rates of male nonemployment. Past research suggests that male joblessness is a prob-lem largely in low−income, Black <b>neighborhoods.</b> In contrast, this study reports that increases in male nonemployment over the past 30 years have been more widely distributed across urban <b>neighborhoods.</b> Although rates of male joblessness rose most sharply in low−income Black <b>neighborhoods,</b> more advantaged Black <b>neighborhoods</b> and low−income to moderate−income Hispanic and multiethnic <b>neighborhoods</b> also experienced substantial increases. Multivariate models highlight the important role that changes in the economy played {{in the growth of}} male nonemployment in low−income and moderate− income <b>neighborhoods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although many {{environmental}} justice {{studies have examined}} racial and socioeconomic disparities in locations of hazardous waste facilities, no study has examined to date racial and socioeconomic disparities in brownfield locations. In order to fill this gap, this dissertation thus examines the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of <b>neighborhoods</b> adjacent to brownfields in the Detroit region from 1960 to 2000. Based {{on some of the}} past sociological claims in the specific context of brownfields, this dissertation argues that deindustrialization in the 1960 s and the subsequent concentration of poverty in the 1970 s were responsible for socioeconomic disparities in brownfield locations. That is, socioeconomic conditions of brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> are worse than socioeconomic conditions of non-brownfield <b>neighborhoods.</b> Moreover, this dissertation also argues that residential segregation imposed on minorities also was responsible for racial disparities in brownfield locations, meaning that brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> are minority concentrated compared to non-brownfield <b>neighborhoods.</b> This dissertation combines the locations of brownfields provided by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality with 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 US Census data employing distance-based methods. Results reveal that brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> show a higher concentration of minorities and a lower socioeconomic condition than non-brownfield <b>neighborhoods.</b> In addition, race is the strongest independent predictor of brownfield locations. Longitudinal analyses of brownfield locations from 1960 to 2000 reveal that brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> experienced greater socioeconomic decline than did non-brownfield <b>neighborhoods.</b> When socioeconomic characteristics in 1970 are controlled, distinctive patterns of subsequent changes in socioeconomic characteristics were found on the basis of initial socioeconomic status. For the wealthiest <b>neighborhoods</b> in 1970, brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> experienced greater socioeconomic declines than non-brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> only in the 1970 s. For second and third wealthiest <b>neighborhoods,</b> brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> experienced greater socioeconomic declines than non-brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> in both the 1970 s and 1980 s. For the most impoverished <b>neighborhoods,</b> no significant changes in socioeconomic differences between brownfield and non-brownfield <b>neighborhoods</b> were found in any decade. Finally, impoverished and minority-concentrated <b>neighborhoods</b> tend to get priority in brownfield cleanup. Findings from this dissertation suggest that deindustrialization led not only to economic and social inequality but also to environmental inequality...|$|R

40|$|Moving to Opportunity (MTO) is a {{demonstration}} {{designed to ensure}} a rigorous evaluation {{of the effects of}} moving very low-income families with children from public and assisted housing in high-poverty inner-city <b>neighborhoods</b> to middle-class <b>neighborhoods</b> throughout a metropolitan area. Poverty in the United States has become increasingly concentrated in urban, often segregated <b>neighborhoods.</b> These <b>neighborhoods</b> are widely thought to deny their residents opportunities by denying them access to good schools, safe streets, successful role models, and good places to work. Three possible solutions have been suggested to resolve the problem of concentration: ¦ Enabling families living in such <b>neighborhoods</b> to move to <b>neighborhoods</b> with low rates of poverty. ¦ Linking families living in such <b>neighborhoods</b> to jobs in areas with greater economic opportunity. ¦ Promoting the revitalization of distressed inner-city <b>neighborhoods.</b> The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is pursuing research and policy initiatives on all three of these approaches; MTO is designed to measure the value of the first one. We do not know the extent to which moving poor people out of <b>neighborhoods</b> with concentrated poverty actually improves their lives for the long term. Poor people who live in concentrated poverty may differ from other poor people both in ways that can be observed, like race or age, and in ways that may not be observed, like aspiration or persistence. Any differences in people’s outcomes that seem {{to be associated with the}} <b>neighborhoods</b> in which they reside might be caused by those <b>neighborhoods,</b> or they might be caused by unobserved factors that also affect the sorting of people into different <b>neighborhoods.</b> Only an experiment in which <b>neighborhoods</b> are allocated randomly can answer this question...|$|R
