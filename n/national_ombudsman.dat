Nevertheless, Clothier had been an effective Ombudsman: a man of achievement and integrity; he liked to get things done and was unafraid to upset people en route. [...] He had worked to enhance public awareness of the Office and appeared in one cartoon as Superman. It had been important to Clothier to give the citizen a leg up against what must seem to him to be the impenetrable vastness of Whitehall.

40|$|The {{momentum}} of last year’s hunger strike by the anti-corruption campaigner Kisan ‘Anna’ Hazare currently sees India’s parliament {{wrestling with the}} formation of a <b>national</b> corruption <b>ombudsman.</b> Hazare’s campaign rests upon the proposition that the democratic ideals with which the Indian state was formed in 1947 are all too often subverted by the self-interest of public servants. Hazare’s supporters argue that this process has two primary effects. First, corruption allows wealthier citizens to access resources and preferential state treatment to which they are not entitled. Second, corruption constitutes a drain on the coffers of many ordinary Indians, in the form of demands for bribes by state functionaries, without which their services cannot necessarily be procured...|$|R

5000|$|In the United Kingdom a post of Ombudsman is {{attached}} to the Westminster Parliament, jurisdiction extending to all departments of the central government and other government institutions. The office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration was created in 1967, covering the activities of central government departments. A separate (<b>National)</b> Health Service <b>ombudsman</b> was subsequently created, but this office has to date always been held by the same person and the two offices are usually referred to as the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. This Ombudsman will usually investigate complaints referred to him or her by a Member of Parliament where there has been evidence of [...] "maladministration" [...] having occurred which has resulted in an [...] "unremedied injustice". Complaints to the Ombudsman are subject to a [...] "time bar" [...] - this means that the Ombudsman may determine a complaint to be out of jurisdiction if too much time has passed between the event or course of events being complained about and the complaint being received by the Ombudsman.|$|R
