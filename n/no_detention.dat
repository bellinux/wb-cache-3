25|$|Detention {{could take}} three forms. First, the Gelinder Arrest (“mild detention”) {{of up to}} nine weeks simply {{involved}} locking up the prisoner, but theoretically with no further deprivation. Second was the Mittelarrest, lasting up to three weeks. The prisoner could receive nothing from the outside except 10000 g of potato bread and a supplement {{on the fourth day}} of captivity. Finally, the Strenger Arrest, lasting two weeks, was similar to the Mittelarrest but included light deprivation. If <b>no</b> <b>detention</b> cell was available in the camp, standing at a post was used as punishment, in which case German military regulations specified that prisoners punished with Strenger Arrest must also stand at a post for two hours a day.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2005 {{incidents}} of torture {{seem to be}} on the rise. According to an October report by the Prime Ministry's Human Rights Presidency (HRP), the number of torture and cruel treatment cases reported {{in the first six months}} of the year surpassed the number reported in the first half of 2007. The HRP reported that, in the first half of the year, 178 persons reported cruel treatment and 26 reported torture, up from 79 reports of cruel treatment and 17 reports of torture during the same period in 2007. In the report on progress of November 2008 the European Commission stated, [...] "the number of applications to NGOs in relation to cases of torture and ill-treatment has increased, in particular outside official places of detention, notably during apprehension, transfer, or in the open with <b>no</b> <b>detention</b> registered... There is a lack of prompt, impartial and independent investigation into allegations of human rights violations by members of security forces." [...] In the 2009 annual report Amnesty International stated: [...] "Reports of torture and other ill-treatment rose during 2008, especially outside official places of detention but also in police stations and prisons." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the more}} visible groups, Code Pink, opted not to do a large protest in the capitol as the timing was just before the Easter break and the United States Congress {{would not be in}} session, however local {{chapters}} had plans to follow members of Congress and protest in smaller towns across the country. The Washington D.C. chapter did push a pink bed on wheels down the street, urging Americans to [...] "wake up". Members of the [...] "Granny Peace Brigade" [...] delivered hand-knitted [...] "stump socks" [...] – [...] "meant to keep the ends of amputated limbs warm" [...] – to the Department of Veterans Affairs. A [...] "March of the Dead" [...] demonstration was staged near the Women in Military Service for America Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. Outside the National Archives and Records Administration protesters laid a large cloth on the ground with the Preamble to the United States Constitution forcing those entering the building to walk over the text. Nearby a masked man in orange prison clothing kneeled with his hands tied behind his back while wearing a sign – [...] "no torture, no secret prisons, <b>no</b> <b>detention</b> without legal process," [...] referring to contentious issues tied to the United States' treatment of prisoners. Outside the White House protesters acted out a prisoner, dressed in an orange Guantanamo captives' uniform – which signifies the prisoner has been labeled [...] "non-compliant" [...] – being waterboarded.|$|E

60|$|The wind being now N.W., {{the sea was}} {{considerably}} run down, and this morning at five o'clock the landing-master's crew, thirteen in number, left the tender; and having now <b>no</b> <b>detention</b> with the landing of artificers, they proceeded to unmoor the Hedderwick praam-boat, and towed her alongside of the Smeaton: {{and in the course}} of the day twenty-three blocks of stone, three casks of pozzolano, three of sand, three of lime, and one of Roman cement, together with three bundles of trenails and three of wedges, were all landed on the rock and raised to the top of the building by means of the tackle suspended from the cross-beam on the middle of the bridge. The stones were then moved along the bridge on the waggon to the building within reach of the balance-crane, with which they were laid in their respective places on the building. The masons immediately thereafter proceeded to bore the trenail-holes into the course below, and otherwise to complete the one in hand. When the first stone was to be suspended by the balance-crane, the bell on the beacon was rung, and all the artificers and seamen were collected on the building. Three hearty cheers were given while it was lowered into its place, and the steward served round a glass of rum, when success was drunk to the further progress of the building.|$|E
60|$|We now {{loaded with}} naval stores, and cleared again for Liverpool. Bill Swett {{did not make}} this voyage with us, the cook acting as steward. We had good {{passages}} out and home, experiencing <b>no</b> <b>detention</b> or accidents. In the spring of 1810, Captain Johnston gave the ship to Captain B----, who carried us to Liverpool for the third time. Nothing took place this voyage either, worthy of being mentioned, the ship getting back in good season. We now took in a cargo of staves for Limerick. Off the Hook we were brought-to by the Indian sloop-of-war, one of the Halifax cruisers, a squadron in company. Several vessels were coming {{out at the same}} time, and among them were several of the clippers in the French trade. The Amiable Matilda and the Colt went to windward of the Englishmen as if the last had been at anchor; but the Tameahmeah, when nearest to the English, got her yards locked in stays, and was captured. We saw all this, and felt, as was natural to men who beheld such things enacted at the mouth of their own port. Our passages both ways were pleasant, and nothing occurred out of the usual course. I fell in with a press-gang, however, in Limerick, which would have nabbed me, but for a party of Irishmen, who showed fight and frightened the fellows so much that I got clear. Once before, I had been in the hands of these vermin in Liverpool, but Captain Johnston had got me clear by means of my indentures. I was acting as second-mate this voyage.|$|E
60|$|I had the honour {{of writing}} to your Lordship from Lucerne, 19th of August, giving {{an account of}} our movements. We have visited, since, those parts of Switzerland usually deemed most worthy of notice, and the Italian lakes, having stopped four days at Milan, and as many at Geneva. With the {{exception}} of a couple of days on the Lake of Geneva, the weather has been most favourable, though frequently during the last fortnight extremely cold. We have had <b>no</b> <b>detention</b> from illness, nor any bad accident, for which we feel more grateful, on account of some of our fellow travellers, who accidentally joined us for a few days. Of these, one, an American gentleman, was drowned in the Lake of Zurich, by the upsetting of a boat in a storm, two or three days after he parted with us; and two others, near the summit of Mount Jura, {{and in the middle of}} a tempestuous night, were precipitated, they scarcely knew how far, along with one of those frightful and ponderous vehicles, a continental diligence. We have been in Paris since Sunday last, and think of staying about a fortnight longer, as scarcely less will suffice for even a hasty view of the town and neighbourhood. We took Fontainebleau in our way, and intend giving a day to Versailles. The day we entered Paris we passed a well-drest young man and woman, dragging a harrow through a field, like cattle; nevertheless, working in the fields on the sabbath day does not appear to be general in France. On the same day a wretched-looking person begged of us, as the carriage was climbing a hill. Nothing could exceed his transport in receiving a pair of old pantaloons which were handed out of the carriage. This poor mendicant, the postilion told us, was an ancien Curé. The churches seem generally falling into decay in the country. We passed one which had been recently repaired. I have noticed, however, several young persons, men as well as women, earnestly employed in their devotions, in different churches, both in Paris and elsewhere. Nothing which I have seen in this city has interested me at all like the Jardin des Plantes, with the living animals, and the Museum of Natural History which it includes. Scarcely could I refrain from tears of admiration at the sight of this apparently boundless exhibition of the wonders of the creation. The statues and pictures of the Louvre affect me feebly in comparison. The exterior of Paris is much changed since I last visited it in 1792. I miss many ancient buildings, particularly the Temple, where the poor king and his family were so long confined. That memorable spot, where the Jacobin Club was held, has also disappeared. Nor are the additional buildings always improvements; the Pont des Arts, in particular, injures the view from the Pont Neuf greatly; but in these things public convenience is the main point.|$|E

50|$|Argentina {{was said}} to have hosted over 520 clandestine {{detention}} centers during the Dirty War. <b>No</b> two <b>detention</b> centers were the same in torture methods, leadership, or location.

50|$|During {{the reign}} of Edward IV of England, there were two cases {{indicating}} {{that there was a}} remedy for damage done by an intermediate bailee (sub-bailee). In 1473, the weight of opinion of the judges allowed an action for damages due to the use of a sub-bailee. In this case the plaintiff had made a bailment to the defendant to keep goods for him. The defendant's bailee had used and damaged them, This action was thought to be similar to trespass, since the bailees had no right {{to the use of the}} chattels, but it was not a trespass since there was no interference with the chattels while they were in the possession of the plaintiff.
