The estimates based on a sample of Turkish manufacturing firms reveal a positive but lagged exposure to real exchange rate depreciation. The foreign sales ratio is found to be the most important positive determinant of exposure. However, foreign debt and other foreign <b>non-financial</b> <b>liabilities</b> make negative contribution to exposure. This indicates that measurable exposures are not easily hedged because of the missing derivative markets. Finally, the two groups of firms, exporters and competitive, are found to gain from real depreciation while the import competing and less competitive firms are found to lose from real depreciation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{financial}} restructuring announcements on short-term stock returns of banks and non-financial companies during the East Asian crisis. We find that the prices of bank stocks respond positively to announcements relating to government guarantees of bank <b>liabilities.</b> <b>Non-financial</b> companies increase in value upon the announcement of guarantees but announcements that favor {{the use of public}} funds for liquidity and capital support for banks negatively affect their stock prices. These results suggest that announcements of deposit guarantees may provide comfort to market participants during a crisis of confidence, but that the provision of public funds for bank bail-outs were not necessarily viewed as credible means to restore the health of the financial sector...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the level and}} distribution of global household wealth. The levels of assets and debts for 39 countries are measured using household balance sheet and survey data centred on the year 2000. The determinants of mean financial assets, <b>non-financial</b> assets, and <b>liabilities</b> are studied empirically, and the results used to estimate average wealth holdings for countries lacking direct evidence. Data on the pattern of household distribution of wealth are assembled for 20 countries, which together account for 59 per cent of the global population and 75 per cent of global wealth. The observed relation between wealth and income distribution in these 20 countries allows estimates of wealth inequality to be produced for many other nations. Combining the figures for individual countries reveals that net worth averaged US$ 44, 024 per adult in PPP terms across the globe. Wealth of US$ 8, 635 was needed {{to be in the}} top half of the global distribution, and US$ 518, 364 to be in the top one per cent. The top 10 per cent owned 71 per cent of world wealth, and the Gini coefficient for the global distribution of wealth is estimated to be 0. 802, indicating greater inequality than that observed in the globa...|$|R
40|$|For {{a number}} of decades now, at the {{instigation}} of Anglo-Saxon standard setters, {{the basis of the}} traditional accounting model, or the financial conventions which determine how a company’s wealth and income is measured, have been increasingly called into question. This wide-reaching movement, initiated in the United States by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and internationally by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), aims to replace historical cost- the current basis for the measurement of a company’s income statement and valuation of its assets and liabilities- with the notion of fair value. Fair value is defined by the IASC 1 as “the amount for which an asset can be exchanged or a liability assumed between two willing and informed parties as part of a transaction with conflicting interests”. The concept of fair value is broader and can be applied more generally than that of market value 2 : indeed, where there is no quoted market price available on an active market, the valuation is determined by the exchange value agreed by two independent parties, by the market price of an item with similar characteristics or by the net present value estimate of future cash flows.

40|$|The East Asian crisis {{began in}} Thailand in mid- 1997 when an ailing {{financial}} sector, {{a slowdown in}} exports, and large increases in central bank credit to weak financial institutions, triggered a run on the baht. Then the crisis spread to {{other countries in the}} region, as common vulnerabilities, and revaluations of risk in emerging markets, triggered large capital flows. To better understand the impact of different policy responses to financial crises, the authors investigate how stock markets in East Asian countries reacted to the initial policy announcements of bank, and financial restructuring - especially how banking, and non-financial sectors in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand, fared in response to announcements of different restructuring measures. They find that prices of bank stocks, responded positively to announcements about government guarantees of bank <b>liabilities.</b> <b>Non-financial</b> companies gained in value when guarantees were announced, but their stock prices were negatively affected by announcements favoring public re-capitalization schemes, and generous liquidity support programs. Possibly the market was concerned that public funds per se, would not restore the health of the financial sector - {{that they would not be}} sufficient, or would not be used to restructure bank balance sheets, and operations, and allow banks to engage in meaningful corporate restructuring. The announcements of increased public support, have been viewed as a signal that the financial institutions were in a financially weaker position than previously thought.

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{estimate}} of the level and distribution of global household wealth. Mean assets and debts within countries are measured, partly or wholly, for 38 countries using household balance sheet and survey data centred on the year 2000. Determinants of mean financial assets, <b>non-financial</b> assets, and <b>liabilities</b> are studied empirically, {{and the results are}} used to impute values to countries lacking wealth data. Household wealth per adult is US 43, 494 in PPP terms, and ranges regionally from US 11, 655 in Africa to US 193, 147 in North America. Data on the shape of the household distribution of wealth for 20 countries, accounting for 59 per cent of the world 2 ̆ 019 s population and, we estimate, 84 per cent of its wealth are used to establish patterns of wealth inequality within countries. Imputations are again performed for countries lacking wealth data, {{on the basis of the}} observed relation between wealth and income distribution for the 20 countries with data. The Gini coefficient for the global distribution of wealth is 0. 804, and the share of the top 10 per cent is 71 per cent. Wealth of US 8, 325 is needed to be in the top half of the distribution, and US 517, 601 is needed to be in the top one per cent. Between-country differences in wealth are two-thirds of global inequality according to the Gini coefficient, indicating a larger role for within-country inequality than in the case of income according to recent estimates. 2 ̆ 013 wealth; net worth; personal assets; inequality; households; balance sheets; portfolio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor {{a number}} of decades now, at the {{instigation}} of Anglo-Saxon standard setters, {{the basis of the}} traditional accounting model, or the financial conventions which determine how a company's wealth and income is measured, have been increasingly called into question. This wide-reaching movement, initiated in the United States by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and internationally by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), aims to replace historical cost - the current basis for the measurement of a company's income statement and valuation of its assets and liabilities - with the notion of fair value.

The most significant European use of it has been the requirement (IAS 39) to use fair value in the measurement of financial instruments, but the IASB also prescribes it for investment properties (IAS 40) and agriculture (IAS 41). Fair value can potentially be used for a large number of <b>non-financial</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> and can therefore {{serve as the basis for}} a new corporate accounting model which aims to provide a more accurate reflection of the uncertainties affecting future cash flow estimates and investment opportunities in financial reports. This article looks at the usefulness of measuring a company's wealth and net income using the fair value method. In this regard, the key question - is fair value relevant? - can be analysed as follows: do fair value "accounting numbers" provide a better estimate of the value of a company and the risk relating to its activity? How informative are they for users? How useful is fair value information for decision-making? In order to answer these questions, we shall first examine the basis and limitations of the traditional accounting model. We will then analyse the determining factors in the emergence of the fair value method, with particular regard to the role attributed to financial statements and the needs of their users. Lastly, we will present a summary of the empirical studies carried out to assess the usefulness of fair value accounting information...|$|R
40|$|Danmarks Nationalbank {{introduced}} its annual report on financial stability in Denmark in 2000. The {{purpose of the}} analyses is to identify risks currently faced by the financial sector. As the stability in the financial sector depends on the customers' financial circumstances, and as the majority of lending from Danish banks is granted to companies in Denmark, analyses of the development in the non-financial sector are crucial in a financial stability context. The primary goal {{of this paper is}} to make a tool that can assist the regular analyses of the non-financial sector, namely to make a model that is able to predict the firms that end up in financial distress. As the firms in the non-financial sector may go out of business for various reasons (financial distress, voluntary liquidation, and because they are merged or acquired, etc.) the method of competing-risks models seems appropriate. To get point identification a parametric competing-risks model is suggested. The parametric competing-risks model is estimated and the results are reported. The empirical analysis is based on a panel data set containing information on the whole population of Danish <b>non-financial</b> public limited <b>liability</b> companies (aktieselskaber) and private limited liability companies (anpartsselskaber) that existed between 1995 and 2001, covering around 30, 000 firms and more than 150, 000 firm-year observations. After application of certain criteria (e. g. exclusion of holding companies and financial institutions), the sample is representative. More than 20 explanatory variables are included in the estimations. Compared to the existing literature this study introduces a number of novel elements to the empirical analysis. Firstly, the empirical distinction between three modes of exit is developed, namely between firms in financial distress, voluntarily liquidated firms, and firms that merge with other firms or are acquired by other firms, and a competing-risks model is estimated. Secondly, a large number of proxies are used for inherently unobservable variables (e. g. uncertainty, ability and motivation). As is discussed in the paper, proxies are important. Thirdly, the extraordinary data set provides an opportunity to compare different specifications of credit risk models, and so the competing-risks specification is compared to a pooled logit model (where all exits are pooled) and to a simple financial distress model (where the exit to financial distress is modelled and all other firms are treated as censored) ...|$|R
