The exercise demonstrates that the process of augmenting the GTAP database is relatively straightforward.

N. 1993), government consumption {{includes the}} outputs of “non-market processes of production ” and excludes their inputs, these being accounted as intermediate usage by various industries, notably, public administration and defence. Most I-O tables contributed to GTAP apply this convention, but some do not. The non-compliant tables {{differ from the}} compliant in presenting much lower totals for government consumption expenditure, and, within those totals, much lower expenditure shares for public administration and defence (more precisely, for the GTAP commodity osg in which public administration and defence are included). This {{has been a major}} source of variation in I-O structure across regions in past releases. The objectives of this procedure are to identify the non-compliant tables, and to revise them so as to approximate a more compliant treatment. We apply the procedure after initial cleaning (chapter 7), but before any sectoral disaggregation (chapter 8. D). So the I-O tables are not uniform in sectoral classification: some use the GTAP sectoral classification, others various aggregations thereof. To identify non-compliant tables, we calculate the ratio of government consumption to GDP in each table, and compare it with external macroeconomic data. Since the contributed tables have various reference years, we use time series data for the comparison. We deem a table non-compliant if its ratio o...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{conventional}} historic cost accounting {{during periods of}} inflation leads to the overstatement of profit; this in turn may result in overdistribution of resources which should {{have been used to}} preserve the income-earning base of the firm. Should such overdistributions occur, they will add to the circulation of money without a corresponding increase of output and hence increase inflation. During deflation the opposite effects may occur. Thus <b>accounting</b> <b>conventions</b> could amplify inflation or deflation and lead to economic instability. The distortions which thus may be imposed on the economy's income earning capacity and the increased risks arising from the consequent economic instability are likely to lead to corporate failures. Should it be found that <b>accounting</b> <b>conventions</b> operate in this way then, for reasons which are outlined, efforts should be made during a period of relatively low inflation to change the <b>accounting</b> <b>conventions.</b> Other implications of the hypothesis are also discussed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the history of}} the <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> starting from the incidental estimates by Petty, King and Davenant in the seventeenth century. The period 1930 - 1950 was a revolution in terms of the roles and uses of the <b>national</b> <b>accounts,</b> e. g. the discovery of input-output analysis, purchasing power parities and macro-econometric modelling and the Keynesian revolution in economic thinking. Most of these new uses also reinforced each other. These uses were also closely linked to the economic circumstances: the economic crisis of the thirties, the Second World War and the need for recovery afterwards stimulated an active role of the government. In 1947, {{for the first time a}} report on <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> concepts was published by the UN. Some years later, the first official guidelines were published. Since then, <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> theory and practice have increasingly been dominated by these guidelines. The period since the Second World War can thus best be labelled as 'the era of the international guidelines'. Many innovations in <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> have been made since the Second World War. After gaining wider acceptance and maturity, a great deal of them has been included in the guidelines and some others have not. Since the Second World War, the <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> statistics published by countries all over the world have changed drastically in scope, concepts, frequency and detail. These developments in <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> practice do not have a straightforward relationship to the international guidelines. Due to the European Unification, the supply of <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> in Europe has been improved dramatically. ...|$|R
