5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leofric, as his cathedral town was not a centre of {{historical}} writing, and he took little part in events outside his diocese. Little notice was taken {{of his life and}} activities; only a few charters originated in his household and there is only one listing of gifts to his diocese. No official acts from his episcopate have survived, and there is just a brief death notice in the Leofric Missal, although <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of his death occurs in the contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. He occurs as a witness to royal charters.|$|E
5|$|The mission did {{fail and}} the {{internal}} settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl having to work with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.|$|E
5|$|Toirdelbach's {{subsequent}} {{capture of}} Donnchad in Dublin {{suggests that the}} latter {{was not only the}} leading Uí Chennselaig dynast, but was also in the process of using the town as the capital of Leinster. Although the list of Leinster kings in the twelfth-century Book of Leinster declares that Domnall had succeeded his grandfather as King of Leinster, it is apparent that Donnchad was indeed the more powerful claimant. In fact, the king-list of Uí Chennselaig in the same source makes <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of Domnall, and states that it was Donnchad who succeeded Diarmait as King of Uí Chennselaig. Domnall, therefore, may not have reigned in Leinster, and could well have been King of Leinster in name only.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Macedonia {{produced}} {{only a few}} fine foods or beverages that were highly appreciated elsewhere in the Greek world, including eels from the Strymonian Gulf and special wine produced in Chalcidice. The earliest known use of flat bread as a plate for meat was made in Macedonia during the 3rdcenturyBC, which perhaps influenced the later trencher bread of medieval Europe. Cattle and goats were consumed, although there was <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of Macedonian mountain cheeses in literature until the Middle Ages. The comedic playwright Menander wrote that Macedonian dining habits penetrated Athenian high society; for instance, the introduction of meats into the dessert course of a meal. The Macedonians also most likely introduced mattye to Athenian cuisine, a dish usually made of chicken or other spiced, salted, and sauced meats served during the wine course. This particular dish was derided and connected with licentiousness and drunkenness in a play by the Athenian comic poet Alexis about the declining morals of Athenians {{in the age of}} Demetrius I of Macedon.|$|E
5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E

Hip joint activity was restored.|$|R

5000|$|Over 7,000 workers {{gathered}} in Tompkins Square Park on January 13, 1874, including about 1,200 {{workers from the}} German Tenth Ward Workingmen’s Association. [...] This was the largest demonstration that New York City had ever seen. Roughly 1,600 policemen were stationed in the surrounding area. There were <b>no</b> <b>notices</b> in sight, however, to inform the crowd that the meeting’s permit had been revoked.|$|R
25|$|In 1969 and 1970, Soviet {{naval vessels}} visited the city. This {{appeared}} to be in violation of the Kennedy-Khrushchev agreements of 1962. However, there was <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> given by the United States and no confrontation ensued.|$|E
25|$|As the {{political}} situation was chaotic, the ageing 64-year-old commander, Oberst (Colonel) Birger Eriksen, had not received any clear orders and had received <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> {{as to whether the}} approaching warships were German or Allied. He was well aware that Norway was officially neutral, but that the government was inclined to side with the British in case of direct Norwegian involvement in the war.|$|E
25|$|Between 1990 and 2010 the {{population}} living {{on less than}} $1.25 a day in developing countries halved to 21%, or 1.2 billion people, achieving MDG1A before the target date, although the biggest decline was in China, which took <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of the goal. However, the child mortality and maternal mortality are down by less than half. Sanitation and education targets will also be missed.|$|E

25|$|Pennsylvania {{accommodated}} 500 Acadians. Because {{they arrived}} unexpectedly, the Acadians had {{to remain in}} port on their vessels for months. Virginia {{refused to accept the}} Acadians on grounds that <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> was given of their arrival. They were detained at Williamsburg, where hundreds died from disease and malnutrition. They were then sent to Britain where they were held as prisoners until the Treaty of Paris in 1763.|$|E
25|$|During {{the concert}} (specifically, during the {{performance}} of Equinoxe Part 5), the amount of fireworks being used and {{the direction of the}} wind did indeed cause debris to rain down on the audience, covering them in ash. Clayton frantically began to try to stop the proceedings, fearing that people would be injured. Although his fears were duly noted, the crowd took <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of the ash falling onto them and carried on enjoying the concert proceedings.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April 1975, Westerby {{arrives at}} an American {{air force base}} in {{north-east}} Thailand and cables his report to the Circus; he also learns that the North Vietnamese Army has captured Saigon, winning and ending the Vietnam War (1945–75). The Circus orders his return to London, not via Hong Kong. Westerby takes <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> and goes to Hong Kong. At his flat he finds the corpse of Luke, his photojournalist friend, who has been shot because the killer thought he was Westerby.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Farber was {{considered}} for {{a seat on the}} New Jersey Supreme Court by former Gov. James McGreevey. A nomination did not materialize after it was revealed that she had an unpaid traffic ticket for unsafe driving, which led to a bench warrant being issued. Farber claimed she received <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of a hearing and paid a fine to resolve the matter. The driving record issue would later be raised against Farber during her confirmation hearing for Attorney General in the New Jersey Senate.|$|E
25|$|On 5 April 2005 Mote {{appealed the}} Parliament's {{decision}} to the Court of First Instance (CFI). He gave <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of his {{application to the}} Attorney General, nor to Judge Aikens at Lewes Crown Court, meaning that the British Government was unable {{to intervene in the}} case. Mote later applied on 15 December 2006 to the CFI for an interim order suspending the Parliament's decision pending the outcome of their decision. This was rejected on the basis that the condition of urgency was not satisfied.|$|E
25|$|Creon arrives to face Oedipus's accusations. The King {{demands that}} Creon be executed; however, the chorus persuades {{him to let}} Creon live. Jocasta enters and {{attempts}} to comfort Oedipus, telling him he should take <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of prophets. As proof, she recounts an incident in which she and Laius received an oracle which never came true. The prophecy stated that Laius would be killed by his own son; however, Jocasta reassures Oedipus by her statement that Laius was killed by bandits at a crossroads {{on the way to}} Delphi.|$|E

60|$|Did Cauchon hint to the English guards that thenceforth if {{they chose}} to make their prisoner's captivity crueler and bitterer than ever, <b>no</b> {{official}} <b>notice</b> would be taken of it? Perhaps so; since the guards did begin that policy at once, and <b>no</b> official <b>notice</b> was taken of it. Yes, from that moment Joan's life in that dungeon was made almost unendurable. Do not ask me to enlarge upon it. I will not do it.|$|R

25|$|He {{spent nine}} {{months on the}} islands, much longer than he had intended. As a Chief Qadi, his skills were highly {{desirable}} in the formerly Buddhist nation that had recently converted to Islam. Half-kidnapped into staying, he became chief judge and married into the royal family of Omar I. He became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgments in the laissez-faire island kingdom began to chafe with its rulers. In the Rihla he mentions his dismay at the local women going about with no clothing above the waist, and the locals taking <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> when he complained. From the Maldives, he carried on to Sri Lanka and visited Sri Pada and Tenavaram temple.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 and 2009, 14 {{lawsuits}} {{were filed}} against JPMorgan Chase in various district courts {{on behalf of}} Chase credit card holders claiming the bank violated the Truth in Lending Act, breached its contract with the consumers and committed a breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The consumers contended that Chase, with little or <b>no</b> <b>notice,</b> increased minimum monthly payments from 2% to 5% on loan balances that were transferred to consumers' credit cards based {{on the promise of}} a fixed interest rate. In May 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California certified the class action lawsuit. On July 23, 2012, Chase agreed to pay $100 million to settle the claim.|$|E
25|$|Her mother, of the House of Hohenzollern, was a {{woman of}} quite distraught {{temperament}} and was melancholic. It is possible she was insane. After the king died on 6November 1632 on the battlefield, his corpse was brought home in a coffin, with his heart in a separate box. Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried until she could be buried with him. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open, and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking <b>no</b> <b>notice</b> of the putrefaction. Eventually, the embarrassed Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, saw no other solution than to have a guard posted at the room to prevent further episodes. As a result, he was not buried until 22June 1634, more than eighteen months later.|$|E
