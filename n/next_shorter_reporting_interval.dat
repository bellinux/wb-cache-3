This project has been done for Yazd Government, therefore due to security issues; statement whole of this project is not possible and therefore only some of permitted information could be mentioned. As a basic model Bryson's model was selected and the research group did its stages after each other. During this process, the group used observations, questionnaires, interviews and official national and international documents, analyzed internal and external different stakeholders, defined strategic issues and finally proposed possible strategies for the Yazd government. The procedure of strategy planning is illustrated briefly in this paper. In the end of project, the research group presents its findings and results to the client with a one year operating plan.

40|$|The <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> of {{infectious}} diseases is often determined as a time unit in the calendar regardless of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. No guidelines have been proposed to choose the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> {{of infectious}} diseases. The present study aims at translating coarsely reported epidemic data into the reproduction number and clarifying the ideal <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> to offer detailed insights into {{the time course of}} an epidemic. We briefly revisit the dispersibility ratio, i. e. ratio of cases in successive <b>reporting</b> <b>intervals,</b> proposed by Clare Oswald Stallybrass, detecting technical flaws in the historical studies. We derive a corrected expression for this quantity and propose simple algorithms to estimate the effective reproduction number as a function of time, adjusting the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> to the generation time of a disease and demonstrating a clear relationship among the generation-time distribution, <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> and growth rate of an epidemic. Our exercise suggests that an ideal <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> is the mean generation time, so that the ratio of cases in successive intervals can yield the reproduction number. When it is impractical to report observations every mean generation time, we also present an alternative method that enables us to obtain straightforward estimates of the reproduction number for any <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> that suits the practical purpose of infection control. © 2009 The Royal Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this <b>report</b> (<b>Short</b> Interpregnancy <b>Intervals</b> and the Risks of Adverse Birth Outcomes in Indiana: Statistics from the Live Birth Data 1990 - 2005) is to assess trends in the {{prevalence}} of short interpregnancy intervals in Indiana from 1990 to 2005 and to evaluate its association with low birth weight, preterm, and small-for-gestational age birth. Methods Data for this study are obtained from the birth certificates of singleton infants born to multiparous mothers between 1990 and 2005. Time trends in the prevalence of short interpregnancy intervals are presented in four-year intervals and by race and Hispanic origin, age, and education of mother. Prevalence of adverse birth outcomes according to interpregnancy interval is presented by race and Hispanic origin for the 2002 - 2005 period. Association of short interpregnancy interval with adverse outcomes was examined by multiple regression analysis, controlling for the potential confounding variables. Short interpregnancy interval is defined as less than 12 completed months between the last live birth and the conception and was computed as the interva...|$|R
30|$|Part b of Fig.  14 {{shows the}} {{expected}} battery lifetime for different <b>report</b> <b>intervals</b> {{and for a}} different number of days in Secure Transport Mode (STP). The STP-mode is most energy-consuming because the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> will be highest and also the door sensor needs to be monitored. We can conclude that in case a battery lifetime of 1 – 3 years is desired, either the <b>report</b> <b>interval</b> {{or the number of}} days in STP must be limited. Since the number of days in STP is dependent on the usage of the container, the only possibility is to let the <b>report</b> <b>interval</b> vary based on the value of the cargo and the days already spent in STP. Considering the same example as above, the number of days in STP could almost double when two tracking devices share their UMTS/GPRS/GPS.|$|R

40|$|Background: Measurement {{uncertainty}} (MU) estimates {{can be used}} by clinicians in result interpretation for {{diagnosis and}} monitoring and by laboratories in assessing assay fitness for use and analytical troubleshooting. However, MU is not routinely used to assess the appropriateness of the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> We describe the relationship between MU and the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> Methods and results: The <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> R is the smallest unit of measurement chosen for clinical reporting. When choosing the appropriate value for R, it is necessary that the reference change values and expanded MU values can be meaningfully calculated. Expanded MU provides the tighter criterion for defining an upper limit for R. This limit can be determined as R 4 k SDa/ 1. 9, where SDa is the analytical standard deviation and k is the coverage factor (usually 2). Conclusion: Using MU estimates to determine the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> for quantitative laboratory results ensures that reporting practices match local analytical performance and recognizes the inherent error of the measurement process...|$|R

We present a model for the estimation of the maximum number of specimens for reference interval studies based on setting the 90 % confidence interval of the reference limits to be equal to the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> Methods: Equations describing the bounds on the upper and lower 90 % confidence intervals for logarithmically transformed and untransformed data were derived and applied to determine the maximum number of specimens required to calculate a reference interval for 12 common chemistry and hematology analytes.

The purpose of this study was to establish the predictors of contraceptive adherence. A total of 211 women were enrolled and interviewed while seeking family planning services at reproductive health Uganda facility. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the association between adherence and the independent variables. Most of the respondents (83. 4 %) were currently using a hormonal contraceptive. Of the participants who were using contraceptives, 43 % had discontinued use at some time for reasons other than pregnancy, 53. 1 % <b>reported</b> having <b>short</b> birth <b>interval</b> less than 2 years, and 7 % reported having more children than desired. The predictors of poor contraceptive adherence included lower education level (OR 2. 484, 95 % CI 1. 403 – 4. 397) and lower self-efficacy (OR 1. 698, 95 % CI 1. 959 – 3. 004).
