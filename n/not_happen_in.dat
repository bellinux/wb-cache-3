He was appointed as the Conservative Party's Ontario co-chair for the 2004 federal election. There were rumours that Baird would leave provincial politics to contest the 2004 election, but this did <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b> <b>In</b> 2005 he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the Conservative Party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted {{the drug was}} being used recreationally in California. It also {{reported}} that BZP was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs. Not long after, {{there was an explosion}} in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> time for the law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Biographies {{published}} {{after his}} death were typically heavy on eulogy. Theodore Martin's five-volume magnum opus was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account. Lytton Strachey's Queen Victoria (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as Hector Bolitho and Roger Fulford, who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters. Popular myths about Prince Albert—such as the claim that he introduced Christmas trees to Britain—are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers, such as Stanley Weintraub, portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance, who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime. In the 2009 movie The Young Victoria, Albert, played by Rupert Friend, is made into a heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet—something that did <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> real life.|$|E

25|$|Chloroplasts develop from proplastids when {{seedlings}} {{emerge from}} the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo {{and in the absence}} of light, proplastids develop into etioplasts that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo etiolation. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.|$|E

40|$|Chapter 4 of Being Known makes a {{bold and}} {{sophisticated}} attempt {{to integrate the}} metaphysics of modality with its epistemology.

Christopher Peacocke's answer roots the possible in the actual, more specifically in different ways of assigning actually existing items as the semantic values of Thoughts (on a broadly Fregean understanding) and their constituent concepts.

She said this would <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> 2012, but would probably take place in 2013.

25|$|Minh {{was allowed}} to emigrate to France in 1983 and settled near Paris, and it was again assumed that the communists had {{permitted}} him to leave {{on the basis that}} he remain aloof from politics and history. In the late 1980s, there was speculation he would be allowed to return to Vietnam to live out his last years, but this did <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b> <b>In</b> the last few years of his life, he lived in Pasadena, California, with his daughter, Mai Duong.

25|$|In general terms, {{the free}} energy change (ΔG) of a {{reaction}} determines whether a chemical change will take place, but kinetics describes {{how fast the}} reaction is. A reaction can be very exothermic and have a very positive entropy change but will <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> practice if the reaction is too slow. If a reactant can produce two different products, the thermodynamically most stable one will in general form, except in special circumstances when the reaction {{is said to be}} under kinetic reaction control. The CurtinHammett principle applies when determining the product ratio for two reactants interconverting rapidly, each going to a different product. It is possible to make predictions about reaction rate constants for a reaction from free-energy relationships.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's {{main line}} of {{argument}} was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> {{a short period of}} time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of Plutonism were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of catastrophism pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, but a great change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.|$|E
