That is, the node j is {{selected from the}} neighborhood (Oi) of node i (o.r) with probability K_i^- 1 ∏^∗(k_j), where K_i=∑_j∈O_i∏^∗(k_j) [...]. Then, delete the links of nodes i and j and repeat this step mp times. The anti-preferential deletion {{is consistent with the}} topological dynamic changes caused by node and link failure in WSN. When remaining energy of node in the network is consumed to a certain threshold after a period of time, the link with which it is connected will fail and be deleted. The anti-preferred deletion mechanism exists in many practical networks. For example, in a <b>user’s</b> e-mail <b>network,</b> a <b>user’s</b> <b>address</b> book is used as a node, and an address in the address book is used as a link. When the address in the address book has not been used for a long time, the link represented by this address will be deleted in the e-mail network that has evolved. Similarly, in the language network, when some old expressions and sentences are no longer used, some languages will be isolated and deleted. In this paper, isolated nodes with a degree of 0 will also be permanently deleted from the network.|$|R

Consequently, managing networks is no longer only a job for skilled network administrators, but has also become one for general home users, who {{have to deal with}} various home network management tasks such as network/device configuration, security management, and troubleshooting to name but a few. However, many home <b>network</b> <b>users</b> have difficulty managing these tasks due to the inherent complexity of the home network and the lack of management tools designed for non-skilled <b>network</b> <b>users.</b> This dissertation <b>addresses</b> the problem of network management for non-skilled <b>network</b> <b>users</b> by investigating a home network management tool with a new interaction model called Eden. Eden is an interactive home network management tool based on direct manipulation. It eliminates the need for users to see all the technical minutia of the network while still allowing users to perform management tasks with a simple drag-and-drop of visually represented networking devices and <b>network</b> settings. The <b>user</b> interface evaluation showed that Eden is intuitive and easy enough for general home users to use. The usability evaluation showed that Eden performed better overall than existing tools and {{that the majority of the}} study participants preferred Eden over the existing tools for future use. My contributions are twofold. First, I present what is to my knowledge the first fully direct manipulation system designed specifically for home network management. Secondly, my evaluation highlights a number of properties in my design [...] particularly in my conceptual model [...] that improve users' understandings of the network, and their ease with managing it.

40|$|International audienceRecommender systems aim at {{suggesting}} {{items to}} users that fit their preferences. Collaborative filtering {{is one of}} the most popular approaches of recommender systems; it exploits users' ratings to express preferences. Traditional approaches of collaborative filtering suffer from the cold-start problem: when a new item enters the system, it cannot be recommended while a sufficiently high number of users have rated it. The quantity of required ratings is not known a priori and may be high as it depends on who rates the items. In this chapter, we propose to automatically select the adequate set of <b>users</b> in the <b>network</b> of <b>users</b> to <b>address</b> the cold-start problem. We call them the "delegates", and they correspond to those who should rate a new item first so as to reliably deduce the ratings of other users on this item. We propose to address this issue as an opinion poll problem. We consider two kinds of delegates: mentors and leaders. We experiment some measures, classically exploited in social networks, to select the adequate set of delegates. The experiments conducted show that only 6 delegates are sufficient to accurately estimate ratings of the whole set of other users, which dramatically reduces the number of users classically required...|$|R

40|$|Communication in {{wireless}} networks elementally comprises of packet exchanges over individual wireless {{links and}} routes formed by these links. To this end, two problems are fundamental: assessment of link quality and {{identification of the}} least-cost (optimal) routes. However, {{little is known about}} achieving these goals without incurring additional overhead to IEEE 802. 11 networks. In this thesis, I design and experimentally evaluate two frameworks that enable individual 802. 11 nodes to characterize their wireless links and routes by employing only local and passively collected information. First, I enable 802. 11 nodes to assess their links by characterizing packet delivery failures and failure causes. The key problem is that nodes cannot individually observe many factors that affect the packet delivery at both ends of their links and in both directions of 802. 11 communication. To this end, instead of relying on the assistance of other nodes, I design the first practical framework that extrapolates the missing information locally from the nodes' overhearing, the observable causal relationships of 802. 11 operation and characterization of the corrupted and undecodable packets. The proposed framework employs only packet-level information generally reported by commodity 802. 11 wireless cards. Next, I design and evaluate routing primitives that enable individual nodes to suppress their poor route selections. I refer to a route selection as poor whenever the employed routing protocol fails to establish the existing least-cost path according to an employed routing metric. This thesis shows that an entire family of the state-of-the art on-demand distance-vector routing protocols, including the standards-proposed protocol for IEEE 802. 11 s mesh networks, suffers from frequent and long-term poor selections having arbitrary path costs. Consequently, such selections generally induce severe throughput degradations for <b>network</b> <b>users.</b> To <b>address</b> this problem, I design mechanisms that identify optimal paths locally by employing only the information readily available to the affected nodes. The proposed mechanisms largely suppress occurrence of inferior routes. Even when such routes are selected their durations are reduced by several orders of magnitude, often to sub-second time scales. My work has implications on several key areas of wireless networking: It removes systematic failures from wireless routing and serves as a source of information {{for a wide range of}} protocols including the protocols for network management and diagnostics...|$|R

In general, legal unbundling implies a less effective regulation, but it reduces the degree of market distortion caused by the difference between marginal costs and average costs (= regulated prices of network usage). We find that the necessary condition is not satisfied for realistic values of the relevant parameters, i. e. legal unbundling leads to lower costumer prices than ownership unbundling in most relevant markets.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with flow control and resource allocation problems in computer networks in which real-time applications may have hard quality of service (QoS) requirements. Recent optimal flow control approaches are unable {{to deal with these}} problems since QoS utility functions generally do not satisfy the strict concavity condition in real-time applications. For elastic traffic, we show that bandwidth allocations using the existing optimal flow control strategy can be quite unfair. If we consider different QoS requirements among <b>network</b> <b>users,</b> it may be undesirable to allocate bandwidth simply according to the traditional max-min fairness or proportional fairness. Instead, a network should have the ability to allocate bandwidth resources to various <b>users,</b> <b>addressing</b> their real utility requirements. For these reasons, this paper proposes a new distributed flow control algorithm for multiservice networks, where the application’s utility is only assumed to be continuously increasing over the available bandwidth. In this, we show that the algorithm converges, and that at convergence, the utility achieved by each application is well balanced in a proportionally (or max-min) fair manner...|$|R

40|$|Network use-of-system (UoS) tariffs play an {{essential}} role in the deregulated power markets to recover network investment and maintenance costs from <b>network</b> <b>users,</b> and send economic signals to influence the users' behaviors in using systems. The tariffs are essential to the business operation of both <b>network</b> operators and <b>users.</b> They, however, could have great volatility due to the uncertainties from both external and internal factors. Such uncertain tariffs could bring severe adverse impacts to <b>network</b> <b>users,</b> which justifies that there is an urgent need to reduce the tariff volatility and improve its predictability. This paper for the first time investigates the variations in network tariffs that cause great risks to <b>network</b> <b>users</b> and then designs financial tools to reduce the volatility. The causing factors of the variations are categorized into global and local groups according to their different features. After introducing the process from network planning, charging to revenue reconciliation, the paper discusses the benefits of hedging for <b>network</b> <b>users.</b> In order to reduce tariff volatility, it proposes a novel risk management strategy to maintain the consistency of tariffs. It is achieved by designing long-term contracts using financial hedging. The value of hedge contracts is decided by three key factors: hedged load/generation percentage, hedged price, and risk premium. The hedged part is charged at hedged prices and the non-hedged part is charged at actual prices, on top of which customers needs to pay extra for the risk premium. The paper also designs an optimal decision-making tool to assist <b>network</b> <b>users</b> to manage long-term contracts in order to reduce total tariff costs. As demonstrated in the case study, the proposed long-term products can effectively reduce tariff volatility for <b>network</b> <b>users</b> and create a safe environment for their business operation...|$|R
