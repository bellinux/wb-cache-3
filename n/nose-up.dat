5|$|On 20 March 2009, Emirates Airline Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500, {{was taking}} off from Melbourne Airport on Runway 16 for a flight to Dubai International Airport and failed to become {{airborne}} in the normal distance. When the aircraft was {{nearing the end of}} the runway, the crew commanded <b>nose-up</b> sharply, causing its tail to scrape along the runway as it became airborne, during which smoke was observed in the cabin. The crew dumped fuel and returned to the airport. The damage caused to the aircraft was considered substantial. The aircraft damaged a strobe {{light at the end of}} the runway as well as an antenna on the localiser, which led to the ILS being out of service for some time causing some disruptions to the airport's operation.|$|E
25|$|No {{mechanical}} defects, {{other than}} the inoperative fuel pump, were reported. The aircraft {{was found to be}} in a high <b>nose-up</b> attitude at impact.|$|E
25|$|After {{four years}} of investigation, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile {{published}} its final report in June 2016. It was found that incorrect <b>nose-up</b> commands to the trimmable horizontal stabilizer were caused by a soldering defect on the pin of its electronic control unit provided by Rockwell Collins.|$|E
25|$|Eyewitnesses (including a Mr Russell) {{state that}} at 3:05pm the Avro Tudor was {{approaching}} runway 28 of Llandow aerodrome at an abnormally low altitude with the undercarriage down. The pilot attempted {{to correct the}} descent by increasing {{the power of the}} engines and brought the plane up. The aircraft rose steeply to 100m (300ft) attaining a <b>nose-up</b> attitude of 35 degrees to the vertical, and then the aircraft stalled.|$|E
25|$|By 16:10:32 (122 seconds), the leading-edge devices had stowed {{fully into}} the wing. The speed was , and height {{above the ground}} was , with the {{aircraft}} still held into its usual climb attitude. Key continued to hold the <b>nose-up</b> attitude {{when there was a}} second stick shake and stick push in the following two seconds. A third stick push followed 127 seconds into the flight but no recovery was attempted. One second later, the stall warning and recovery system was over-ridden by a flight crew member.|$|E
25|$|The Camel {{proved to}} have better {{manoeuvrability}} than the Albatros D.III and D.V and offered heavier armament and better performance than the Pup and Triplane. Its controls were light and sensitive. The Camel turned more slowly to the left, {{which resulted in a}} <b>nose-up</b> attitude due to the torque of the rotary engine, but the torque also resulted in being able to turn to the right quicker than other fighters, although that resulted in a tendency towards a nose-down attitude from the turn. Because of the faster turning capability to the right, some pilots preferred to change heading 90° to the left by turning 270° to the right.|$|E
25|$|The Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight is a medium-lift tandem-rotor {{transport}} helicopter, {{furnished with}} a set of counter-rotating main rotors in a tandem-rotor configuration. It was typically powered by a pair of General Electric T58 turboshaft engines, which were mounted {{on each side of the}} rear rotor pedestal; power to the forward rotor was transferred from the rear-mounted engines via a drive shaft. For redundancy, both engines are coupled so that either one would be capable of powering both of the main rotors in the event of a single engine failure or a similar emergency situation. Each of the rotors feature three blades, which can be folded to better facilitate storage and naval operations. The CH-46 features a fixed tricycle landing gear, complete with twin wheels on all three legs of the landing gear; this configuration results in a <b>nose-up</b> stance, helping to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. Two of the main landing gear were installed within protruding rear sponsons; the free interior space of the sponsons are also used to house fuel tanks, possessing a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).|$|E
500|$|In late 1963 {{the project}} was named Tagboard; the Q-12 was re-designated D-21 while the A-12 version {{launcher}} became M-21 (D- for [...] "daughter" [...] and M- for [...] "mother"). Two of the original 18 A-12 aircraft were designated as M-21s with serial numbers 60-6940 and 60-6941. The M-21 was a two-seat version of the A-12, with a pylon on the fuselage centerline between the vertical stabilizers to carry the drone in a <b>nose-up</b> attitude.|$|E
500|$|Based upon an {{estimated}} takeoff weight of 49,087 pounds (22,265kg), the manufacturer calculated {{a speed of}} 138 knots (159 miles per hour or 256 kilometers per hour) and a distance of [...] would have been needed for rotation (increasing <b>nose-up</b> pitch), with more runway needed to achieve lift-off. At a speed approaching , Polehinke remarked, [...] "That is weird with no lights" [...] referring {{to the lack of}} lighting on Runway 26 – it was about an hour before daybreak. [...] "Yeah", confirmed Clay, but the flight data recorder gave no indication either pilot tried to abort the takeoff as the aircraft accelerated to [...]|$|E
500|$|Modifications were {{completed}} on the Ames model and testing resumed in April 1961. The new design demonstrated much better control in hover and considerably improved lift. The vehicle was {{now able to}} travel at up to , a great improvement over the [...] previously reached. However, it remained unstable in pitch, and exhibited a strong <b>nose-up</b> trim. NASA engineers attempted to modify this with a T-tail, but this proved to sit within the airflow of the turborotor and did not help. Frost's team considered two new designs, one with a large vertical tail and one with a wing with tip mounted verticals —"winglets." [...] Both designs used two [...] thrust General Electric J85 turbojets and increased the turborotor diameter from five to six ft.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} found {{that as the}} B-52 entered its final turn sequence around the tower, its indicated airspeed (IAS) was [...] Although Holland increased the engine power after starting the turn, his input came too late to maintain the aircraft's airspeed, as the B-52 turbofan engines take up to eight seconds to respond to throttle commands. Even though the airspeed indicator was available to all four aircrew members, the aircraft's airspeed was allowed to continue to decrease. Eight seconds before impact, the aircraft's IAS had deteriorated to [...] and the aircraft's bank angle increased past 60°. At this time Holland or McGeehan applied full right spoiler, right rudder, and <b>nose-up</b> elevator, and the aircraft entered a turning flight stall (also called accelerated stall). This phenomenon is a stall that occurs at a higher airspeed than the design stall speed – which always refers to {{straight and level flight}} – because the aircraft is turning. Due to the bank of 60° or more, the stall speed for the aircraft at that moment was [...] Thus, flying 2 knots slower, the aircraft stalled, without having sufficient altitude to recover before striking the ground.|$|E
500|$|The second prototype, VX777, flew in September 1953. More {{representative}} of production aircraft, it was lengthened {{to accommodate a}} longer nose undercarriage leg, featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with Bristol Olympus 100 engines of [...] thrust. At Falk's suggestion, a fighter-style control stick replaced the control wheel. Both prototypes had almost pure delta wings with straight leading edges. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired and fitted with Olympus 101 engines of [...] thrust before resuming trials in October 1955. While exploring the high speed and high altitude flight envelope, mild buffeting and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the speed of sound, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive, unacceptable to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down. The solution included the [...] "phase 2" [...] wing, featuring a kinked and drooped leading edge and vortex generators on the upper surface, first tested on 707A WD480. An auto-mach trimmer introduced a <b>nose-up</b> attitude when at high speeds; the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight.|$|E
2500|$|... 3. The {{accident}} airplane's movements {{after the}} command captain {{returned to the}} cockpit {{were the result of}} both pilots' inputs, including opposing elevator inputs where the relief first officer continued to command nose-down and the captain commanded <b>nose-up</b> elevator movements.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 March 1949 a Lockheed Lodestar {{aircraft}} became airborne at Coolangatta, Queensland, Australia for {{a flight}} to Brisbane. [...] Before reaching a height of [...] it suddenly pitched <b>nose-up,</b> stalled and crashed onto its belly beyond {{the end of the}} airstrip.|$|E
2500|$|Analysis of the FDR and the CVR {{revealed}} {{that at the}} moment the aircraft struck the ground it was at a heading of 339° (north-northwest, in line with the runway centerline) and [...] short of the threshold of runway 34 at a positive pitch rate of five degrees (which corresponds to a slight <b>nose-up</b> position). The autopilot was found to have been activated up until a short time before the accident.|$|E
2500|$|The airframe, {{engine and}} crew {{compartments}} were retained from the ANT-25 almost unchanged, although the co-pilot's and navigator's positions were each given one [...] DA machine gun for defense. The DB-1 (long-range bomber model 1), {{as it was}} designated in VVS service, was given a smooth skin and a bomb bay {{was built in the}} wing center section that carried ten [...] FAB-100 bombs <b>nose-up.</b> An AFA-14 camera was mounted in the rear cockpit, but other cameras could be carried instead of the bombs.|$|E
2500|$|For a reflex-cambered airfoil, {{the center}} of {{pressure}} lies {{a little ahead of}} the quarter-chord point at maximum lift coefficient (large angle of attack), but as lift coefficient reduces (angle of attack reduces) {{the center of}} pressure moves forward. [...] When the lift coefficient is zero an airfoil is generating no lift but a reflex-cambered airfoil generates a <b>nose-up</b> pitching moment, so the location of the center of pressure is an infinite distance ahead of the airfoil. [...] This direction of movement of the center of pressure on a reflex-cambered airfoil has a stabilising effect.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the flight}} voice {{recorder}} {{revealed that the}} co-pilot and a third pilot on the flight deck had made relatively subtle suggestions to the pilot– once the stick-shaker warning commenced– that he must {{deal with the fact}} that the plane was still in a speed-draining <b>nose-up</b> attitude, protocols and training were reinforced to establish a greater willingness of junior flight-deck staff to be more forceful in similar situations. [...] (In the Birgenair crash, it had even been revealed that the co-pilot chose not to use his own, active, stick to counter the pilot and try to bring the nose down.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was descending through {{an altitude of}} [...] when the stick shaker activated and sounded for 3 seconds. After 1.5 seconds, the stick shaker sounded again. The aircraft continued to descend below the glide slope until it collided with a stand of trees in a high <b>nose-up</b> attitude. It came to rest upright in a commercial building, [...] short of the runway. After the impact, a fire started {{in or near the}} left engine, which spread {{to the rest of the}} aircraft. At least four of the passengers survived the crash, however, only three escaped before the {{aircraft was}} fully engulfed in flames.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plane was}} too badly damaged to {{determine}} a definite cause. Canadian aircraft {{were not required to}} carry voice cockpit recorders or flight data recorders at this point, complicating the investigation into the crash of TCA Flight 831. [...] The official report released in 1965 pointed to problems in the jet's pitch trim system (the device that maintains a set <b>nose-up</b> or -down attitude) as a possibility, since a pitch trim problem caused the similar crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 304, another DC-8, three months later in 1964. [...] Other possible causes were put forward that could not be ruled out: 1) Icing of the pitot system; and 2) Failure of the vertical gyro.|$|E
2500|$|The {{take-off}} {{appeared to}} be normal until the undercarriage retracted. [...] The aircraft quickly pitched <b>nose-up</b> into an almost vertical attitude. [...] First the aircraft rolled to the right until the wing was almost vertical, then it rolled to the left. [...] The aircraft reached a height estimated to be between [...] and then began descending and curving to the left. [...] It continued to descend until it crashed onto its belly, tree stumps tearing open {{the underside of the}} left wing and the fuselage beneath the cabin door. The aircraft slid for only about [...] before stopping about [...] beyond the end of the strip. It came to rest in the shallow waters of a swamp {{at the edge of the}} airstrip. Within seconds of the crash, flame and black smoke erupted from the wreckage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} in daily civil operations in Australia since November 1946 so the investigators assumed {{there must have been}} numerous flights with the centre of gravity significantly more than 39% of Mean Aerodynamic Chord. [...] It was necessary for the investigators to find something unique about the fatal flight of VH-BAG that would explain its sudden climb immediately after take-off and the pilot's inability to regain control and prevent the aircraft crashing. [...] The aircraft's tailplane {{was one of the few}} parts of the aircraft not destroyed by fire. [...] The position of the elevator trim tab spool appeared to be in the normal position for landing rather than a typical position for take-off. The investigators concluded that on the final takeoff it was likely that the elevator trim tab was still set for landing. [...] This, coupled with the aircraft being tail-heavy and longitudinally unstable after undercarriage retraction, caused the aircraft to pitch <b>nose-up</b> so strongly that the pilot was unable to retain control or prevent the aircraft stalling.|$|E
2500|$|Feighnter was {{assigned}} as the Navy's project pilot for the Vought F7U Cutlass, a carrier-based jet fighter-bomber with swept wings and an unusual tailless design. From July 23 to August 14, 1951, he performed carrier suitability {{tests of the}} Cutlass on board the USS Midway. Feightner survived a number of near-fatal incidents in the Cutlass. During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine. On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier [...] Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme <b>nose-up</b> attitude that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the Landing Signal Officer (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly struck the ramp. Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did {{not live up to}} its potential and remained in service less than four years.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 July 1908 the airship was reinflated {{with fresh}} {{hydrogen}} to ensure maximum lift for the planned 24-hour endurance trial, {{which was to}} be a return flight to Mainz. Shortly after setting off the next morning a fan broke on the forward engine and it had to turn back. The following day it was damaged while being manoeuvered out of its hangar: repairs were not completed {{until the end of the}} month. [...] The trial flight finally started on 4 August, when LZ4 lifted off at 06:22 in the morning, carrying 12 people and sufficient fuel for 31hours of flight. The flight to Zürich had excited considerable public interest, and large crowds gathered along the route to witness the flight, which took it over Konstanz, Schaffhausen, Basel and Strasbourg. [...] Shortly after passing Strasbourg the forward engine had to be stopped since the fuel tank in the engine gondola had been exhausted, and needed to be refilled. At this point the airship was flying light due to the heat of the sun having caused the hydrogen to expand, and was being held at a low altitude by dynamic downforce generated by flying in a nose-down attitude: with the loss of the power of one engine, it rose to an altitude of , venting gas from the relief valves as it did so. At 1:58 p.m the aft engine had to be stopped for refuelling: this time the airship rose to , with a further loss of hydrogen. Two further engine stoppages caused further loss of gas: by now LZ4 was only being kept in the air by dynamic lift generated by flying with a <b>nose-up</b> attitude, the resultant drag reducing its speed to , and at 5:24 pm a landing was made on the Rhine near Oppenheim, [...] short of Mainz. [...] All superfluous items and five crew members were unloaded, and the flight was resumed at 10:20. Mainz was reached half an hour later, and the ship turned to begin its return journey. Further engine problems followed: a crank bearing in the forward engine melted at 1:27 am, reducing airspeed to about [...] and it was decided to land to have the engine repaired by engineers from the Daimler works at Untertürkheim. Accordingly, LZ4 was set down at 7:51 am at Echterdingen.|$|E

50|$|On {{aircraft}} with swept wings, {{wing tip}} stall also produces an undesirable <b>nose-up</b> pitching moment which hampers {{recovery from the}} stall.|$|E
50|$|On 24 September 1994, TAROM Flight 381, an Airbus A310 {{registered}} YR-LCA {{flying from}} Bucharest to Paris Orly, {{went into a}} sudden and uncommanded <b>nose-up</b> position and stalled. The crew attempted to countermand the aircraft's flight control system but were unable to get the nose down while remaining on course. Witnesses saw the aircraft climb with an extreme <b>nose-up</b> attitude, then bank sharply left, then right, then fall into a steep dive. Only when the dive produced additional speed was the crew able to recover steady flight. An investigation found that an overshoot of flap placard speed during approach, incorrectly commanded by the captain, caused a mode transition to flight level change. The auto-throttles increased power and trim went full <b>nose-up</b> as a result. The crew's attempt at commanding the nose-down elevator could not counteract effect of stabilizer <b>nose-up</b> trim, and the resulting dive brought the aircraft from a height of 4,100 ft {{at the time of}} the stall to 800 ft when the crew was able to recover command. The aircraft landed safely after a second approach. There were 186 people on board.|$|E
50|$|No {{mechanical}} defects, {{other than}} the inoperative fuel pump, were reported. The aircraft {{was found to be}} in a high <b>nose-up</b> attitude at impact.|$|E
5000|$|... 12:45:35 <b>nose-up</b> {{attitude}} is now 15° and speed is 122 knots. TOGA power is applied. Four seconds later, the aircraft begins striking the treetops.|$|E
50|$|At 02:10:34 UTC, after {{displaying}} incorrectly {{for half}} a minute, the left-side instruments recorded a sharp rise in airspeed to 223 kn, as did the Integrated Standby Instrument System (ISIS) 33 seconds later (the right-side instruments are not recorded by the recorder). The icing event had lasted for just over a minute. The pilot continued making <b>nose-up</b> inputs. The trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) moved from three to 13 degrees <b>nose-up</b> in about one minute, and remained in that latter position {{until the end of}} the flight.|$|E
50|$|Although {{this effect}} was {{unfavourable}} {{in a conventional}} straight wing aircraft, on a swept-wing design it had unexpected and dangerous results. When the tips stall on a swept wing, the center of pressure, the average lift point for the wing as a whole, moves forward. This is because the section still generating considerable lift is further forward. This causes further <b>nose-up</b> force, increasing the angle of attack and causing more of the tip area to stall. This {{may lead to a}} chain reaction that causes violent <b>nose-up</b> pitching of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} will cruise, {{maintaining the}} flap setting. Again: two reasons. It reduces the stall speed, {{but it also}} allows a slightly less <b>nose-up</b> attitude. Meaning: a cooler engine.|$|E
50|$|The crew perhaps wrongly {{perceived}} {{the nature of}} the emergency. Since the explosion of the engine caused the loss of engine thrust, the speed of the plane decreased. This rapid deceleration caused the crew to think that the plane was pitching down, which may explain why the crew made a <b>nose-up</b> input, while in reality, it didn't pitch down. This phenomenon is called as somatogravic illusion. However, instead of fixing the situation, the input that the crew made (the <b>nose-up</b> input) only caused the plane to decelerate even more. The pilot may have suffered spatial disorientation immediately after the emergency.|$|E
