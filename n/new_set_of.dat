5|$|Also in 2015, {{work began}} on {{bypassing}} the 1960s interchange with US23 near Brighton. A <b>new</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> through lanes {{was built on}} I-96 between the current eastbound and westbound lanes with three new bridges over northbound and southbound US23, and over Old US23. The existing lanes of I-96 were changed to be collector-distributor lanes for ramp traffic. This project was completed in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|An earlier {{black-and-white}} {{adaptation of}} M. R. James's Whistle and I'll Come to You, directed by Jonathan Miller and shown {{as part of}} the series Omnibus in 1968, is often cited as an influence upon the production of the films, and is sometimes included {{as part of the}} series. The series was revived by the BBC in 2005 with a <b>new</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> adaptations that were produced intermittently over the next few years.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how one can describe explicitly the present arbitrariness in solutions of relativistic wave equations in external electromagnetic fields of special form. This arbitrariness {{is connected to}} the existence of a transformation, which reduces effectively the number of variables in the initial equations. Then we use the corresponding representations to construct <b>new</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> exact solutions, which may have a physical interest. Namely, we present <b>new</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> stationary and nonstationary solutions in magnetic field and in some superpositions of electric and magnetic fields.

5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a <b>new</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective barrier between officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the result of}} Adrian, Etula, and Muir (2014) is reexamined. They propose a model with nancial {{intermediary}} leverage that is able to price a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> portfolios remarkably well. In this paper the model is estimated with di erent portfolios as test assets. This is done to account for recent critiques {{of the use of}} size and book-to-market sorted portfolios as test assets. This paper uses two <b>new</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> portfolios, industry portfolios and portfolios sorted on size and pre-formation leverage beta. The proposed model with nancial intermediaries is not able to explain the variation of cross-sectional average returns on the two <b>new</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> portfolios. nhhma...|$|R
5|$|Once the Convention had {{finished}} amending {{the first draft}} from the Committee of Detail, a <b>new</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> unresolved questions were sent to several different committees for resolution.

Two committees addressed questions related to the slave trade and the assumption of war debts.|$|E
5|$|Tropic Moon III {{involved}} a completely <b>new</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> systems, up to date, and infinitely more capable than those previously installed.

5|$|With {{modifications}} {{that were}} aimed at improving the ships endurance by including a diesel generator, it was launched as Velebit (P-01) in 1996.

In 1947, the college chaplain Leslie Cross presented a <b>new</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting that Cross had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that the oars had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed further in the 1950s, making five bumps in 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970.
