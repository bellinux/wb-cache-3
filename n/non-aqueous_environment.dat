Similarly, all these compounds markedly inhibit protein carbonyl formation, clozapine being one of the most efficient. Thus, under different in vitro experimental conditions, the neuroleptic drugs chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine and the antipsychotic substance clozapine act as very effective antioxidants; this property might, at least in part, be responsible for the physiological and clinical effects observed in vivo...|$|E

Methods: Three different mixtures of saturated polyglycolysed glycerides were extruded in a mm extruder {{at different rates}} and using different dies. The force applied to the ram and its displacement were recorded and {{used to determine the}} "specific work of extrusion" and pursuit rheometric determinations, according to the Bagley's approach. Results: As the melting range of the mixtures, or the length of the dies increased the higher the "specific work of extrusion" observed. From the rheometric analysis, viscoelastic properties were identified and decomposed into plastic and elastic components. The elastic component contributed more to the total pressure loss, and {{for the majority of the}} cases, was higher than the plastic component. From the Bagley plot it was possible to calculate the wall shear stress (sigma (omega)), that increased with the melting range of the materials and the shear rate applied (gamma) The viscosity (eta) decreased as the shear rate increased reflecting a non-Newtonian behavior of the materials. Finally, materials showing lower viscosities required less work to produce the extrudates.

Circular dichroism experiments were carried out to determine whether the inclusion of an artificial amino acid significantly perturbed the secondary structure of the model peptides, and to find out whether TFE was actually inducing the expected change to the secondary structure of the peptide as it was added to solution.

The mechanisms underlying Gibbs-Donnan equilibria are discussed, with particular emphasis as to how they arise across a selectively permeable membrane by way of a worked example. The equilibrium of forces influencing fluid movements across the capillary endothelium, known as Starling forces, is then described. Comparisons are made between the classic model as first proposed by Starling in 1896 and the modified glycocalyx model, which has developed over the past 25 years.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of intra-protein communication and allosteric coupling {{is key to}} understanding the structure-property relationship of protein function. For subtilisin Carlsberg, the Ca 2 +-binding loop is distal to substrate-binding and active sites, yet the serine protease function depends on Ca 2 + binding. The atomic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of apo and Ca 2 +-bound subtilisin show similar structures {{and there is no}} direct evidence that subtilisin has alternative conformations. To model the intra-protein communication due to Ca 2 + binding, we transform the sequential segments of an atomic MD trajectory into separate elastic network models to represent anharmonicity and nonlinearity effectively as the temporal and spatial variation of the mechanical coupling network. In analogy to the spectrogram of sound waves, this transformation is termed the ‘‘fluctuogram’ ’ of protein dynamics. We illustrate that the Ca 2 +-bound and apo states of subtilisin have different fluctuograms and that intra-protein communication proceeds intermittently both in space and in time. We found that residues with large mechanical coupling variation due to Ca 2 + binding correlate with the reported mutation sites selected by directed evolution for improving the stability of subtilisin and its activity in a <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>environment.</b> Furthermore, we utilize the fluctuograms calculated from MD to capture the highly correlated residues in a multiple sequence alignment.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Thermodynamic {{compensation}} in {{the interaction}} of quinoline antimalarials with haematin in 40 % (v/v) aqueous OMSO has been compared with that in pure aqueous solution. The data indicate {{that the degree of}} desolvation and loss of conformational freedom is identical in both systems. The nature of interactions between quinoline drugs and haematin was investigated spectroscopically in organic and mixed solvents. Free energies of association of chloroquine, quinine and quinidine with haematin are largely insensitive to the increasing concentration of NaCI 0. This demonstrates that electrostatic interactions play a minor role in the overall stability of these complexes under these conditions. Increasing concentration of OM SO weakens association of chloroquine, amodiaquine, quinine, quinidine and 9 -epiquinine with haematin. These effects suggest that the interactions are hydrophobic. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that free energy of association with haematin weakens as a function of decreasing solvent polarity in organic solvents. However, free energies of association are weaker in mixed aqueous solvents than in pure organic solvents. This indicates that dispersion and electrostatic interactions are relatively stronger in a <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>environment.</b> A new assay has been developed for measuring inhibition of,ß-haematin formation using 5 % (v/v) aqueous pyridine solution. This pyridine solution forms a low complex with haematin in aqueous solution but not with,ß-haematin. Formation of ß-haematin is brought about in 4. 5 M acetate, pH 4. 5 at 60 °C. The assay is rapid (60 min incubation) and requires no centrifugation or expensive radioactive material.

40|$|Lipases are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of the ester linkage in a triacylglycerol oil-water interface, while in <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>environments</b> they catalyze reverse reactions (esterification, transesterification and interesterification). They {{can be produced}} by a solid state fermentation (SSF) process adding value to agro-industrial residues as alkaline soapstocks {{that can be used}} as a lipid substrate for lipase production. The objective of this study was to characterize the soapstocks of canola, sunflower and corn and use these byproducts for fungal lipase production using the mutant strain 11 T 53 A 14 of Aspergillus niger. The work was carried out following 24 - 1 and 23 experimental designs in the presence and absence of inducers, respectively, aiming to evaluate the influence of some variables in the lipase production. The production by SSF was carried out in aerated columns incubated at 32 °C. Among the soapstocks evaluated, the sunflower soapstock was the best inducer for enzyme production, with 201 U/gdm (gram of dry medium) using 108 spores/gm (gram of medium) inoculated on wheat bran humidified with 80 mL of liquid (ammonium sulfate solution) that corresponds to a final concentration of 0. 5 % nitrogen, and 3 % inducer. The best lipase activity obtained without soapstock was 182 U/gdm under the same processing conditions as the experiment using soapstock. Although the results with the highest lipase activity with sunflower soapstock and without inducer are close, the Tukey test showed a significant difference of these results, which proves the importance of lipid substrate to improve the lipase activity. 201...|$|R
40|$|Transfer of a proton is {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} most elementary and yet {{one of the most}} significant reactions in chemical and biological processes and have received great attention during the last 60 years. Surprisingly, the exact mechanism of this elementary reaction is still not fully understood especially in <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>environments.</b> Photoacids, compounds that increase their acidity upon excitation, have enabled detailed time-resolved studies of the proton dissociation process. This thesis explores proton-transfer reactions in "super" photoacids and in supramolecular assemblies using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. We start by introducing a novel class "super" photoacids and explore their acid-base and spectroscopic properties in aqueous solutions. We explain the origin of the photoacidity and demonstrate how it can be influenced. Secondly, we present a combined computational and experimental study of intermolecular proton-transfer reaction in organic solvents. Our findings suggest that the proton-transfer mechanism is much more complex in the absence of water and the kinetics are heavily influenced by the solvent properties such as polarity, viscosity and proton conductivity. The second half of the thesis focuses on proton transfer in supramolecular assemblies. First, we show how proton transfer can be utilized to convert photon energy into mechanical motion. This is achieved by using molecular machines where the proton transfer induces a nanometer-sized structural rearrangement on a nanosecond time scale. Secondly, we explore intramolecular proton transfer in an organocatalyst and show how a detailed understanding of the photophysical properties can be used to gain insights into the catalytic mechanism of these catalysts...|$|R
40|$|Adipocere is a greasy, waxy {{substance}} {{produced as}} a late post-mortem change that occurs due to putrefactive and hydrolytic enzymes {{associated with the}} decomposition process. Enzymes which convert free fatty acids in adipose tissue to saturated fatty acids commonly known to comprise adipocere include myristic, palmitic, stearic and hydroxy stearic acids. Many factors can affect the decomposition process, either increasing or retarding its rate of development, but there is limited research into the effects that wrapping materials and coverings have upon decomposition and adipocere formation in a forensic setting. A {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of different types of wrapping materials on the rate and extent of adipocere formation on a porcine model. Analysis using Gas-Chromatography coupled with Mass-Spectrometry was employed to determine the chemical composition of adipocere which formed over a 14 week decomposition period. The results suggest that wrapping materials accelerate the rate of adipocere formation in <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>environments,</b> suggesting that the water content within the porcine tissue is sufficient to induce adipocere formation. The chromatograms demonstrated the hydrolysis of triglycerides in fatty tissue to unsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid and palmitoleic acid. The further hydrogenation into saturated fatty acids, comprising palmitic acid and stearic acid were present confirming adipocere formation. A knowledge of the effects of a variety of different types of wrapping materials on the rate at which adipocere forms and its composition would be a useful forensic indicator and can offer valuable information for the estimation of post-mortem intervals and peri-mortem events.
