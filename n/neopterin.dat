50|$|This study {{examined}} the clinical history of the CSF and urine of two Greek siblings who were both diagnosed with SR deficiency. Both siblings displayed delayed psychomotor development and a movement disorder. The diagnosis was confirmed by measuring the SR enzyme activity and mutation analysis. The mutation analysis of the gene was performed using genomic DNA isolated from blood samples. The results concluded that both patients have low concentrations of HVA and HIAA and high concentrations of sepiapterin in the CSF, but <b>neopterin</b> and biopterin were abnormal in only one sibling. The results of this research indicates that when diagnosing the SR deficiency, the quantification of sepiapterin in the CSF is more important and indicative of SR deficiency than using <b>neopterin</b> and biopterin alone. The results also show that the urine concentrations of neurotransmitter metabolites are abnormal in patients with this disorder.

50|$|In 1988, Pierre Lebon and {{his colleagues}} {{identified}} the additional feature of raised levels of interferon-alpha in patient CSF {{in the absence of}} infection.

An {{increase in}} the number of white cells (particularly lymphocytes) in the CSF, and high levels of interferon-alpha activity and <b>neopterin</b> in the CSF are important clues - however, these features are not always present. More recently, a persistent elevation of mRNA levels of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts have been recorded in the peripheral blood of almost all cases of AGS with mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1 and IFIH1, and in 75% of patients with mutations in RNASEH2B.

40|$|Summary: Serum and urinary <b>neopterin</b> {{concentrations}} were measured in 142 patients suffering from various inalignant diseases. Increased {{serum and urinary}} <b>neopterin</b> levels were found in 48 % and 55 % of patients respectively. <b>Neopterin</b> showed sufficient sensitivity in the detection of haematological disorders and hy-pernephroma, whereas the sensitivity of <b>neopterin</b> was rather poor in patients with other solid tumours. Comparison of serum-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) concentrations and serum or urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels in testicular cancer patients showed that determination of <b>neopterin</b> provides no further Information in the managemerit of these patients. In testicular cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, {{a significant increase in}} serum (p < 0. 005) and urinary (p < 0. 0005) <b>neopterin</b> concentrations was measured after chemotherapy, reflecting the release of <b>neopterin</b> from macrpphages during the damage by cytotoxic drugs. In the adjuvant testicular tumour patients, known to be tumour free, l out of 16 patients showed elevated serum and 3 out of 15 patients showed false positive urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels. False positive serum (24 %) and urinary (37 %) <b>neopterin</b> values were also obtained in 28 patients with various nonmalignant diseases, but no evidence for an inflammatory process.

Quantification of <b>neopterin</b> in body fluids has been achieved by standard high-performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. <b>Neopterin</b> levels predict HIV-related mortality more efficiently than clinical manifestations. Successful {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} is associated with a decrease in <b>neopterin</b> levels. Elevated <b>neopterin</b> levels were associated with hepatitis by hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Serum <b>neopterin</b> levels were found to be a predictor of response to treatment of chronic HCV infection with pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. <b>Neopterin</b> levels of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were found to be higher in patients with more extensive radiological changes. Elimination of blood donors with elevated <b>neopterin</b> levels to reduce risk of transmission of infections with known and unknown viral pathogens has been undertaken. <b>Neopterin</b> measurement is hereby more cost effective but less sensitive than screening using polymerase chain reaction based assays.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{high level}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) <b>neopterin</b> is a marker of central nervous system inflammatory-immune mediated processes. We aimed to assess data from 606 neuropediatric patients, describing the clinical and biochemical features of those neurological disorders presenting CSF <b>neopterin</b> values above a new cut-off value that was defined in our laboratory. METHODS: To establish the new CSF <b>neopterin</b> cut-off value, we studied two groups of patients: Group 1 comprised 68 patients with meningoencephalitis, and Group 2 comprised 52 children with a confirmed peripheral infection and no central nervous system involvement. We studied 606 CSF samples from neuropediatric patients who were classified into 3 groups: genetic diagnosis (A), acquired/unknown etiologic neurologic diseases (B) and inflammatory-immune mediated processes (C). RESULTS: The CSF <b>neopterin</b> cut-off value was 61 nmol/L. Out of 606 cases, 56 presented a CSF <b>neopterin</b> level above this value. Group C had significantly higher CSF <b>neopterin,</b> protein and leukocyte values than the other groups. Sixteen of twenty-three patients in this group had a CSF <b>neopterin</b> level above the cut-off, whereas three and seven patients presented increased leukocyte and protein values, respectively. A significant association was found among CSF <b>neopterin,</b> proteins and leukocytes in the 606 patients. White matter disturbances were associated with high CSF <b>neopterin</b> concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Although children with inflammatory-immune mediated processes presented higher CSF <b>neopterin</b> values, patients with other neurological disorders also showed increased CSF <b>neopterin</b> concentrations.

40|$|Background The {{inflammatory}} cell product <b>neopterin</b> is elevated in serum {{before and during}} delirium. This suggests a role for disordered cell-mediated immunity or oxidative stress. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>neopterin</b> levels reflect brain <b>neopterin</b> levels more closely than serum levels. Here we hypothesized that CSF <b>neopterin</b> levels would be higher in delirium. Methods In this prospective cohort study, 139 elderly patients with acute hip fracture were recruited in Oslo and Edinburgh. Delirium was diagnosed with the confusion assessment method performed daily pre-operatively and on the first 5  days post-operatively. Paired CSF and blood samples were collected {{at the onset of}} spinal anaesthesia. <b>Neopterin</b> levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results Sixty-four (46  %) of 139 hip fracture patients developed delirium perioperatively. CSF <b>neopterin</b> levels were higher in delirium compared to controls (median 29. 6 vs 24. 7  nmol/mL, p[*]=[*] 0. 003), with highest levels in patients who developed delirium post-operatively. Serum <b>neopterin</b> levels were also higher in delirium (median 37. 0 vs 27. 1  nmol/mL, p[*]=[*] 0. 003). CSF <b>neopterin</b> remained significantly associated with delirium after controlling for relevant risk factors. Higher <b>neopterin</b> levels were associated with poorer outcomes (death or new institutionalization) 1  year after surgery (p[*]=[*] 0. 02 for CSF and p[*]=[*] 0. 03 for serum). Conclusions This study is the first to examine <b>neopterin</b> in CSF from patients with delirium. Our findings suggest potential roles for activation of cell-mediated immune responses or oxidative stress in the delirium process. High levels of serum or CSF <b>neopterin</b> in hip fracture patients may also be useful in predicting poor outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Determining {{individual}} {{health status}} {{is of great}} importance for {{a better understanding of}} life history trade-offs between growth, reproduction, and maintenance. However, existing immunological methods are invasive and therefore not suitable for investigating health status in wild populations. Thus, there is an urgent need for non-invasive methods to assess the immune status of animals. <b>Neopterin</b> is involved in the cell-mediated pathway of the immune response (Th 1 –type), secreted during the activation of monocytes and macrophages. We investigated if urinary <b>neopterin</b> could serve as a biomarker of health status in bonobos and chimpanzees. First, we performed a chemical validation of a commercial <b>neopterin</b> enzyme immune assay (EIA) for bonobo and chimpanzee urine. We then examined if urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels in bonobos increase during the acute period of respiratory infections. We found that <b>neopterin</b> levels can be reliably measured in urine of the two species with a commercial EIA. Stability experiments revealed considerable changes in urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels in relation to multiple freeze–thaw cycles and extended exposure to room temperature. Exposure to sunlight led to a degradation of urinary <b>neopterin,</b> whereas sample storage up to 2 years did not affect urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels. There was no detectable diurnal variation in <b>neopterin</b> levels, and levels remained very stable across several days in healthy individuals. While urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels were independent of sex, non-adult individuals had higher urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels than adults.

In this paper, it is shown that other known stimuli of monocytes (e. g., to secrete proteases or to migrate) such as zymosan-activated human serum, lipopolysaccharide, human C 3 /iC 3 and zymosan coated with complement were unable to trigger monocytes/macrophages to release <b>neopterin.</b> Monocytes/macrophages could be stimulated solely by IFN-gamma (25 U/ml) and IFN-alpha at very high concentrations (10, 000 U/ml). In the case of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), basically the same pattern was observed. If however, in the buffer controls PBMNC showed some <b>neopterin</b> release, all stimuli triggered an increase of <b>neopterin</b> secretion: 10, 000 U/ml IFN-alpha induced the same amount of secreted <b>neopterin</b> as did 25 U/ml of IFN-gamma.

A group of 50 patients with active juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) (who routinely have <b>neopterin</b> levels assessed) served as controls for the assessment of the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of <b>neopterin</b> as a diagnostic test for HLH. The Pearson correlation was used to measure the association between serum <b>neopterin</b> levels and established HLH-related laboratory data. Serum <b>neopterin</b> levels were measured using a competitive enzyme immunoassay. During the time frame of the study, 3 patients with familial HLH and 18 patients with secondary HLH were identified as having had serum <b>neopterin</b> measured (all HLH patients were grouped together). The mean <b>neopterin</b> levels were 84. 9 nmol/liter (standard deviation [SD], 83. 4 nmol/liter) for patients with HLH and 21. 5 nmol/liter (SD, 10. 13 nmol/liter) for patients with JDM. A cutoff value of 38. 9 nmol/liter was 70 % sensitive and 95 % specific for HLH. For HLH patients, <b>neopterin</b> levels correlated significantly with ferritin levels (r = 0. 76, P = 0. 0007). In comparison to the level in a control group of JDM patients, elevated serum <b>neopterin</b> was a sensitive and specific marker for HLH. Serum <b>neopterin</b> has value as a diagnostic marker of HLH, and prospective studies are under way to further evaluate its role as a marker for early diagnosis and management of patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Neopterin</b> is a pyrazino-pyrimidine compound, and {{is known}} to be a marker {{associated}} with cell-mediated immunity in various diseases. We hypothesized that the levels of serum and urine <b>neopterin</b> would be elevated in renal disease, and would correlate with certain clinical parameters. We evaluated serum and urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels in patients with several renal diseases, including nephrotic syndrome (NS, n= 19), chronic renal failure (CRF, n= 8), end stage renal disease (ESRD, n= 64) and controls (n= 22). Serum <b>neopterin</b> was elevated in patients with CRF and ESRD, as compared to controls. Urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels were also found to be elevated in patients with CRF and ESRD, as compared to controls. Serum <b>neopterin</b> levels showed significant positive correlation with age, serum BUN and creatinine levels, and inverse correlation with WBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum albumin and total iron binding capacity. Urine <b>neopterin</b> levels exhibited positive correlation with age and serum creatinine levels, and inverse correlation with WBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, BUN and serum albumin. In conclusion, increased serum and urinary <b>neopterin</b> levels were found in some patients with renal disease and were correlated with certain clinical parameters...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that <b>neopterin</b> is synthesized in vitro by human monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells upon stimulation with gamma interferon (IFN-γ). <b>Neopterin</b> production under specific conditions in vitro has also been obtained upon stimulation with IFN-α and/or IFN-β. However, it is unknown if any IFN-γ-independent <b>neopterin</b> synthesis is possible in vivo. In the present study we investigated the serum <b>neopterin</b> concentrations in patients affected by the syndrome of Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD). Indeed, this syndrome is characterized by deeply impaired or absent IFN-γ production or function due to severe mutations in molecules involved in IFN-γ/interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) /IL- 23 -dependent pathway. Serum <b>neopterin</b> levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 27 patients with MSMD. We found that serum <b>neopterin</b> levels are elevated in the complete absence of IFN-γ activity due either to a complete deficiency of its receptor or to deleterious mutations of IL- 12 or its receptor. These data clearly indicate that, as reported from in vitro studies, other stimuli are able to induce <b>neopterin</b> synthesis in vivo. Consequently, <b>neopterin</b> cannot be used as means of diagnosis of MSMD due to IFN-γ-, IL- 12 -, and IL- 23 -dependent pathway defects...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether urinary <b>neopterin</b> concentrations {{respond to}} the pathological conditions (especially coro-nary artery dilatation) of Kawasaki syndrome. All of 29 children with Kawasaki syndrome had very high unnary <b>neopterin</b> concentrations. Increased urinary <b>neopterin</b> concentrations coincided with fever and with monocytosis in peripheral blood. The urinary <b>neopterin</b> excretion peak-ing within the first 8 days after onset correlated {{with the development of}} coronary artery dilatation. Increased un-nary <b>neopterin</b> concentrations indicate that cell-mediated immunity is activated in patients with Kawasaki syndrome. Endogenous interferon- # and activation of monocytes/ macrophages {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of Kawasaki syndrome. Not only do neoptenn concentra-tions correlate with symptoms in the acute phase o...|$|E
