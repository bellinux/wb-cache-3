One of the possible approaches is compensating losses by the amplifying centers embedded into a NIM host material to provide amplification due to population inversion [1]. An alternative approach based on optical parametric amplification in NIMs has been proposed in [2], where the precondition is the non-symmetric current-voltage characteristics of NIM’s structural elements that give rise to its quadratic nonlinearity.

In this thesis, we characterized the <b>negative-index</b> <b>metamaterials</b> that {{is composed of}} periodic arrangements of split-ring resonators (providing negative permeability) and thin wire (providing negative permittivity) arrays. The resonances of split-ring resonators (SRR) are investigated experimentally and theoretically. By combining SRR and wire arrays together, we observed a transmission band where both permittivity and permeability are simultaneously negative, indicating a left-handed behavior. Reflection measurements reveal that the impedance is matched to the free space at a certain frequency range. The lefthanded metamaterial is also shown to exhibit negative refractive index by using three different experimental methods namely, refraction from a wedge-shaped <b>negative-index</b> <b>metamaterial</b> (<b>NIM),</b> beam-shift from a slab-shaped NIM and phase shift from NIMs with different lengths. Flat-lens behavior is observed from a slabshaped <b>negative-index</b> <b>metamaterial</b> based microwave lenses. Furthermore, we demonstrated subwavelength imaging and subwavelength resolution by using thin superlenses constructed from SRR-wire arrays with an effective negative index. We {{have been able to}} image a point source with a record-level, λ/ 8 resolution. SRRand wire arrays exhibit negative index provided that the wave propagates parallel to the plane of SRR structure which makes it hard to fabricate at higher frequencies. An alternative structure called fishnet metamaterial however could yield negative index with wave propagation normal to the structure. We observed left-handed transmission and negative phase velocity in fishnet type metamaterials.

Particularly, in this dissertation, the versatility of CS and CMS NWs {{for the design of}} <b>negative-index</b> <b>metamaterials</b> in the visible range and, plasmonic light harvesting in ultrathin photocatalyst layers for water splitting are studied. ^ Utilizing the LSPR in the metal layer and the magnetic dipole resonance in the semiconductor shell under traverse electric (TE) polarization, semiconductor-metal-semiconductor CMS NWs can be designed to exhibit spectrally overlapping electric and magnetic resonances in the visible range. NWs exhibiting such double resonances can be considered as meta-atoms and arrayed to form polarization dependant, low-loss NIM. ^ Alternatively, by tuning the LSPR in the TE polarization and the optical resonance in the transverse magnetic (TM) polarization of metal-photocatalyst CS and semiconductor-metal-photocatalyst CMS NWs, the absorption within ultrathin (sub- 50 nm) photocatalyst layers can be substantially enhanced. Notably, aluminum and copper based NWs provide absorption enhancement remarkably close to silver and gold based NWs respectively. Further, such absorption is polarization independent and remains high over a large range of incidence angles and permittivity of the medium. ^ Due to the tunability of their optical properties, CS and CMS NWs, are expected to be vital components for the design of nanophotonic devices. An outlook has been presented highlighting some of the potential applications of such nanowires beyond negetive-index metamaterials and extreme absorption. ...|$|R

Such thin structures are analogous to a monolayer of atoms, making it difficult to assign bulk properties such as the index of refraction. Negative refraction of surface plasmons was recently demonstrated but was confined to a two-dimensional waveguide 9. Three-dimensional (3 D) optical metamaterials have come into focus recently, including the realization of negative refraction by using layered semiconductor metamaterials and a 3 D magnetic metamaterial in the infrared frequencies; however, neither of these had a negative index of refraction 10, 11.

Moreover, it can readily be probed from free space, making it functional for optical devices. We construct a prism made of this optical NIM to demonstrate negative refractive index at optical frequencies, resulting unambiguously from the negative phase evolution of the wave propagating inside the metamaterial.

40|$|Artificially {{structured}} composite metamaterials {{consist of}} sub-wavelength sized structures that exhibit unusual electromagnetic properties {{not found in}} nature. Since the first experimental verification in 2000, metamaterials have drawn considerable attention because of their broad range of potential applications. One of the most attractive features of metamaterials is to obtain negative refraction, termed left-handed materials or <b>negative-index</b> <b>metamaterials,</b> over a limited frequency band. <b>Negative-index</b> <b>metamaterials</b> at near infrared wavelength are fabricated with circular, elliptical and rectangular holes penetrating through metal/dielectric/metal films. All three <b>negative-index</b> <b>metamaterial</b> structures exhibit similar figure of merit; however, the transmission is higher for the <b>negative-index</b> <b>metamaterial</b> with rectangular holes {{as a result of}} an improved impedance match with the substrate-superstrate (air-glass) combination. In general, the processing procedure to fabricate the fishnet structured <b>negative-index</b> <b>metamaterials</b> is to define the hole-size using a polymetric material, usually by lithographically defining polymer posts, followed by deposition of the constitutive materials and dissolution of the polymer (liftoff processing). This processing (fabrication of posts: multi-layer deposition: liftoff) often gives rise to significant sidewall-angle because materials accumulate on the tops of the posts that define the structure, each successive film deposition has a somewhat larger aperture on the bottom metamaterial film, giving rise to a nonzero sidewall-angle and to optical bianisotropy. Finally, we demonstrate a nanometer-scale, sub-picosecond metamaterial device capable of over terabit/second all-optical communication in the near infrared spectrum. We achieve a 600 fs device response by utilizing a regime of sub-picosecond carrier dynamics in amorphous silicon and ~ 70 % modulation in a path length of only 124 nm by exploiting the strong nonlinearities in metamaterials. We identify a characteristic signature associated with the negative index resonance in the pump-probe signal of a fishnet structure. We achieve much higher switching ratios at the fundamental resonance (~ 70 %) relative to the secondary resonance (~ 20 %) corresponding to the stronger negative index at the fundamental resonance.
