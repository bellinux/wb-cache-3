40|$|Researchers often impute {{continuous}} variables under an assumption of normality, yet many incomplete variables are skewed. We find that imputing skewed {{continuous variables}} under a normal model {{can lead to}} bias; the bias is usually mild for popular estimands such as means, standard deviations, and linear regression coefficients, but the bias can be severe for more shape-dependent estimands such as percentiles or the coefficient of skewness. We test several methods for adapting a <b>normal</b> <b>imputation</b> model to accommodate skewness, including methods that transform, truncate, or censor (round) normally imputed values, as well as methods that impute values from a quadratic or truncated regression. None of these modifications reliably reduces the biases of the normal model, and some modifications can make the biases much worse. We conclude that, if one has to impute a skewed variable under a normal model, it is usually safest {{to do so without}} modifications [...] unless you are more interested in estimating percentiles and shape that in estimated means, variance, and regressions. In the conclusion, we briefly discuss promising developments in the area of continuous imputation models that do not assume normality. Comment: 38 pages, 6 figures, 2 Tables + 2 Appendix Table...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{imputation}} {{has entered}} mainstream {{practice for the}} analysis of incomplete data. We have used it exten-sively in a large Australian longitudinal cohort study, the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study (1992 â€“ 2008). Although we have endeavored to follow best practices, there is little published advice on this, and we have not pre-viously examined the extent to which variations in our approach might lead to different results. Here, we examined sensitivity of analytical results to imputation decisions, investigating choice of imputation method, inclusion of aux-iliary variables, omission of cases with excessive missing data, and approaches for imputing highly skewed contin-uous distributions that are analyzed as dichotomous variables. Overall, we found that decisions made about imputation approach had a discernible but rarely dramatic impact for some types of estimates. For model-based estimates of association, the choice of imputation method and decisions made to build the imputation model had little effect on results, whereas estimates of overall prevalence and prevalence stratified by subgroup were more sensitive to imputation method and settings. Multiple imputation by chained equations gave more plausible results than multivariate <b>normal</b> <b>imputation</b> for prevalence estimates but appeared to be more susceptible to numerical instability related to a highly skewed variable. longitudinal cohort study; missing data; multiple imputation; sensitivity analysis Abbreviations: AC, available case; CC, complete case; CCA, complete case adult data with partial adolescent data; MICE, multiple imputation by chained equations; MVNI, multivariate normal imputation; PMM, predictive mean matching; VAHCS, Victoria...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Missing data is {{a common}} problem in {{epidemiological}} studies, and is particularly prominent in longitudinal data, which involve multiple waves of data collection. Traditional multiple imputation (MI) methods (fully conditional specification (FCS) and multivariate <b>normal</b> <b>imputation</b> (MVNI)) treat repeated measurements of the same time-dependent variable as just another â€˜distinctâ€™ variable for imputation and therefore do not {{make the most of}} the longitudinal structure of the data. Only a few studies have explored extensions to the standard approaches to account for the temporal structure of longitudinal data. One suggestion is the two-fold fully conditional specification (two-fold FCS) algorithm, which restricts the imputation of a time-dependent variable to time blocks where the imputation model includes measurements taken at the specified and adjacent times. To date, no study has investigated the performance of two-fold FCS and standard MI methods for handling missing data in a time-varying covariate with a non-linear trajectory over time â€“ a commonly encountered scenario in epidemiological studies. Methods We simulated 1000 datasets of 5000 individuals based on the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Three missing data mechanisms: missing completely at random (MCAR), and a weak and a strong missing at random (MAR) scenarios were used to impose missingness on body mass index (BMI) for age z-scores; a continuous time-varying exposure variable with a non-linear trajectory over time. We evaluated the performance of FCS, MVNI, and two-fold FCS for handling up to 50 % of missing data when assessing the association between childhood obesity and sleep problems. Results The standard two-fold FCS produced slightly more biased and less precise estimates than FCS and MVNI. We observed slight improvements in bias and precision when using a time window width of two for the two-fold FCS algorithm compared to the standard width of one. Conclusion We recommend the use of FCS or MVNI in a similar longitudinal setting, and when encountering convergence issues due to a large number of time points or variables with missing values, the two-fold FCS with exploration of a suitable time window...|$|E

Patients meeting APACHE II inclusion criteria admitted to 18 ICUs in Sri Lanka over three consecutive months had data necessary for the calculation of APACHE II, probabilities prospectively extracted from case notes. APACHE II physiology score (APS), probabilities, Standardised (ICU) Mortality Ratio (SMR), discrimination (AUROC), and calibration (C-statistic) were calculated, both by imputing missing measurements with normal values and by Multiple Imputation using Chained Equations (MICE). From a total of 995 patients admitted during the study period, 736 had APACHE II probabilities calculated. Data availability for APS calculation ranged from 70. 6 % to 88. 4 % for bedside observations and 18. 7 % to 63. 4 % for invasive measurements. SMR (95 % CI) was 1. 27 (1. 17, 1. 40) and 0. 46 (0. 44, 0. 49), AUROC (95 % CI) was 0. 70 (0. 65, 0. 76) and 0. 74 (0. 68, 0. 80), and C-statistic was 68. 8 and 156. 6 for <b>normal</b> value <b>imputation</b> and MICE, respectively.

40|$|Imputation for factor {{analysis}} 2 Imputation methods are popular for {{the handling of}} missing data in psychology. The methods generally consist of predicting missing data based on observed data, yielding a complete dataset that is amiable to standard statistical analyses. In the context of Bayesian {{factor analysis}}, this paper compares imputation under an unrestricted multivariate <b>normal</b> model (Multiple <b>Imputation)</b> to imputation under the statistical model of interest (Data Augmentation). The former method is popular in applied research, but the latter method is more straightforward from a Bayesian perspective. Simulations demonstrate that Data Augmentation yields less-biased parameter estimates for moderate sample sizes and high missingness proportions. Multiple Imputation, on the other hand, yields less-biased parameter estimates for large sample sizes with misspecified models. The incorporation of auxiliary variables in Data Augmentation is also addressed, and BUGS code is provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{imputation}} {{is becoming}} increasingly popular for handling missing data. However, it is often implemented without adequate consideration of whether it offers any advantage over complete case analysis for the research question of interest, or whether potential gains may be offset by bias from a poorly fitting imputation model, particularly {{as the amount of}} missing data increases. Methods Simulated datasets (n[*]=[*] 1000) drawn from a synthetic population were used to explore information recovery from multiple imputation in estimating the coefficient of a binary exposure variable when various proportions of data (10 - 90 %) were set missing at random in a highly-skewed continuous covariate or in the binary exposure. Imputation was performed using multivariate <b>normal</b> <b>imputation</b> (MVNI), with a simple or zero-skewness log transformation to manage non-normality. Bias, precision, mean-squared error and coverage for a set of regression parameter estimates were compared between multiple imputation and complete case analyses. Results For missingness in the continuous covariate, multiple imputation produced less bias and greater precision for the effect of the binary exposure variable, compared with complete case analysis, with larger gains in precision with more missing data. However, even with only moderate missingness, large bias and substantial under-coverage were apparent in estimating the continuous covariateâ€™s effect when skewness was not adequately addressed. For missingness in the binary covariate, all estimates had negligible bias but gains in precision from multiple imputation were minimal, particularly for the coefficient of the binary exposure. Conclusions Although multiple imputation can be useful if covariates required for confounding adjustment are missing, benefits are likely to be minimal when data are missing in the exposure variable of interest. Furthermore, when there are large amounts of missingness, multiple imputation can become unreliable and introduce bias not present in a complete case analysis if the imputation model is not appropriate. Epidemiologists dealing with missing data should keep in mind the potential limitations as well as the potential benefits of multiple imputation. Further work is needed to provide clearer guidelines on effective application of this method. </p...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDMissing {{data are}} common in survey data sets. Enrolled {{subjects}} do not often have data recorded for all variables of interest. The inappropriate handling of missing data may lead to bias in the estimates and incorrect inferences. Therefore, special attention is needed when analysing incomplete data. The multivariate <b>normal</b> <b>imputation</b> (MVNI) and the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) have emerged as the best techniques to impute or fills in missing data. The former assumes a normal distribution of the variables in the imputation model, but can also handle missing data whose distributions are not normal. The latter fills in missing values {{taking into account the}} distributional form of the variables to be imputed. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the performance of these methods when data are missing at random (MAR) or completely at random (MCAR) on unordered or nominal categorical variables treated as predictors or response variables in the regression models. Both dichotomous and polytomous variables were considered in the analysis. The baseline data used was the 2007 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The analysis model of interest was the logistic regression model of the womanâ€™s contraceptive method use status on her marital status, controlling or not for other covariates (continuous, nominal and ordinal). Based on the data set with missing values, data sets with missing at random and missing completely at random observations on either the covariates or response variables measured on nominal scale were first simulated, and then used for imputation purposes. Under MVNI method, unordered categorical variables were first dichotomised, and then K âˆ’ 1 (where K is the number of levels of the categorical variable of interest) dichotomised variables were included in the imputation model, leaving the other category as a reference. These variables were imputed as continuous variables using a linear regression model. Imputation with MICE considered the distributional form of each variable to be imputed. That is, imputations were drawn using binary and multinomial logistic regressions for dichotomous and polytomous variables respectively. The performance of these methods was evaluated in terms of bias and standard errors in regression coefficients that were estimated to determine the association between the womanâ€™s contraceptive methods use status and her marital status, controlling or not for other types of variables. The analysis was done assuming that the sample was not weighted fi then the sample weight was taken into account to assess whether the sample design would affect the performance of the multiple imputation methods of interest, namely MVNI and MICE. As expected, the results showed that for all the models, MVNI and MICE produced less biased smaller standard errors than the case deletion (CD) method, which discards items with missing values from the analysis. Moreover, it was found that when data were missing (MCAR or MAR) on the nominal variables that were treated as predictors in the regression model, MVNI reduced bias in the regression coefficients and standard errors compared to MICE, for both unweighted and weighted data sets. On the other hand, the results indicated that MICE outperforms MVNI when data were missing on the response variables, either the binary or polytomous. Furthermore, it was noted that the sample design (sample weights), the rates of missingness and the missing data mechanisms (MCAR or MAR) did not affect the behaviour of the multiple imputation methods that were considered in this study. Thus, based on these results, it can be concluded that when missing values are present on the outcome variables measured on a nominal scale in regression models, the distributional form of the variable with missing values should be taken into account. When these variables are used as predictors (with missing observations), the parametric imputation approach (MVNI) would be a better option than MICE...|$|E
