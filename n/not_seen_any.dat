5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked why}} she did not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said she had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her {{of the importance of}} his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|P Associates {{received}} {{final approval}} from the city zoning board and the historical commission in August 1999, but continued to seek more financing, which {{it was able to}} secure from Corus Bank of Chicago in September 2001. To develop the tower, now called The St. James, P Associates formed the St. James Associates Joint Venture with Clark Realty Capital LLC and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments, which represented an undisclosed client. With financial backing from its partners and tax breaks for new residential construction passed in 2000, construction began on November 28, 2001. BACE Construction (Philadelphia based) was awarded the construction of the project. Philadelphia had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> residential high-rise development since the 1980s, and The St. James {{was one of the first}} to begin construction in the city, preceded only by the 16-story Residences at the Dockside, which broke ground in 2000. It became the largest residential building in the city.|$|E

5|$|In Britain, Seymour's {{victory was}} rewarded: Seymour himself was {{presented}} with a commemorative medal, £100 (with £625 to share among the wounded) and the freedoms of Cork and Limerick, although there were suggestions that he should receive a knighthood. In addition, first lieutenant Goddard Blennerhasset was promoted to commander, the junior officers were advanced and Thétis was purchased by the Royal Navy as HMS Brune, the crews of Emerald and Amethyst profiting from the prize money. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. Amethyst had been severely damaged in the engagement and repairs took 71 days to complete at Plymouth. Five months later, Seymour and Maitland were specially selected to hunt the Niémen, en route to Île de France, in the Bay of Biscay. Again, Emerald was absent when the frigate was brought to action and again Seymour was able to capture his opponent after a fierce encounter in the Action of 6 April 1809. Although Seymour praised the bravery of Thétis surviving French officer, Lieutenant Joseph Dedé, Dedé later swore in court that Thétis had not surrendered until after Triumph and Shannon arrived, a statement that contradicts not only British testimony, but also Dedé's own insistence {{on the night of}} the battle that he had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> other ships during the action. Historian William James suggests that this was a deliberate attempt to appeal to the French naval authorities to avoid responsibility for the defeat.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Martin Stucki, a {{mechanical}} engineer and commercial helicopter pilot, initiated design work on what would eventually become {{the basis for the}} SKYe SH09. Frustrated by legacy designs and typically unsuited cockpits, Stucki had observed that the light single-engine helicopter market had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> all-new designs developed in decades, and conducted market research that indicated a viable demand for a new rotorcraft in the 2.5-tonne class. Accordingly, in 2007, Stucki formed Marenco Swisshelicopter (the name Marenco was derived from Martin Engineering and Consulting) to carry out the development of the envisioned rotorcraft.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{original}} specifications have changed over the time as well, the 900m² lounge was expanded to 1,100m² and nine additional private boxes were added to {{the original}} 18. Even the capacity has changed, as it was discovered during the installation of the seatscoloured light green and grey, a somewhat controversial decision given the colours of the three clubs that will be playing on the stadiumthat more than planned could be fitted, which would allow room for another 1,000 seated spectators and thus extending the capacity to 18,800. The construction work has <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> major complications and the stadium was planned to be completed by 30 November 2008.|$|E
25|$|Up to now, the 33rd had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> {{significant}} action, {{but this}} was about to change. Emboldened by recent successes achieved by Confederate raiders under Colonel John Hunt Morgan and seeking to divert Federal attention from the strategically important towns of Chattanooga and Vicksburg, Mississippi, General Bragg decided to invade Kentucky, a slave state that had remained loyal to the Unionbut which still contained a large pro-Confederate minority. Pursuing Federal troops rounded up many stragglers, but refrained from attacking the main Confederate force at first. Bragg's army reached the fortified town of Munfordville, on the Green River, on September 14. Despite the huge advantage in numbers possessed by the Southerners, the Federal commander, Colonel John T. Wilder, refused the initial demand for surrender. Confederate forces attacked his works and were repulsed, settling in for a two-day siege before the Federal commander was finally persuaded to give up after being taken on a personal tour of the Confederate siege lines by General Buckner.|$|E

25|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing opened on December 11, 2006, with Reiser being represented by attorney William Du Bois. At the hearing, a forensic technician testified that blood matching Nina Reiser's DNA {{had been found}} on a bag in Hans Reiser's car, and on a pillar in his mother's (Beverly Palmer's) house, {{where he had been}} living since the separation. It later emerged that a mistake had been made when the police analysed the blood on the pillar, rendering the evidence inconclusive. Police also testified that they had found a 40-piece socket set which may have been used to remove the passenger seat, a receipt for the purchase of the socket set from Kragen Auto Parts, four seat bolts, and a ratchet wrench with a socket on it, suggesting that the seat may have been removed recently. A traffic officer who had pulled Reiser over nine days after Reiser's wife went missing testified later in the trial that the passenger seat had been present at the time, and that he had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> blood.|$|E
25|$|The rumours caused {{confusion}} {{and as a}} result Plymouth and the surrounding area were put on alert. Sir Ferdinand Gorges the Governor of the Fort at Plymouth put a 500-man guard on the town and a pinnace was sent out to feedback sightings of the Spanish fleet. Gorges was fed reports of the landings in Cornwall and Wales and sightings of Spanish ships and immediately sent the information to parliament and the Queen in London in the quickest possible time. An excited panic set in motion across much of England and Wales. Troops were being recalled from Amiens in France (it had recently been captured by the Anglo-French force the previous month) and for the mobilization of troops in the West Country. Charles Blount, the 8th Baron Mountjoy was put in command of the English land forces while the few galleons from Chatham were sent to the Cornish and Devon coasts. Although dispersed by a storm they reached Falmouth a few days later, but on arrival had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> Spanish ships.|$|E
25|$|The only Spanish ship in {{the area}} left from the Armada; the 120 ton Bear of Amsterdam had <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> of her fellow cohorts. Poor {{navigation}} meant that she had missed Milford Haven and landed as far North at Aberdyfi via the Dyfi Estuary on October 26. They landed men ashore but were ambushed by the Merionethshire Militia losing two killed and four captured and retreated back to their ship. The Bear was unable to leave for ten days {{because of a lack}} of wind but at the same time could not be boarded by the militia as there was no suitable boats. An attempt to burn the ship was thwarted by the wind and the Bear of Amsterdam eventually left. She was driven around the Cornish peninsula & swept up the channel by an easterly gale suffering some damage. Hoping to see the Spanish already at Falmouth, the ship was captured not far off from there on November 10 by a waiting English squadron. She was led into Dartmouth with 70 Spaniards taken prisoner, and this being the last ship from the Armada to be captured.|$|E

25|$|On 7 March 1740, in a {{more direct}} approach, Vernon {{undertook}} a reconnaissance-in-force of the Spanish city. Vernon left Port Royal in command of a squadron including ships of the line, two fire ships, three bomb vessels, and transport ships. Reaching Cartagena on 13 March, Vernon immediately landed several men to map the topography and to reconnoitre the Spanish squadron anchored in Playa Grande, west of Cartagena. Having <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> <b>any</b> reaction from the Spanish, on 18 March Vernon ordered the three bomb vessels to open fire on the city. Vernon intended to provoke a response that might give him {{a better idea of}} the defensive capabilities of the Spanish. Understanding Vernon's motives, Lezo did not immediately respond. Instead, Lezo ordered the removal of guns from some of his ships, in order to form a temporary shore battery for the purpose of suppressive fire. Vernon next initiated an amphibious assault, but in the face of strong resistance, the attempt to land 400 soldiers was unsuccessful. The British then undertook a three-day naval bombardment of the city. In total, the campaign lasted 21 days. Vernon then withdrew his forces, leaving HMS Windsor Castle and HMS Greenwich in the vicinity, with a mission to intercept any Spanish ship that might approach.|$|E
