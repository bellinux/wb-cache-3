5|$|Like John of Tynemouth, {{a number}} of the glosses on a late-twelfth-century copy of Gratian's Decretum are {{ascribed}} to Simon. These take the form of <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> his lectures that were later added to the margins of copies of the Decretum. This combined work is now at Gonville and Caius College at Cambridge University, catalogued as manuscript (MS) 283/676. Another set of student <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> his lectures, this time entitled Quaestiones, survives as part of British Library MS Royal E.VII. This work includes lecture notes not only from Simon's classes, but from John and Nicholas' as well.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated {{due to a lack of}} capital and the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that creditors who would accept payment in <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> the Bank of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> either.|$|E

5|$|A certain {{detail that}} comes up in the novel is whether we are limited to certain realities, such as 2+2=4, a theme that also comes up in Yevgeny Zamyatin's We and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.

5|$|Some of John's writings, {{dealing with}} canon law, still survive. They show {{him to have}} been steeped in canon law and quite knowledgeable. In his writings, he often cited earlier canonists or theologians as well as {{contemporary}} writers. A number of the glosses on a late-twelfth-century copy of Gratian's Decretum are ascribed to John. These {{take the form of}} <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> his lectures that were later added to the margins of copies of the Decretum.

5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was memorialized {{on several}} postage stamps. The {{first was a}} 13-cent stamp issued on November 18, 1902, with the {{engraved}} likeness of Harrison modeled after a photo provided by his widow. In all Harrison has been honored on six U.S. Postage stamps, more than most other U.S. Presidents. Harrison also was featured on the five-dollar National Bank <b>Notes</b> <b>from</b> the third charter period, beginning in 1902. In 2012, a dollar coin with his image, part of the Presidential $1 Coin Program, was issued.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the band}} {{released}} its Island Records debut, The Artist in the Ambulance. The album's title is {{in reference to}} Burn Collector by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band's desire {{to do more than}} make music and contribute to society through their charitable donations. A portion of the album's proceeds were this time donated to the Syrentha Savio Endowment, a financial aid organization for breast cancer patients. First pressings of the album were packaged in a digipak-style case with postcards containing lyrics and <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> the band.|$|E

5|$|In Zürich, Vermigli succeeded Konrad Pellikan as {{the chair}} of Hebrew, a {{position}} he would hold until his death. He married his second wife, Catarina Merenda of Brescia, Italy, in 1559. Vermigli was able to share his teaching duties with fellow Hebraist Theodor Bibliander, allowing him time to study and prepare the <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> his previous lectures for publication. He began lecturing on the books of Samuel and Kings. While in Zürich, Vermigli declined invitations to desirable positions in Geneva, Heidelberg, and England.|$|E
5|$|Joannou {{worked with}} blues-rock group The Mess Hall; he co-produced – with Matt Lovell – their six-track {{extended}} play, Feeling Sideways, which {{was released in}} May 2003. The album was nominated for the ARIA Award for 'Best Independent Release' in 2003. Joannou and Lovell co-produced The Mess Hall's studio album, <b>Notes</b> <b>from</b> a Ceiling which was issued in June 2005. Joannou and Lovell received a nomination at the ARIA Music Awards of 2005 for 'Producer of the Year'. In 2003, Gillies formed Tambalane with Wes Carr, initially as a song-writing project, they released a self-titled album in 2005 and toured Australia.|$|E
5|$|Objects from Puerto Rico are {{constantly}} featured in specialized magazines, in both {{national and international}} distribution. The Puerto Rican dollars that were collected by the government, were burned between January 16–24, 1925, drastically {{reducing the amount of}} surviving <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> the Bank of Puerto Rico. The Great Depression reduced their numbers further, since necessity prevented the collection of pesos in large denominations. Thus less than five exemplars are known to exist of the 100 and 200 peso banknotes issued by El Banco Español de Puerto Rico and the 5 and 10 dollars Series F bills published by the Bank of Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|Richard Elfman {{entered into}} a {{licensing}} deal with the creative resource company, PANGEA, to provide licensees {{with the opportunity to}} create merchandise based on the cult film. According to articles that appeared in the media on May 3, 2016, the arrangement calls for content to be created that will include a Storyboard Book of the original film, featuring commentary and anecdotal <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> director. Shot glasses and sculpted pieces were among the list of immediate items that would be released. A fantasy novella series was also noted as being under development.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the trek}} found archaeological {{artifacts}} related to 19th-century Europeans and undisturbed disarticulated human remains, Beattie {{was disappointed that}} more remains were not found. Examining the bones of Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, he compared <b>notes</b> <b>from</b> the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for trace element analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher than the control samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E
5|$|At a seminar, Aristo met {{director}} Hanung Bramantyo {{and showed}} him one of his screenplays. Bramantyo, who liked what he saw, asked Aristo to write a screenplay for a new film {{he was working on}} with Leo Sutanto of SinemArt. The resulting work, written after intensive research into the production of brownies and titled after the snack, was released in 2004. It garnered a Citra Award for Best Director at the Indonesian Film Festival for Bramantyo and a nomination for best original screenplay for Aristo. While Brownies was in production, Aristo wrote four other screenplays, for Catatan Akhir Sekolah (<b>Notes</b> <b>from</b> the End of School), Cinta Silver (Silver Love), Jomblo (Single), and Alexandria. All of these were made into films between 2005 and 2006. After these successes, at the end of 2006 Bramantyo asked Aristo and his new wife, screenwriter Ginatri S. Noer, to adapt the novel Ayat-Ayat Cinta (Verses of Love) by Habiburrahman El Shirazy, into a film. The resulting work, also entitled Ayat-Ayat Cinta, was highly successful. This was followed by Karma (2007), and Kambing Jantan: The Movie (2008).|$|E
