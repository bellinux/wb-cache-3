40|$|The {{distribution}} and relative frequency among anatids of <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas chlorotis) in Holocene fossil deposits on the North, South, and Stewart Islands of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> are reviewed. <b>Brown</b> <b>teal</b> remains representing 641 birds are reported from 73 widely distributed sites throughout <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> The fossil sites indicate the prehistoric {{use of a}} large range of palaeohabitats including coastal sites, lakes, swamps, and forests as diverse as wet podocarp and beech forests up to 700 m altitude. There is often no direct association of these forest sites with aquatic habitats such as rivers or ponds indicating that <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> were foraging often at considerable distances from such features while in forests. In the seasonally drier eastern regions <b>brown</b> <b>teal</b> were confined more to aquatic habitats, though {{this may have been}} the result of competitive exclusion with Finschs duck which dominated terrestrial habitats, rather than habitat incompatibility...|$|R

50|$|Brown {{earth is}} a type of soil. Brown earths are mostly located between 35° and 55° north of the Equator. The largest expanses cover western and central Europe, large areas of western and trans-Uralian Russia, the east coast of America and eastern Asia. Here, areas of brown earth soil types are found {{particularly}} in Japan, Korea, China, eastern Australia and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> <b>Brown</b> earths cover 45% of the land in England and Wales. They are common in lowland areas (below 1,000 feet) on permeable parent material. The most common vegetation types are deciduous woodland and grassland. Due to the reasonable natural fertility of brown earths, large tracts of deciduous woodland have been cut down and the land is now used for farming. They are normally located in regions with a humid temperate climate. Rainfall totals are moderate, usually below 76 cm per year, and temperatures range from 4°C in the winter to 18°C in the summer. They are well-drained fertile soils with a pH of between 5.0 and 6.5.|$|R

In film premieres from Auckland to the National Zoo in Washington D.C., Tobias addressed the issue of [...] "coldspots" [...] in addition to [...] "hotspots," [...] emphasizing new methodologies critically necessary within conservation biology to address those species [...] "under the radar screen," [...] like several of the avifauna species that Tobias has worked to rescue from oblivion in regions like <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> where the Dancing Star Foundation has been assiduously translocating such species as the <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>Brown</b> Creeper (pipipi (Mohoua novaeseelandiae), Stewart Island Black Robin and Rifleman (Acanthisitta chloris Māori: tītipounamu), all rare <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> bird species.

50|$|Len Brown was a {{right-handed}} lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler {{who turned}} to bowling leg-breaks and googlies {{later in his}} career. His first-class cricket career began with two matches for Transvaal against the 1930-31 English touring team and he took seven wickets in his first match, including Wally Hammond and Percy Chapman twice each. He was then picked, as {{the youngest member of}} the team, for the 1931-32 tour to Australia and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> <b>Brown</b> was rarely part of the touring team's first eleven in the major matches, but after a bad showing in the first Test match, which was lost by an innings and 163 runs, he played in a non-first-class match against a New South Wales Country XI and, bowling throughout the Country XI's first innings, took five wickets for 57 runs, with another couple of wickets in the second innings. That led to his call-up to the Test team for the second match of the series. The result, though, was almost identical to the first game - defeat by an innings and 155 runs - and Brown took only one wicket at a cost of 100 runs. He also scored 2 and 8 in his two innings. He played in {{only a few of the}} other matches on the tour until the South Africans crossed to <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> where, in a less taxing series, he was recalled for the second Test match against the New Zealanders, the first game having been won by an innings. In this second (and last) Test of his career, Brown took a single wicket in each innings and scored 7 in the South Africans' only completed innings.|$|R
