President Richard Nixon {{considered}} nominating Mildred Lillie, a California appeals court judge, {{to fill the}} vacant seat; Lillie {{would have been the}} first female <b>nominee</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court. However, Nixon decided against Lillie's nomination after the American Bar Association found Lillie to be unqualified. Thereafter, Nixon nominated William Rehnquist (a future Chief Justice), who was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E

Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist were then successfully nominated to fill those vacancies.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} for induction, nominees must meet certain prerequisites. Players must have been retired {{for at least five}} years before becoming eligible. Referees and coaches must have either been retired {{for at least five years}}, or, if they are still active, have coached or officiated for at least 25 years at high-school-level programs or higher. Those being considered for induction as contributors may be inducted at any time; the Hall of Fame and its committees evaluate whether contributions are significant enough for the <b>nominee</b> <b>to</b> be inducted as a contributor. Teams are also inducted at the committees' discretion.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one {{individuals}} have held {{the office of}} governor of Washington since the state's admission to the Union, with Arthur B. Langlie serving non-consecutive terms. Langlie and Daniel J.

5|$|The first {{winner of}} the award was Willie Mays, {{and the most recent}} winner is Anthony Rizzo. None of the winners has {{received}} the award more than once, so far. The first pitcher to win the award was Phil Niekro in 1980, and the first catcher to win the award was Gary Carter in 1989. To date, Clemente's former teammate Willie Stargell and Andrew McCutchen are the only members of the Pittsburgh Pirates to win the award. Stargell won his award in 1974, and McCutchen won in 2015. The Pirates themselves have been wearing Clemente-era throwback uniforms in recent years on Roberto Clemente Day, which is the day they play the game that they present their <b>nominee</b> <b>to</b> MLB. In 2014, for the first time, the award was awarded to two players instead of one. The award was awarded to Paul Konerko and Jimmy Rollins.|$|E
5|$|During an {{unsuccessful}} senatorial bid in 1914, Stanley assumed an anti-prohibition stance. This issue would dominate {{his political career}} {{for more than a}} decade and put him at odds with J. C. W. Beckham, the leader of the pro-temperance faction of the state's Democratic Party. In 1915, Stanley ran for governor, defeating his close friend Edwin P. Morrow by just over 400 votes. It was the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history. Historian Lowell H. Harrison called Stanley's administration the apex of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. Among the reforms adopted during his tenure were a state antitrust law, a campaign finance reform law, and a workman's compensation law. In 1918, Stanley was chosen as the Democratic <b>nominee</b> <b>to</b> succeed the recently deceased senator Ollie M. James. Stanley was elected, but did not resign as governor to take the seat until May 1919 and accomplished little in his single term. He lost his re-election bid to Frederic M. Sackett in the 1924 Republican landslide and never again held elected office. He died in Washington, D.C. on August 12, 1958.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Crittenden {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig <b>nominee</b> <b>to</b> replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to {{nominate}} Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether {{he would be able to}} secure enough votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would be the nominee, and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with Richard Mentor Johnson, John Rowan, Charles A. Wickliffe, and John Breathitt. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, but he refused to vote for himself because he wanted Clay to be the nominee. Some of Crittenden's supporters, however, refused to vote for Clay, and the seat was left vacant.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{elections}} of 1967, Reddy {{was elected to}} the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh. On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a joint session of Parliament, the handing down of a sentence of imprisonment for Contempt {{of the house and the}} setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation suit filed against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of the Parliament'. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's <b>nominee</b> <b>to</b> succeed Zakir Hussain as President.|$|E

25|$|The {{period between}} {{the death of a}} king, and the {{election}} of a new king, was known as the interregnum. During the interregnum, the senate elected a senator to the office of Interrex to facilitate the election of a new king. Once the Interrex found a suitable nominee for the kingship, he presented this <b>nominee</b> <b>to</b> the senate for an initial approval. If the senate voted in favor of the nominee, that person stood for formal election before the People of Rome in the Curiate Assembly (the popular assembly). After the nominee was elected by the popular assembly, the senate ratified the election by passing a decree. The Interrex then formally declared the <b>nominee</b> <b>to</b> be king. The new king then took the auspices (a ritual search for omens from the Gods), and was vested with legal authority (imperium) by the popular assembly.|$|E
