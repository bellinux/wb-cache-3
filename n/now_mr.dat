2500|$|The {{title of}} QC {{continues}} to be used. In 1998 two Northern Ireland barristers (Seamus Treacy, <b>now</b> <b>Mr</b> Justice Treacy, and Barry Macdonald) opposed the requirement of swearing an oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Bar Council, the body which represents barristers' interests, had agreed (in the Elliott Report) that the royal oath should be dropped and replaced by a more neutral statement. It suggested that, instead of declaring services to Queen Elizabeth, barristers should [...] "sincerely promise and declare that I will well and truly serve all whom I may lawfully be called {{to serve in the}} office of one of Her Majesty's Counsel, learned in the law according {{to the best of my}} skill and understanding".|$|E
2500|$|Hitler made it {{onto the}} stage through Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima, who wrote a play called My Friend Hitler (Wagatomo Hitora), retelling the Night of the Long Knives. Moreover, the Hungarian writer George Tabori wrote a comedy called Mein Kampf which portrayed Hitler as a poor young man who enters Vienna, wanting to become an artist. Hitler appears as a minor {{character}} in Stanley Eveling's The Dead of Night, set above the Führerbunker as the Russians are entering Berlin. [...] Dr Freud Will See You <b>Now</b> <b>Mr</b> Hitler (2008) was a radio drama by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran presenting an imagined scenario in which Sigmund Freud treats the young Hitler. Toby Jones played Hitler. Utpal Dutt's 1975 Bengali play Barricade {{is set in the}} time that Hitler is rising to power.|$|E
2500|$|It {{should also}} be said that Mr M’Culloch’s {{attempts}} to get the (perhaps disgruntled) [...] Heritors to repair the dilapidated church met with little success. He therefore began preaching in a tent next to the church, using letters and printed sermons from New England detailing the extraordinary events taking place there — the so-called First Great Awakening. The lack of a minister for many years had led to {{a huge number of}} [...] "fellowships", or praying societies, in the parish. <b>Now</b> <b>Mr</b> M’Culloch added another ingredient — the letters and sermons were supplemented by sermons on his own specialist theme [...] "Regeneration: its nature and necessity". Mr M’Culloch’s readings from the pulpit, along with his private conversations with concerned parishioners, laid a solid foundation for the historical events that soon followed — the extraordinary events known as the Cambuslang Work — or [...] "wark" [...] in Scots — referring to the [...] "work of the Lord". Later, Mr M’Culloch claimed some 400 people had been converted during the Cambuslang Work, including 70 from Cambuslang itself. It is typical of his modesty that we do not know if he himself ever eventually experienced conversion, though he did exclaim at one point during his last illness [...] "The whole is shortly summed up in the words of Jesus Christ; ‘He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned’" ...|$|E

2500|$|Equity {{is a body}} {{of rules}} that {{developed}} in England separately from the [...] "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The Lord Chancellor on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so. This meant equity came to operate more through principles than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to {{take good care of}} the entrusted property. In the early case of Keech v Sandford [...] a child had inherited the lease on a market in Romford, London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford {{that he did not want}} the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (<b>now</b> <b>Mr</b> Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of conflict of interest. The Lord Chancellor, Lord King, agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote, ...|$|E
