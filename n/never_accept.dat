5|$|Just {{months into}} his reign, Edward forced a {{constitutional}} crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King {{he was also}} head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a constitutional monarch, Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the executions in the Civil War, many Republicans would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> the Free State as a {{legitimate}} Irish government, but rather saw it as a repressive, British-imposed government. This attitude was partially alleviated after 1932, when Fianna Fáil, the party that represented the bulk of the Republican constituency, entered government peacefully; it introduced a new Constitution in 1937. The Free State officially became the Republic of Ireland in 1949.|$|E

We will use our numbers to delegitimize any agreement that is not consistent with our minimal position. If needs be we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threaten to be another rape of our continent.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March 1935, Hitler had {{appointed}} Joachim von Ribbentrop, {{who served}} as both Hitler's Extraordinary Ambassador-Plenipotentiary at Large (making part of the Auswärtiges Amt, the German Foreign Office) and as the chief of a Nazi Party organization named the Dienststelle Ribbentrop that competed with the Auswärtiges Amt was appointed to head the German delegation to negotiate any naval treaty. Baron Konstantin von Neurath, the German Foreign Minister was first opposed to this arrangement, but {{he changed his mind}} when he decided that the British would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> the 35:100 ratio; having Ribbentrop head the mission {{was the best way to}} discredit his rival.|$|E
25|$|Chico Xavier wrote most of 450 {{allegedly}} psychographic books. He never {{admitted to}} be the author of any of his books. He affirmed he would only reproduce whatever the spirits dictated to him. Being the reason for why he would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> the money attained from selling his books. He sold more than 50 million copies in Portuguese; with translations in English, Spanish, Japanese, Esperanto, French, German, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Mandarin, Swedish, Braille, and others languages. He also transcribed around ten thousand letters allegedly from the dead to their families. The letters were declared legitimate by many people, {{and some of the}} letters were used as evidence in four criminal trials. Chico Xavier granted all the copyrights to charity institution since the first book.|$|E

25|$|In 1924 the IRA counted 14,500 {{members in}} total, {{including}} young men aged from 19 upwards, but with just over 5,000 weapons in its dumps. By 1926 {{the number of}} members had shrunk to 5,042. By 1930 the IRA possessed fewer than 2,000 members and only 859 rifles, indicating the decline in its military potential. The casualties of the anti-Treaty IRA in the Civil War have never been accurately counted, but {{are thought to have}} been considerably more than the 800 or so deaths suffered by the Free State Army, perhaps two or three times as numerous. Significantly however, the war had not been brought to an end by any kind of agreement between the two sides. The IRA of the post-Civil War era would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> the Free State as a legitimate Irish government and would continue to oppose its existence.|$|E
25|$|Konoe's {{terms for}} making peace were so extreme and harsh {{that even the}} Japanese {{military}} objected to them, {{on the grounds that}} Chiang would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> peace with them. The German Foreign Minister, Konstantin von Neurath, who was attempting to mediate a compromise peace between China and Japan as the Reich, which had friendly relations with Japan and China did not wish to choose between the two, complained, upon seeing Konoe's peace terms, that these were so intentionally outrageous and humiliating demands that they seemed to be designed only to inspire rejection on Chiang's part. Konoe's main demands were that China recognise Manchukuo, sign the Anti-Comintern Pact, allow Japanese officers to command the Chinese National Revolutionary Army, allow Japanese troops to remain indefinitely in all the areas of China they had occupied, and pay reparations to Japan. China was not only to pay the entire costs of the war run up by Japan but also a punitive amount so that the Chinese people might reflect on the folly of seeking to challenge the might of Japan.|$|E
500|$|He stated, [...] "I will <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> any {{proposals}} that will obligate the Jewish {{people to leave}} France, because to me the Jews {{are the same as}} any other citizen in our country. It takes weakness to chase them out of the country, but it takes strength to assimilate them". He was seen as so favourable to the Jews that the Russian Orthodox Church formally condemned him as [...] "Antichrist and the Enemy of God".|$|E

Speer later concluded that Hanke must have been speaking of Auschwitz and blamed himself for not inquiring further of Hanke or seeking information from Himmler or Hitler: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{role of the}} Evil Queen/Regina went to Lana Parrilla. She {{explained}} the character, [...] "There's always two stories being told when playing Regina. There's the threat of her knowing she's an evil queen and then there's just the pure simple fact that the biological mother has stepped into her world {{and the threat of}} losing her son is just enormous. That's a fear that I think any adopted mother would have. I think that's going to really help the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard back from her management staff.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} month, {{a controversy}} arose after the Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) {{issued a report}} calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% — a stark difference from the official figure of 18.9%, used by politicians to justify the retention or revival of the NEP. One local analyst suggested that [...] "If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely the next question is, why the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> at present." [...] The report's methodology was criticised for using market value instead of par value for its calculations of equity, and limiting its scope to a thousand publicly listed companies. It also included government-linked companies (GLCs) as Bumiputra-owned companies. Some, however, criticised the government, alleging that par value did not accurately reflect {{the value of the}} enterprises studied, and claimed that a portion of GLC equity should be considered Bumiputra-held. The report was later withdrawn, but the controversy continued after an independent media outlet cited a study following the government methodology that indicated Bumiputra equity had passed the 30% mark in 1997.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} letter, the Drapier walks a careful line between openly indicting {{the king and}} merely hinting at his {{relationship}} with Wood's patent; while the Drapier accuses Wood, he constantly refers to the king's authority and power to issue legal tender (this is called [...] "the King's Prerogative"). In particular, the Drapier claims that the king is unable to force his people to accept any copper based currency. As the Drapier points out, the constitution establishing Ireland as a kingdom limits {{the authority of the}} monarch because it forces the people of Ireland to use only gold or silver coins as official currency. Throughout this argument, the Drapier compares the king's ability to print money with the petty amount of political power held by Wood, which undermines the image of the king as the supreme authority in Ireland while hinting that the king is not protecting the rights of the Irish people. The Drapier stops himself before he commits treason, and he instead argues that the king would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> a patent that could harm Ireland; to the Drapier, the king would never act {{in such a way as}} to help Wood harm the people of Ireland.|$|E
500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann made a decision that changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the right place for Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey. He would <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> anything on its face value... He was the type of player who was a manager's dream because you could talk about a decision and he would accept it and there it was, in his game." ...|$|E

Wail al-Shehri's father denied reports that Wail had an {{aeronautics}} degree, as some news reports said, [...] "My son Wail was 25 {{years old and had}} a BA in physical education from the Abha Teacher’s College. He was mentally ill and had gone to numerous clerics for assistance in overcoming this instability. He had asked the school, where he taught, for a 6-month leave to go to Madinah." [...] His father also told reporters that he dreaded having to believe that Wail and Waleed were involved in the September 11 attacks, [...] "If {{that turns out to be}} the truth, then I'll never, <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> it from them. I'll never forgive them for that." [...] Family members said that Wail and Waleed became very religious in the months before they disappeared, had expressed interest in going to Chechnya, and hoped for martyrdom. In a report entitled [...] "A Saudi Apology" [...] for Dateline NBC aired on August 25, 2002, John Hockenberry traveled to Asir, where he interviewed Shehri's brother, Salah, who agreed that Wail and Waleed were deceased. Salah described them as not very religious, and suggested they had been brainwashed.|$|E

That's not why we created the state." [...] Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also stated that month that [...] "I'll <b>never</b> <b>accept</b> a solution that is based on their return to Israel, any number.... I will not agree to accept any kind of Israel responsibility for the refugees. Full stop.... It's a moral issue of the highest level.
