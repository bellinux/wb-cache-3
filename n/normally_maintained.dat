5|$|Sapumal Kumaraya (also {{known as}} Chempaha Perumal in Tamil), who ruled the Jaffna kingdom {{on behalf of}} the Kotte kingdom is {{credited}} with either building or renovating the Nallur Kandaswamy temple. Singai Pararasasegaram is credited with building the Sattanathar temple, the Vaikuntha Pillaiyar temple and the Veerakaliamman temple. He built a pond called Yamuneri and filled it with water from the Yamuna river of North India, which is considered holy by Hindus. He was a frequent the visitor of the Koneswaram temple, as was his son and successor King Cankili I. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan had the traditional history of the temple compiled as a chronicle in verse, entitled Dakshina Kailasa Puranam, known today as the Sthala Puranam of Koneshwaram Temple. Major temples were <b>normally</b> <b>maintained</b> by the kings and a salary was paid from the royal treasury to those who worked in the temple, unlike in India and rest of Sri Lanka, where religious establishments were autonomous entities with large endowments of land and related revenue.|$|E

500|$|In a {{continuous}} distillation, {{the system is}} kept in a steady state or approximate steady state. [...] Steady state means that quantities related to the process do not change as time passes during operation. [...] Such constant quantities include feed input rate, output stream rates, heating and cooling rates, reflux ratio, and temperatures, pressures, and compositions at every point (location). [...] Unless the process is disturbed due to changes in feed, heating, ambient temperature, or condensing, steady state is <b>normally</b> <b>maintained.</b> [...] This is also the main attraction of continuous distillation, apart from the minimum amount of (easily instrumentable) surveillance; if the feed rate and feed composition are kept constant, product rate and quality are also constant. [...] Even when a variation in conditions occurs, modern process control methods are commonly able to gradually return the continuous process to another steady state again.|$|E
500|$|Morard de Galles {{planned to}} sail his fleet from the French naval {{fortress}} of Brest {{under cover of}} darkness on the night of 15–16December. The British Channel Fleet <b>normally</b> <b>maintained</b> a squadron off Brest to blockade the port, but its commander, Rear-Admiral John Colpoys, had withdrawn his force from its usual station [...] offshore to [...] northwest of Brest because of severe Atlantic winter gales. The only British ships within sight of Brest were an inshore squadron of frigates under Sir Edward Pellew in , accompanied by , , [...] and the lugger HMS Duke of York. Pellew was already renowned, having been the first British officer of the war to capture a French frigate: the Cléopâtre at the Action of 18 June 1793. He later captured the frigates Pomone and Virginie in 1794 and 1796, and saved 500lives following the shipwreck of the East Indiaman Dutton in January 1796. For these actions he had first been knighted and then raised to a baronetcy. Indefatigable was a razee, one of the largest frigates in the Royal Navy, originally constructed as a 64-gun third rate and cut down to 44 guns in 1795 to make the ship fast and powerful enough to catch and fight the largest of French frigates. Armed with 24-pounder cannon on the main decks and 42-pounder carronades on the quarter deck, she had a stronger armament than any equivalent French frigate.|$|E

[...] For example, as an accidental byproduct of the rule that doubles consonants in this situation after a short vowel, a double [...] will normally indicate the hard pronunciation (e.g. bagged is pronounced , not as [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|During {{the time}} of Operation Desert Shield, the {{military}} buildup to the Persian Gulf War, US Air Force Boeing KC-135s & McDonnell Douglas KC-10As, and USMC KC-130 Hercules aircraft were deployed to forward air bases in England, Diego Garcia, and Saudi Arabia. Aircraft stationed in Saudi Arabia <b>normally</b> <b>maintained</b> an orbit in the Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone, informally known as [...] "Frisbee", and refueled Coalition Aircraft whenever necessary. Two side by side tracks over central Saudi Arabia called [...] "Prune" [...] and [...] "Raisin" [...] featured 2–4 basket equipped KC-135 tankers each and were used by Navy aircraft from the Red Sea Battle Force. Large Navy strike groups from the Red Sea would send A-6 tankers to the Prune and Raisin tracks ahead of the strike aircraft arriving to top off and take up station {{to the right of}} the Air Force tankers thereby providing an additional tanking point. RAF Handley Page Victor and Vickers VC10 tankers were also used to refuel British and coalition aircraft and were popular with the US Navy for their docile basket behavior and having three point refueling stations. An additional track was maintained close to the northwest border for the E-3 AWACS aircraft and any Navy aircraft needing emergency fuel. These 24-hour air-refueling zones helped make the intense air campaign during Operation Desert Storm possible. An additional 24/7 tanker presence was maintained over the Red Sea itself to refuel Navy F-14 Tomcats maintaining Combat Air Patrol tracks. During the last week of the conflict, KC-10 tankers moved inside Iraq to support barrier CAP missions set up to block Iraqi fighters from escaping to Iran.|$|E
6000|$|Without {{pausing to}} dwell on the {{objection}} that land cannot be improved beyond a certain point, and that, at the reaching of that point, farther claim to tenure would cease, on Mr. Mill's principle--take even this admission, with its proper subsequent conclusion, that [...] "in no sound theory of private property was it ever contemplated that the proprietor of land should be merely a sinecurist quartered on it." [...] Now, had that conclusion been farther followed, it would have compelled the admission that all rent was unjustifiable which <b>normally</b> <b>maintained</b> any person in idleness; which is indeed the whole truth of the matter. But Mr. Mill instantly retreats from this perilous admission; and after three or four pages of discussion (quite accurate for its part) of the limits of power in management of the land itself (which apply just as strictly to the peasant proprietor as to the cottier's landlord), he begs the whole question at issue in one brief sentence, slipped cunningly into the middle of a long one which appears to be telling all the other way, and in which the fatal assertion (of the right to rent) nestles itself, {{as if it had been}} already proved,--thus--I italicize the unproved assertion in which the venom of the entire falsehood is concentrated.|$|E

50|$|A typical nuclear {{submarine}} has {{a crew of}} over 80; conventional boats typically have fewer than 40. The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation {{for long periods of}} time, without family contact.

Familygrams were originally limited to 15 words, though later as many as 50 words were permitted. Content was also severely restricted. Familygrams were not private communications. Familygrams were scanned for content before being transmitted, and scanned again before delivery to the intended recipients. There are many examples of such familygrams on the Internet, dating from the Vietnam War and earlier.|$|R

Opponents argue that photo ID requirements disproportionately affect minority, handicapped and elderly voters who do not <b>normally</b> <b>maintain</b> driver's licenses. Also, requiring such groups to obtain and keep track of photo IDs that are otherwise unneeded is considered a suppression tactic aimed at those groups.|$|R

They are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion. Their one weakness is cats, who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them. It is revealed that they also maintain an incestuous relationship.|$|R

50|$|In the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, {{counties}} typically provide, at a minimum, courts, public utilities, libraries, hospitals, {{public health}} services, parks, roads, law enforcement, and jails. There {{is usually a}} county registrar, recorder, or clerk (the exact title varies) who collects vital statistics, holds elections (sometimes in coordination with a separate elections office or commission), and prepares or processes certificates of births, deaths, marriages, and dissolutions (divorce decrees).

Other key county officials include the coroner/medical examiner, treasurer, assessor, auditor, comptroller, and district attorney.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife tourism also causes {{disruption}} to intra-specific relationships. Attendance {{by female}} harp seals to their pups declined when tourists were present and those females remaining with their pups spent significantly less time nursing {{and more time}} watching the tourists. There is also a risk of the young not being recognized, and being more exposed to predator attacks.

40|$|The {{immune system}} recognizes and {{is poised to}} {{eliminate}} cancer but is held in check by inhibitory receptors and ligands. These immune checkpoint pathways, which <b>normally</b> <b>maintain</b> self-tolerance and limit collateral tissue damage during anti-microbial immune responses, can be co-opted by cancer to evade immune destruction. Drugs interrupting immune checkpoints, such as anti-CTLA- 4, anti-PD- 1, anti-PD-L 1, and others in early development, can unleash anti-tumor immunity and mediate durable cancer regressions. The complex biology of immune checkpoint pathways still contains many mysteries, and the full activity spectrum of checkpoint-blocking drugs, used alone or in combination, is currently the subject of intense study...|$|R
50|$|Many {{plays in}} English Renaissance drama exploit bawdy humour and risqué subject matter; but they <b>normally</b> <b>maintain</b> {{at least a}} formal {{commitment}} to the established morality of the social order. Westward Ho and Northward Ho, two early Jacobean comedies by Thomas Dekker and John Webster, and the city comedies of Thomas Middleton, provide good examples of this tendency, as do many other dramas of the era. In The Parson's Wedding, Killigrew abandons even a lip-service acceptance of socially-approved morality; he is overtly and even gleefully cynical about the moral claims and sexual mores of society - especially in regard to marriage.|$|R
5000|$|The human anus (from Latin [...] meaning [...] "ring", [...] "circle") is the {{external}} {{opening of the}} rectum.
