5|$|England beat Scotland 7–2 in April 1955, {{and this}} time Matthews linked up much better with Revie, and 40-year-old Matthews was largely {{credited}} for the outstanding margin of victory. In this game Duncan Edwards was making his England debut; when Matthews made his, Edwards had <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> born. Matthews went on England's unsuccessful tour of the continent in 1955, as the selectors erratic choices helped to ensure a 1–0 defeat to France, a 1–1 draw with Spain, and a 3–1 defeat to Portugal. Left out against Denmark, {{he was back in}} the team in October for a 1–1 draw with Wales.|$|E

5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to be challenged at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{second set}} of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their {{optimism}} was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help and, far from considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{a special}} case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The alkali metal borides tend to be boron-rich, {{involving}} appreciable boron–boron bonding involving deltahedral structures, and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high vapour pressure at elevated temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700°C, and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron decreases down the group: lithium reacts completely at 700°C, but sodium at 900°C and potassium not until 1200°C, and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides have <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> characterised. Various phases are known, such as LiB10, NaB6, NaB15, and KB6. Under high pressure the boron–boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following Wade's rules to forming Zintl anions {{like the rest of}} group 13.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the line was prompted by the need of mine owners around Guisborough and East Cleveland to transport their iron ore to the River Tees. Guisborough was already served by the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway (M), {{a subsidiary of the}} Stockton and Darlington (S), which had built a line (opened in 1854) running along the south of the valley in which Guisborough sits. However, the line was an inconveniently long distance from the lucrative iron ore mines in the north of the valley, along the south flank of the Eston Hills, and provided no connection at all for mines east of Guisborough. The M had been built by a group of industrialists based in Stockton and Darlington who used it to service their own mines, deliberately avoiding the estates of their rivals. It only provided a minimal passenger service to Middlesbrough – one train a day each way – and the line had originally <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> planned to have a passenger station in Guisborough.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{team member}} was Amanda Carter, aged 48, who {{was coming back}} for a fourth Paralympic games having competed in the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta and the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, at which she had been sidelined by a {{crippling}} elbow injury. She returned to the Gliders' lineup in 2009. The youngest, who had <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> born when Carter had played in Barcelona, was 19-year-old Amber Merritt. British-born Merritt was originally a swimmer, but had been recruited into basketball by the Paralympic Hall of Fame coach Frank Ponta. Merritt had averaged 20 points and 8.4 rebounds per game in the Gliders' World Challenge series against Japan, Germany and China in Sydney in July 2012, including a game against Germany in which she scored 21 points and eight rebounds. Another young player from whom much was hoped was Cobi Crispin, who had been named Australian Women’s Wheelchair Basketball International Player of the Year in 2011, and had since posted impressive performances in the May 2012 Paralympic World Cup in Manchester and the Gliders World Challenge.|$|E
