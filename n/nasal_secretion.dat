40|$|Abstract. Eosinophils are {{regarded}} as major cell population directly involved into late phase of allergic inflammation of nasal mucosa. We performed a comparative study, measuring the amounts of eosinophils and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> and serum samples of thirty-three patients with persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR), and twenty-five persons with chronic infectious rhinitis (CIR), to determine diagnostic significance of these parameters. Eosinophil counts in nasal secret were carried out by exfoliative cytology analysis. Sampling of <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> was performed by absorption method. The samples were standardized by concentration of urea in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> and sera. ЕСР levels in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> and serum were determined by chemiluminescence assays (UniCAP 100, Phadia, Sweden). Mean scores of eosinophils in nasal secret of PAR patients were 4. 6 times higher, than in the patients with CIR. Median ECP values in serum and <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> of PAR patients were, resp., 30. 5 ± 28. 0 μg/l and 402. 7 ± 326. 9 μg/l. In patients with CIR, ECP values were 12. 4 ± 11. 5 μg/l in serum and 86. 9 ± 137. 4 μg/l in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions.</b> The appropriate differences have been significant (р < 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) is {{the most}} common {{allergen}} for seasonal allergic rhinitis in Japan. Little is known about local production of immunoglobulin (Ig) E in people with or without Japanese cedar pollinosis. The aims of this study were to measure levels of JCP-specific IgE in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> and determine correlations with levels in serum. Methods: Forty-six subjects were enrolled in this study, comprising 24 symptomatic subjects, 9 asymptomatic subjects sensitized to JCP, and 13 subjects not sensitized to JCP. <b>Nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> were obtained during a period of Japanese cedar dispersal, and levels of JCP-specific IgE were measured with CAP-fluorescent enzyme immunoassay. Serum JCP-specific IgE and total IgE were also measured using the same method. Results: Among the 46 subjects enrolled, JCP-specific IgE in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> was measureable in 43 subjects. Irrespective of symptom development, sensitized subjects showed higher levels of JCP-specific IgE in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> than non-sensitized subjects.

Exposure to low DE for 28 days did not augment the increase in INP immediately after inhalation of His aerosoL These results reveal that 4 -week exposure to high DE induces nasal mucosal hyperresponsiveness in guine...|$|E
40|$|The WBR- 1 {{strain of}} bovine {{adenovirus}} type 3 was suspended in Eagle's medium or bovine <b>nasal</b> <b>secretion</b> and atomized into a rotating drum at temperatures of 6 degrees C or 32 degrees C and relative humidities of 30 % or 90 %. Impinger {{samples of the}} aerosols were collected seven minutes, one, two and three hours postgeneration, and titrated for infectivity in embryonic bovine kidney cell cultures. Under certain conditions of temperature and relative humidity, the virus was more stable in aerosols of Eagle's medium than in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretion.</b> The bovine adenovirus was usually inactivated more rapidly at 30 % relative humidity than at 90 % relative humidity and during aging of the aerosols the virus was inactivated more rapidly at 32 degrees C than at 6 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|Background: An Environmental Challenge Chamber (ECC) is {{a useful}} tool to expose {{allergic}} patients to relevant allergens in a controlled indoor setting and to test antiallergic treatments. Hitherto, ECC studies with grass pollen are primarily conducted offseason to avoid potential confounders. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} prospective study was to investigate whether the therapeutic effect of a combination of cetirizine and pseudoephedrine in an ECC setting is equivalent when tested within and out of the grass pollen season. Methods: In a randomised, double blind study the effect of a combination of 10 mg cetirizine and 120 mg pseudoephedrine versus placebo on nasal symptoms, <b>nasal</b> <b>secretion,</b> and nasal flow measured by rhinomanometry was investigated in 70 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Subjects underwent four 6 h pollen exposures with Dactylis glomerata pollen in an ECC with drug administration after 2 h. Two exposures were conducted within the pollen season and two out of the pollen season. Results: The active treatment significantly reduced nasal symptoms, <b>nasal</b> <b>secretion,</b> and nasal flow compared to placebo both within and out of the pollen season (Po 0. 0001). Treatment effects on symptoms, <b>nasal</b> <b>secretion,</b> and nasal flow were not different between the seasons. (P 40. 2, P 40. 5 P 40. 6, respectively). Conclusion: An ECC can be used to test anti-allergic treatments both within and out of the grass pollen season...|$|E
40|$|In 15 {{patients}} with Japanese cedar pollinosis and 10 healthy control subjects, levels of {{major basic protein}} (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and arylsulfatase B (As) in the <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> were examined before and after challenge with Japanese cedar pollen extract. The MBP and ECP levels in the patients were significantly higher 30 min after challenge than those before challenge (P &# 60; 0. 005). MBP and ECP levels after challenge were significantly higher in the <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> of patients than in the controls (MBP: P &# 60; 0. 01, ECP: P &# 60; 0. 05). The level of As after challenge was significantly higher in the <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> of patients than in the controls. These results suggest that eosinophils activate or modify the immediate, nasal allergic reaction and {{have a role in}} regulating immunological responses. </p...|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulin (Ig) {{concentrations}} in serurn and in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> {{were correlated with}} pneumonia and diarrhea during the first 12 wk of life of dairy calves. The peak onset of pneumonia occurred between 2 and 4 wk of age when the calves' serum Ig G 1, Ig G 2 and IgA concentrations were lowest. As IgG 2 {{concentrations in}}creased, fewer calves developed pneumonia. Peak onset of pneumonia was also correlated with the lowest IgG and IgA concentrations in the calves' <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions.</b> Diarrhea often preceded pneumonia...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Biological markers in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> provide {{valuable}} information on nasal pathophysiology. However, published data on biomarker concentrations in nasal fluids are remarkably inconsistent, and the bias due to different sampling techniques, {{has not yet}} been systematically evaluated. Concentrations of various protein were repeatedly determined in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> of 16 healthy volunteers. The proteins were detected by using: 1) a 2 -macroglobulin as a marker for plasma contamination; 2) lactoferrin as a marker for glandular secretion; 3) lactate dehydrogenase as a marker for tissue injury; and 4) interleukin (IL) - 1 b, IL- 8, tumour necrosis factor-a, and eosinophil cationic protein and tryptase as indicators for tissue inflammation. A total of four different sampling methods, including nasal lavage (NL) and a new polyurethane foam sampler technique (PFST) were employed. Analyte concentrations in NL were approximately 10 -times lower than in specimens obtained by PFST. Due to the unpredictable dilution during NL, various analytes were below the detection limit of the high sensitivity assays employed. With PFST, concentrations below the detection limit rarely occurred. The specimens did not significantly differ regarding plasma contamination, glandular secretion or tissue injury. The considerable variability of reported analyte concentrations in <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions</b> mainly results from different sampling techniques. To collect <b>nasal</b> <b>secretions,</b> samplers are considered superior to nasal lavage techniques...|$|R
