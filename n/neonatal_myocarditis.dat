40|$|Enteroviruses are {{a leading}} cause of viral infections in children. While most enteroviral infections are mild and self-limiting, severe disease such as a viral sepsis syndrome, myocarditis, {{hepatitis}} and meningoencephalitis may occur. We present two cases of neonatal enteroviral myocarditis. Cardiorespiratory failure occurred in both cases, and severe shock refractory to conventional treatment required support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). One child with coxsackievirus B 3 myocarditis failed to recover and died after 3 weeks on ECMO, while one child could be decannulated successfully after 9 days of ECMO and recovered completely subsequently. In conclusion, <b>neonatal</b> <b>myocarditis</b> has a very high mortality, and ECMO should be considered early in neonates with rapid clinical and echocardiographic deterioration despite adequate inotropic support...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{heart failure}} in the early {{neonatal}} period is rare. Normally it is due to asphyxia, severe septicaemia, a congenital heart malformation or a viral myocarditis. Kawasaki disease (KD) {{as a cause of}} an <b>neonatal</b> <b>myocarditis</b> is not an established diagnosis. KD is a vasculitis of still unknown origin occurring predominantly in infants and preschool children. KD before the age of 3 months is rare. There are only few reports about KD in the 1 st month. We present a newborn who showed the cardiac symptoms of KD in the 1 st week of life with coronary dilatation and myocarditis. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of incomplete KD should be considered not only in infants but also in newborns with signs of myocarditis and coronary abnormalities. Therapy with gammaglobulins may prevent the sequelae of coronary involvement...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} child with {{myocardial}} necrosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and severe mitral valve (MV) regurgitation following <b>neonatal</b> enteroviral <b>myocarditis.</b> He underwent MV annuloplasty at 18 months and MV replacement at 3 years of age. He remains asymptomatic on medical therapy at 8 years of age. Mitral valve surgery may stabilize the evolution of dilated cardiomyopathy and delay the ultimate need for heart transplant...|$|R
40|$|<b>Neonatal</b> {{enterovirus}} <b>myocarditis</b> {{is a rare}} but serious {{infection that}} is often an underrecognized cause of cardiovascular collapse. Enterovirus myocarditis in patients with such collapse should be suspected when signs {{of congestive heart failure}} and tachyarrhythmia are present. The majority of reported electrical disturbances associated with enterovirus myocarditis are ventricular in origin, but the infection can present as atrial tachyarrhythmia. Atrial tachyarrhythmias associated with enterovirus myocarditis are difficult to manage because of their resistance to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy. We present 2 cases of neonates with atrial tachycardia associated with enterovirus myocarditis who responded to a combination of amiodarone and flecainide...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Human enteroviruses (EVs) and parechoviruses (HPeVs) {{belong to}} the family Picornaviridae. Although most EV and HPeV infections remain asymptomatic, both {{pathogens}} can cause {{a wide spectrum of}} clinical manifestations ranging from respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms to <b>myocarditis,</b> <b>neonatal</b> sepsis, and infections of the central nervous system. OBJECTIVES: Aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the spectrum of EVs and HPeVs in apparently healthy adults and children living in the South of Côte d'Ivoire. STUDY DESIGN: The study included 105 stool samples obtained from healthy individuals aged 0 - 53 years between June 2013 and December 2014 in the Sud-Como region of Côte d'Ivoire. After collection and shipment to Germany, the samples were analyzed by real-time PCR for the presence of EVs and HPeVs RNA. Molecular typing and virus isolation of all samples were performed. "é RESULTS: Out of 105 samples, 24 (22. 8...|$|R
