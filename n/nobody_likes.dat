500|$|In January 1991, {{following}} her departure from Automatic Dlamini, Harvey formed her own band with former bandmates Rob Ellis and Ian Oliver. Harvey decided {{to name the}} trio PJ Harvey after rejecting other names as [...] "nothing felt right at all or just suggested the wrong type of sound", and also {{to allow her to}} continue music as a solo artist. The trio consisted of Harvey on vocals and guitars, Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Oliver on bass. Oliver later departed to rejoin the still-active Automatic Dlamini. He was subsequently replaced with Steve Vaughan. The trio's [...] "disastrous" [...] debut performance was held at a skittle alley in Charmouth Village Hall in April 1991. Harvey later recounted the event saying: [...] "we started playing and I suppose there was about fifty people there, and during the first song we cleared the hall. There was only about two people left. And a woman came up to us, came up to my drummer, it was only a three piece, while we were playing and shouted at him 'Don't you realize <b>nobody</b> <b>likes</b> you!

One had the {{drunkard}} Grady's little girl come shivering to Dooley's door on a winter's night with a can to be filled with beer for her father. Dooley accompanies her home, and tries to beat some decency into the sodden Grady. Another, with Dooley's recollections of a long-ago Christmas in Roscommon, caused Dunne to be brought to tears by his own writing. In another, Dooley joins with Father Kelly, the parish priest, in getting relief for [...] "the man Carey down the street that <b>nobody</b> <b>likes,</b> him being a notorious infidel". Dooley and the priest gather provisions for the atheist, later getting him a job, and endure his speech against the Bible until Kelly cuts him off, [...] "What talk have ye? Go an' starve no more." [...] Although he applauded such acts of individual charity, Dunne through Dooley denigrated charitable organizations, wondering that [...] "a man can square himself with his conscience by giving one thousand dollars to a policeman and telling him to distribute it!

2500|$|In April 2014, The Washington Post {{reported}} that some federal judges holding low-level positions had been balking at sweeping requests {{by law enforcement}} for cellphone and other sensitive personal data.

Although some rulings were overturned, said the Post, their decisions have shaped when and how investigators can seize information detailing the locations, communications and online histories of Americans.

[...] " [...] is the evilest of the evil and one of the more intriguing characters in the roster ... he also manages to put a leash on Scorpion at some point." [...] Complex named Quan Chi second behind only Shang Tsung as the series' most brutal character: [...] "He's MK's root of all evil, having a hand in just about every villain's scheme." [...] Den of Geek rated Quan Chi 26th in their 2015 ranking of the franchise's 73 playable characters, calling him [...] "the true evil mastermind of the MK universe" [...] who [...] "suffers from the writers trying to make him a little too slick and smart for his own good." [...] In 2010, Game Informer named Quan Chi as a character they wanted for the reboot: [...] "Many of the characters introduced post-MK3 were forgettable, but Quan Chi stood out as one of the more interesting." [...] However, Nic Rowen of Destructoid gave a harsher opinion of the character: [...] "Quan Chi is a dark sorcerer shitbag that <b>nobody</b> <b>likes,</b> both in the fandom and in the series' narrative [...] unsuccessfully scheming behind the back of whatever master he is currently serving like an incompetent, bald Starscream." [...] Fans ranked Quan Chi as the 29th-best character in a 2013 online poll held by Dorkly that rated the entire Mortal Kombat roster, and eliminated him in the lower rounds in the annual [...] "Supreme Mortal Kombat Champion" [...] polls hosted by Mortal Kombat Online, losing to Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Jade, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Vallabhbhai Patel {{was one of}} {{the first}} Congress leaders to accept the {{partition}} of India as a solution to the rising Muslim separatist movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He had been outraged by Jinnah's Direct Action campaign, which had provoked communal violence across India and by the viceroy's vetoes of his home department's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality. Patel severely criticised the viceroy's induction of League ministers into the government, and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress approval. Although further outraged at the League's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government, he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims, and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu-Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences. The continuation of a divided and weak central government would in Patel's mind, result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence. Between the months of December 1946 and January 1947, Patel worked with civil servant V. P. Menon on the latter's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim-majority provinces. Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition. Patel, a fierce critic of Jinnah's demand that the Hindu-majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state, obtained the partition of those provinces, thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan. Patel's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public, which had tired of the League's tactics, but he was criticised by Gandhi, Nehru, secular Muslims and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so. When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947, Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over the perceived practical unworkability of any Congress-League coalition, the rising violence and the threat of civil war. At the All India Congress Committee meeting called to vote on the proposal, Patel said:I fully appreciate the fears of our brothers from [...] <b>Nobody</b> <b>likes</b> the division of India and my heart is heavy. But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts. We cannot give way to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid of one thing, that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste or prove unfruitful. My nine months in office has completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honorable exceptions, Muslim officials from the top down to the chaprasis (peons or servants) are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the Mission Plan would have blocked India's progress at every stage. Whether we like it or not, de facto Pakistan already exists in the Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances I would prefer a de jure Pakistan, which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 percent of India, which we can make strong with our own genius. The League can develop the rest of the country.Following Gandhi's denial but Congress' approval of the plan, Patel represented India on the Partition Council, where he oversaw the division of public assets, and selected the Indian council of ministers with Nehru. However, neither he nor any other Indian leader had foreseen the intense violence and population transfer that would take place with partition.|$|E
