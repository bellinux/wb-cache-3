40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of 229 'New Economy' firms offering broad-based stock options to that of their <b>non-stock</b> <b>option</b> counterparts. A simple comparison of these firms reveals that the former have higher shareholder returns, Tobin's "q" and new knowledge generation.

However, we do not find evidence that these plans result in superior growth in Tobin's "q" or new knowledge generation. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd/London School of Economics 2002. ...|$|E
