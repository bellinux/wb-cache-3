5|$|Somerset {{has a high}} {{indigenous}} British population, with 98.8% registering {{as white}} British and 92.4% of these as born in the United Kingdom. Chinese is the largest ethnic group, while the black minority ethnic proportion {{of the total population}} is 2.9%. Over 25% of Somerset's population is concentrated in Taunton, Bridgwater and Yeovil. The rest of the county is rural and sparsely populated. Over 9million tourist <b>nights</b> <b>are</b> spent in Somerset each year, which significantly increases the population at peak times.|$|E
5|$|To the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate {{conditions}} obtain. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures around 29°C (84°F) and nights around 12°C (54°F) with virtually full sun and clear nights. Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures around 41°C (106°F) and nights no lower than 29°C (84°F). In {{the weeks before}} the monsoon temperatures {{are similar to the}} above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with the monsoon. Temperatures are around 35°C (95°F) but humidity is very high; <b>nights</b> <b>are</b> around 27°C (81°F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.|$|E

5|$|In Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna {{are portrayed}} as icons of affection and {{intimate}} friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they are portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet {{and when they are}} thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon <b>nights</b> <b>are</b> discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse.|$|E

25|$|Two main Arabic {{manuscript}} {{traditions of}} the <b>Nights</b> <b>are</b> known: the Syrian and the Egyptian.

25|$|In {{spite of}} its name, The Maritimes has a humid {{continental}} climate of the warm-summer subtype. Especially in coastal Nova Scotia, differences between summers and winters are pretty narrow compared with most of Canada. The inland climate of New Brunswick is in stark contrast during winter, resembling more continental areas. Summers are somewhat tempered by the marine influence throughout the provinces, but due to the southerly parallels still remain similar to more continental areas further west. Yarmouth in Nova Scotia has significant marine influence to have a borderline oceanic microclimate, but winter <b>nights</b> <b>are</b> still cold even in all coastal areas. The northernmost areas of New Brunswick are only just above subarctic with very cold continental winters.|$|E
25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} and certainly most popular night of Selichot in the Ashkenazi tradition is the first night, when many women and girls as well as men and boys attend the late-night service on Saturday night. In some communities, the hazzan wears a kittel and sings elaborate melodies. In some congregations, {{it is not unusual for}} a choir to participate in this first night's service. In the Eastern Ashkenazic tradition, this night also has more Selichot than any other night prior to Rosh Hashanah eve. The other <b>nights</b> <b>are</b> more sparsely attended and those services are often led by a layperson, rather than a trained musician, and with melodies that are less elaborate than the first night.|$|E

25|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Erigavo {{features}} a mild {{version of the}} semi-arid climate. The city generally sees equable temperatures year round, {{with some of the}} mildest weather in all of Somaliland. Despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude, temperatures rarely exceed 30 degrees Celsius. <b>Nights</b> <b>are</b> frequently chilly, even during the summer season. This is a trait shared with very few places in the world; notable locations with similar climate are Sana'a in Yemen or Arequipa in Peru. The city receives on average under 400mm of precipitation annually. Average monthly temperatures range from 14.3 C in the month of December to 19.7 C in the month of July. Absolute minimum temperatures sometimes touch or cross zero degrees Celsius isotherm.|$|E
25|$|Stockholm's {{location}} {{just south}} of the 60th latitude means that the number of daylight hours is relatively small during winter— about six hours, while in June and the first half of July, the <b>nights</b> <b>are</b> relatively short, with about 18 hours of daylight. Around the Summer solstice the sun never reaches further below the horizon than 7.3 degrees. This gives the sky a bright blue colour in summer once the sun has set, because it does not get any darker than nautical twilight. Also, when looking straight up towards the zenith, few stars are visible after the sun has gone down. This is {{not to be confused with}} the midnight sun, which occurs north of the Arctic Circle, around 7 degrees farther north.|$|E

Similarly, reports of a country of perpetual snow and darkness (the country of the Hyperboreans) had reached the Mediterranean some centuries before. Pytheas is the first known scientific visitor and reporter of the Arctic, polar ice, and the Germanic tribes.

25|$|Although {{the first}} known {{translation}} into a European language only appeared in 1704, {{it is possible that}} the Nights began exerting its influence on Western culture much earlier. Christian writers in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced by Juan Manuel's story collection El Conde Lucanor and Ramón Llull's The Book of Beasts. Knowledge of the work, direct or indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with parallels in the <b>Nights</b> <b>are</b> found in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales (in The Squire's Tale the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and Boccaccio's Decameron. Echoes in Giovanni Sercambi's Novelle and Ariosto's Orlando furioso suggest that the story of Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known. Evidence also appears to show that the stories had spread to the Balkans and a translation of the Nights into Romanian existed by the 17th century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.|$|E
