40|$|Nowadays, the {{environmental}} concern in machining {{industry is a}} fact. Because of that, in this article a new cooling-lubrication system which combines CO 2 cryogenic and MQL technologies is presented. The aim of this new cooling-lubrication system is to offer an ecological and economic efficient alternative. Two nozzle adapters are proposed with different CO 2 outlets. The developed nozzles are Plug & Play and directly applicable to commercial MQL systems. The behaviors of nozzle adapters were simulated by CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and the optimal <b>nozzle</b> <b>adapter</b> was tested by milling Inconel 718 Â®. In these milling tests, the tool life was measured and using different main cooling-lubrication techniques: dry, wet, CO 2 stand alone, MQL stand alone and CO 2 +MQL (proposed alternative) Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|A {{confirming}} {{check was}} performed to verify that the fuel assembly structural integrity is not impacted by the TPBARs. The structural adequacy of Westinghouse fuel assembly design is evaluated using NRC requirements for combined seismic and LOCA loads per Appendix A to the SRP 4. 2 and the approved methodology (Reference 1). The grid load results for the fuel assembly design in Watts Bar Unit 1 were reviewed. Based on the combined seismic and LOCA grid load there is a sufficient amount of grid load margin. The total weight for 24 TPBARs plus the holddown assembly is approximately 62 lbs, which is approximately 4 % {{of the weight of}} a typical fuel assembly. Because the TPBAR assembly is a hanging structure supported by the top <b>nozzle</b> <b>adapter</b> plate of the fuel assembly and the rodlets are hanging in the guide thimble tubes, the added weight can be considered {{to be a part of}} the fuel assembly nozzle support. The added TPBAR assembly weight, together with the rodlet stiffness, has an insignificant effect on the fuel assembly's dynamic characteristics. Therefore, the design basis analyses/evaluations performed for the fuel assembly structural integrity assessment for Watts Bar remain applicable. Furthermore, it is concluded that the LOCA and seismic combined loads will not be affected for Watts Bar Unit 1 containing TPBARs...|$|E
40|$|The Solid Rocket Motor Air Flow Equipment (SRMAFTE) {{facility}} was constructed {{for the purpose}} of evaluating the internal propellant, insulation, and nozzle configurations of solid propellant rocket motor designs. This makes the characterization of the facility internal flow field very important in assuring that no facility induced flow field features exist which would corrupt the model related measurements. In order to verify the design and operation of the facility, a three-dimensional computational flow field analysis was performed on the facility checkout model setup. The checkout model measurement data, one-dimensional and three-dimensional estimates were compared, and the design and proper operation of the {{facility was}} verified. The proper operation of the metering <b>nozzles,</b> <b>adapter</b> chamber transition, model nozzle, and diffuser were verified. The one-dimensional and three-dimensional flow field estimates along with the available measurement data are compared...|$|R
40|$|The modular {{cladding}} system COAXn {{represents a}} flexible processing tool for laser cladding applications and guarantees {{a stable and}} controllable manufacturing process {{as well as the}} highest precision in material deposition. It consists of different powder <b>nozzle</b> bodies, tips, <b>adapters,</b> media supplies, and process monitoring devices, which are compatible among each other. Thus, for various lasers, optics, workpiece geometries, and cladding materials required by the user, an optimum unit can be composed easily. The basic nozzle is designed for a minimum focal length of the laser focusing optic of 70 mm and a rotation-symmetrical as well as rectangular power density distribution. Nozzle inclinations do not influence the powder supply, and even working in three-dimensional space with moving nozzle is possible without any effect on the powder stream. The minimum powder f ocus is about 1 mm, and the powder efficiency can amount to 90 % when the melt pool is larger than the powder spot. Experiences with up to 6 kW laser power even in long-time operation are there. A number of these cladding units has been est ablished for years in industrial applications of repair and surface protection of aeroengine parts, motor and turbine components as well as different moulds and tools...|$|R

A collimated laser beam is directed to an optical element (4) focusing the workpiece surface to be processed over the coupling module through the beam guiding module. A nozzle (7) with a discharge opening for laser beam and protective gas is present at the processing module. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The modular system for deposition welding on inner surfaces of workpieces with a laser beam (1), comprises a supply for powdered additive material, a supply for protective gas and a coolant, and a coupling module (2), a laser beam guiding module (5) and a processing module (6), which are connectable with one another. A collimated laser beam is directed to an optical element (4) focusing {{the surface of the}} workpiece to be processed over the coupling module through the laser beam guiding module. A nozzle (7) with a discharge opening for the laser beam and the protective gas and a channel with a discharge opening for the powdered additive material are present at the processing module, where the channel is aligned to the nozzle at an angle, so that the powdered additive material impinges {{on the surface of the}} workpiece to be processed in a focal spot of the laser beam. The discharge openings of the channel for the powdered additive material are arranged to each other at equal angle distances. The beam guiding module and the processing module are connectable with an extension module. The connections for the supply of protective gas, powdered additive material and coolant are present at the coupling module, extension module and/or beam guiding module and channels for powdered additive material are guided through the beam guiding module and the processing module, where the protective gas is guided to the discharge opening of the nozzle and the powdered additive material is guided up to the channels of the nozzle. An element reflecting the laser beam is present in the processing module, where the laser beam is deflected on the surface of the workpiece with the element over the discharge opening of the nozzle. The protective gas is disposed between the discharge opening of the nozzle and the reflecting element within the processing module, and is held in a retaining element, which is detachably connected with the processing module, using two frame elements that are pivoted around a rotating axis. The element focusing the laser beam is incorporated in the beam guiding module and/or the extension module. A focal length of the focusing element is changeable. The laser beam is focused with the reflecting element arranged in the processing module. A connection and a channel through the beam guiding module and the extension module are arranged to each channel for the additive material present in the processing module and the nozzle. A supporting element is arranged at the beam guiding module and/or extension module, and is formed by a rotatably mounted bead, roller or wheel. Nozzles or parts of the nozzle, with which the channels for the additive material are inclined at different angles, are exchangeably fastened at the processing module. The system is movable with the processing module and/or the workpiece relative to each other in two axes. The protective gas is directly guided into the beam guiding module, extension module or the processing module above or below the element focusing the laser beam. The protective gas is guided at the reflecting element in the processing module and through the discharge opening for the laser beam. A two-dimensional cross-table is arranged at the coupling module for the adjustment of the laser beam. The coolant is guided into the processing module through the channel over the beam guiding module for cooling the reflecting element and/or the nozzle. The rear side of the reflecting element is indirectly cooled with the coolant. The coolant is guided for cooling the <b>nozzle</b> in an <b>adapter</b> element at the processing module. USE - Modular system for deposition welding on inner surfaces of workpieces with a laser beam. ADVANTAGE - The modular system ensures precise, safe and simple deposition welding on the inner surfaces of the workpieces with high quality, high flexibility and high efficiency...|$|R
