5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a <b>nominal</b> <b>rate,</b> the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Is it {{important}} for central banks to set positive <b>nominal</b> interest <b>rates</b> {{and as a}} consequence make profits from printing money balances (seignorage) ? In a two period economy under entrepreneurial risk and credit frictions, optimal interest rate policy calls for setting positive <b>nominal</b> <b>rates.</b> Seignorage transfers provide insurance against idiosyncratic contingencies and credit frictions in the asset markets. In a finite horizon economy, optimal interest rate policy calls for higher <b>nominal</b> <b>rates</b> in the long-run and lower <b>nominal</b> <b>rates</b> in the short-run. Lastly, we investigate an alternative policy-money supply rules. Money supply rules imply a multiplicity of equilibria. We will construct economies where optimal allocations under interest rate rules are identical to optimal allocations under money supply rules. The same money supply rule that implied an allocation identical to the one with optimal interest rate rules can give another allocation that is far from the optimal allocation under interest rate rules. ...|$|R

How <b>nominal</b> interest <b>rates</b> rigidity would interact with the Fisher equation is simple, yet the implications are surprising. If <b>nominal</b> <b>rates</b> cannot catch up to real rates, the Fisher effect becomes inverted in the short term: big enough credit crunches bring deflation and central banks must lower interest rates to stimulate inflation. The paper shows that <b>nominal</b> interest <b>rates</b> rigidity is sufficient to characterize the little we know about inflation. It also shows that, unlike for other products, the pricing of loans is influenced by past negotiated loans, generating rigidity. ...|$|R
60|$|In a {{great number}} of cases, indeed, the man to whom they were {{accredited}} was a muleteer. These men hated the French with a hatred even more deep and deadly than that of other Spaniards, for, in addition to the national causes of hatred, their mules were constantly being requisitioned or seized by the troops and they themselves forced to accompany the army for long distances at a <b>nominal</b> <b>rate</b> of pay for themselves and their animals. Then, too, they were in close connection with the guerillas, for whom they carried goods up into the mountains from the towns, and when the chance came would leave their animals in the mountains and join in cutting off an enemy's convoy. They acted as messengers and spies too, and took their friends in the hills early news of intended movements of the enemy. Many a day had the boys traveled in the company of these muleteers, merry, careless fellows, singing and talking to their mules, apparently the best-natured of men, until something would be said which would recall the hated foe, and then their black eyes would flash, their fingers clutch their knife-handles, and they would pour out long strings of deep Spanish oaths. Great was the surprise of these men on receiving the password from two boys, but they never hesitated an instant in taking them in, in giving them hospitality as long as they remained, and in either accompanying them to the next town, or handing them over to the charge of some comrade going in that direction. Not even to them did the Scudamores ever betray that they were not what they were taken to be, two Spanish boys employed by the English commander as messengers. Often they were questioned how the English had come to entrust important communications to two boys, and their reply always was that their father and mother had fled to Portugal from the French, and were living there near the English lines, and that they had offered their lives in case of their sons' treachery.|$|E
60|$|The {{staple of}} their {{business}} was, however, the letting of bicycles on hire. It was a singular trade, obeying no known commercial or economic principles--indeed, no principles. There was a stock of ladies' and gentlemen's bicycles {{in a state of}} disrepair that passes description, and these, the hiring stock, were let to unexacting and reckless people, inexpert in the things of this world, at a <b>nominal</b> <b>rate</b> of one shilling for the first hour and sixpence per hour afterwards. But really there were no fixed prices, and insistent boys could get bicycles and the thrill of danger for an hour for so low a sum as threepence, provided they could convince Grubb that that was all they had. The saddle and handle-bar were then sketchily adjusted by Grubb, a deposit exacted, except in the case of familiar boys, the machine lubricated, and the adventurer started upon his career. Usually he or she came back, but at times, when the accident was serious, Bert or Grubb had to go out and fetch the machine home. Hire was always charged up to the hour of return to the shop and deducted from the deposit. It was rare that a bicycle started out from their hands in a state of pedantic efficiency. Romantic possibilities of accident lurked in the worn thread of the screw that adjusted the saddle, in the precarious pedals, in the loose-knit chain, in the handle-bars, above all in the brakes and tyres. Tappings and clankings and strange rhythmic creakings awoke as the intrepid hirer pedalled out into the country. Then perhaps the bell would jam or a brake fail to act on a hill; or the seat-pillar would get loose, and the saddle drop three or four inches with a disconcerting bump; or the loose and rattling chain would jump the cogs of the chain-wheel as the machine ran downhill, and so bring the mechanism to an abrupt and disastrous stop without at the same time arresting the forward momentum of the rider; or a tyre would bang, or sigh quietly, and give up the struggle for efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Seasonal {{fluctuations}} are {{as large}} as cyclical fluctuations. Monetary policy in the United States has dealt with seasonality by smoothing <b>nominal</b> <b>rates</b> of interest. The original motivation for this was that seasonality in <b>nominal</b> interest <b>rates</b> put recurring strain on the banking system. We build a model of monetary policy {{in the presence of}} seasonality that puts financial market conditions in the foreground. Our findings are as follows. Insulating <b>nominal</b> <b>rates</b> of interest or rates of inflation from seasonal variation are the basis for a formula for generating indeterminacy of equilibria and excess volatility. Preventing seasonality in the rate of monetary growth does not suffer from this problem. Moreover, under any method for conducting monetary policy, the setting of the target value of the monetary instrument will affect the degree of seasonal variability in most endogenous variables. This is a new channel by which monetary policy can have real effects. The case for eliminating seasonality in <b>nominal</b> <b>rates</b> of interest is strongest when seasonal impulses derive from shifts in money demand. It is weakest when seasonal impulses derive from the real sector. ...|$|R
