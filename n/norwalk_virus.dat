5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the <b>Norwalk</b> <b>virus.</b> This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} Vibrio vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the <b>Norwalk</b> <b>virus</b> and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the oyster farming industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
25|$|Noroviruses {{commonly}} {{isolated in}} cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups: genogroup I (GI) includes <b>Norwalk</b> <b>virus,</b> Desert Shield virus and Southampton virus; and II (GII), which includes Bristol virus, Lordsdale virus, Toronto virus, Mexico virus, Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{microbial}} water quality in canal waters throughout the Florida Keys, a survey was conducted to determine the concentration of microbial fecal indicators {{and the presence of}} human pathogenic microorganisms. A total of 19 sites, including 17 canal sites and 2 nearshore water sites, were assayed for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, coliphages, F-specific (F+) RNA coliphages, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and human enteric viruses (polioviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, hepatitis A <b>viruses,</b> <b>Norwalk</b> <b>viruses,</b> and small round-structured viruses). Numbers of coliforms ranged from < 1 to 1, 410, E. coli organisms from < 1 to 130, Clostridium spp. from < 1 to 520, and enterococci from < 1 to 800 CFU/ 100 ml of sample. Two sites were positive for coliphages, but no F+ phages were identified. The sites were ranked according to microbial water quality and compared to various water quality standards and guidelines. Seventy-nine percent of the sites were positive for the presence of enteroviruses by reverse transcriptase PCR (polioviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, and echoviruses). Sixty-three percent of the sites were positive for the presence of hepatitis A viruses. Ten percent of the sites were positive for the presence of <b>Norwalk</b> <b>viruses.</b> Ninety-five percent of the sites were positive for {{at least one of the}} virus groups. These results indicate that the canals and nearshore waters throughout the Florida Keys are being impacted by human fecal material carrying human enteric viruses through current wastewater treatment strategies such as septic tanks. Exposure to canal waters through recreation and work may be contributing to human health risks...|$|R
40|$|Forty-three stool {{samples from}} 27 human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -seropositive children and 38 samples from 38 HIV-negative children, collected during a 15 -month period, were examined for enteric viruses. Diagnostic assays included enzyme immunoassays for rotavirus, adenovirus, and Norwalk virus; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for picobirnavirus and atypical rotavirus; and PCR for astrovirus and enterovirus. Specimens from HIV-positive children {{were more likely than}} those of HIV-negative children to have enterovirus (56 versus 21 %; P 0. 5). No adenoviruses, picobirnaviruses, or <b>Norwalk</b> <b>viruses</b> were found. The rates of virus-associated diarrhea were similar among HIV-positive and HIV-negative children. Enteroviruses were excreted for up to 6 months in HIV-positive children; however, no evidence for prolonged excretion of poliovirus vaccine was observed. These results suggest that although infection with enterovirus and astrovirus may be frequent in HIV-infected children, enteric viruses are not associated with the diarrhea frequently suffered by these children...|$|R

40|$|The {{four major}} {{mechanisms}} of diarrhea are osmotic forces, secretory forces, exudation from a disrupted intestinal mucosa, and disturbed intestinal motility.

Most cases of travellers' diarrhea are caused by strains of Escherichia coli to which the traveller has little immunity. Most travellers who develop diarrhea benefit from treatment with diphenoxylate, loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate. The few patients who develop more severe, incapacitating diarrhea are candidates for treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Antibiotics should not be used to prevent travellers' diarrhea, because antibiotic resistance is becoming a problem...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a new procedure for concentration of enteric viruses from water using a negatively charged membrane. Rinsing the membrane with 0. 5 mM H 2 SO 4 (pH 3. 0) in order to elute cations prior to viral elution with 1 mM NaOH (pH 10. 5) promoted poliovirus recovery yields from 33 to 95 % when applied to pure water and 38 to 89 % when applied to natural seawater from Tokyo Bay, Japan, respectively. This method showed average recovery yields of spiked poliovirus of 62 % (n = 8) from 1 liter of artificial seawater. This method showed higher recovery yields (> 61 %) {{than that of the}} conventional method using positively charged membrane (6 %) when applied to seawater. This method is also free from beef extract elution, which has an inhibitory effect in the subsequent viral genome detection by reverse transcription-PCR. Naturally occurring <b>Norwalk</b> <b>viruses</b> from 2 liters of Tokyo Bay water in winter and infectious enteroviruses from 2 liters of recreational coastal seawater in summer were detected by using this viral concentration method...|$|R
40|$|This review {{addresses}} both {{historical and}} recent investigations into viral contamination of marine waters. With the relatively recent emergence of molecular biology-based assays, {{a number of}} investigations have shown that pathogenic viruses are prevalent in marine waters being impacted by sewage. Research has shown that this group of fecal-oral viral pathogens (enteroviruses, hepatitis A <b>viruses,</b> <b>Norwalk</b> <b>viruses,</b> reoviruses, adenoviruses, rotaviruses, etc.) can cause {{a broad range of}} asymptomatic to severe gastrointestinal, respiratory, and eye, nose, ear, and skin infections in people exposed through recreational use of the water. The viruses and the nucleic acid signature survive for an extended period in the marine environment. One of the primary concerns of public health officials is the relationship between the presence of pathogens and the recreational risk to human health in polluted marine environments. While {{a number of studies have}} attempted to address this issue, the relationship is still poorly understood. A contributing factor to our lack of progress in the field has been the lack of sensitive methods to detect the broad range of both bacterial and viral pathogens. The application of new and advanced molecular methods will continue to contribute to our current state of knowledge in this emerging and important field...|$|R

40|$|Sequence {{comparison}} of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of small round-structured viruses (SRSVs) from 10 recent U,K. outbreaks ofgastroenteritis revealed significant genetic variation.

The amino acid sequences of the RNA poly-merase, capsid and ORF 3 of these two viruses are relatively similar (about 92 %, 69 % and 72 % amino acid identity, respectively). A representative member of group II SRSVs, Bristol virus, was subjected to a detailed genetic analysis. Bristol virus is a recent antigenic type 2 isolate from a U. K. hospital outbreak of gastroenteritis. Using a single clinical sample the 3 '-terminal 3881 nucleotide cDNA sequence [excluding the poly(A) tail] of this virus was determined.
