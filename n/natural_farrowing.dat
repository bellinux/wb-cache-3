40|$|Microbial succession, {{composition}} and ecological distribution within the gastro-intestinal tract are critical {{areas of study}} since commensal bacteria {{have been shown to}} affect animal health and development. A series of experiments were conducted to determine whether altered microbial succession in neonatal animals would modulate the development and health of pigs later in life. An initial experiment in conventional pigs was conducted to establish the early postnatal microbial succession profile and to identify early colonizing bacterial species. Culture-independent analysis of digesta and mucosal microbiota showed distinct variation between the proximal and distal gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) indicating that fecal or distal gut profiles cannot be used to predict succession in the upper GIT. Temporally, Clostridium spp. were found to be most prevalent in the GIT microbiota of the neonatal pig up to 0. 5 d of age, accompanied by a high abundance of Escherichia and Shigella spp. These genera were transiently displaced by Streptococcus spp. followed by a preponderance of Lactobacillus spp. between 3 and 20 d of age. Subsequently, a “snatch-farrow” model was employed to modulate early postnatal microbial succession and investigate the effects on postweaning microbial composition. Pigs were collected into sterile towels directly from the vaginal canal and transferred to a sterile isolator environment for the first 4 days. Pigs were either inoculated with sow feces or not at 1 d of age resulting in significant differences in fecal microbial profile at 4 days of age, prior to removal from isolators. Analysis using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (TRFLP) of intestinal microbiota at 28 d of age did not show significant clustering or variation in diversity indices for either group during the 4 -d postnatal isolator phase. However, enumeration of selected taxa using quantitative PCR did indicate significant treatment differences in postweaning microbiota. Despite these results, this approach was rejected for further use as the protocol provided only moderate control of early postnatal colonization and variation and unpredictability of the timing of <b>natural</b> <b>farrowing</b> contributed to significant litter effects. Finally, a gnotobiotic monoassociation model was used investigate the effects of modulating early postnatal microbial succession on postweaning physiology, microbial {{composition and}} mucosal gene expression. Twenty-four cesarean-section derived piglets were monoassociated for the first 4 days of life with either L. mucosae (L), S. infantarius (S), C. perfringens (C) or E. coli (E). Pigs from treatments E and L animals showed the highest growth rate during the conventional rearing period (7 - 28 d of age). Monoassociation with different bacterial species during the first 4 d of life resulted in significant changes in postweaning microbial composition in small intestine and colon as assessed by quantitative PCR, although TRFLP did not identify unique clustering by treatment or variation in diversity. L. mucosae was the only inoculant species with significant variation, with a reduction in the colonic mucosa at 28 days of age. Monoassociation with L. mucosae was also associated with increased nutrition related gene expression in small intestine. Pigs monoassociated with E. coli had low expression of microbial sensing (TLR 2 and 4), NFkappaB complex genes and mucins at 28 d of age. This study clearly showed that controlled early microbial succession in neonatal pigs altered post-weaning commensal microbiota composition, postweaning physiology and host gene expression in small and large intestine. The findings suggest the importance of peri-natal management and feeding strategies in promoting postweaning health and performance...|$|E
