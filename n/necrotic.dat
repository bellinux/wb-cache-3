5|$|Caribbean sponges of {{the genus}} Aplysina suffer from Aplysina red band syndrome. This causes Aplysina to develop one or more rust-colored bands, {{sometimes}} with adjacent bands of <b>necrotic</b> tissue. These lesions may completely encircle branches of the sponge. The disease appears to be contagious and impacts approximately 10 percent of A. cauliformis on Bahamian reefs. The rust-colored bands are caused by a cyanobacterium, but it is unknown whether this organism actually causes the disease.|$|E
5|$|Four minor {{stages of}} OCD have been {{identified}} after trauma. These include revascularization and formation of granulation (scar) tissue, absorption of <b>necrotic</b> fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive arthritic deterioration.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} level of {{nutrient}} requirements, cabbage is prone to nutrient deficiencies, including boron, calcium, phosphorus and potassium. There are several physiological disorders that can affect the postharvest appearance of cabbage. Internal tip burn occurs when the margins of inside leaves turn brown, but the outer leaves look normal. <b>Necrotic</b> spot is where there are oval sunken spots a few millimeters across that are often grouped around the midrib. In pepper spot, tiny black spots occur on the areas between the veins, which can increase during storage.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue {{is replaced by}} scarring and cavities filled with caseous <b>necrotic</b> material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so can spread {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.|$|E
5|$|When a serpin {{inhibits}} {{a target}} protease, {{it forms a}} permanent complex, which needs to be disposed of. For extracellular serpins, the final serpin-enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation. One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which binds to inhibitory complexes made by antithrombin, PA1-1, and neuroserpin, causing cellular uptake. Similarly, the Drosophila serpin, <b>necrotic,</b> is degraded in the lysosome after being trafficked into the cell by the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (homologous to the mammalian LDL receptor family).|$|E
5|$|The {{most serious}} {{pathology}} discovered {{was in a}} series of five large tail vertebrae. The first two vertebrae showed only minor abnormalities {{with the exception of a}} large groove that extended along the left side of both bones. However, the next three vertebrae were completely fused together at many different points, forming a solid bony mass. There is no sign of any other vertebrae after the fifth in the series, indicating that the tail ended there prematurely. From the size of the last vertebrae, scientists judged that about ten vertebrae were lost. One explanation for this pathology is severe physical trauma resulting in the loss of the tail tip, followed by osteomyelitis (infection) of the last remaining vertebrae. Alternatively, the infection may have come first and led to the end of the tail becoming <b>necrotic</b> and falling off. This is the first example of tail truncation known in a non-avian theropod dinosaur.|$|E
5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens <b>necrotic</b> spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his quadriceps muscle to become <b>necrotic.</b> Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria, and so he has to remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E
25|$|<b>Necrotic</b> tissue {{should be}} removed in most {{pressure}} ulcers. The heel is an exception in many cases when the limb has an inadequate blood supply. <b>Necrotic</b> tissue is an ideal area for bacterial growth, which {{has the ability to}} greatly compromise wound healing. There are five ways to remove <b>necrotic</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|Activation-induced {{death of}} primary T-lymphocytes and other {{important}} constituents of the immune response are caspase-independent and <b>necrotic</b> by morphology; hence, current researchers have demonstrated that the occurrence of <b>necrotic</b> cell death can not only occur during pathological processes but also during normal processes such as tissue renewal, embryogenesis, and immune response.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after the}} initial cause of the {{necrosis}} has been halted, the <b>necrotic</b> tissue {{will remain in the}} body. The body's immune response to apoptosis, which involves the automatic breaking down and recycling of cellular material, is not triggered by <b>necrotic</b> cell death due to the apoptotic pathway being disabled.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of S. haemorrhoidalis {{may produce}} myiasis on <b>necrotic</b> or dead flesh.|$|E
25|$|<b>Necrotic</b> lesions {{are caused}} by {{invasion}} of blood vessels leading to thrombosis and infarcation. Though uncommon, cutaneous infections can become disseminated infections. Lesions extend into muscle, tendon, bone, and ultimately spread by the bloodstream to other organs. The brain {{is the most common}} site of secondary infection but <b>necrotic</b> lesions may also form in the spleen and heart.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{is diagnosed}} clinically but requires CT evaluation to differentiate mild acute pancreatitis from severe <b>necrotic</b> pancreatitis. Experienced clinicians {{were able to}} detect severe pancreatitis in approximately 34-39% of patients who later had imaging confirmed severe <b>necrotic</b> pancreatitis. Blood studies are used to identify organ failure, offer prognostic information, determine if fluid resuscitation is adequate, and if antibiotics are indicated.|$|E
25|$|Chemical debridement, or enzymatic debridement, {{is the use}} of {{prescribed}} {{enzymes that}} promote the removal of <b>necrotic</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{conditions}} are far more common {{and more likely to}} be the source of <b>necrotic</b> wounds, even in areas where brown recluse spiders actually occur. The most important of these is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacterium whose <b>necrotic</b> lesions are very similar to those induced by recluse bites, and which can be lethal if left untreated. Misdiagnosis of MRSA as spider bites is extremely common (nearly 30% of patients with MRSA reported that they initially suspected a spider bite), and can have fatal consequences.|$|E
25|$|The {{clearance}} {{of early}} apoptotic cells {{is an important}} function in multicellular organisms. It leads to a progression of the apoptosis process and finally to secondary necrosis of the cells if this ability is disturbed. <b>Necrotic</b> cells release nuclear fragments as potential autoantigens, as well as internal danger signals, inducing maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), since they have lost their membranes' integrity. Increased appearance of apoptotic cells also stimulates inefficient clearance. That leads to maturation of DCs and also to the presentation of intracellular antigens of late apoptotic or secondary <b>necrotic</b> cells, via MHC molecules.|$|E
25|$|Debridement, {{referring}} to the removal of dead tissue by surgical or non-surgical means, is the standard therapy for necrosis. Depending on {{the severity of the}} necrosis, this may range from removal of small patches of skin to complete amputation of affected limbs or organs. Chemical removal of <b>necrotic</b> tissue is another option in which enzymatic debriding agents, categorised as proteolytic, fibrinolytic or collagenases, are used to target the various components of dead tissue. In select cases, special maggot therapy using Lucilia sericata larvae has been employed to remove <b>necrotic</b> tissue and infection.|$|E
25|$|Encapsulated hematomas, {{encapsulated}} <b>necrotic</b> tissue (from {{an insect}} bite, foreign body, or other noxious mechanism), keloids (discrete overgrowths of scar tissue) and granulomas may also present as tumors.|$|E
25|$|Newer tests: Polymerase chain {{reactions}} {{involving the}} bacterial 16S rRNA have {{high rates of}} false positives because they can detect <b>necrotic</b> bacterial debris {{even in the absence}} of active infection.|$|E
25|$|CRP binds to the phosphocholine {{expressed}} on {{the surface}} of dead or dying cells and some bacteria. This activates the complement system, promoting phagocytosis by macrophages, which clears <b>necrotic</b> and apoptotic cells and bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} {{primarily}} an infection of subcutaneous fat, {{resulting in a}} focus of <b>necrotic</b> (dead) fat containing myriads of the mycobacteria in characteristic spherules formed within the dead fat cells. Skin ulceration is a secondary event.|$|E
25|$|Spider venoms work {{on one of}} two {{fundamental}} principles; they are either neurotoxic (attacking the nervous system) or <b>necrotic</b> (attacking tissues surrounding the bite). In some cases, the venom affects vital organs and systems. The venoms of the widow spiders, Brazilian wandering spider and Australian funnel-web are neurotoxic. Heart muscle damage is an unusual complication of widow venom {{that may lead to}} death. Pulmonary edema, which is fluid accumulation in the lungs, is a feared and potentially serious but uncommon complication of funnel-web venom. Recluse and South African sand spider venoms are <b>necrotic.</b> Recluse venom may also cause severe hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), though this is typically uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Maydl's hernia: two {{adjacent}} {{loops of}} small intestine are within a hernial sac {{with a tight}} neck. The intervening portion of bowel within the abdomen is deprived of its blood supply and eventually becomes <b>necrotic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bacteria may {{secondarily}} colonize the socket, {{and lead}} to further dissolution of the clot. Bacterial breakdown and fibrinolysis are widely accepted as a major contributing factors {{to the loss of}} the clot. Bone tissue is exposed to the oral environment, and a localized inflammatory reaction takes place in the adjacent marrow spaces. This localizes the inflammation to the walls of the socket, which become <b>necrotic.</b> The <b>necrotic</b> bone in the socket walls is slowly separated by osteoclasts and fragmentary sequestra may form. The bones of the jaws seem to have some evolutionary resistance to this process. When bone is exposed at other sites in the human body, this is a much more serious condition.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{applications}} of krill enzymes include products for treating <b>necrotic</b> tissue and as chemonucleolytic agents. Of the 376 krill-related patents {{that had been}} registered world-wide until 2002, 17% related to medical uses. Most of these medical patents had been registered after 1988.|$|E
25|$|Spider bites are {{commonly}} misdiagnosed. Unverified bite reports are frequent and likely represent many other conditions, both infectious and non-infectious, {{which can be}} confused with spider bites. Many of these conditions are far more common {{and more likely to}} be the source of <b>necrotic</b> wounds.|$|E
25|$|Myiasis is the {{infestation}} {{of living}} or <b>necrotic</b> tissue {{in a living}} host by fly larvae. Some flies may just lay their eggs in a festering wound, while other may infest unwounded tissue. C. cadaverina has occasionally been found in cases of myiasis but is not a fly that is regularly found. Myiasis is fairly uncommon in the United States, but tends to be very common {{in third world countries}} and can create a major problem with livestock, causing severe economic losses. Myiasis is different from maggot therapy in which physicians purposely use larvae of flies that feed on <b>necrotic</b> tissue in order to clean up a wound and aid healing. Maggot therapy can clean up a wound that has been festering for months very quickly.|$|E
25|$|A spider bite, {{also known}} as arachnidism, is an injury {{resulting}} from the bite of a spider. The effects of most bites are not serious. Most bites result in mild symptoms around {{the area of the}} bite. Rarely they may produce a <b>necrotic</b> skin wound or severe pain.|$|E
25|$|Thermal burns usually {{result from}} placing hot food or {{beverages}} in the mouth. This may occur {{in those who}} eat or drink before a local anesthetic has worn off. The normal painful sensation is absent and a burn may occur. Microwave ovens sometimes produce food which is cold externally and very hot internally, and {{this has led to}} a rise in the frequency of intra-oral thermal burns. Thermal food burns are usually on the palate or posterior buccal mucosa, and appear as zones of erythema and ulceration with <b>necrotic</b> epithelium peripherally. Electrical burns more commonly affect the oral commissure (corner of the mouth). The lesions are usually initially painless, charred and yellow with little bleeding. Swelling then develops and by the fourth day following the burn the area becomes <b>necrotic</b> and the epithelium sloughs off.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{debridement}}, or maggot debridement therapy, {{is the use}} {{of medical}} maggots to feed on <b>necrotic</b> tissue and therefore clean the wound of excess bacteria. Although this fell out of favor for many years, in January 2004, the FDA approved maggots as a live medical device.|$|E
25|$|If {{infection}} {{occurs at}} a late stage of plant development, plants {{are able to}} survive and generate fruits. However,the plant may appear stressed rather than wilted and may develop white interveinal areas that will develop into brown <b>necrotic</b> tissue. Often the seeds are infected as well.|$|E
25|$|The main medical {{concern with}} this species {{is that it}} causes {{accidental}} enteric, urinary, auricular, and urogenital myiasis. Myiasis is the infestation of animals or humans, where dipterous fly larvae feed on the host's <b>necrotic</b> or living tissue. This is prevalent in small children and bedridden adults living in unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptom of}} black pod disease is the <b>necrotic</b> lesion on the cocoa pod with brown or black color, which {{eventually}} enlarged {{to cover the}} whole pod. White mycelia growth on lesions that appeared several days after infection is the sign for the causal pathogen of black pod disease, which is Phytophthora spp.|$|E
25|$|Y. pestis bacilli {{can resist}} {{phagocytosis}} and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, {{the lymph nodes}} can haemorrhage and become swollen and <b>necrotic.</b> Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the {{hobo spider}} was {{considered}} to be a dangerous species based on a toxicology study on rabbits where lesions appeared after spiders were induced to bite the rabbits. This laboratory study has led to the proposal that {{in some parts of the}} U.S. nearly all bites attributed to the brown recluse spider are in reality the hobo spider's bite. The CDC and other U.S. government agencies have also used this same study as the basis for a report claiming that the hobo spider bite causes necrosis in humans, despite the absence of any confirmed cases. Subsequent attempts to replicate the study by injecting sufficient venom to ensure envenomation have failed to produce <b>necrotic</b> lesions, and there is even question as to whether the lesions observed in the original study were <b>necrotic.</b> The CDC no longer considers it a dangerously venomous species.|$|E
