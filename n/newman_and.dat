5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between <b>Newman</b> <b>and</b> Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at <b>Newman,</b> <b>and</b> travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on the natural environment, regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E

5|$|Although McMurtry's novel {{focuses on}} Lonnie Bannon, Ravetch and Frank {{expanded}} Hud's character to the lead role. Ritt wanted Hud {{to be an}} antihero who did not regret his actions {{at the end of}} the film.

Ravetch and Frank accompanied Ritt and Newman through pre-production, casting and publicity design.|$|E

When he inadvertently received a black eye while he was helping the team with their punting drills, his father had to talk his mother out of making him come back home.|$|E

5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. <b>Newman</b> <b>and</b> Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E
5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} <b>Newman</b> <b>and</b> Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which {{was signed by}} 12 {{painters}} and three sculptors, and addressed {{to the editor of}} the Tribune.

Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation, calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Francis Henry Taylor a philistine. Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 comments in the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, Veronica and {{her father}} Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{investigate}} more suspects {{in the murder of}} Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.), particularly his wife Mindy (Jaime Ray <b>Newman)</b> <b>and</b> her lover Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian). Both of them become particularly suspicious when they disappear, and Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes onshore. However, Veronica later deduces that teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan) committed the murder to frame Hank.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell Froude, was attacking the Church's move towards {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead {{a greater emphasis on}} Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided a serious challenge to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to Roman Catholicism. Although Froude was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on <b>Newman</b> <b>and</b> the Oxford Movement), he ultimately repudiated his beliefs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Newman</b> <b>and</b> Copland led {{the charge}} from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and {{advanced}} into the new town.

When their ammunition was expended their only option was to surrender. Not all the Commandos were captured; five men reached neutral Spain, from where they eventually returned to England.|$|E

5|$|Newman's {{great success}} at ABC had been {{noted by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation, whose {{executives}} were keen to revive their own drama department's fortunes {{in the face of}} fierce competition from ITV. In 1961 the BBC's Director of Television, Kenneth Adam, met with <b>Newman</b> <b>and</b> offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC. He accepted the position, eager for a new challenge, although he was forced by ABC to remain with them until the expiration of his contract in December 1962, after which he immediately began work with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} the second of two to deal {{directly}} {{with the death of}} Hearst's basketball coach, Tom Barry (Matt McKenzie).
