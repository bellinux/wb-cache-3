5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E

25|$|A primary {{appeal of}} telepharmacy is its {{potential}} to expand access to pharmacy care in smaller rural communities, some of which cannot support a full-time pharmacist or cannot easily recruit a pharmacist to reside in their region. Telepharmacy can potentially give patients in remote locations access to professional pharmacy care {{that could not be}} received locally, which can lower costs and improve patient safety through better patient counseling, drug administration monitoring, and compliance monitoring. Sharing of pharmacists between sites can also decrease costs in existing facilities, which might <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> employ a full-time pharmacist.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the actual}} process of cell death is precipitated by enzymes, {{apoptotic}} signals must cause regulatory proteins {{to initiate the}} apoptosis pathway. This step allows those signals to cause cell death, or the process to be stopped, should the cell <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> die. Several proteins are involved, but two main methods of regulation have been identified: the targeting of mitochondria functionality, or directly transducing the signal via adaptor proteins to the apoptotic mechanisms.

25|$|On June 17, 2009, {{the city}} council and WCSA came to an {{agreement}} on a new financing plan crafted by city CFO Natwar Gandhi. Under the plan, the city would loan Marriott $80 million in return for Marriott, Capstone, and Quadrangle raising their equity contribution to $320 million from $135 million. To obtain the additional equity money, ING Clarion Real Estate Investment was added as a new partner in the project. The higher equity participation meant that Marriott would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> seek private lending {{as part of the}} agreement—which meant construction could go forward without the long delay that would occur while seeking bank loans. The city's total contribution would be $267 million ($135 million in equity financing, $80 million in loans, and $52 million in WCSA bond refinancing), all to be raised by a joint city-WCSA bond issue.|$|E
25|$|Charles Fox Parham, an {{independent}} holiness evangelist who believed strongly in divine healing, {{was an important}} figure {{to the emergence of}} Pentecostalism as a distinct Christian movement. In 1900, he started a school near Topeka, Kansas, which he named Bethel Bible School. There he taught that speaking in tongues was the scriptural evidence for the reception of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. On January 1, 1901, after a watch night service, the students prayed for and received the baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. Parham received this same experience sometime later and began preaching it in all his services. Parham believed this was xenoglossia and that missionaries would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> study foreign languages. After 1901, Parham closed his Topeka school and began a four-year revival tour throughout Kansas and Missouri. He taught that the baptism with the Holy Spirit was a third experience, subsequent to conversion and sanctification. Sanctification cleansed the believer, but Spirit baptism empowered for service.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s, {{a branch}} {{was built to}} haul {{materials}} to construct the Outerbridge Crossing. The branch was built along the West Shore of Staten Island from the Richmond Valley station, and originally ended at Allentown Lane in Charleston at Allentown Lane, past the end of Drumgoole Boulevard. The branch was cut back south of the bridge after the bridge was completed. The Gulf Oil Corporation opened a dock and tank farm along the Arthur Kill in 1928 {{and in order to}} serve it, the Travis Branch was built south from Arlington Yard into the marshes of the island's western shore to Gulfport. At this time, the two branches along the West Shore were mapped to be joined together by the B. The West Shore Line, once completed, would have allowed for service to run between Arlington on the North Shore sub-division and Tottenville on the Perth Amboy sub-division. In addition, freight from the Perth Amboy sub-division would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be delayed be the congestion of Saint George Yard and by the frequent passenger service of the SIRT. This proposal was killed by the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|A common {{issue in}} {{previous}} Windows versions was that competing applications doing common tasks each tried to associate {{themselves as the}} default for a certain file type using their own custom user interface. The default application information for a particular file type was stored in the registry on a per-machine basis, resulting in applications changing another user's default program when one user's defaults were changed and each application querying several different registry values when launched. In Windows Vista onwards, file type associations and protocol handlers can be set on a per-user basis using the new Default Programs API, meaning default programs for file types and tasks can be different for each individual user. There is an API for calling a common user interface so applications <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> maintain their own file association UI. The Default Programs API gives applications a programmatic way to check for and discover other default applications, restore a single or all registered defaults, query for {{the owner of a}} specific default file association/protocol, launch the Default Programs UI for a specific application or clear all per user associations. Applications only need to registered at install time to be part of Default Programs.|$|E
25|$|During {{his first}} term as mayor, Brown quietly favored the {{demolition}} and abolition of the Transbay Terminal to accommodate the redevelopment of the site for market-rate housing. Centrally located at First and Mission Streets near the Financial District and South Beach, the terminal originally served as the San Francisco terminus for the electric commuter trains of the East Bay Electric Lines, the Key System of streetcars and the Sacramento Northern railroads which ran on the lower deck of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. Following the termination of streetcar service in 1958, the terminal has seen continuous service as a major bus facility for East Bay commuters; AC Transit buses transport riders from the terminal directly into neighborhoods throughout the inner East Bay. The terminal also serves passengers traveling to San Mateo County and the North Bay aboard SamTrans and Golden Gate Transit buses respectively, and to tourists arriving by bus motorcoach. Today, the terminal is being planned for redevelopment as a region wide mass transit hub maintaining the current bus services, but with a new tunnel that would extend the Caltrain commuter rail line from its current terminus at Fourth and Townsend Streets to the site. Once completed, Caltrain riders would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> transfer to Muni {{in order to reach}} the downtown financial district. Additionally, the heavy rail portion of the terminal would be designed to accommodate the planned High Speed Rail lines to Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|In the Pāli Canon, {{an enlightened}} person {{is said to}} be neutral in terms of karma, that is, the person no longer generates karma, merit, or demerit. Some {{scholars}} have interpreted this to mean that an enlightened person attains a state where distinctions between good and evil no longer exist. Other scholars have criticized this as making little sense, considering how the Buddha would normally emphasize ethics. The fact that an enlightened person is neutral in terms of karma, does not mean he is [...] neutral. Indeed, the Buddha is quoted in the Tipiṭaka as saying he is foremost in 'higher morality' (adhisīla). Keown attempts to overcome this problem by proposing that enlightened people are beyond the accumulative experience of good deeds (merit, puñña), since they are already perfected. They therefore do not need to accumulate goodness and the resulting happiness anymore. They <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> strive for a happy rebirth in the next life, because they have gone beyond rebirth. Their enlightenment is, however, an [...] perfection as well, though this is solely described as kusala, not as puñña.|$|E
