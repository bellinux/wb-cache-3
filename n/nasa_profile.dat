40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{is a tool}} that is commonly used in industry and academia. Engineers and scientists are sometimes apprehensive {{about the use of}} CFD due to inconsistencies and/or errors in results obtained with different software packages for the same flow cases. As a result, efforts are being made to ensure that there is uniformity among results of flow simulations produced by the computer programs. The current research makes a contribution to the verification of an open-source CFD toolbox known as OpenFOAM. In doing so, flow results for two benchmark flow cases obtained with OpenFOAM are compared with the results obtained with high-accuracy NASA CFD codes CFL 3 D and FUN 3 D. The benchmark cases are the zero pressure gradient boundary layer of flow over a flat plate and a two-dimensional bump in a channel. A number of flow <b>profiles</b> obtained with <b>NASA’s</b> definitions of “standard” versions of the Spalart-Allmaras, Shear Stress Transport, and k-ω turbulence models are compared with their CFL 3 D and FUN 3 D counterparts. A grid convergence study is performed to measure the change in the results as a function of element size, specifically for the finest meshes. The flows’ mean velocity, skin friction coefficient, and turbulent variable profiles obtained with OpenFOAM are in agreement with <b>NASA’s</b> <b>profiles</b> for both cases. The grid convergence studies show that the differences between OpenFOAM and NASA results are found to be of less than 5 % for all variables on the finest meshes in both benchmark cases. OpenFOAM’s capability to produce accurate results for the benchmark cases is confirmed. National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationMechanical EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|The sea-level {{estimation}} of satellite altimetry {{is affected by}} a sea-state related error, the so called electromagnetic (EM) bias. The ocean-wave troughs reflect the radar signals stronger than the crests, which then biases the altimeter mean sea level measurements towards the troughs. ^ In order to establish an EM bias correction algorithm based on those parameters available from the satellite platform, namely the significant wave height and the normalized radar cross section (NRCS), the University of Massachusetts (UMass) collaborated with the Goddard Space Flight Center of NASA in four airborne experiments: EM Bias Experiment (1989), Shelf Edge Exchange Processes Experiment (SEEP 1989), Surface Wave Dynamics Experiment (SWADE 1991), and Southern Ocean Wave Experiment (SOWEX 1992). All four employed the 5. 3 and 13. 6 GHz frequencies currently {{being used by the}} TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeters. The 5. 3 / 13. 6 GHz dual-frequency, nadir-looking scatterometer of UMass measured ocean surface NRCS by spatially resolving wave troughs and crests, while the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar and the 36 GHz Scanning Radar Altimeter of <b>NASA</b> <b>profiled</b> waves, and provided directional wave spectra. Sea state conditions were also derived from buoy recordings, primarily during the SWADE missions. ^ The first three experiments provided data for the prelaunch EM bias correction curves of the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeters, while SOWEX complemented the earlier data set with high-wind, high-wave-height measurements. The evaluation of the TOPEX/POSEIDON performance has found that the prelaunch curves slightly overestimate the bias at both frequencies, meanwhile they predict the bias difference at the two frequencies correctly. On-orbit data analysis, as well as the observations from SOWEX suggest that both the 5. 3 and 13. 6 GHz biases decrease for high winds, which fact was taken into account during the revision of the EM bias correction algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|As the {{dominant}} anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO 2), represents {{an important component}} of climate change (IPCC 2007). Owing to burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have increased over 110 parts-per-million by volume (ppmv) from 270 ppmv to 380 ppmv since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Understanding of the spatial distribution of the sources and sinks of atmospheric CO 2 is necessary not only to predict the future atmospheric abundances but also their effect on future climate. Although designed for deriving high precision temperature and moisture <b>profiles,</b> <b>NASA's</b> Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) IR measurements include broad vertical sensitivity (between 3 and 10 km) to atmospheric CO 2 variations. Coupled with AIRS' broad swath pattern and a technique referred to as ""cloud-clearing"" these measurements enable daily global spatial coverage. Nevertheless, AIRS' ability to determine the spatial distribution of carbon dioxide (CO 2) is strongly dependent on its ability to separate the radiative effects of CO 2 from temperature not to mention measurement uncertainties due to clouds and other geophysical variables such as moisture and ozone. This research presents a thorough investigation into the temporal and spatial scales that the AIRS can separate temperature (and other geophysical variables) from CO 2. Through our detailed understanding of the way satellites view the Earth's atmosphere, we have developed an algorithm capable of retrieving global middle-to-upper tropospheric CO 2 concentrations in all-weather conditions with total uncertainties ranging between 1 to 2 ppmv. From a radiative perspective, roughly equivalent to 30 mK to 60 mK, 1 to 2 ppmv, is an awesome feat for a space-borne sensor. Necessary for the remarkable performance of this algorithm, we developed methodologies capable of separating the radiative effect of CO 2 variability from temperature, improved the fast rapid transmittance algorithm for AIRS, and derived algorithm diagnostics that provide the case-dependent skill of AIRS algorithms for temperature and all other constituents (e. g. H 2 O, O 3, CO, CH 4, and CO 2) from theoretical considerations. As a result, the 1 to 2 ppmv uncertainties match extremely well with simulation; experiments performed before validation experiments had collected data and the retrieval algorithm was still in its infancy...|$|R

Graphite reinforced polyimide composites, PMR- 15 and PMR-II- 50, formed by sheet molding and pre-pregging will be surface treated, overlaid with a bond coat and then coated with WC-Co. The surface treatment will include cleaning, RF plasma or ultraviolet light- ozone etching, and deposition of SiO(x) groups. These surface treatments will be studied in order to investigate and improve adhesion and oxidation resistance. The following panels were provided by NASA-Glenn Research Center(NASA-GRC) : Eight compression molded PMR-II- 50; 6 x 6 x 0. 125 in. Two vacuum-bagged PMR-II- 50; 12 x 12 x 0. 125 in. Eight compression molded PMR- 15; 6 x 6 x 0. 125 in. One vacuum-bagged PMR- 15; 12 x 12 x 0. 125 in. All panels were made using a 12 x 12 in. T 650 - 35 8 HS (3 K-tow) graphite fabric. A diamond-wafering blade, with deionized water as a cutting fluid, was used to cut PMR-II- 50 and PMR- 15 panels into 1 x 1 in. pieces for surface tests. The panel edges exhibiting delamination were used for the preliminary surface preparation tests as these would be unsuitable for strength and erosion testing.

40|$|Steady {{increases}} in computing power have allowed for {{numerical weather prediction}} models to be initialized and run at high spatial resolution, permitting a transition from larger scale parameterizations {{of the effects of}} clouds and precipitation to the simulation of specific microphysical processes and hydrometeor size distributions. Although still relatively coarse in comparison to true cloud resolving models, these high resolution forecasts (on the order of 4 km or less) have demonstrated value in the prediction of severe storm mode and evolution and are being explored for use in winter weather events. Several single-moment bulk water microphysics schemes are available within the latest release of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model suite, including the NASA Goddard Cumulus Ensemble, which incorporate some assumptions in the size distribution of a small number of hydrometeor classes in order to predict their evolution, advection and precipitation within the forecast domain. Although many of these schemes produce similar forecasts of events on the synoptic scale, there are often significant details regarding precipitation and cloud cover, as well as the distribution of water mass among the constituent hydrometeor classes. Unfortunately, validating data for cloud resolving model simulations are sparse. Field campaigns require in-cloud measurements of hydrometeors from aircraft in coordination with extensive and coincident ground based measurements. Radar remote sensing is utilized to detect the spatial coverage and structure of precipitation. Here, two radar systems characterize the structure of winter precipitation for comparison to equivalent features within a forecast model: a 3 GHz, Weather Surveillance Radar- 1988 Doppler (WSR- 88 D) based in Omaha, Nebraska, and the 94 GHz <b>NASA</b> CloudSat Cloud <b>Profiling</b> Radar, a spaceborne instrument and member of the afternoon or "A-Train" of polar orbiting satellites tasked with cataloguing global cloud characteristics. Each system provides a unique perspective. The WSR- 88 D operates in a surveillance mode, sampling cloud volumes of Rayleigh scatterers where reflectivity is proportional to the sixth moment of the size distribution of equivalent spheres. The CloudSat radar provides enhanced sensitivity to smaller cloud ice crystals aloft, as well as consistent vertical profiles along each orbit. However, CloudSat reflectivity signatures are complicated somewhat by resonant Mie scattering effects and significant attenuation in the presence of cloud or rain water. Here, both radar systems are applied to a case of light to moderate snowfall within the warm frontal zone of a cold season, synoptic scale storm. Radars allow for an evaluation of the accuracy of a single-moment scheme in replicating precipitation structures, based on the bulk statistical properties of precipitation as suggested by reflectivity signatures...|$|R
