5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While {{it is true that}} in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E
25|$|In Venice stands San Marco's, {{one of the}} world's {{best known}} Byzantine-style churches, dating mainly from the 11th-century and {{decorated}} over many centuries but maintaining its centrally planned Byzantine form. It is called St Mark's Basilica, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> of basilical shape, but {{because it has been}} awarded that title. It has a Greek Cross plan, a large dome being surrounded by four somewhat smaller ones. Its decoration, both inside and out, is typical of the Byzantine period in its lavish use of mosaics and polychrome marble veneers.|$|E
500|$|Equitable tracing {{is based}} not on legal {{ownership}} but on the claimant's possession of an equitable interest. There are several advantages to equitable tracing; first, it can trace property now mixed with other property. In Boscawen v Bajwa, Millett justified this by saying that [...] "equity's power to charge a mixed fund with the repayment of trust moneys enables the claimant to follow the money, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> his, {{but because it is}} derived from a fund which is treated as if it were subject to a charge in his favour". A limitation is that where the property has been put into a bank account that no longer contains enough money to repay it, it cannot be traced.|$|E

Then I entered the hotel, and coming round the other side of him, saw his face in the sunlight. His face frightened me, as it did everyone; but <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> brutal, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> evil. On the contrary, <b>it</b> frightened me <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so beautiful, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so good." ...|$|R

50|$|Some sources {{claim that}} Lord Milner had removed the {{original}} monument <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> damaged, but <b>because</b> he {{was opposed to}} Dutch (and Afrikaans), and that the replica was built not by government but {{by a group of}} Afrikaners.|$|R
2500|$|The Government's {{contention}} that the district is subject to §5 under Sheffield <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "political subdivision" [...] {{but because it is}} a [...] "State" [...] is counterintuitive and similarly untenable after the 1982 amendments. [...] The Government's contrary interpretation has helped to render the bailout provision all but a nullity. Since 1982, only 17 jurisdictions—out of the more than 12,000 covered political subdivisions—have successfully bailed out of the Act. It is unlikely that Congress intended the provision to have such limited effect.|$|E
2500|$|Many have {{questioned}} the evolution of overt menstruation in humans and related species, speculating on what advantage there could be to losing blood associated with dismantling the endometrium, rather than absorbing it, as most mammals do. [...] Humans do, in fact, reabsorb {{about two-thirds of the}} endometrium each cycle. Strassmann asserts that overt menstruation occurs <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> beneficial in itself. [...] Rather, the fetal development of these species requires a more developed endometrium, one which is too thick to reabsorb completely. Strassman correlates species that have overt menstruation to those that have a large uterus relative to the adult female body size.|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{working in}} the Humboldtian {{tradition}} developed ideas that would become central in Boasian anthropology. Leopold von Ranke defined {{the task of the}} historian as [...] "merely to show as it actually was", which is a cornerstone of Boas's empiricism. Wilhelm Dilthey emphasized the centrality of [...] "understanding" [...] to human knowledge, and that the lived experience of an historian could provide a basis for an empathic understanding of the situation of an historical actor. For Boas, both values were well-expressed in a quote from Goethe: [...] "A single action or event is interesting, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> explainable, but because it is true." ...|$|E

25|$|In Scotland, {{which never}} {{manufactured}} its own stained glass but bought from the south, they {{lost much of}} their glass <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> smashed but <b>because</b> the monasteries were disbanded.

2500|$|The {{presence}} or absence of a guessing or pseudo-chance parameter is a major and sometimes controversial distinction. [...] The IRT approach includes a left asymptote parameter to account for guessing in multiple choice examinations, while the Rasch model does <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> assumed that guessing adds randomly distributed noise to the data. As the noise is randomly distributed, it is assumed that, provided sufficient items are tested, the rank-ordering of persons along the latent trait by raw score will not change, but will simply undergo a linear rescaling. [...] By contrast, three-parameter IRT achieves data-model fit by selecting a model that fits the data, at the expense of sacrificing specific objectivity.|$|E
2500|$|Both the Shurangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra {{describe}} the tathagatagarbha ("arahant womb") [...] as [...] "by nature brightly shining and pure," [...] and [...] "originally pure," [...] though [...] "enveloped in the garments of the skandhas, dhatus and ayatanas and soiled with the dirt of attachment, hatred, delusion and false imagining." [...] It {{is said to}} be [...] "naturally pure," [...] but it appears impure as it is stained by adventitious defilements. Thus the Lankavatara Sutra identifies the luminous mind of the Canon with the tathagatagarbha. (Some Gelug philosophers, in contrast to teachings in the Lankavatara Sutra, maintain that the [...] "purity" [...] of the tathagatagarbha is <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> originally or fundamentally pure, but because mental flaws can be removed — that is, like anything else, they are not part of an individual's fundamental essence. These thinkers thus refuse to turn epistemological insight about emptiness and Buddha-nature into an essentialist metaphysics.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Contact with [...] "waste" [...] {{is seen as}} a taboo and {{socially}} unacceptable in most developed countries, and freegans are often associated with stigmatized and racialized groups like the homeless or even compared to scavenging [...] "pest" [...] animals like raccoons. Some public health officials, like those in New York City, have explicitly discouraged dumpster diving for sanitation reasons and media coverage occasionally fixates on the [...] "ick" [...] factor of dumpster diving while (explicitly or implicitly) ignoring its political content. This discourse has been deployed more broadly to discredit anarchist movements by claiming they are unhygienic and thus dangerous. While some freegans argue that dumpster dived food is safe—noting it is usually thrown out because it cannot be profitably sold, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no longer edible—others embrace the [...] "dirtiness" [...] of recovered food as a symbolic rejection of capitalist norms. The group freegan.info has made the disgust attached to wasted food part of its messaging, arguing that social disapprobation should instead fall on those who throw out food, rather than those who recover it.|$|E
2500|$|Historian H. D. Kitto {{feels that}} Thucydides {{wrote about the}} Peloponnesian War <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most {{significant}} war in antiquity but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> caused the most suffering. Indeed, several passages of Thucydides' book are written [...] "with an intensity of feeling hardly exceeded by Sappho herself." ...|$|R

50|$|Tendring is the eponymous {{village and}} civil parish of the Tendring {{district}} of Essex — {{and before that}} of the Tendring Hundred. It gave {{its name to the}} larger groupings <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at the centre, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> significantly larger {{than any of the other}} settlements. The linear village straddles the B1035 connecting Manningtree with Thorpe-le-Soken.|$|R
2500|$|The {{infanticide}} objection {{points out}} that infants (indeed up to about one year of age, since it is only around then that they begin to outstrip the abilities of non-human animals) have only one of Warren's characteristics—consciousness—and hence {{would have to be}} accounted non-persons on her view; thus her view would permit not only abortion but infanticide. [...] Warren agrees that infants are non-persons (and so killing them is not strictly murder), but denies that infanticide is generally permissible. For, Warren claims, once a human being is born, {{there is no longer a}} conflict between it and the woman's rights, since the human being can be given up for adoption. Killing such a human being would be wrong, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a person, but because it would go against the desires of people willing to adopt the infant and to pay to keep the infant alive. (Although, this clarification has problems of its own: beef cattle, chickens, or any other livestock raised for meat--or indeed even some plants--have supporters who would pay to keep the animals alive. Thus, according to Warren, it must be wrong to kill animals, and perhaps even plants.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Richard Hosley {{suggested}} {{the main source}} for the play {{may have been the}} anonymous ballad [...] "A merry jeste of a shrewde and curst Wyfe, lapped in Morrelles Skin, for her good behauyour". The ballad {{tells the story of a}} marriage in which the husband must tame his headstrong wife. Like Shrew, the story features a family with two sisters, the younger of whom is seen as mild and desirable. However, in [...] "Merry Jest", the older sister is obdurate <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simply her nature, but because she has been raised by her shrewish mother to seek mastery over men. Ultimately, the couple return to the family house, where the now tamed woman lectures her sister on the merits of being an obedient wife. The taming in this version is much more physical than in Shakespeare; the shrew is beaten with birch rods until she bleeds, and is also wrapped in the flesh of a plough horse (the Morrelle of the title). [...] "Merry Jest" [...] was not unknown to earlier editors of the play, and had been dismissed as a source by A.R. Frey, W.C. Hazlitt, R. Warwick Bond and Frederick S. Boas. Modern editors also express doubt as to Hosley's argument.|$|E
