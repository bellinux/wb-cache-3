25|$|Brush {{discharge}} occurs from a <b>nonconductive</b> charged {{surface or}} highly charged <b>nonconductive</b> liquids. The energy {{is limited to}} roughly 4 millijoules. To be hazardous, the voltage involved must be above about 20 kilovolts, the surface polarity must be negative, a flammable atmosphere must be present {{at the point of}} discharge, and the discharge energy must be sufficient for ignition. Further, because surfaces have a maximum charge density, an area of at least 100cm2 has to be involved. This is not considered to be a hazard for dust clouds.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{carbon-based}} compounds like graphene {{have also}} been proposed. First identified in the nineteenth century, an easy method of producing graphene was not available until 2004. Being a particular form of carbon, graphene typically exists in its stable form of graphite, a widely used material in many applications – the lead in a mechanical pencil being an example. When a single monolayer of carbon atoms is extracted from <b>nonconductive</b> bulk graphite, electrical properties are observed contributing to semiconductor behavior, making it a viable substitute for silicon. More research {{will need to be}} performed, however, on sub 50nm graphene layers, as its resistivity value increases and thus electron mobility decreases.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{higher quality}} {{instruments}} {{are designed to}} prevent or reduce galvanic corrosion between any steel in the valves and springs, and the brass of the tubing. [...] This may {{take the form of}} desiccant design, to keep the valves dry, sacrificial zincs, replaceable valve cores and springs, plastic insulating washers, or <b>nonconductive</b> or noble materials for the valve cores and springs. Some instruments use several such features.|$|E

[...] The OOO couplings and specifications have long since been replaced by commercial N scale manufacturers.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "casting robot" [...] {{would use}} {{sculpting}} tools and templates to make plaster molds. Plaster {{was selected because}} the molds are easy to make, can make precise parts with good surface finishes, and the plaster can be easily recycled afterward using an oven to bake the water back out. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from <b>nonconductive</b> molten rock (basalt) or purified metals. A carbon dioxide laser cutting and welding system was also included.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of surface charge imbalance {{means that the}} objects will exhibit attractive or repulsive forces. This surface charge imbalance, which yields static electricity, can be generated by touching two differing surfaces together and then separating them due to the phenomena of contact electrification and the triboelectric effect. Rubbing two <b>nonconductive</b> objects generates {{a great amount of}} static electricity. This is not just the result of friction; two <b>nonconductive</b> surfaces can become charged by just being placed {{one on top of the}} other. Since most surfaces have a rough texture, it takes longer to achieve charging through contact than through rubbing. Rubbing objects together increases amount of adhesive contact between the two surfaces. Usually insulators, e.g., substances that do not conduct electricity, are good at both generating, and holding, a surface charge. [...] Some examples of these substances are rubber, plastic, glass, and pith. Conductive objects only rarely generate charge imbalance except, for example, when a metal surface is impacted by solid or liquid nonconductors. The charge that is transferred during contact electrification is stored on the surface of each object. Static electric generators, devices which produce very high voltage at very low current and used for classroom physics demonstrations, rely on this effect.|$|E
2500|$|Direct {{cortical}} {{electrical stimulation}} (DCES), {{also known as}} cortical stimulation mapping, is frequently performed in concurrence with ECoG recording for functional mapping of the cortex and identification of critical cortical structures. When using a crown configuration, a handheld wand bipolar stimulator may be used at any location along the electrode array. [...] However, when using a subdural strip, stimulation must be applied between pairs of adjacent electrodes due to the <b>nonconductive</b> material connecting the electrodes on the grid. [...] Electrical stimulating currents applied to the cortex are relatively low, between 2 and 4 mA for somatosensory stimulation, and near 15 mA for cognitive stimulation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nonconductive</b> {{specimens}} collect charge when scanned by {{the electron}} beam, {{and especially in}} secondary electron imaging mode, this causes scanning faults and other image artifacts. For conventional imaging in the SEM, specimens must be electrically conductive, {{at least at the}} surface, and electrically grounded to prevent the accumulation of electrostatic charge. Metal objects require little special preparation for SEM except for cleaning and conductively mounting to a specimen stub. [...] Non-conducting materials are usually coated with an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited on the sample either by low-vacuum sputter coating or by high-vacuum evaporation. Conductive materials in current use for specimen coating include gold, gold/palladium alloy, platinum, iridium, tungsten, chromium, osmium, and graphite. Coating with heavy metals may increase signal/noise ratio for samples of low atomic number (Z). The improvement arises because secondary electron emission for high-Z materials is enhanced.|$|E
2500|$|Newman et al. (2006) {{inserted}} conductive and non-conductive fibers into a collagen-TERP scaffold (collagen cross-linked with a terpolymer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm) [...] ). The fibers were embedded by tightly wrapping {{them on a}} {{small glass}} slide and sandwiching a collagen-TERP solution between it and another glass slide; spacers between the glass slides set the gel thickness to 800µm. The conductive fibers were carbon fiber and Kevlar, and the <b>nonconductive</b> fibers were nylon-6 and tungsten wire. Neurites extend in all directions in thick bundles on the carbon fiber; however with the other three fibers, neurites extended in fine web-like conformations. The neurites showed no directional growth on the carbon and Kevlar fibers, but they grew along the nylon-6 fibers {{and to some extent}} along the tungsten wire. The tungsten wire and nylon-6 fiber scaffolds had neurites grow into the gel near the fiber-gel interface in addition to growing along the surface. All fiber gels except Kevlar showed a significant increase in neurite extension compared to non-fiber gels. There was no difference in the neurite extension between the non-conductive and the conductive fibers.|$|E

50|$|For higher frequencies, {{inductors}} {{are made}} with cores of ferrite. Ferrite is a ceramic ferrimagnetic material that is <b>nonconductive,</b> so eddy currents cannot flow within it. The formulation of ferrite is xxFe2O4 where xx represents various metals. For inductor cores soft ferrites are used, which have low coercivity and thus low hysteresis losses. Another similar material is powdered iron cemented with a binder.|$|E

50|$|Aside {{from its}} use in the {{production}} of CRTs, Aquadag is used in many types of high-voltage lab apparatus where a conductive coating is needed on an insulating surface.
