5|$|Plasma is a {{state of}} matter in which an ionised gaseous {{substance}} becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter. This state can be contrasted with the other states: solid, liquid, and gas.

For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500hPa level, or 5.9km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5°C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% relative humidity, the required lapse rate is 9.8°C/km.|$|E

In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E

This results from meitnerium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.

For example, although oganesson {{is a member of}} group18 – the first synthetic element to be so – it may be significantly reactive, unlike all the other elements of that group (the noble gases). It was formerly thought to be a gas under <b>normal</b> <b>conditions</b> but is now predicted to be a solid due to relativistic effects.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Knee joint {{proprioception}} combines {{sensory input}} {{from a variety}} of afferent receptors that encompasses the sensations of joint position and motion. Poor proprioception is one of the risk factors of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Most studies have favored testing knee joint position sense in the sagittal plane and non-weight-bearing position. One of the most common mechanisms of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury is dynamic knee valgus. No study has measured joint position sense in a manner relevant to the mechanism of injury. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} measure knee joint position sense in the noncontact anterior cruciate liga-ment injury risk position and <b>normal</b> <b>condition.</b> [Subjects and Methods] Thirty healthy male athletes participated in the study. Joint position sense was evaluated by active reproduction of the anterior cruciate ligament injury risk position and <b>normal</b> <b>condition.</b> The dominant knees of subjects were tested. [Results] The results showed less accu-rate knee joint position sense in the noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury risk position rather than the <b>normal</b> <b>condition.</b> [Conclusion] The poorer joint position sense in non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury risk position compared with the <b>normal</b> <b>condition</b> may contribute to the increased incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury...|$|R

5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to be a solid under <b>normal</b> <b>conditions</b> and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.2g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61g/cm3. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough rutherfordium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for rutherfordium {{is expected}} to be around 150pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of fermium {{has only been}} studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under <b>normal</b> <b>conditions,</b> fermium exists in solution as the Fm3+ ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6 (pKa= 3.8). Fm3+ forms complexes {{with a wide variety}} of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually more stable than those of the preceding actinides. It also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be more stable than those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm3+ ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An3+ ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of fermium, and hence fermium would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal–ligand bonds.|$|E
5|$|Under <b>normal</b> <b>conditions</b> about 75% of {{the eggs}} hatch. Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions.

Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan for this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.|$|E

5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} give off a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers (Class D type).

5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, {{it is not}} {{surprising}} that their players dominated the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs at a much higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On the bowling front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were a large part of the success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. The bowling was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under <b>normal</b> <b>conditions.</b> As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E
