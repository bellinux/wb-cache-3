40|$|Objective(s) : To {{understand}} the role of mitochondrial respiration in cisplatin sensitivity, we have employed wild-type and mitochondrial DNA depleted Rho 0 yeast cells. Materials and Methods: Wild type and Rho 0 yeast cultured in fermentable and <b>non-fermentable</b> <b>sugar</b> containing media, were studied for their sensitivity against cisplatin by monitoring growth curves, oxygen consumption, pH changes in cytosol/mitochondrial compartments, reactive oxygen species production and respiratory control ratio. Results: Wild-type yeast grown on glycerol exhibited heightened sensitivity to cisplatin than yeast grown on glucose. Cisplatin (100 μM), although significantly reduced the growth of wild- type cells, only slightly altered {{the growth rate of}} Rho 0 cells. Cisplatin treatment decreased both pHcyt and pHmit to a similar extent without affecting the pH difference. Cisplatin dose-dependently increased the oxidative stress in wild-type, but not in respiration-deficient Rho 0 strain. Cisplatin decreased the respiratory control ratio. Conclusion: These results suggest that cisplatin toxicity is influenced by the respiratory capacity of the cells and the intracellular oxidative burden. Although cisplatin per se slightly decreased the respiration of yeast cells grown in glucose, it did not disturb the mitochondrial chemiosmotic gradient...|$|E

Enzymatic saccharification of alkaline pretreated OPEFB was done using different cellulase enzyme preparations. Crude cellulase cocktails from Trichoderma asperellum UPM 1 and Aspergillus fumigatus UPM 2 produced 8. 37 g/L reducing sugars with 0. 17 g/g yield. Production of bioethanol from OPEFB hydrolysate using Baker’s yeast produced approximately 0. 59 g/L ethanol, corresponding to 13. 8 % {{of the theoretical}} yield. High reducing sugars concentration in the final fermentation samples resulted from accumulation of <b>non-fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> such as xylose and cellobiose that were not consumed by the yeast.

40|$|Production {{of ethanol}} using {{cellulosic}} material as feedstock {{is crucial for}} sustainable fuel ethanol production. However a production process based on cellulosic biomass involves several energy and cost intensive steps like storage of biomass, pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation, where pretreatment is the energy intensive and troublesome step. This project aimed for an integration of storage and pretreatment step, to get more energy efficiency and more ethanol yield. In the present investigation wheat strawwas used as a model and was stored in moist conditions with different fungal species (Pichia anomala, Pichia stipitis, and Anthracophyllum discolor) inoculated separately in mini-silos for 1 month at 15 °C and 4 °C. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation was carried out afterthe storage period and ethanol yields were compared with dry wheat straw as a control. A 7. 52 % higher ethanol yield (compared to the dry wheat straw) was obtained from wheat straw incubated by P. anomala at 15 °C, and 6. 87 % higher ethanol yield from P. stipitis inoculated wheat straw incubated at 4 °C showed ISP can result in increasing the ethanol yield. Also it was obvious from the study that, the release of sugar from integrated storage and pretreatment (ISP) sample was faster than from the traditional sample. The higher concentration of <b>non-fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> (eg: xylose, arabinose, mannose etc.) left during fermentation of ISP samples indicate that the ISP process causes more structural damage to the cellulosic substances and produces more sugar release than the control. Moreover P. anomala and P. stipitis showed a biocontrol activity during moist storageby preventing growth of other fungi and enterobacteria in the wheat straw during the one month incubation. In conclusion, ISP acted as an efficient method of storage and resulted in higher ethanol yield...|$|R
40|$|Bioethanol {{produced}} from lignocellulosic materials {{is emerging as}} a promising alternative to fossil fuels. Fermentation of these substrates results in low yields due {{to the presence of}} inhibitory compounds and <b>non-fermentable</b> <b>sugars.</b> The main advantage of biomass bioconversion under HG (initial dry mater concentrations above 10 % w/w) or very high gravity (VHG, above 30 % w/w) conditions is the generation of high final ethanol concentrations (above 5 % v/v), decreasing the cost of the distillation step, which {{is considered one of the}} main constraints in the bioethanol industry. However, many challenges are associated with the increase in initial dry mater. With this the generation of inhibitors during the pre-treatment step is increased, which in turn dramatically reduces the fermentability of the material. In this project, the effects of nutrients on the fermentative performance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on toxic spruce hydrolysates were evaluated. Fermentations were performed with the addition of selected nutrients to evaluate their effects on inhibitor tolerance and fermentation rates. Yeast extract was found to have positive effects on the fermentation rate and biomass growth in comparison to other nutrients at fermentations in 78 % of hydrolysate. The effect was evaluated with smaller inoculum sizes, 1 and 0. 5 gL - 1. For 1 gL - 1 of initial cell dw, and less, the nutrient addition was crucial for biomass growth and ethanol formation. Cultivations performed with an initial cell density of 1 gL - 1 and with yeast extract supplementation resulted in an ethanol concentration of 19. 2 gL - 1. In comparison, the unsupplemented cultivation produced an ethanol concentration of 1. 5 gL - 1. The conversion of inhibitory compounds was also affected by the supplementation. At 1 gL - 1 of inoculums, HMF and furfural was not converted to less toxic compounds without the addition of yeast extract. The positive effects were found to be independent from the concentration starting at 0. 5 % w/v of yeast extract. The results were used for scaling-up experiments in bioreactors. In these controlled conditions the addition of yeast extract resulted in higher production rates and yields. Spruce hydrolysate was found to be fermentable at a concentration of 90 %. However, the high concentration resulted in lower ethanol yield. A yield of 0. 16 was reached after 36 hours for the fermentation at 90 % of hydrolysate, which is considerably lower than the theoretical yield of 0. 5. Fermentations at 80 % of hydrolysate reached yield of 0. 3...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the uptake of D-galacturonic acid into the yeast cell and the genetic engineering of a yeast strain containing the fungal genes for D-galacturonic acid catabolism. Bioethanol {{is considered a}} more sustainable alternative for transport fuels derived from fossil reserves. However, as it is produced nowadays, bioethanol is criticised because of its use of valuable food crops and fertile agricultural lands. Waste products from agriculture (e. g. corn stover, wheat straw, bagasse, beet pulp), paper industry, forestry and the cultivation of bioenergy crops, i. e. fast-growing trees or grasses {{have the potential to}} overcome this problem. Unfortunately, these feedstocks, named lignocellulose substrates, are difficult to convert into bioethanol in a commercially-viable way. The hydrolysis of lignocellulose substrates into monomeric or dimeric sugars, as well as the fermentation of the sugars by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are troublesome. S. cerevisiae can ferment only a certain range of sugars. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to the genetic engineering of yeast in order to obtain strains that can ferment xylose and arabinose, the most important <b>non-fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> in most lignocellulosic hydrolysates. The goal of this project was to explore the use of pectin-rich substrates for bioethanol production. This is an attractive alternative for the common lignocellulose feedstocks because none of the problems concerning hydrolysis or use of food crops and agricultural lands apply. Besides pectin-rich waste streams like sugar beet pulp and citrus pulp, we are particularly interested in the pectin-rich cactus Opuntia ficus-indica. This cactus has an established high productivity in large-scale plantations in semi-arid areas. The main problem here is that pectin is to a large extent composed of the sugar D-galacturonic acid, which cannot be fermented by yeast. In this study, we have tackled this issue by focussing on the uptake and the metabolisation of D-galacturonic acid by S. cerevisiae. While the uptake of D-galacturonic acid is well established in bacteria, there are no studies on D-galacturonic acid uptake in S. cerevisiae. In contrast to what has been suggested in the literature, we have shown that S. cerevisiae transports D-galacturonic acid at an unexpectedly high rate given its inability to metabolize this compound as a substrate. The uptake of D-galacturonic acid was strongly enhanced at low pH. The D-galacturonic acid uptake easily matches or even exceeds the uptake of non-metabolized compounds like arabinose or xylose in S. cerevisiae, especially at an extracellular pH of 4. 5  5, which is typical for bioethanol fermentations. Moreover, the uptake is not inhibited by any other sugar present in lignocellulose hydrolysates, which is an important advantage. The D-galacturonic acid uptake was subsequently further characterized. Despite the strong increase of the uptake at low pH, there is only modest inhibition by proton gradient uncouplers and no intracellular accumulation above the extracellular levels, which suggests that the uptake does not occur by H+-symport. Probably the strong pH effect is due to a preference of the uptake system for the undissociated D-galacturonic acid. pHi measurements show that the buffering capacity of the cytosol is high enough to fully counteract the dissociation of D-galacturonic acid inside the cell and supports our hypothesis. There was no saturation of the uptake rate at higher substrate concentrations, which prevented determination of a Km-value for the uptake. Because of the diffusion-like characteristics of the uptake and the hydrophilic nature of D-galacturonic acid, a channel-type uptake system appears to be most likely. In spite of many efforts, we were unable to identify the gene or genes that encode the transport system. None of the plasma membrane channel deletion strains, nor any of the other plasma membrane transporter single and multiple deletion strains tested, were deficient or even partially affected in D-galacturonic acid uptake. Several explanations are possible. The D-galacturonic acid transporter does not belong to the list of 200 genes that were examined or the transport system is encoded by multiple genes. The second part of this work was devoted to the construction of a laboratory yeast strain expressing the D-galacturonic acid degradation pathway from the fungus Trichoderma reesei. Four fungal genes were expressed from plasmids and the enzymatic activity was confirmed in the recombinant S. cerevisiae strain. Since the strain did not spontaneously grow on D-galacturonic acid, spontaneous mutants were selected after prolonged incubation in D-galacturonic acid medium and glycerol, which was added as source of reducing power. The first tests with these mutants were very promising, as we saw a clear improvement of the growth only when D-galacturonic and glycerol were present together in the medium. Unfortunately, the phenotype in two of the three mutants was found to be independent of the plasmids that we introduced. Futher analysis showed an enhanced glycerol consumption, but no D-galacturonic acid utilization. Hence, the mutants must have acquired a mutation that enhances the growth on glycerol. Surprisingly, D-galacturonic acid and - as we found later - also other organic acids like D-glucuronic acid and malic acid seem to stimulate the glycerol growth. It remains puzzling why the phenotype was plasmid dependent in one of the mutants. Microarray analysis and realtime PCR have shown that the mutants have an increased expression of the glycerol/H+-symporter STL 1, probably due to multiplication of an 18 kb-large subtelomeric region containing the STL 1 gene. Moreover, STL 1 expression and improved glycerol growth were correlated in segregants of a diploid of one of the mutants crossed with the parent. Our results indicate that Stl 1 is important for the growth on glycerol, especially at low glycerol concentration. However, mere overexpression of STL 1 was insufficient to restore the phenotype, which suggests additional mutations in the mutants. Finally, our results provide an important contribution to the development of genetically engineered yeast strains able to convert pectin hydrolysates into bioethanol, since they show that introduction of a heterologous D-galacturonic acid transporter may not be required. To obtain a D-galacturonic acid fermenting yeast strain, future investigations {{will have to deal with}} several challenges like the cofactor recycling and the metabolism of glycerol, an intermediate in the D-galacturonic acid pathway that is difficult to convert to ethanol in S. cerevisiae. Finally, interesting findings were obtained regarding the growth of yeast in glycerol medium, with possible applications in yeast production from glycerol, which is nowadays quite cheaply available as a by-product from biodiesel production.
