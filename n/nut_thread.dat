50|$|January 31, 2000: Flight 261, a McDonnell Douglas MD-83, {{plunged into}} the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu, California while {{preparing}} to attempt an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport en route from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and Seattle, killing all 88 people on board. In its final report, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined {{the cause of the}} accident to be failure of acme <b>nut</b> <b>threads,</b> which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the horizontal stabilizer's trim system. The failure of the acme <b>nut</b> <b>threads</b> happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly, which was the result of Alaska's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approval of those intervals. NTSB also found that the lack of a fail-safe mechanism for the failure of the acme <b>nut</b> <b>threads</b> on the MD-80 design contributed to the accident. This incident, along with an earlier ValuJet Flight 592 crash, led to closer FAA oversight of airline maintenance operations. The accident was also the subject of episode 5, season 1, of the documentary series, Mayday.|$|R
50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the <b>nut</b> <b>thread.</b> The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} requirements imposed to the modern mechanisms is economic feasibility. Therefore, considered as advanced are mechanical transducers of rotary motion to translational one, where rolling friction is mainly realized. They include planetary roller-screw mechanisms (PRSM). PRSM has a large variety of features. The design feature of PRSM is multiple starts of screw and <b>nut</b> <b>thread.</b> Rollers, as a rule, are made single-threaded. Number of screw thread starts which equals to a number of <b>nut</b> <b>thread</b> starts, has an effect on almost all performance characteristics of PRSM. This article covers comprehensively enough the influence of screw thread starts quantity on: kinematical parameters of PRSM, transfer function, mechanism radial dimensions, efficiency, power values, required characteristics of electric motor. As a result of investigations the graphs of dimensionless parameters vs. number of screw thread starts have been plotted, which are demonstrative and common. Being high enough the PRSM efficiency can vary within 20 … 25 % and more. It depends on a variety of mechanism part parameters; primarily on geometrical ones, as well as on a number of screw thread starts. Previously the methods of PRSM design calculation consisted in determination of the main geometric parameters of mechanism parts, then in determination of mechanism efficiency. At that, it was not always possible to design the economically feasible PRSM structure. Introduction of a dimensionless value – a relation of PRSM part thread pitch to average screw thread diameter – contributed to successive plotting of the assemblage of curves for relation of efficiency to the indicated ratio and a number of screw thread starts. By taking this assemblage of curves as a basis, the method of economically feasible PRSM structures calculation and design was proposed.   The essence of the developed method lies in that selection or definition of a number of screw thread starts helps to determine the relation of PRSM parts thread pitch to average diameter of screw thread which provides the maximum possible efficiency. Given further are check calculations confirming the operation capability of the selected PRSM design. </p...|$|E

5000|$|Later {{analysis}} {{estimated that}} 90% of the threads in the acme nut {{had previously been}} worn away, and that they stripped out during the accident flight while en route to San Francisco. Once the threads stripped out, the horizontal stabilizer assembly was then subjected to aerodynamic forces it was not designed to withstand, and finally, the overstressed stabilizer assembly failed completely. Based on the time since the last inspection of the jackscrew assembly, the NTSB determined that the <b>nut</b> <b>threads</b> had deteriorated at [...] per 1,000 flight‑hours, much faster than the expected wear of [...] per 1,000 flight‑hours. Over {{the course of the}} investigation, the NTSB considered a number of potential reasons for the substantial amount of deterioration of the <b>nut</b> <b>threads</b> on the acme screw, including the substitution by Alaska Airlines (with the approval of the aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas) of Aeroshell 33 grease instead of the previously approved lubricant, Mobilgrease 28. The use of Aeroshell 33 was found not to be a factor in this accident. Insufficient lubrication of the components was also considered as a reason for the wear. Examination of the jackscrew and acme nut revealed that no effective lubrication was present on these components {{at the time of the}} accident. Ultimately, the lack of lubrication and resultant excessive wear of the acme <b>nut</b> <b>threads</b> were determined to be the direct causes of the accident.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ballscrew drive {{mechanisms}} {{are widely used}} in the transmitting system of precision machine tools. The profile of the ball nut is a gothic curve combined by two equal radius arcs with offset centers. Most of gothic arc ball nuts are manufactured by form grinding, where the grinding wheel is shaped into the desired profile and the tool axis is tilted at the lead angle of the ball <b>nut</b> <b>thread.</b> In case of the internal ball nut grinding the high lead angle and long thread limits the manufacturing process. To avoid the collision between the internal surface of the workpiece and outer surface of the quill the optimal tilt angle is modified. The modified tilt angle affects to {{the profile of the}} formed grinding wheel. This paper presents a method for the generation of modified grinding wheel profile independently of the tilt angle. The desired profile points are generated by solid boolean operations with programming of a parametric CAD system...|$|E

Although stress analysis of threaded connectors has been performed since the early 1900 's, there are still areas that are not fully understood. The way in which eccentricity affects the fatigue performance and stress distribution is one such area, and is the main area of research described in this thesis. The techniques of photoelasticity and fatigue testing were used to determine the effect of eccentricity on the stresses and fatigue performance of bolts. The results show that eccentric loading has a significant effect on the fatigue performance, but that this effect can be quantified if the local stress amplitude is considered. The photoelastic analysis results show the eccentricity slightly increases the stress intensity factors at the crack tip. A number of two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element models were created to detennine the salient characteristics of the models. The models were validated against the resuh from the photoelastic analysis and the results agreed well. Accurate results can be obtained from a two-dimensional model, but the information obtained is limited unless many models are created. However, if a three-dimensional model is created more information can be obtained, but the <b>nut</b> <b>thread</b> run-out must be accurately modelled to obtain the correct stress distribution. The shape of cracks occurring in cyclically loaded steel bolts and the effect of crack shape on the stress distribution was also investigated. The photoelastic analysis of cracked bolts failed to predict the shapes of cracks occurring in cyclically loaded bolts. It is suggested that the inability of photoelasticity to model plasticity is the cause of this failure and this is supported by results from an elastic-plastic finite element model...|$|E
