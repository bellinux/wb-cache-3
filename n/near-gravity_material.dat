30|$|In this study, {{reprocessing}} of tailings {{from the}} Anjir Tange processing plant using a heavy media cyclone was investigated. Gravity separation tests by the heavy media cyclone and sink—float were performed in both industrial and laboratory scale for different size fractions. Finally, {{the efficiency of}} heavy media cyclone devices has been evaluated using by Tromp curves. The Tromp curve is an indicative of actual performance of the separation unit since it is independent of feed quality. In case of coal washing, the degree of misplacement is directly depended to the amount particles with a specific weight close to gravity of separation (<b>near-gravity</b> <b>material).</b> However, the coal containing high <b>near-gravity</b> <b>material</b> can be effectively processed by choosing the right process and correct operating parameters.|$|E
30|$|Pilot-scale testing {{sessions}} were {{conducted at the}} two private coal groups, Aryan Energy Pvt. Ltd. in Talcher and Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. in Jharsuguda, and at the Kargali Washery, Coal India Ltd. located in Bokaro, Jharkhand. The coals procured for evaluation at the Aryan Energy site were from two different seams, Balaram and Hingula, of the Mahanadi Coalfields. These coals have a relatively high feed ash and are generally difficult to wash due to high proportions of <b>near-gravity</b> <b>material</b> (NGM). Similarly, the coals received for assessment at the Bhushan Power & Steel complex were mixed of Mahanadi and IB-Valley coalfields. The facility process coals from multiple sources. At the Kargali Washery, the ROM coal received for evaluation was from three different coal seams of the Karanpura coalfields. These coals are also contains high ash with {{a high percentage of}} NGMs. For the coal samples evaluated, average feed ash contents were reported 48.7  %, 54.9  %, and 54.6  % on a dry-basis (db) for the Aryan, Bhushan, and Kargali facility, respectively. Typical surface moisture is ranged as low as 3  %– 7  % and as high as 13  %– 17  % during rainy season.|$|E
40|$|The spiral {{performed}} well in cleaning the coarse 8 x 16 mesh size fraction, {{as demonstrated by}} the Ep ranging from 0. 091 to 0. 177. This is in line with typical spiral performance. In addition, the presence of the coarser size fraction did not significantly affect spiral performance on the typical 16 x 100 mesh fraction, in which the Ep ranged from 0. 144 to 0. 250. Changes in solids concentration and flow rate did not show a clear correlation with spiral performance. However, for difficult-to-clean coals with high <b>near-gravity</b> <b>material,</b> such as this anthracite, a single-stage spiral cleaning such a wide size fraction {{may not be able to}} achieve the clean coal ash and yield specifications required. In the first place, while the performance of the spiral on the coarse 8 x 16 mesh fraction is good with regard to Ep, the cutpoints (SG 50 s) are high (1. 87 to 1. 92), which may result in a clean coal with a higher-than-desired ash content. And second, the combination of the spiral's higher overall cutpoint (1. 80) with the high near-gravity anthracite results in significant misplaced material that increases the clean coal ash error. In a case such as this, one solution may be to reclean the clean coal and middlings from the first-stage spiral in a second stage spiral...|$|E
40|$|Coal in {{the finer}} {{particle}} size ranges (below 1 mm) has always suffered from poor cleaning efficiencies. This {{problem has been}} exacerbated in recent years with the increased amount of high ash fines due to continuous mining machines and the mining of dirtier coal seams. In the present work, it is proposed to improve overall plant efficiencies by processing coarser coal in column flotation than is now commonly treated by that method. Column flotation for coarse coal is supported by actual lab and plant test data that result in a full-scale column plant installation. The fundamentals of coarse particle detachment from bubbles are reviewed and a new simplified model is developed which better handles cubical and rectangular coal particles. Much of the lower efficiency of fine coal cleaning is due to poor size separation of the fine-sized raw coal which results in misplaced high ash fines reporting to the coarser size streams. By sending coarser material to column flotation, the finest size separation {{that takes place in}} a plant can be as coarse as 0. 5 mm or greater. The proper use of wash water in a flotation column then becomes the best mechanism for desliming of the high ash clays. This work quantifies the benefits of removing the high ash fines from the plant product and increasing overall plant yield by increasing the amount of <b>near-gravity</b> coarse <b>material.</b> The resulting yield gain is greater than that obtained from only the increased fine coal recovery. Methods of column operation for improved coarse coal recovery are also evaluated. ii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Great appreciation is expressed to my advisor, Dr. Roe-Hoan Yoon, for his encouragement and guidance throughout the duration of this investigation.
