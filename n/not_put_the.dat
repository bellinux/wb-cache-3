5|$|After a few {{setbacks}} Max and Steph finally tie {{the knot}} {{in a ceremony}} initiated by Kieron Hobbs (Jake Hendriks). After the ceremony Max and O.B. leave everyone to enjoy the party while they slip away with Tom. When they are alone Max gives O.B. an engraved watch to say thanks for being his best man and his best mate, but when Niall drives away at speed he doesn't see Tom {{in the way of}} the car and Max jumps out in front of him to grab Tom, Niall did <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> brakes and carried on and crashed in to a wall after running over Max. O.B. rushed to Max's side and held him, soon after he died in O.B.'s arms and Steph arrived too late to say goodbye. Steph was overwhelmed with grief, and refused to leave her flat she shared with Max or wouldn't take off her wedding dress, until a visit from the priest helps her to face up to her responsibilities for Tom. Later at Max's will reading, Steph and Tom were left Max's entire estate.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes has {{sex with}} Dr. Paul Browning (Joe Thompson), who assumes {{she is a}} prostitute and pays her afterwards. Mercedes becomes a cleaner in a {{hospital}} along with Lynsey. Mercedes meets Doctor Browning {{at the hospital and}} he asks to keep seeing and paying Mercedes, which she agrees to. Mercedes convinces Lynsey to help a patient who is DNR. Lynsey is blamed for the incident and Mercedes discovers Doctor Browning had <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> patient's DNR request into their file.

This followed controversy over Latham's policy of withdrawing Australian troops from Iraq by the end of 2004. Beazley's return to the front bench was generally seen as a move by Latham to reassure Australian public opinion that a Labor government would <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> U.S.-Australian alliance at risk.|$|E

The cancellation of the orders was seriously considered, but Shell concluded {{that it was better}} to continue, mostly to <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> shipyard in a very difficult position by withdrawing such a huge, already initiated project (the work commitments were already well advanced, with extremely heavy cancellation charges).

25|$|The Arctic's {{native peoples}} still carry out {{subsistence}} hunting of belugas to obtain food and raw materials. This practice {{is a part}} of their culture, but doubts still remain whether the number of whales killed may be sustainable. The number of animals killed is about 200 to 550 in Alaska and around 1,000 in Canada. However, in areas such as Cook Inlet, Ungava Bay, and western Greenland, previous levels of commercial whaling have put the species in danger of extinction, and continued hunting by the native peoples may mean some populations will continue to decline. The Canadian sites are the focus of discussions between the local communities and the Canadian government, with the objective of permitting sustainable hunting that does <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> species at risk of extinction.|$|E
25|$|Oliver Cromwell laid siege to Clonmel in May 1650. The {{walls were}} {{eventually}} breached, but Hugh Dubh O'Neill, {{the commander of}} the town's garrison, inflicted heavy losses on the New Model Army when they tried to storm the breach. That night, O'Neill, deciding that further resistance was hopeless {{due to a lack of}} ammunition, led his soldiers and camp followers out of the town under cover of darkness. The story is told that Cromwell became suspicious of O'Neill's desperate situation when a silver bullet was discharged by the townspeople at his troops outside the walls. The following morning, 18 May 1650, mayor John White was able to surrender the town on good terms as Cromwell was still unaware of the garrison's escape just hours before. Although feeling deceived, he did <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants 'to the sword' as occurred elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Schlesinger's {{insistence on}} higher defense budgets, his {{disagreements}} {{within the administration}} and with Congress on this issue, and his differences with Secretary of State Kissinger all contributed to his dismissal from office by President Ford in November 1975. Schlesinger's legacy included {{the development of the}} close-air support aircraft the A-10, and the lightweight F-16 fighter. Kissinger strongly supported the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks process, while Schlesinger wanted assurances that arms control agreements would <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> United States in a strategic position inferior to the Soviet Union. The secretary's harsh criticism of some congressional leaders dismayed President Ford, who was more willing than Schlesinger to compromise on the Defense budget. On 2 November 1975, the president dismissed Schlesinger and made other important personnel changes. Kissinger lost his position as special assistant to the President for national security affairs but remained as secretary of state. Schlesinger left office on 19 November 1975, explaining his departure in terms of his budgetary differences with the White House.|$|E

25|$|When {{the ball}} crosses the {{sideline}} during general play a line-out is formed {{with the team}} that did <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> ball into touch throwing it in, unless it was kicked into touch from a penalty kick, {{in which case the}} team kicking to touch throws in. If the ball is kicked directly (does not bounce first) over the sideline by a team member who is outside his 22-metre line, the line-out is formed on the sideline perpendicular to where that player kicked it. The same rule applies if the ball is moved (passed, knocked, kicked or run) back inside the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker. Once a tackle, scrum, line-out, ruck or maul occurs inside the 22 or the ball is moved there by the opposition a player can kick it directly into touch with the line-out forming where the ball crossed the sideline. If the ball bounces before crossing the sideline or is carried across by a player the line-out is formed where the ball crossed the line. However, a line-out can never take place within five metres of the ingoal area, and is always moved back to a mark five metres out.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, within days Nimitz was in touch with all Navy Department bureaus asking them to assess their needs for an equivalent to the WAAC. With few exceptions, the responses were negative. Yet, Congressional inquiries continued to increase about the Navy's plan for women.|$|E

[...] Cornell did <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth".

Purchase, Montagu and Cholmondeley could <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> boots on, so an electric fire was located and the feet defrosted enough to put the boots on properly. The pocket litter was placed on the body, and the briefcase attached. The body was placed in the canister, which was filled with [...] of dry ice and sealed up. When the dry ice sublimated, it filled the canister with carbon dioxide and drove out any oxygen, thus preserving the body without refrigeration. The canister was placed in the 1937 Fordson van of an MI5 driver St. John [...] "Jock" [...] Horsfall, who had been a racing champion before the war. Cholmondeley and Montagu travelled {{in the back of the}} van, which drove through the night to Greenock, west Scotland, where the canister was taken on board the submarine [...] Seraphs commander, Lt.

500|$|Hitler {{immediately}} {{turned to}} the Luftwaffe to help blunt the offensive. At this point, its close support corps was deployed in the Crimea, {{taking part in the}} siege of Sevastopol. 8th Air Corps under the command of Wolfram von Richthofen was initially ordered to deploy to Kharkov from the Crimea, but the command was rescinded. In an unusual move, Hitler kept it in the Crimea, but did <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> corps under the command of Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4), which already contained 6th Air Corps, under the command of General Kurt Pflugbeil, and Fliegerführer Süd (Flying Command South), a small anti-shipping command based in the Crimea. Instead, he allowed Richthofen to take charge of all operations over Sevastopol. The siege in the Crimea was not over, and the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula had not yet been won. Still, Hitler was pleased with the progress there and content to keep Richthofen where he was and withdraw air support from Fliegerkorps VIII in order to prevent a Soviet breakthrough at Kharkov. The use of the Luftwaffe to compensate for the German Army's lack of firepower suggested that the OKW saw the Luftwaffe primarily as a ground support arm. This angered Richthofen who complained that the Luftwaffe was treated as [...] "the army's whore". Now that he was not being redeployed to Kharkov, Richthofen also complained about the withdrawal of his units to the region, arguing that the Kerch and Sevastopol battles were ongoing and owing to the transfer of aerial assets to Kharkov, victory in the Crimea was no longer guaranteed. In reality, the Soviet units at Kerch were already routed and the Axis position at Sevastopol was comfortable.|$|E
