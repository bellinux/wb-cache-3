However Masucci did not play. Masucci scored 9 goals in 2007-08 season. As Masucci sometimes wore no.7 before the team had a fix number in 2008 (but also wore no.11), Masucci sometimes incorrectly known as midfielder, as the line-up in the news usually listed players in alphabetical order (from 1 to 11) or according to position (from keeper, defender, midfielder to forward). Masucci also wore no.7 shirt since the team had a fix <b>number</b> in <b>Serie</b> B.|$|R

5000|$|At age eight, Marrone {{joined the}} Juventus youth system {{and made his}} way through the ranks of the youth sector all the way through to the Primavera (under-20) youth squad for the 2007-08 season.

In September 2013, then-manager Martin Jol stated that Trotta is not [...] "the finished article yet" [...] and challenged him to [...] "step up a gear and then maybe he can play for Fulham {{in the next couple}} of years". In January 2014, Trotta was the subject of loan attention from a <b>number</b> of Italian <b>Serie</b> B sides. After returning to Craven Cottage on 4 May from his loan away from the club, new manager Felix Magath cast his eye over Trotta in training prior to the final Premier League match of the season against Crystal Palace, but the Italian failed to make the squad. With the Cottagers playing in the Championship for the 2014/15 season, it was reported on 13 May that Trotta was keen to sit down for talks with Magath over his future. The talks were subsequently postponed until June, casting further doubts over Trotta's future. Those doubts were confirmed when Trotta submitted a transfer request on 3 June. Trotta failed to receive a first team call under Magath or his successor Kit Symons and departed Craven Cottage on 9 January 2015. He made just three senior appearances in five years at Craven Cottage.|$|R
