A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny." [...] It {{is the second time}} that Carey and Bieber have collaborated, the first being when the two re-recorded Carey's 1994 song [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] for Bieber's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe.|$|E

In a recent interview, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie was such a wonderful character and the show was watched by so many people, especially the murder of Den, that it opened up doors that I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would.</b> I had some fantastic offers when I left, there was film and theatre... it was wonderful for me; EastEnders {{is a very good}} calling card." [...] Oberman has also recently declared her willingness to return to the part of Chrissie and EastEnders, even if only to provide a resolution for the character.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, young brothers Pablo, Nacho and Victor Ruiz had their first contact with computers. In the case of Victor Ruiz, he started with a Sinclair ZX81, creating some amateur self made games. On their first attempt as a company, they created NCM, which would later become Dinamic. Their original idea was simply to create a team of programmers, they <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> start such an intense commercial activity.|$|R

2500|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. [...] "It was really great that in taking the movie, because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny." [...] Initially, Lords had a topless scene in the movie, but refused since she would breastfeed in between the takes. Katie Morgan, another former pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.|$|E

The song has been a regular in Europe concerts ever since its live debut on the premiere of the band's Final Countdown Tour on 29 April 1986 in Gävle, Sweden and arguably became the band's most recognizable and popular song. One of the most memorable performances of the song took place in Stockholm, Sweden on 31 December 1999, as part of the Millennium celebrations.|$|E

English music journalist Paul Morley would later recollect: [...] "Ian didn't just kill himself and it all just disintegrated {{and the whole thing}} fell apart; the group just picked themselves up and kept going which was extraordinary.

60|$|Fanny, perhaps, had a {{right to}} be indignant, for {{certainly}} Mr. Saul had given her no fair warning of his intention. Mary had for some months been intent rather on Mr. Fielding's church matters than on those going on in her own parish, and therefore there had been nothing singular in the fact that Mr. Saul had said more on such matters to Fanny than to her sister. Fanny was eager and active, and as Mr. Saul was very eager and very active, it was natural that they should have had some interests in common. But there had been no private walkings, and no talkings that could properly be called private. There was a certain book which Fanny kept, containing the names of all the poor people in the parish, to which Mr. Saul had access equally with herself; but its contents were of a most prosaic nature, and when she had sat over it in the rectory drawing-room, with Mr. Saul by her side, striving to extract more than twelve pennies out of charity shillings, she had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> lead to a declaration of love.|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeRetail tobacco {{access is}} an {{important}} determinant of youth smoking prevalence. This study examines perceptions of ease in obtaining cigarettes and how prevalence of self-reported retail tobacco access among youth smokers varies by province in Canada. Additionally, relevant retail experiences, such as being asked for identification by a store clerk, are described. MethodsData from grades 9 – 12 {{students who participated in}} the 2010 / 2011 Youth Smoking Survey, a nationally generalizable sample of Canadian students (n= 31396) were used to examine retail tobacco access and related experiences. Logistic regression models were used to examine differences in retail tobacco access and retail tobacco experiences by sociodemographic and regional characteristics. Results 79 % of students who <b>never</b> smoked <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easy to get cigarettes. About one-quarter of smokers reported usually buying cigarettes from stores, and the percent of student smokers usually buying cigarettes in stores ranged from 16 % in British Columbia to 36 % in Quebec. Compared to grade 9 students, grade 12 students had higher odds of report being asked for identification (OR= 6. 3, 95 % CI 1. 9 – 21. 5). ConclusionsRetail tobacco access appears to be a significant source of cigarette access among Canadian youth. Retail tobacco access varies significantly by province, which suggests provincial policies should be strengthened...|$|R
50|$|It was {{expected}} that the squadron's stay at Autreville would be no longer than the time necessary to draw supplies and get filled up with pilots and observers. At {{the time it was}} realized that a shortage of pilots and observers existed but <b>it</b> was <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take six weeks to get them ten of each. There were at this time about six squadrons in the neighborhood of Colombey-les-Belles waiting for their flyers.

They were equipped with radio and guns, etc., {{and as far as the}} airplanes went the squadron was ready for work on the front about 1 October 1918, but as to flying personnel there was only one complete team assigned, one pilot and one observer. At this place all supplies were drawn, including radio equipment, armament, spare parts, etc., but as to transportation <b>it</b> was not <b>thought</b> necessary. One truck was placed at the disposal of the squadron for about six hours a day to draw all the material from Colombey-les Belles. Since all of the radio equipment was new and untried many radio tests from the air were made at Autreville and others were made later.|$|R

60|$|Our heroine {{received}} this intelligence with the mingled sensations of apprehension, delight, misgivings, and joy, {{that are so}} apt to beset the female heart, in the freshness of its affections, when once brought in subjection to the master-passion. She had <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> possible Luis <b>would</b> sail on an expedition like that {{in which he was}} engaged, without endeavoring to see her alone; but, now she was assured that both the queen and her guardian acquiesced in his being admitted, she almost regretted their compliance. These contradictory emotions, however, soon subsided in the tender melancholy that gradually drew around her manner, as the hour for the departure approached. Nor were her feelings on the subject of Luis' ready enlistment in the expedition, more consistent. At times she exulted in her lover's resolution, and in his manly devotion to glory and the good of the church; remembering with pride that, of all the high nobility of Castile, he alone ventured life and credit with the Genoese; and then, again, tormenting doubts came over her, as she feared that the love of roving, and of adventure, was quite as active in his heart, as love of herself. But in all this there was nothing new. The more pure and ingenuous the feelings of those who truly submit to the influence of this passion, the more keenly alive are their distrusts apt to be, and the more tormenting their misgivings of themselves.|$|R
