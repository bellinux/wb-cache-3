5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being done {{at the same point}} in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> display.|$|E

Despite Priestley's reduced scientific output, his presence stimulated American interest in chemistry.|$|E

5|$|A replica Arrow {{built by}} Allan Jackson {{was used in}} The Arrow, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began {{building}} a full-scale replica of the Arrow in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica {{could be used for}} the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> public display.|$|E

5|$|The allies invaded Paraguay in April 1866, {{but after}} initial success, their advance {{was blocked by}} fortifications at Humaitá and along the Paraguay River. Porto Alegre had {{remained}} behind, leading the 2nd Corps and guarding Rio Grande do Sul. Mitre, <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> Brazilian territory and acknowledged as the allied commander-in-chief, planned to use Porto Alegre's army to march through Paraguayan territory from the rear to surround Humaitá. As {{a result of a}} suggestion by Tamandaré—though Mitre had not issued orders for the move—Porto Alegre boarded his army onto Brazilian ships and instead brought them up to the positions occupied by the other allied troops.|$|E

5|$|The aquarium's {{attempts}} to display captive white sharks ended in 2011 {{due to the}} project's high resource intensity. Captive white sharks also incurred injuries and killed other animals in the exhibit after becoming increasingly aggressive, and the final shark died due to unknown reasons following its release. Although <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> exhibit for the public, aquarium scientists have continued to conduct research on white sharks. Collaborating with Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in June 2016, aquarium scientists created cameras attached to harmless dorsal fin tags {{in an attempt to}} study the behavior of white sharks during their gathering known as the White Shark Café.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{dropped the}} word streek (regional) from its name and now calls itself Museum de Oude Wolden (Museum the Old Wolds).

In 2017, the museum became an independent foundation, although the municipality of Bellingwedde still owns {{the building and}} the collection.|$|E
5|$|A {{study with}} an intent-to-treat {{prospective}} design {{was published in}} 1998 by a team from the Johns Hopkins Hospital and followed-up by a report published in 2001. As with most studies of the ketogenic diet, there was no control group (patients who did not receive the treatment). The study enrolled 150 children. After three months, 83% of them {{were still on the}} diet, 26% had experienced a good reduction in seizures, 31% had had an excellent reduction and 3% were seizure-free. At twelve months, 55% were still on the diet, 23% had a good response, 20% had an excellent response and 7% were seizure-free. Those who had discontinued the diet by this stage did so because it was ineffective, too restrictive or due to illness, and most of those who remained were benefiting from it. The percentage of those still on the diet at two, three and four years was 39%, 20% and 12% respectively. During this period the most common reason for discontinuing the diet was because the children had become seizure-free or significantly better. At four years, 16% of the original 150 children had a good reduction in seizure frequency, 14% had an excellent reduction and 13% were seizure-free, though these figures include many who were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> the diet. Those remaining on the diet after this duration were typically not seizure-free but had had an excellent response.|$|E

5|$|Arrangements devised in 1963 between 'Aflaq and the Military Committee {{led to a}} {{very close}} mutual {{involvement}} {{of the military and}} civilian sectors of the regime, so {{that by the end of}} 1965 the politics of the Syrian army had become almost identical to the politics of the Ba'th Party. The principle military protagonist of the period Hafiz, J'did, and 'Umran were <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> military service and their power depended on their intermediary supporters in the army and in the party. In November 1965, the National Command issued a resolution which stated it was forbidden for the Regional Command to transfer or dismiss military officers without the consent of the National Command. After hearing of the resolution, Jadid rebelled immediately, and ordered Colonel Mustafa Tlas to arrest the commanders of the Homs garrison and his deputy, both supporters of National Command. In response, Razzaz called for an emergency session of the National Command which decreed the Regional Command dissolved, and made Bitar Prime Minister. Hafiz was made Chairman of a new Presidential Council and Shibli al-Aysami his deputy. Umran was recalled from exile and reappointed to the office of Minister of Defence and commander-in-chief, and Mansur al-Atrash was appointed Chairman of a new and expanded National Revolutionary Council. Jadid and his supporters responded by making war on the National Command. Assad, who neither liked nor had sympathy for the Aflaqites, did not support a showdown through the use of force. In response to the coming coup, Assad, along with Naji Jamil, Husayn Mulhim and Yusuf Sayigh, left for London.|$|E
