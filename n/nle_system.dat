50|$|Once {{a project}} is complete, the <b>NLE</b> <b>system</b> {{can then be}} used to export to movie {{in a variety of}} formats in context which may range from {{broadcast}} tape formats to compressed file formats for the Internet, DVD and mobile devices.|$|E
50|$|Although M-JPEG {{became the}} {{standard}} codec for NLE {{during the early}} 1990s, it had drawbacks. Its high computational requirements ruled out software implementations, leading to the extra cost and complexity of hardware compression/playback cards. More importantly, the traditional tape workflow had involved editing from tape, often in a rented facility. When the editor left the edit suite, they could take their confidential video tapes with them. But the M-JPEG data rate was too high for systems like Avid on the Mac and Lightworks on PC to store the video on removable storage, so these used fixed hard disks instead. The tape paradigm of keeping your (confidential) content with you was not possible with these fixed disks. Editing machines were often rented from facilities houses on a per-hour basis, and some productions chose to delete their material after each edit session, and then recapture {{it the next day}} to guarantee security of their content. In addition, each <b>NLE</b> <b>system</b> had storage limited by its hard disk capacity.|$|E

50|$|NLE {{software}} is typically {{based on a}} timeline interface paradigm where sections of moving image video recordings, known as clips, are laid out in sequence and played back. The NLE offers a range of tools for trimming, splicing, cutting and arranging clips across the timeline. As digital <b>NLE</b> <b>systems</b> have advanced their toolset, their role has expanded and most consumer and professional <b>NLE</b> <b>systems</b> alike now include a host of features for colour manipulation, titling and visual effects, as well as tools for editing and mixing audio synchronized with the video image sequence.|$|R
50|$|Avid {{is still}} {{considered}} the industry standard, {{with the majority of}} major feature films, television programs, and commercials created with its <b>NLE</b> <b>systems.</b> Final Cut Pro received a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in 2002 and continues to develop a following.|$|R
50|$|A {{spin-off}} {{product was}} released by NewTek known as the TriCaster, a portable live-production, live-projection, live-streaming, and <b>NLE</b> <b>system.</b> The TriCaster packages the VT system as a turnkey solution in a custom-designed portable PC case with video, audio and remote computer inputs and outputs {{on the front and}} back of the case. As of April 2008, four versions are in production: the basic TriCaster 2.0, TriCaster PRO 2.0, TriCaster STUDIO 2.0 and the new TriCaster BROADCAST, the latter of which adds SDI and AES-EBU connectivity plus a preview output capability. The TriCasterPRO FX, a model that was situated in line between the original TriCaster PRO and TriCaster STUDIO was introduced in early 2008, and has now been discontinued. Its feature set has been added to the new TriCaster PRO 2.0. TriCaster STUDIO 2.0 and TriCaster BROADCAST use successively larger cases than the base model TriCaster 2.0. The units within the product line above the base-model TriCaster 2.0 enables use of LiveSet 3D Live Virtual Set technology developed by NewTek, that replaces tens of thousands of U.S. dollars worth of conventional 3D virtual set equipment alone, and is also found in NewTek's venerable VT5 Integrated Production Suite, the modern-day successor to the original Video Toaster.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} aimed at {{describing}} a hybrid scheme for English to Bangla translation. The translated output in English scripts is useful for learning Bengali language. This is {{a significant contribution to}} Human Language Technology generation also. About two hundred million people in West Bengal and Tripura (two states in India) and in Bangladesh (a country whose people speak and write Bangla as their first language). This proposed translator would benefit Bengalee society because rural people are not usually very conversant with English. The English to Bangla Translator is being enhanced. This system (EnglishBangla -ANUBAD or EB-ANUBAD) takes a paragraph of English sentences as input sentences and produces equivalent Bangla sentences. EB-ANUBAD system is comprised of a preprocessor, morphological parser, semantic parser using English word ontology for context disambiguation, an electronic lexicon associated with grammatical information and a discourse processor, and also uses a lexical disambiguation analyzer. This system does not rely on a stochastic approach. Rather, it is based on a special kind of hybrid architecture of transformer and rule-based Natural Language Engineering (NLE) architectures along with various linguistic knowledge components of both English and Bangla.

50|$|MXF {{is fairly}} {{effective}} at the interchange of D10 (IMX) material, {{mainly because of}} the success of the Sony eVTR and Sony's eVTR RDD to SMPTE. Workflows combining the eVTR, Avid <b>NLE</b> <b>systems,</b> and broadcast servers using MXF in coordination with AAF are now possible.|$|R
50|$|MXF was {{developed}} to carry {{a subset of the}} Advanced Authoring Format (AAF) data model, under a policy known as the Zero Divergence Directive (ZDD). This theoretically enables MXF/AAF workflows between non-linear editing (<b>NLE)</b> <b>systems</b> using AAF and cameras, servers, and other devices using MXF.|$|R
50|$|MoviePlus, {{like all}} current <b>NLE</b> <b>systems</b> {{also has the}} ability to up-convert {{standard}} definition material to high definition as well as the ability to cross-convert video of differing frame rates. Like many similar products, all rendering is performed in software rather than in hardware: Rendering is a slow process, even on a fast computer.|$|R
50|$|EDLs {{are created}} by offline editing systems, or can be paper {{documents}} constructed by hand such as shot logging. These days, linear video editing systems have been superseded by non-linear editing (<b>NLE)</b> <b>systems</b> which can output EDLs electronically to allow autoconform on an online editing system - the recreation of an edited programme from the original sources (usually video tapes) and the editing decisions in the EDL.|$|R
50|$|In 2010 Canon {{released}} its new lineup of professional file-based camcorders. The recording format {{used in these}} camcorders incorporates MPEG-2 video with bitrates up to 50 Mbit/s and 16-bit linear PCM audio in what Canon has called XF codec. Canon claims that its flavor of MXF is fully supported by major <b>NLE</b> <b>systems</b> including Adobe Premiere, Apple Final Cut Pro X, Avid Media Composer, and Grass Valley EDIUS.|$|R
5000|$|Digital Audio Tape (or DAT) is {{the most}} well-known, and had some success as an audio storage format among {{professionals}} and [...] "prosumers" [...] before the prices of hard drive and solid-state flash memory-based digital recording devices dropped in the late 1990s. Hard-drive recording has mostly made DAT obsolete, as hard disk recorders offer more editing versatility than tape, and easier importation into digital audio workstations (DAWs) and non-linear video editing (<b>NLE)</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There was a {{transitional}} analog period using multiple source videocassette recorder (VCR)s with the EditDroid using LaserDisc players, but modern <b>NLE</b> <b>systems</b> edit video digitally captured onto {{a hard drive}} from an analog video or digital video source. Content is ingested and recorded natively with the appropriate codec that the video editing software uses to process captured footage. High-definition video is becoming more popular and can be readily edited using the same video editing software along with related motion graphics programs. Video clips are arranged on a timeline, music tracks, titles, digital on-screen graphics are added, special effects can be created, and the finished program is [...] "rendered" [...] into a finished video. The video may then be distributed {{in a variety of}} ways including DVD, web streaming, QuickTime Movies, iPod, CD-ROM, or video tape.|$|R
