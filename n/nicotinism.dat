Aim: The aim of thiobservational, cross-sectional study is to evaluate the relationship between metabolic syndrome and multinodular nontoxic goiter in an inpatient population from a geographic area with moderate iodine deficiency. Subjects and methods: We examined 1422 Caucasian euthyroid inpatients. Thyroid volume was determined by ultrasound of the neck. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed to evaluate single thyroid nodules and dominant nodules 215 mm in euthyroid multinodular goiter. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was made according to the criteria of the American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Results: Of the sample, 277 patients had clinical evidence of multinodular nontoxic goiter, 461 met the criteria for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, and 132 were found to have both conditions. After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, <b>nicotinism,</b> parity, alcohol intake, thyroid function, and metabolic syndrome-related pharmacological treatment, metabolic syndrome was found to be an independent risk factor for the occurrence of multinodular non-toxic goiter.

In the theoretical part I address the concept of tobacco, its composition, dependence and the consequences of its use. I then describe the term drug addiction, its origin, development and stages. In the conclusion I characterise the period of adolescence and the risk factors and differences concerning addictive substances which are connected with it. To meet the set goals, quantitative research was chosen, a method of questioning, using anonymous questionnaires, which were employed to define pupils' experience with tobacco and other addictive drugs. Data was collected from the 9 th years of basic shools and from the corresponding years of 8 -year grammar schools. For the research, two assumed hypotheses were designated and opened. Hypothesis 1 : The users of tobacco products have more extensive experience with illegal addictive substances than non-users of tobacco products. This hypothesis was verified. Hypothesis 2 : Girls use more tobacco products than boys. This hypothesis was also verified. The results of my Bachelor Dissertation can be used for educational purposes, as part of preventive activity in educational institutions and for making this more effective, for further research and also as material for improving awareness of this issue...|$|E

Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were proposed as one of the possible markers of oxidative injury, which originates under oxidative and carbonyl stress and increase global inflammatory activity. The present study was undertaken to compare AOPP concentrations in a control group of healthy individuals without ICHS (I), patients with stable angina pectoris (II), patients with acute coronary syndrome over 48 hours without ST elevations (III), and patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (IV). Coronaronary angiography, risk factors and anamnestic data were analyzed. We examined 73 probands with signs of myocardial ischemia, mean age of 61. 5 years (64 % males) subjected to coronarography and 21 healthy individuals. No significant difference was found between venous blood and coronary samples, or between infarction and non-infarction arteries in the group IV. AOPP concentrations in healthy individuals in the group I (82. 9 ± 29. 3 mmol/l) did not differ significantly from patients in group II (89. 6 ± 26. 7 mmol/l) and group III (112. 3 ± 54. 6 mmol/l).

40|$|The {{principal}} idea of {{the work}} was to show a new, original method of description of the phenomena of human biological development {{with the use of}} nonstandard research methods so far unused in the ontogenetic studies in regard to the stable and involutional phases of ontogenesis. The main purpose of the work was to assess with selected methods individual reactions of a human organism in ontogenesis against the development of the population. Two research methods were selected. They were subsequently used to show individual reactions of a single human organism against the phenotypic variability characterising the population. The research methods employed are based on the physical and chemical properties of biological cells (the Electrophoretic Mobility of Cell Nuclei (EMN) method) {{as well as on the}} physical properties of selected physical parameters describing the properties of biological structures (the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy method). One of the objectives of the study was to corroborate the applicability of the EMN index method as an adequate criterion 1 A summary of the thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Sciences in Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznañ 1999.

High sensitivity of the EMN index made it possible to check to what extent a reaction of an individual, resulting from the operation of selected factors increasing the risk of premature death (<b>nicotinism,</b> alcoholism), would permit to assess the deviation of this individual organism from the theoretical course of its ontogenesis determined with the EMN method. Another task under the study involved checking to what degree the ontogenetic development curve in selected subject groups (alcoholics, smokers and non-smokers) determined with the EMN method deviated from the control curve. The principal research tasks regarding the methods of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy involved attempts to find a new physical parameter, which could serve as a measure of the advancement of certain biological processes accompanying human ontogenesis.

40|$|Background/Aim. A certain {{percentage}} of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have an unstable carotid plaque. For these patients {{it is possible to}} register by modern imaging methods the existence of lesions of the brain parenchyma - the silent brain infarction. These patients have a greater risk of ischemic stroke. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the connection between the morphology of atherosclerotic carotid plaque in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis and the manifestation of silent brain infarction, and to analyze the influence of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases on the occurrence of silent brain infarction and the morphology of carotid plaque. Methods. This retrospective study included patients who had been operated for high grade (> 70 %) extracranial atherosclerotic carotid stenosis at the Clinic for Vascular and Transplantation Surgery of the Clinical Center of Vojvodina over a period of 5 years. The patients analyzed had no clinical manifestation of cerebrovascular insufficiency of the carotid artery territory up to the time of operation. The classification of carotid plaque morphology was carried out according to the Gray-Weale classification, after which all the types were subcategorized into two groups: stable and unstable. Brain lesions were verified using preoperative imaging of the brain parenchyma by magnetic resonance. We analyzed ipsilateral lesions of the size > or = 3 mm. Results. Out of a 201 patients 78 % had stable plaque and 22 % unstable one. Unstable plaque was prevalent in the male patients (male/female ratio = 24. 8 % : 17. 8 %), but without a statistically significant difference (p > 0. 05). The risk factors (hypertension, <b>nicotinism,</b> hyperlipoproteinemia, and diabetes mellitus) showed no statistically significant impact on carotid plaque morphology and the occurrence of silent brain infarction.

Those suffering from the condition show very specific behavioral traits, which manifest as lifestyle habits; they also show comorbidities that can be the symptoms and/or consequences of certain lifestyles. Materials and methods: The targeted population was adults aged 18 – 65 years. The total sample was 1, 012 (507 males and 505 females). The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS V. 1. 1) was administered to evaluate the current symptoms of ADHD and a questionnaire regarding lifestyles that are pertinent to ADHD, exercise, drug use, and diet. Results: An ASRS score of 4 – 6 points was found in 11. 4 % of the male population and 9. 7 % of the female population (5 – 6 points indicate very high-intensity symptoms). A score of 6, the highest intensity of symptomatology, was found in 1. 18 % of males and 0. 99 % of females. Gender differences in scores were not statistically significant. In terms of self-reported lifestyles, we calculated an ordered logistic regression and the odds ratios of those with ASRS scores > 4. Those with higher ASRS scores had higher rates of self-reported unhealthy lifestyles and poor diets with high consumption of sweets. We also ascertained a paradoxical finding {{that is not in}} line with the current literature on the disorder – lower rates of cigarette smoking among people with higher ADHD symptomatology. Conclusion: Several specific lifestyles were found to be associated with higher ADHD symptoms such as poor diet and cannabis use. Other factors classically associated with the disorder such as cocaine addiction and <b>nicotinism</b> were either insignificant or surprisingly less prominent among the Czech sample. However, ADHD-prone respondents reported to be more physically active, which fits the clinical picture of hyperactivity but contrasts with literature that reports sedentary ADHD lifestyle.

40|$|The {{thesis on}} hand {{presents}} the results of a monocentric prospective register at the Campus Benjamin Franklin of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin for the application and significance of intravascular ultrasound in intravascular brachytherapy. Between February 2000 and July 2003 a total of 121 patients with angiographically detected in-stent-restenosis were successively included in the register. The period of observation was 6 months. Within the framework of this thesis altogether 70 patients were selected for an IVUS-monitored PCI with ensuing IVBT. The remaining 51 patients could not be treated with the help of IVBT owing to the outcome of an initial IVUS examination or because of technical obstacles. It should be stressed that by means of the IVUS examination 20. 7 percent of the cases (25 patients) were diagnosed with insufficient distention of the stent although through the appli¬cation of coronary angiography an intimal hyperplasia came to be primarily suspected. This emphasizes the role of IVUS as a diagnostic method that complements coronary angiography by helping to differentiate between an actually existing in-stent-restenosis and stent malopposition and that therefore gains considerable influence on the choice of poten¬tial therapeutic options. Furthermore, it was possible to derive from the IVUS data predictive factors (e. g. fulfilment of the MUSIC criteria, <b>nicotinism)</b> for the formation of a restenosis. It could be dem¬onstrated that time-saving online analysis (in comparison to costly offline analysis) provides a reliable, efficient and valid diagnostic technique in case of acute interventions, facilitating, for example, the differentiation between in-stent-restenosis and stent malopposition. On the basis of the accompanying IVUS examination it could be proved in this study that the application of IVBT results in a significant therapeutic success not only in the short term but also in the six-month control period. The effect of IVBT {{can be summed up in}} the term 'plaquemelting'. The outcome for patients with partly difficult vascular morphology, such as longer in-stent-restenosis and small coronary arteries, is comparable to the results of other randomized studies. By comparing IVBT with the currently common use of DES, it can be shown on the basis of the late lumen loss that after 6 to 9 months both methods produce stable long-term results. With regard to the treatment of ISR, the formation of de novo ISR and therapy risks, it is obvious that DES are the better therapeutic option. In this connection long-term studies are now required. In interventional cardiology IVBT has at present already been superseded by DES. New studies point out that the drug-eluting balloon (DEB) can develop into a useful alternative and that in the future it will possibly be an even more effective and better tolerable therapeutic option for an ISR...|$|E
