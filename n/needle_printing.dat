40|$|This paper {{presents}} a structural scheme {{of the model}} to generate profiles of <b>needle</b> <b>printing</b> elements of Braille printer to publish books for the blind. The ex-amples of computer simulation of the profile of <b>needle</b> <b>printing</b> elements for paper and cardboard have been presented. To ensure social, cultural and information needs of blind people it is impor-tant to improve the process of manufacturing printed materials for this group of people. The problem of inclusive education {{and the production of}} educational, artistic and other publications in Braille is always relevant as the rehabilitation, cor-rectional and special pedagogy for people with disabilities has increasing scientific, practical and state interest [1, 2]. The traditional and most common technology of manufacturing printed products for the blind is congreve stamping. Originally it was used on flat-bed and crucible machines. Such paper or cardboard was put between the stamp and the matrix and convex relief elements of Braille text were formed under the pressure. Now to get relief images we widely use Braille printers that can print ou...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} understand the atomization process in the specialized printing method which consists of the high frequency oscillating motion of a needle and a micro air jet. Highly viscous liquids, such as glycerin and acrylic paint were successfully printed with this printing method within the line width of 1 mm. High-speed imaging technique was used to observe the evolution and mechanical perturbation of a liquid meniscus which is coated on the oscillating needle. Various parameters which affect print patterns were identified to understand and control the atomization process occurring at the oscillating needle. For time-controlled atomization or printing, a pulse air jet system was implemented to print liquids only when it is demanded, and it was shown that the period of atomization can be controlled by the air jet on-and-off. The inertial coating process was studied to explain the dynamic meniscus profile, compared with static meniscus. Kinematic analysis of the needle motion was performed, which shows that the needle motion is a sinusoidal one undergoing inertial coating. Liquid sheet breakup mechanism {{in the presence of}} the air stream was also studied in conjunction with the principle of the air- blast atomizer. Performing as a printing device or a droplet generator, the reciprocating <b>needle</b> <b>printing</b> method studied here can be applied to printing or coating processes which utilize high viscosity media. by Heejin Lee.

This perforates the foundation, {{making it easier}} to tear away after the block is completed. Several methods can be used to prepare the design for use on the foundation: tracing, photocopying, computer <b>printing,</b> <b>needle</b> punching, and pre-set designs.|$|R
5000|$|Progressive Era reformers {{strongly}} promoted free public schooling {{through high}} school, {{on the assumption}} that ignorance was a waste and that learning developed the personality as well as skills needed in a modernizing society. Public school enrollment rose from 553,000 in 1900, to 1.1 million in 1930, and then declined a bit. The wide range of schools included elementary, junior high schools, as well as comprehensive, academic, and technical senior high schools. In addition, the system operated training schools in music the arts, science, cooking, the <b>needle</b> trades <b>printing</b> and the like, with special schools for handicapped children and a very large evening program for adults. The availability of free public education through high school was especially attractive to poor Jewish immigrants who placed a high value on human capital.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nowadays, the {{histological}} {{examination of}} prostate core needle biopsies is still {{regarded as the}} gold standard in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). We investigated if the tissue <b>print</b> of core <b>needle</b> biopsy (biopsy <b>print)</b> {{could be used as}} adjunctive molecular investigative procedures in conjunction with routine histological examination of biopsy to improve PCa diagnosis. Methods The direct contact of PCa core biopsy to nitrocellulose membrane resulted in the release of a cellular micropeel that was used for downstream analytical procedures. Results By zymogram print-phoresis we demonstrated that matrix metalloproteases MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 could be visualized in biopsy prints and that the gelatinolytic activity was positively correlated with immunohistochemistry analysis of the same markers in matched bioptic specimens. Moreover, we compared the ability to detect the PCa-associated hypermethylation of GSTP 1 promoter in DNA extracted from biopsy prints with those of the corresponding core <b>needle</b> biopsies. Biopsy <b>prints</b> demonstrated the same specificity of biopsies in detecting PCa (50 %) while the sensitivity and the positive predictive value were lower than biopsies (56 % vs 78 % and 63 % vs 70 %, respectively). Conclusions Biopsy print, combining a molecular point of view to the routinely hystopathological analysis of prostate biopsies, should be a useful tool to improve the diagnosis of PCa. </p...|$|R
