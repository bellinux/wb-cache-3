In 1961, Baker appeared in the controversial independent film Something Wild, directed by her then-husband Jack Garfein, playing a traumatized rape victim. She went on to star in several critically acclaimed Westerns throughout the 1960s, such as The Big Country (1958), How the West Was Won (1962), and Cheyenne Autumn (1964).|$|E
500|$|After her {{suspension}} with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker {{appeared in}} William Wyler's Western epic The Big Country (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot {{was described as}} [...] "problematic": Baker was four months pregnant {{at the time and}} had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her {{on the verge of tears}} after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. She followed The Big Country with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in The Miracle (1959) co-starring Roger Moore, and in But <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. The New York Times praised Baker's performance in But <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me,</b> saying: [...] "Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks but also can act, makes you understand why Mr. Gable would like to cheat a little bit on Father Time." [...] She disliked The Miracle so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. But <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> was made at Paramount.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, the {{two teams}} agreed to {{schedule}} a rematch for September 6, 2010. Deborah Yow stated that, [...] "The citizens of Maryland {{have made it clear}} they want this game." [...] Alluding to the Navy athletic staff's perceived reticence, she added, [...] "We got past the Charlotte situation." [...] The delay in scheduling was attributed to the need for a three-way contract between Maryland, Navy, and the stadium tenants, the Baltimore Ravens. For this reason, a renewal as far off as 2014 was not seriously discussed. Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "I {{would like to see it}} as an annual game, but that's <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about it {{a long time ago and}} decided I would step out, for us, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E
500|$|In native Sweden, [...] "Dressed for Success" [...] and [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] {{were chosen}} as the first two singles from their second album Look Sharp!, as Gessle and EMI Sweden chose to {{highlight}} Fredriksson's singing. Gessle said, [...] "I always thought we should promote the songs Marie sang. Me being a lead singer wasn't part of the plan, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> anyway." [...] Both singles reached the top 10 of the Swedish singles chart, while the album, which was released in Sweden in October 1988, held the No.1 position for 14 weeks. Music critic Måns Ivarsson was underwhelmed by the album, writing derisively: [...] "To consist of two such original persons as Marie Fredriksson and Per Gessle, the album sounds unbelievably conventional. Most striking are the lyrics. Gessle's once so subtle Swedish lyrics have became desolate English nonsense." [...] But the album won Roxette their first Rockbjörnen awards in Sweden and Gessle his first Grammis award in the category Best Composer.|$|E

500|$|Just before Vladimir died, he {{had sent}} his son Boris on {{campaign}} against the nomads in the south. According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk seized Kiev while those of Vladimir's retainers who were with Boris on campaign encouraged Boris to take power, an offer Boris refused apparently stating [...] "Be it <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to raise my hand against my elder brother". In the confusion resulting from the death of Vladimir Sviatopolk was able to seize power in Kiev, as Yaroslav was in the north, Mstislav in the south, Sviatoslav in the Derevlian land, Gleb in Murom and Boris on the aforementioned expedition against the Pechenegs. As Franklin and Shepard put it, Sviatopolk's [...] "previous arrest turned to his advantage, for it ensured that he was already ... closest {{to the center of}} power". According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk successfully arranged the murder of three of his brothers, Boris of Rostov, Gleb of Murom and Sviatoslav of the Derevlian lands.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge's {{communication}} with his supporters between the meetings indicated greater willingness {{to become a}} candidate, but he instructed Clay to nominate him only if his support exceeded Guthrie's. Many believed that Buchanan supported Breckinridge, but Breckinridge wrote to Beck that [...] "The President is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> except as a last necessity, {{that is to say}} not until his help will not be worth a damn." [...] After a majority of the delegates, most of them Douglas supporters, voted to replace Alabama and Louisiana's walk-out delegates with new, pro-Douglas men in Baltimore, Virginia's delegation led another walk-out of Southern Democrats and Buchanan-controlled delegates from the northeast and Pacific coast; 105 delegates, including 10 of Kentucky's 24, left, and the remainder nominated Douglas. The walk-outs held a rival nominating convention, styled the National Democratic Convention, at the Maryland Institute in Baltimore. At that convention on June 23, Massachusetts' George B. Loring nominated Breckinridge for president, and he received 81 of the 105 votes cast, the remainder going to Daniel S. Dickinson of New York. Oregon's Joseph Lane was nominated for vice-president.|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or <b>not.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E

500|$|As the googly {{caused a}} {{sensation}} following its invention, many other cricketers tried to emulate Bosanquet. Reggie Schwarz, the South African cricketer {{who played for}} Middlesex, learned how to bowl the googly through observation of Bosanquet; Schwarz in turn {{passed it on to}} the South African bowlers Aubrey Faulkner, Bert Vogler and Gordon White. These four raised the bowling of the googly to a high standard and raised fears of the detrimental effect it would have on batting. Following the development of googly bowling by South Africans, it was further refined by English and Australian cricketers until it became firmly established. In later years, the googly was blamed for a deterioration in the quality and attractiveness of batting. Bosanquet refused to accept any blame and published a defence in The Morning Post during 1924, later reprinted in Wisden, which humorously downplayed the impact of the googly. He wrote: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to defend it. Other and more capable hands have taken it up and exploited it, and, if blame is to be allotted, let it be on their shoulders. For me is the task of the historian, and if I appear too much {{in the role of the}} proud parent, I ask forgiveness." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I think is a great thing to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story begins}} with a dialog between two characters. The first asks the other [...] "You do know why you're here?", and the second replies: [...] "Yes, there's great {{confusion}} on earth, and the power that is has concluded the following: Perfect man has visited earth already and His voice was heard; The voice of imperfect man must now be made manifest; and I have been selected as the most likely candidate." [...] This statement is followed by [...] "Where's the Show" [...] and [...] "Let Me Be a Man". In the medley, Nelson depicts {{the birth of the}} character, who implores God to become a man. The song is followed by [...] "In God's Eyes", depicting the character learning to act as a good Samaritan. In [...] "Family Bible", the character describes his memories of and nostalgia for his childhood, the times with his family and the reading of the family Bible. [...] "It's <b>Not</b> <b>for</b> <b>Me</b> to Understand" [...] depicts the character praying, after watching a blind child listening to other children playing and finding himself unable to understand why God allowed that to happen. God replies to the Imperfect Man, [...] "It's not for you to reason why, you too are blind without my eyes, so question not what I command". In the last stanza, the character now expresses [...] his fear of the Lord and his reluctance to question the unfairness of the world again. The medley [...] "These Are Difficult Times / Remember the Good Times", describes the character's bad times and his recovery by remembering the good times.|$|E

500|$|Representing {{as he did}} a {{state in}} the Deep South, Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance {{on the issues that}} were tearing the nation apart. The {{occasion}} arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union. Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas, and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the adoption procedure to oppose it. Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two-hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general, following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as [...] "probably his most effective speech in the Senate." [...] One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave-holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule. Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by [...] "the people," [...] he said: [...] "States have conferred, and may at any time confer, their whole political power on a minority. They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate, upon the payment of tax, upon militia duty, or upon the color of skin; but whoever the State chooses to confer her political authority upon, are the people." [...] He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave-holding states, although at this time he did not believe it would necessarily lead to secession. He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened: [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to indicate the path she [...] may, in her wisdom, pursue; but, sir, ... my whole heart is with her, and she will find me treading it with undivided affections." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E
