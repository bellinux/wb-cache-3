5|$|Physical trauma {{including}} tearing, friction or bumping of {{the piercing}} site, which may cause edema and delay healing. The risks can be minimized by wearing properly sized jewellery and not changing it unnecessarily, by <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> the piercing more than required for aftercare, and by being conscious of environmental factors (such as clothing) that may impact the piercing.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{vaccine for}} the common cold.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help with pain. Antibiotics should not be used. Evidence does not support a benefit from cough medicines.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{challenges}} encountered during the Crucible are team and individual obstacle courses, day and night assault courses, land navigation courses, individual rushes up steep hills, large-scale martial arts challenges and countless patrols to and from each of these. These challenges are often made even more difficult by the additions of limitations or handicaps, such as the requirement to carry several ammunition drums, <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> portions of an obstacle painted red to indicate simulated booby traps and evacuating team members with simulated wounds.|$|E
25|$|From this point, the English fielding {{began to}} go {{downhill}} in no uncertain fashion. Sheppard ran round and round a skier from Carmody and did not touch it and, from having the home men 50 for three, the Englishmen allowed them to get on top completely. This is the worst fielding I had seen from an M.C.C team. Bailey emulated Sheppard by running round and round a catch, and <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> it, and Brown seemed to despair of victory...Brown left Perth stating, in a most determined manner, that his fieldsmen would know that they had had fielding practice before very long.|$|E
25|$|The players spin {{a racket}} {{to decide who}} serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either {{the left or right}} service box. For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike the front wall above the service line and below the out line and land in the {{opposite}} back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to volley a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point.|$|E

25|$|Edwin H. Colbert has {{suggested}} that the theropod footprints referred to the ichnogenus Grallator, located in the Connecticut River Valley across Connecticut and Massachusetts, may have been made by Coelophysis. The footprints are from the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic aged Newark Supergroup. They clearly show digits II III and IV but not I or V. That condition is strange for footprints of their age. The digits were presumed to be stubby and ineffective, <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> the ground when the dinosaur was walking or running. They have been thought to be from an unidentified, primitive saurischian similar to Coelophysis by David B. Weishampel and L. Young more recently. Skeletal remains resembling Coelophysis have also been found in the valley, supporting the idea that a species similar to Coelophysis is responsible for the footprints.|$|E
25|$|For {{positive}} integers, this proof can be geometrized: if {{one considers}} the quantity x'n as {{the volume of the}} n-cube (the hypercube in n dimensions), then the derivative is the change in the volume as the side length is changed – this is x'n1, which can be interpreted as the area of n faces, each of dimension n1 (fixing one vertex at the origin, these are the n faces <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> the vertex), corresponding to the cube increasing in size by growing in the direction of these faces – in the 3-dimensional case, adding 3 infinitesimally thin squares, one to each of these faces. Conversely, geometrizing the fundamental theorem of calculus, stacking up these infinitesimal (n1) cubes yields a (hyper)-pyramid, and n of these pyramids form the n-cube, which yields the formula. Further, there is an n-fold cyclic symmetry of the n-cube around the diagonal cycling these pyramids (for which a pyramid is a fundamental domain). In the case of the cube (3-cube), this is how the volume of a pyramid was originally rigorously established: the cube has 3-fold symmetry, with fundamental domain a pyramids, dividing the cube into 3 pyramids, corresponding {{to the fact that the}} volume of a pyramid is one third of the base times the height. This illustrates geometrically the equivalence between the quadrature of the parabola and the volume of a pyramid, which were computed classically by different means.|$|E
500|$|The first Datchet Bridge was {{a wooden}} bridge {{commissioned}} by Queen Anne as the crossing was a convenient back-way to Windsor Castle. Responsibility for the upkeep {{and maintenance of}} the crossing later passed to the counties of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire over whose boundary the bridge spanned. There followed many decades of dispute between the counties over who should pay for what. This culminated in 1836 with each county deciding {{to build their own}} half, in different materials and <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> in the middle. The resulting [...] "crazy erection", Buckinghamshire's side in wood and Berkshire's in iron, known as The Divided Bridge, was demolished in 1848 and is the only case on the Thames where an established bridge crossing site has completely disappeared.|$|E

500|$|The story {{received}} mixed opinions. Seid said that, due to {{the story}} being taken directly from the original, it was overly short and simple by modern standards. Bramwell felt the story was not as nuanced as other entries, and noted the lower number of [...] "lovable" [...] characters. Stella {{said that while the}} plot could get confusing, the prologue and [...] "sophisticated" [...] translation helped explain events. Hatfield also praised the translation, and while agreeing that the story was simpler than other Fire Emblem games, he found the scope impressive for its origins as a Famicom game. Reddick, in contrast to his praise for the gameplay, called the story fairly standard for the genre, with most of its key moments being [...] "dull and forgettable". Dutton, while <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> the overall story, found the dialogue overly [...] "cheesy".|$|E
500|$|Against Romania, Pelé {{scored two}} goals, with Brazil winning by a final score of 3–2. In the quarterfinals against [...] Peru, Brazil won 4–2, with Pelé {{assisting}} Tostão for Brazil's third goal. In their semi-final match, Brazil faced Uruguay {{for the first}} time since the 1950 World Cup final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2–1, and Pelé assisted Rivelino for the 3–1. During that match, Pelé made one of his most famous plays. Tostão passed the ball for Pelé to collect which Uruguay's goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of and ran off his line to get the ball before Pelé. However, Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a feint by <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeepers left, while Pelé went to the goalkeepers right. Pelé ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.|$|E
500|$|While Marlon would {{correspond}} with and eventually marry his wife Carol at 18, Michael never {{had sex with}} groupies, finding his brothers' behavior toward women disgusting. In addition to <b>not</b> <b>touching</b> groupies, Jackson reportedly never {{had an interest in}} having any type of sex as a youngster. In one alleged incident, when he was 15 years old, a male family member arranged for two prostitutes to take his virginity. They were told to [...] "work him over", before being locked in a room with him. Instead Michael picked up a Bible and read bible verses to the girls. The girls left in tears. James McField, who worked with The Jackson 5, stated that the lead singer of the band often needed someone to talk with. It was at these times that women would be introduced to him for companionship. McField asserted that he never witnessed anything sexual, and that such females were not Jackson's type; [...] "He liked nice girls, pure girls who appeared to have no street background." ...|$|E
