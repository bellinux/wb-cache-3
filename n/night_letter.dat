40|$|Not for publication. For {{official}} use only. The recent {{occurrence of}} cases of poliomyelitis among children who had recently been inoculated with poliomyelitis vaccine manufactured by Cutter Laboratories dramatically illustrated the need for establishing a nationwide system of collecting accurate and detailed reports on all cases 20 f poliomyelitis in the country. It was imperative to determine {{as rapidly as possible}} the nature of the apparent association of cases with Cutter Vaccine. Similar associations with vaccines from other manufacturers might occur at any time. As increasing numbers of children become immunized and as the normal poliomyelitis season approaches, it may be expected by mere coincidence that many children will contract poliomyelitis at some time following vaccination. In order to interpret such occurrences properly, it is neces- s&ry that accurate current information be available on a national basis in far more detail and more rapidly than is now available through established morbidity reporting channels. Accordingly, on April 28, one day following the discovery of the association {{of cases of}} poliomyelitis with Cutter Vaccine and its withdrawal from use, the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service directed the establishment of the Poliomyelitis Surveillance Unit within the Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta. The two documents establishing this Unit are attached: l) The news release of April 28, 1955, and 2) the telegramto all Regional Medical Directors of the Public Health Service from Otis L. Anderson, Chief, Bureau of State Services of the Public Health Service. The Surveillance Program will serve broad functions. The accurate and detailed information collected and disseminated currently to Federal and State Health Officials and participating laboratories should serve to guide the most effective application of the limited supplies of vaccine available in 1955. The wise use of these supplies should accelerate the decline of poliomyelitis throughout the country, leading, it may be hoped, to rapid disappearance of the disease.

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{developed}} {{out of a}} larger work in progress, which focuses on representations of Italy in contemporary Australian fiction and non-fiction prose. This larger project aims to add to an established body of work on travel writing by considering Australian texts that describe Australian travel in Italy, Italian people and Italian places. In this paper, I will specifically focus on the representations of Italy in Robert Dessaix’s novel <b>Night</b> <b>Letters</b> (1996). My paper will explore {{the relationship between the}} writer’s actual journey in Italy and that of the creative work’s main character. The novel offers the protagonist’s account in the form of letters, which describe his travel from Switzerland across Northern Italy to Venice. I will begin by briefly outlining the Italian itinerary followed by Dessaix that would eventually inspire the novel. I will then explore the relationship between Dessaix’s notebooks recording his two journeys in Italy and the literary accomplishment of <b>Night</b> <b>Letters.</b> My aim is to show ways in which an itinerary becomes a story, a complex narrative. Reference will be made to factual accounts and descriptions in the author’s own diaries with an analysis of their generative role as key sources for the fictional work. This will be done through a close reading of particular passages, in the diaries and in the novel, concerning the same event. A comparative analysis of the notebooks and <b>Night</b> <b>Letters</b> can show that Dessaix’s diary entries relating to Italian places are woven into the fictional fabric of the ‘night letters’ according to a unifying principle...|$|R

You[r] love 2 ̆ 6 sweetness has done so much, sweetheart, you’ll never know. I don’t know what I’ll ever do without you, honey. You’re so wonderful. I love you so, my darling.

Honey, I can’t tell you how much you’ve done for me this week. Honestly, honey, you’ve changed my whole outlook on life. You can’t imagine how awful it was to fear marriage 2 ̆ 6 look upon the whole business with discust [sic]. I wish I could thank you enough for what you’ve done for me.

40|$|Translation begins] Darling- Rather {{my darling}} Lieutenant Just arrived home from New York. I’m so glad you’re a Lieutenant! But, honey, there’s one thing. We’ve {{got to get}} married down there. I have a funny feeling about that darling + I {{honestly}} {{think it would be}} much better for everyone if we were married down here. Here {{are a few of the}} reasons. First, I know you want to get married on the day you graduate. 2. I want to get married on the day you graduate 3. We’re going down to see you graduate anyway. 4. Mother will have a two week vacation if we go down. I we don’t then she’ll work herself into a complete collapse rushing around making plans for the wedding + the reception. 5. it’s much less expensive this way. 6. I want to get married down there in the army chapel. 7. Mother wants to see the south. She’s never been there + this will be the only chance she has. 8. Mother + I had a real long talk + she said no matter what she + Hilda + I were going down south to see you graduate + get married. 9. Oh, honey, I can’t remember the other reasons now but please darling, let’s get married down there. I want it that way + I’m sure you do too- no matter what you may say. Oh, about the <b>night</b> <b>letter.</b> That might be slightly confusing because I added a few sentences in there. Mother wrote, “Wedding plans unchanged- leaving March 7 th”. And the reason I wrote as you probably gathered. Oh, honey, I’m so glad that you are a Lieutenant. You’re going to be the handsomest officer. Really, though, honey, the only thing to do is have the wedding down there. Please, honey, it means so much to me. I’d be broken hearted if you said you didn’t want to get married down there. Really, I would. I’ve counted on it so, Judd. You don’t know how much it means to me. I’m so sorry that I wasn’t here when you called honey. I’m so upset about now. You haven’t any idea how much we’ve all counted on this. Judd, honey, what has happened that made you change your mind. Golly, darling, have you forgotten you said you were going to marry me March 11 th- I haven’t. Honey, it would be so unreasonable to have it at home. Hilda + mother + I are so excited about the trip + getting married down there. If you could have seen how disappointed we all were you never would have suggested it. No, honey, it would be awful to have the wedding here. I was so disappointed. I was sure they were fooling when they told me that you said you wanted to get married home. Honey, I know you don’t- you just can’t. Honey, it’s awfully late. I hope you call tomorrow. I’ll send this air mail special. Hope you get it soon. Honey, you couldn’t mean it when you said you didn’t want us to come down to see you graduate. Getting your wings means more to you than anything else and, honey, I want to be with you then. It’s the most important moment in your life and, honey, please don’t say you don’t want me to be there. I love you so, my darling. I mean sir- should I be more formal now, Lieutenant?
