50|$|The Willis Islets are {{important}} nesting areas for birds and turtles but contain negligible natural resources. They comprise less than 3 km2 of land. There is no <b>port</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbour,</b> only offshore anchorage.|$|R

50|$|A berth is a {{designated}} location in a <b>port</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbour</b> used for mooring vessels {{when they are}} not at sea. Berths provide a vertical front which allows safe and secure mooring that can then facilitate the unloading or loading of cargo or people from vessels.|$|R
5000|$|Coastal defence (or defense) {{and coastal}} {{fortification}} are measures taken to provide protection against military attack {{at or near}} a coastline (or other shoreline), for example, fortification and coastal artillery. Because an invading enemy normally requires a <b>port</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbour</b> to sustain operations, such defences are usually concentrated around such facilities, or places where such facilities could be constructed.|$|R

Laos {{is a country}} in Asia, which possesses a number of modern transportation systems, including several highways {{and a number of}} airports. As a landlocked country, Laos possesses no <b>ports</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbours</b> on the sea, and the difficulty of navigation on the Mekong means that this is also not a significant transport route.|$|R

50|$|The port of Mako in the Pescadores Islands was an {{area with}} a long {{association}} with the Imperial Japanese Navy, having been the first portion of Taiwan captured during the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in the First Sino-Japanese War. Mako was designated a third echelon <b>naval</b> <b>port,</b> <b>or</b> yokobu (要港部) on 4 July 1901. It served as a staging point and refueling base in the Russo-Japanese War, and especially {{during the early stages}} of the Second Sino-Japanese War.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{economic}} {{activity in the}} Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands being uninhabited. Cartier Island is an unvegetated sand island.

The customs vessel ACV Ashmore Guardian is stationed off the reef for up to 330 days per year. The islands are also visited by seasonal caretakers and occasional scientific researchers.|$|R
50|$|However, on March 14, 1914, {{the status}} of the Ryojun Naval District was reduced to that of a third echelon <b>naval</b> <b>port,</b> <b>or</b> yōkōbu (要港部). It served as a staging point and {{refueling}} base in World War I for operations against the Imperial German Navy’s German East Asia Squadron based out of Tsingtao. With the Allied victory in World War I eliminating the German threat and with the Washington Naval Treaty limiting naval forces, Ryojun Military Port was deactivated on December 1, 1922.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of ports and harbours {{throughout the world}} can seriously impact on the natural course of longshore drift. Not only do ports and harbours {{pose a threat to}} longshore drift in the short term, they also pose a threat to shoreline evolution. The major influence the {{creation of}} a <b>port</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbour</b> can have on longshore drift is the alteration of sedimentation patterns, which in turn may lead to accretion and/or erosion of a beach or coastal system.|$|R
5000|$|After the Russo-Japanese War, {{when the}} {{strategic}} importance {{of control of}} the Tsugaru Straits came into focus, and with Japan's acquisition of Karafuto Prefecture, more investment was made in securing Japan's northern frontiers. Ōminato was one of eleven designated third echelon <b>naval</b> <b>ports,</b> <b>or</b> yokobu (要港部) located in various locations around Japan. In December 1905 it was made independent of Yokosuka. Although Muroran, Asahikawa and Wakkanai bases reported to Ōminato, it was not raised to full Naval District (...) headquarters status, but continued as Ōminato yokobu. A wireless station was completed in 1913.|$|R

50|$|It {{is known}} {{that he was in}} Bristol in 1787 and later {{travelled}} to the South Coast; there are few <b>ports</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbours</b> from this region that do not feature in his work. In 1789 he toured Wales and in 1813 he travelled to Devon, painting scenes around Plymouth harbour. During his career he also painted scenes showing the Cape of Good Hope, Madeira, Cuba and Cape Horn. Between 1783 and 1824 he lived in London, including addresses in Covent Garden and Somers Town during the course of his exhibiting career.|$|R
50|$|In 1886 Greece was {{blockaded}} by Great Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy and Russia, {{to prevent}} her from engaging in war with Turkey, and thus forcing the powers to define their attitude towards the latter power. The instructions given to the British commander were to detain every ship under the Greek flag coming out of or entering any of the blockaded <b>ports</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbours,</b> <b>or</b> communicating with any ports within the limit blockaded; but if any parts of the cargo on board of such ships belonged to any subject or citizen of any foreign power other than Greece, and other than Austria, Germany, Italy and Russia, and had been shipped before notification of the blockade or after such notification, but under a charter made before the notification, such ship {{was not to be}} detained.|$|R
25|$|There are no railways, waterways, <b>ports</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbours</b> on the island. Loading jetties {{are located}} at Kingston and Cascade, but ships cannot {{get close to}} either of them. When a supply ship arrives, it is emptied by whaleboats towed by launches, five tonnes at a time. Which jetty is used depends on the {{prevailing}} weather of the day; the jetty on the leeward {{side of the island}} is often used. If the wind changes significantly during unloading/loading, the ship will move around to the other side. Visitors often gather to watch the activity when a supply ship arrives.|$|R
50|$|Osaka, a {{strategic}} port city {{and location of}} several shipyards was initially ranked as a third echelon <b>naval</b> <b>port</b> <b>or</b> yokobu (要港部) reporting to the Kure Naval District. The military base itself was established in 1939, but {{was little more than}} a base in name only, and was intended to form an administrative structure as legal representative of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Osaka area. It lacked in any base facilities, not even a repair yard, fueling depot or stores, and it relied on civilian-owned port facilities to service passing warships. Nonetheless, it was raised to the status of Guard District on March 13, 1940.|$|R

Both airports formerly served scheduled passenger flights and both are proposing expansions and renovations to handle domestic and European flights in the near future. The nearest international airports to south Cumbria are Blackpool, Manchester and Liverpool John Lennon. North Cumbria is closer to Newcastle, Glasgow Prestwick and Glasgow International. Barrow-in-Furness {{is one of the}} country's largest shipbuilding centres, but the Port of Barrow is only minor, operated by Associated British Ports alongside the Port of Silloth in Allerdale. There are no ferry links from any <b>port</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbour</b> along the Cumbria coast.|$|R
50|$|The National Highways Act, 1956 {{provides}} for private {{investment in the}} building and maintenance of the highways. Some existing roads have been reclassified as national highways. Bypasses have recently been constructed around larger towns and cities to provide uninterrupted passage for highway traffic. The hugely varied climatic, demographic, traffic, and sometimes political situation in India results in national highways being single lane in places with low traffic to six lanes in places with heavy traffic. National highways are being upgraded or are under construction. Some national highways are long while some are short spurs off other national highways to provide connectivity to nearby <b>ports</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbours.</b>|$|R

30|$|In the {{open-ended}} questions, {{the representatives of}} the Greek ports bring forward the problems of financing, understaffing and the need for qualified personnel, the lack of quality and safety management experience. Moreover, the port experts, who participated in this research project, reacted positively to the development of quality and safety systems. Though their comments they recognized the need for further applicable results including methods for quality and safety system integration. Many of the issues for quality and safety management are common to other economic sectors and {{the results of this study}} are analogous to the ones presented for example in Zantanidis et al., [29], Tsekouras et al., [30], Gotzamani and Tsiotras [31] etc. Finally, although the results are interesting, they should not be straightforwardly generalized for either the Greek <b>ports</b> <b>or</b> <b>harbours,</b> <b>or</b> outside the Greek environment.|$|R
