Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric <b>name</b> <b>suggests</b> that events are seen candidly, as a fly might see them. Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied {{on the idea that}} DNA could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E

5|$|As its common <b>name</b> <b>suggests,</b> it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
