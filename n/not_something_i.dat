500|$|Upon release, {{the song}} was {{generally}} met with positive reviews from music critics. Romanian publication Libertatea praised the refrain of [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] for being optimistic, and described its beats as [...] "explosive". Jonathan Currinn, writing in his own website, expected the track to become a hit, although stating that the lyrics [...] "aren't exactly strong and Viper's solo in the song adds nothing. He has a unique voice but it's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> can see myself listening to, he isn't a great singer, but I can see how his vocals change the track." [...] German portal Mix1 awarded [...] "Baby, It's OK" [...] with seven out of eight stars when reporting about its release.|$|E

500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."

500|$|In October 2017, former New York Times {{reporter}} Sharon Waxman {{wrote on}} TheWrap that, {{when she looked}} into the allegations of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein in 2004, Russell Crowe and Damon made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of Miramax Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo, whom she suspected of having [...] "no film experience" [...] and whose [...] "real job was {{to take care of}} Weinstein’s women needs" [...] in Europe. Damon responded in an interview with Deadline, [...] "For the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that... It’s <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> would do, for anybody". He said that he had known Lombardo [...] "in a professional capacity" [...] while working on The Talented Mr. Ripley, so he called the reporter and relayed his experience with Lombardo at Weinstein's request. [...] "That was the extent of it....I’m sure I mentioned to her that I didn’t know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn’t." [...] Waxman has since endorsed Damon’s statement on Twitter.|$|E
500|$|Zero has {{received}} a mixed reaction from western video game critics. GamesRadar's Becky Cunningham praised Tara Platt's performance in the role, and that her relationship with Mikhail helped humanize her. GameSpot's Heidi Kemps found Zero entertaining despite her negative portrayal, enjoying the points where she breaks the fourth wall to critique the game's puzzles and finding that she [...] "related to [...] as the game progressed, which is <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> typically feel for antihero characters." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling found that Zero's presence turned the game into [...] "a jet-black comedy", comparing her favorably to Jordan Belfort: while both unlikable characters, there was [...] "something magnetic about their horribleness". Destructoid's Chris Carter commended Drakengard 3 and Zero, saying [...] " [...] was drawn into [...] world and its cast of characters, and I wanted to see Zero's journey through from start to finish." [...] This view was shared by Will Borger of Gaming Bolt, who called story, characters, world, and in particular Zero, the reasons for playing the game. In addition, he felt that players would find themselves relating to her more as the story progressed.|$|E

500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What did I know about chronic clinical depression? [...] She kind of needed someone to take care of her.

500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E

The agreement on a date comes between various parties at Sony, and it’s not necessarily a date I would be hoping for. March would've been too early. We could have produced the game in time to make that deadline, but the finished product wouldn't have had everything that I wanted to include." [...] Sony Computer Entertainment has certain control over the release dates of their games, this {{could be one of the}} contributing factors delaying Gran Turismo 5.

[...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> changed purposefully", Spears said of the album's sound and added: [...] "It's just something that kind of changed on itself with me being older.

[...] One of its producers, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins talked about working with Spears on a Rolling Stones cover, stating: [...] "It's going to shock everybody", adding: [...] "It has flavors of the original, but it's a straight 2000 version — new to the ear. Which I think is cool, because people who appreciate that song are going to love it. And I made it so new and young that the young kids that love Britney are going to love it. It's going to grab both a mature and young audience." [...] Spears also worked with Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, telling MTV News: [...] "When you hear the song, it's so pure and delicate. It's just one of those songs that pull you in", and added: [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen … they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think.
