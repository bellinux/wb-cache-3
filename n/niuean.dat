25|$|Niue, whose {{capital is}} {{the village of}} Alofi, is a self-governing state in free {{association}} with New Zealand; and New Zealand conducts most diplomatic relations (though not all) on its behalf. Niueans are citizens of New Zealand, and Queen Elizabeth II is head of state in her capacity as Queen of New Zealand. Between 90–95% of <b>Niuean</b> people live in New Zealand, along with about 70% of the speakers of the <b>Niuean</b> language. A bilingual country, Niue has over 30% of its population speak both <b>Niuean</b> and English, though the percentage of monolingual English-speaking people is only 11%, while 46% are monolingual <b>Niuean</b> speakers.

50|$|Around {{midnight on}} Saturday 15 August 1953, Resident Commissioner Cecil Hector (Hec) Watson Larsen {{was murdered in}} his bed by 3 <b>Niueans</b> who had escaped from Niue’s jail. Larsen (born 1908) had been Resident since 1943, and treated Niue as his own fief, using prisoners, whom he had arrested, convicted and jailed on minor charges, for labour in his own house and garden, or to chase and return his golf balls he hit on the prison farm. A 7pm curfew was imposed on all natives, and, {{although}} <b>Niueans</b> were prohibited (until 1964) from making, possessing or drinking alcohol (in early 1950 one Mohetu was given 90 days hard labour for possessing a bottle of yeast, an ingredient for home-brew beer), the European New Zealand colonial personnel often got drunk, and Larsen would taunt the prisoners while drinking in front of them. He also physically and verbally abused them (swearing was a jailable offence for <b>Niueans),</b> as did his wife Jessie.|$|R

25|$|A {{delegation}} {{from the}} government of Niue travelled to Tonga to try and persuade Royal Tongan to continue flying to Niue from Tonga past 28 October 2002; that date on which the flights were to cease, and Polynesian Airlines would begin jet service to Auckland. Royal Tongan told the <b>Niuean</b> government that it could no longer justify the service.|$|E
25|$|The next notable European {{visitors}} {{represented the}} London Missionary Society; {{they arrived in}} 1846 on the Messenger of Peace. After many {{years of trying to}} land a European missionary, a <b>Niuean</b> named Nukai Peniamina was taken to Samoa and trained as a pastor at the Malua Theological College. Peniamina returned as a missionary with the help of Toimata Fakafitifonua. He was finally allowed to land in Uluvehi Mutalau after a number of attempts in other villages had failed. The chiefs of Mutalau village allowed him to land and assigned over 60 warriors to protect him day and night at the fort in Fupiu.|$|E

Niue Island Organic Farmers Association is currently paving way to a Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) committed to making Niue the world's first fully organic nation by 2020. A leader in green growth, Niue is also transitioning to solar power, with help from the European Union. Niue aims to become 80% renewable by 2025. On the other hand, Niue currently deals with one of the highest rates of greenhouse gas production per capita in the world (second only to Kuwait and Brunei). In 2015, Niue started providing phone landlines to all of its inhabitants. In 2008, Niue {{became the first}} country in the world where laptops are provided to all school students. A small and highly democratic nation, Niueans enjoy high freedom, and elections are held every 3 years. There are no political parties in Niue; all assembly members are independents.

2500|$|Christianization of Niutao {{began in}} 1861, {{with the first}} {{introduction}} by the traders Mr Tom and Mr Jack {{with the help of}} Mr Ah Fong and Mr Tong. [...] Mose, from Vaitupu, helped persuade the chiefs and people of Niutao to accept Christianity. The first preachers were a Samoan missionary and a <b>Niuean</b> missionary. Tapumanaia Kitiona was the Samoan missionary on Niutao who arrived in 1865 after graduating from Malua Theological College in Samoa. The Reverend A. W. Murray, of the London Missionary Society, visited in 1866. Murray reported that a blackbirder (a slave ship seeking to kidnap workers to mine the guano deposits on the Chincha Islands in Peru) had called but no islanders were taken by the blackbirders because of the actions of McKenzie, the resident trader. In 1870, Tapu of Samoa and Sione of Niue, two teachers from the Samoa Fono Tele (General Assembly of Samoan Churches) were delivered to Niutao by the Reverend J. Whitmee.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred fifty}} Polynesians from five {{different}} island groups (Samoans, Maoris, <b>Niueans,</b> Cook Islanders, and Tongans) were surveyed {{for the presence}} of an Asian-specific length mutation of mitochondrial (mt) DNA by using enzymatic amplification with thermostable Taq DNA polymerase. Ninety-three percent of Polynesians exhibited this 9 -bp deletion, including 100 % of Samoans, Maoris, and <b>Niueans.</b> The same deletion was also found in 8 % of Tolais from New Britain and in 14 % of coastal New Guineans. A deletion frequency of 82 % in Fijians confirmed their ethnic affinity to Polynesians. In contrast, the deletion was absent in 30 New Guinea highlanders and 31 Australian aborigines, the only exception being an aborigine who also had the Southeast Asian triplicated zeta-globin gene rearrangement in his nuclear DNA. These data support the theories claiming that an independent group of pre-Polynesian ancestors who colonized into the Pacific were ultimately derived from east Asia...|$|R
25|$|Remittances from expatriates were a {{major source}} of foreign {{exchange}} in the 1970s and early 1980s. Continuous migration to New Zealand has shifted most members of nuclear and extended families there, removing the need to send remittances back home. In the late 1990s, PFTAC conducted studies on the balance of payments, which confirmed that <b>Niueans</b> are receiving few remittances but are sending more money overseas.|$|R

5000|$|Recent {{maternal}} mitochondrial DNA {{analysis suggests}} that Polynesians, including Samoans, Tongans, <b>Niueans,</b> Cook Islanders, Tahitians, Hawaiians, Marquesans and Māori, are genetically linked to indigenous peoples {{of parts of}} Southeast Asia including those of Taiwanese aborigines. This DNA evidence is supported by linguistic and archaeological evidence. [...] Recent studies into paternal Y chromosome analysis shows that Polynesians are also genetically linked to peoples of Melanesia.|$|R
50|$|Niue began {{permitting}} the immigration of limited numbers of Indian workers, {{as well as}} Indonesians and Filipinos, in 2006, to replace the shortage of labour caused by the emigration of <b>Niueans</b> to New Zealand and Australia. In that year, 20 Indian Sikhs moved to Niue to work for an Indo-Niuean joint venture company that grows vanilla and noni (Morinda citrifolia). There is also a small Indian community of professionals in Niue.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{previously}} known as Ululauta and Matahefonua. Ululauta and Matahefonua both mean [...] "head of the land".

5000|$|The {{island in}} recent years has {{suffered}} a serious loss of population because of migration of <b>Niueans</b> to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism. An initiative into the financial services industry was dropped under pressure from the US Treasury. More recently [...] the sale of Internet domain names under the NU top level domain has brought in some income. These domains are particularly popular in Scandinavia, Belgium and the Netherlands, since nu means [...] "now" [...] in Dutch and the Scandinavian languages.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Niueans</b> in Niue and New Zealand, King Koroki Mahuta (the Maori king), {{as well as}} churches, unions, {{and other}} groups, began to {{petition}} the government for clemency from late 1953. Public unease at the recent reintroduction of capital punishment was heightened when, in a single announcement, the Prime Minister Sidney Holland refused to commute the Niueans’ death sentences, but did commute to life imprisonment a death sentence on a European murderer who had strangled to elderly Napier women {{as part of a}} robbery to pay her gambling debts. The Auckland Star ran editorials suggesting latent racism in the justice system in both New Zealand and the Cook Islands, such that 3 Europeans convicted of the same crime would never be hanged. In February 1954, more fuel was added to this fire when another European, who had stabbed to death his pregnant girlfriend, was reprieved, while ‘Darkie’ Whiteland, a mentally disturbed Maori was hanged. [...] <b>Niueans</b> were solidly against the hangings occurring on Niue. The New Zealand government had already tried to enact legislation to allow the hangings to occur in New Zealand, but this fell through, so on 31 December 1953, the 3 were shipped to Samoa to hang, out of the way during the Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation tour of the Commonwealth.|$|R
