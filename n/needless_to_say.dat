5|$|While {{equality}} jurisprudence primarily centres {{around a}} pledge of {{the protection of}} equal laws, laws frequently classify individuals out of necessity. <b>Needless</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{the very idea of}} classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. Therein lies the paradox of equality jurisprudence. The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated for the purpose of the law and none who are not.|$|E
5|$|His {{first great}} coup was when in 1834 he {{successfully}} bought out the Morris Canal and Banking Company, machinations which pushed {{its stock price}} from $10 ($ today) per share in December 1834 to $185 ($ today) a share in January 1835, at which point Little chose to collect his debts. Although theoretically he could have asked for more (he was, after all, in total control of the company), Little chose not to force the issue because he feared the resulting bankruptcies would destabilize the market potentially cause a collapse. He repeated this feat in September of the same year, cornering stocks {{for the construction of}} the Harlem Railroad. Approximately 60,000 shares had been sold short by that time, but only 7,000 shares had yet been issued; <b>needless</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Little prospered immensely.|$|E

5|$|Athens had {{recently}} become a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In their fight {{to establish the}} democracy, the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid (which {{was not in the}} end needed), in return for submitting to Persian overlordship. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. <b>Needless</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> the Athenians had baulked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes, unsurprisingly, was {{not pleased}} with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army. Cleomenes's {{attempts}} to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian Empire. Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him a 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced to. However, they were severely censured for this {{when they returned to}} Athens. At some point later Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. <b>Needless</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> the Athenians balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of Athens no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt; especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
