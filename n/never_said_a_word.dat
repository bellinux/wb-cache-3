5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
25|$|The Lausanne conference {{convened in}} late 1922 {{to settle the}} terms of a new treaty that would take the place of the Treaty of Sèvres. Inönü became famous for his {{stubborn}} resolve in determining Ankara's position as the legitimate, sovereign government of Turkey. After delivering his position, Inönü turned off his hearing aid during the speeches of British foreign secretary Lord Curzon. When the secretary had finished, Inönü reiterated his position as if Lord Curzon had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
500|$|As a person, West {{was often}} {{described}} as an introverted and nervous character, but who also drew highest praise for his uncompromising work ethic. Regarding his shyness, WVU roommate Jody Gardner testified that West never dated in his entire freshman year, and Lakers coach Fred Schaus once recalled a two-week period when his guard <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Apart from being shy, West was always restless: Schaus described him as a [...] "bundle of nerves", Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy as [...] "always on the move", and fellow Laker and Mountaineer Rod Hundley testified that during bar visits, West would quickly squirm and demand to go elsewhere before everybody else had settled. His first wife Martha Kane recalled that her husband often had difficulties opening up to her. After a big loss, the Wests would drive home and she would try to console him, but West would say [...] "get out" [...] at the home porch and drive away—an experience that [...] "killed" [...] her as a wife.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{career at}} the Met, however, was not without its ups-and-downs. Flagstad got {{involved}} in a long-running feud with tenor co-star Lauritz Melchior after Melchior took offense to some comments Flagstad made about [...] "stupid publicity photos" [...] during a game of bridge in Flagstad's hotel suite while the two were on tour together in Rochester, NY. Present during the infamous bridge game were Flagstad, Melchior and his wife, and Edwin McArthur. Afterwards, Melchior fanned the flames further by insisting that there be no solo curtain calls for Flagstad when the two performed together. Audiences had no clue that, despite the marvelous and sometimes historic performances, the two <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to each other off stage {{for the next two}} years. It was Flagstad's husband Henry Johansen who finally brought the two together to make peace. Flagstad also feuded with the Met's general manager, Edward Johnson, after conductor Artur Bodanzky's death, when she asked to be conducted for a few performances by her accompanist, Edwin McArthur, rather than by the Met's new conductor Erich Leinsdorf. Flagstad had wanted this for McArthur, whom she had taken under her wing. Johnson refused and would not hear of it any further. Flagstad did get her way, though; she went over Johnson's head and discussed the matter with the Met's board of directors, particularly David Sarnoff, RCA and NBC founder and chairman. It was Sarnoff who made the arrangements for McArthur to begin conducting Met productions on a limited basis. Her relationship with Johnson improved, however; just before Flagstad left the Met in 1941, on the night of her 100th performance of Isolde ...|$|E
