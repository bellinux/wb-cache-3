The viruses, which had been obtained by recombination (reassortment) at 25 [deg] between contemporary epidemic wild-type strains and cold-adapted A/Ann Arbor/ 6 / 60 (H 2 N 2), followed by selection for growth at 25 [deg] of virus with wild-type HA and <b>NA,</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> highly restricted genetic composition. Eighteen of the thirty-five recombinants had RNAs coding for the three polymerase (P) proteins, NP, M, and NS, from the cold-adapted mutant A/Ann Arbor/ 6 / 60 had only the HA and NA of the wild-type strains. Only 4 out of 64 theoretically possible combinations of genes coding for nonglycoprotein viral products were detected. The restricted genetic composition of cold-adapted recombinants produced at 25 [deg] supports the evaluation of this method of preparing live vaccine strains to determine whether recombinants with constant gene composition have predictable levels of attenuation for man...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To compare, {{clinically}} and biometrically, affected {{and fellow}} acute primary angle-closure (APAC) eyes and glaucomatous eyes with narrow angle (NA). Methods: Comparative case series; 30 patients with APAC and 27 glaucomatous patients with NA were evaluated. Keratometry (K), central corneal thickness (CCT), lens thickness (LT), axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured. Parameters defined as lens posisiton (LP) and relative lens position (RLP) were calculated. Results: Biometric difference between APAC-affected and fellow eyes was {{found only in}} LP (P= 0. 046). When fellow eyes were compared to glaucomatous eyes with NA, {{differences were found in}} ACD (P= 0. 009), AL (P= 0. 010), and LT/AL (P= 0. 005). The comparison between APAC-affected and glaucomatous eyes with NA showed significant differences in almost all biometric parameters, except for LT (P= 0. 148) and RLP (P= 0. 374). We found that the logistic regression model (LRM), built with three parameters (K, CCT and LT/AL), higher than 0. 334 could be a reasonable instrument to differentiate APAC eyes from glaucomatous eyes with NA. Conclusions: This study showed that APAC-affected and fellow eyes have similar biometric features, and glaucomatous eyes with <b>NA</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> less crowded anterior segment. The LRM built showed promising results in distinguishing APAC from glaucomatous eyes with NA...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} temperature () of superconductivity in A 3 C 60 compounds is generally lower smaller with alkali atoms (A). Furthermore decreases with applied pressure. In the BCS model, these trends are {{explained by the}} lower density of states at the Fermi level for a decreased lattice constant (R). There {{is more than one}} counterexample, however, suggesting that BCS does not give the whole truth. The most important one is that the compound with the largest lattice constant, Cs 3 C 60, is not superconducting at all at ambient pressure. In this paper we derive a novel model where a negative lattice contribution to Hubbard U, proportional to 1 /R, is taken into account. It is possible to explain why A 3 C 60 compounds with A = Li, and <b>Na</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> low or are not superconducting at all, and why Cs 3 C 60 is superconducting only at applied pressure and then with the highest of all C 60 alkali fullerides. It is concluded that the density of states mechanism derived in the BCS model is in doubt. Nevertheless superconductivity in A 3 C 60 depends on electron-phonon coupling.

40|$|Trabajo presentado en la EGU General Assemby 2014, celebrada del 27 de abril al 2 de mayo de 2014 en Viena (Austria) Prevailing winds {{over the}} North Atlantic (<b>NA)</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> direct {{influence}} on the location and intensity of the Gulf Stream (GS) by the transfer of momentum between atmosphere and ocean. Therefore, the study of interannual variability of the GS requires the identification of sources of variability within the atmospheric circulation. Various studies have highlighted {{the impact of the}} North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on the variability of the GS transport. However, there is still no scientific consensus thereupon. On the one hand, several scientific papers (Sato & Rossby, 1995; Curry & McCartney, 2001; deCoëtlogon et al., 2006) exhibit a decrease of the GS transport during low NAO periods, as well as a higher transport during high NAO phases. On the second hand, studies of Gangopadhyay et al. (1992), Baringer & Larsen (2001) and DiNezio et al. (2009) suggest a lower transport during positive phases of the NAO. Finally, Chaudhuri et al. (2011) obtained a more complex conclusion, whereby the influence of the NAO is different upstream and downstream of Cape Hatteras. This currently limited understanding of the links between the NAO and the GS in NA, impels us to further analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of the GS. Our main purpose in this study is to reconstruct a spatially continuous field of ocean (sub) surface circulation in the NA from in situ time series of discrete steps, in order to accurately quantify the position and intensity of the GS since 1900. From there, {{we will be able to}} examine the correlation of this current with the NAO. To this end, we used the DIVA (Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis) tool, which is a numerical implementation of the variational inverse method (VIM) using the finite elements method to reconstruct continuous fields from discrete measurements. These measurements of temperature, salinity and currents since the beginning of the last century originate from several data bases, such as WOD (World Ocean Database, NOAA), SeaDataNet, ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), Hydrobase 3 and ARGO buoys but also from the Norwegian Marine Data centre (NMD) of the Institute of Marine Research. The exact duplicates have been removed from these data sets, while the near duplicates (considering space and time) have been subjected to a specific algorithm removing the vast majority of them. The type of instrument (CTD, XBT, [...] .) was also taken into account when attributing the relative weights to observations, following the accuracy of these ones. The signal-to-noise ratio as well as the correlation length have been optimized for each vertical level (15 layers, from 0 to 3000 m depth) and filtered vertically to avoid unrealistic discontinuity. Then, a reference field has been created with DIVA for the whole period (1900 - 2013) in order to work with anomalies with respect to this averaged field. After the handling of Arctic sea ice, the analyzes of temperature and salinity gives us high-resolution gridded fields for every month since 1900, which allow us to reconstruct in 4 D the speed and direction of the GS thanks to the geostrophic approximationPeer reviewe...|$|E
