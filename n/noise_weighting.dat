25|$|A-weighting {{began with}} work by Fletcher and Munson which {{resulted}} in their publication, in 1933, {{of a set of}} equal-loudness contours. Three years later these curves were used in the first American standard for sound level meters. This ANSI standard, later revised as ANSI S1.4-1981, incorporated B-weighting as well as the A-weighting curve, recognising the unsuitability of the latter for anything other than low-level measurements. But B-weighting has since fallen into disuse. Later work, first by Zwicker and then by Schomer, attempted to overcome the difficulty posed by different levels, and work by the BBC resulted in the CCIR-468 weighting, currently maintained as ITU-R 468 <b>noise</b> <b>weighting,</b> which gives more representative readings on noise as opposed to pure tones.|$|E
25|$|ITU-R 468 <b>noise</b> <b>weighting</b> was {{therefore}} developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness {{of all types}} of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI) and, , is maintained by the ITU. It became widely used in Europe, especially in broadcasting, and was adopted by Dolby Laboratories who realised its superior validity for their purposes when measuring noise on film soundtracks and compact cassette systems. Its advantages over A-weighting is less understood in the US, where the use of A-weighting still predominates. It is universally used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.|$|E

In this paper, we present results on two important aspects in online learning algorithms based on combining <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection and <b>weight</b> decay. Through intensive computer simulations, the convergence behaviors of those algorithms and the performance of the NNs generated by these algorithms are elucidated. It is found that (i) the online learning algorithm based on purely multiplicative <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection does not converge, (ii) the algorithms combining <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection and <b>weight</b> decay exhibit better convergence behaviors than their pure <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection counterparts, and (iii) the neural networks attained by those algorithms combining <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection and <b>weight</b> decay show better fault tolerance abilities than the neural networks attained by the pure <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection-based algorithms. These empirical results not just can supplement our recent work done on the convergence behaviors of the <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection-based learning algorithms [16], but also provide new information on effect of <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> and <b>weight</b> decay on the neural networks that are generated by these algorithms...|$|R

2500|$|The self-noise or {{equivalent}} input noise level {{is the sound}} level that creates the same output voltage as the microphone does {{in the absence of}} sound. This represents the lowest point of the microphone's dynamic range, and is particularly important should you wish to record sounds that are quiet. The measure is often stated in dB(A), which is the equivalent loudness of the noise on a decibel scale frequency-weighted for how the ear hears, for example: [...] "15dBA SPL" [...] (SPL means sound pressure level relative to 20micropascals). The lower the number the better. Some microphone manufacturers state the noise level using ITU-R 468 <b>noise</b> <b>weighting,</b> which more accurately represents the way we hear noise, but gives a figure some 11–14dB higher. A quiet microphone typically measures 20dBA SPL or 32dB SPL 468-weighted. Very quiet microphones have existed for years for special applications, such the Brüel & Kjaer 4179, with a noise level around 0dB SPL. Recently some microphones with low noise specifications have been introduced in the studio/entertainment market, such as models from Neumann and Røde that advertise noise levels between 5–7dBA. Typically this is achieved by altering the frequency response of the capsule and electronics to result in lower noise within the A-weighting curve while broadband noise may be increased.|$|E

In this paper, four different online <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection training algorithms for multilayer perceptron (MLP) are analyzed and their objective functions are derived. Most importance, the objective function of injecting multiplicative <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> during training is shown {{to be different from}} the prediction error of a trained MLP if its weights are injected by the same multiplicative <b>weight</b> <b>noise.</b> It provides a firm response to a question being posed for 14 years [8]: Can deterministic penalty terms model the effects of synaptic <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> on network fault-tolerance?. Besides, we show that the objective function of injecting additive <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> during training is equivalent to adding a regularizer penalizing the magnitude of the gradient vector of the MLP output with respect to its weight vector.

40|$|Abstract. While injecting <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> during {{training}} {{has been proposed}} {{for more than a}} decade to improve the convergence, generalization and fault tolerance of a neural network, not much theoretical work has been done to its convergence proof and the objective function that it is minimizing. By applying the Gladyshev Theorem, it is shown that the convergence of injecting <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> {{during training}} an RBF network is almost sure. Besides, the corresponding objective function is essentially the mean square errors (MSE). This objective function indicates that injecting <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> during training an radial basis function (RBF) network is not able to improve fault tolerance. Despite this technique has been effectively applied to multilayer perceptron, further analysis on the expected update equation of training MLP with <b>weight</b> <b>noise</b> injection is presented.
