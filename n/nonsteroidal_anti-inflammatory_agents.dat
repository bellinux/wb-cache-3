40|$|Abstract: Ketorolac tromethamine, a new <b>nonsteroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>agent</b> of the pyrrolo-pyrrole group, was assayed for {{inhibitory}} {{effects on}} polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) {{in a variety}} of systems.

Ketorolac also inhibited phorbol myristate ace-tate-stimulated adherence of PMN to bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a {{class of}} nuclear {{transcription}} factors that are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. One of these, PPARγ, regulates responsiveness to insulin in adipose cells, and PPARγ-activating drugs such as pioglitazone {{are used in the}} treatment of type 2 diabetes. PPARγ acts in myeloid-lineage cells, including T-cells and macrophages, to suppress their activation and their elaboration of inflammatory molecules. PPARγ activation also suppresses the activated phenotype in microglia, suggesting that PPARγ-activating drugs may be of benefit in chronic neuroinflammatory diseases. Some, but not all, <b>nonsteroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>agents</b> (indomethacin and ibuprofen in particular) also have activating effects on PPARγ. Discussion and conclusions These observations suggest on the one hand a role for PPARγ-activating drugs in the treatment of chronic neuroinflammatory diseases-as shown for a patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis by Pershadsingh et al. in this issue of the Journal of Neuroinflammation-and suggest on the other hand a possible explanation for confusing and contradictory results in trials of <b>nonsteroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>agents</b> in Alzheimer's disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Indomethacin, a <b>nonsteroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>agent,</b> is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of ovulation in vertebrates. The presumptive ob-ligate anovulatory mode of indomethacin action is via suppres-sion of ovarian prostaglandin production. We report that a very high systemic dose of indomethacin (800 mg i. m.) is required to block ovulation in gonadotropin-treated anestrous ewes. A lower dose of indomethacin (200 mg), which negated the preovulatory rise in follicular prostaglandin (PGF 2 a) biosynthesis, did not pre-vent ovulation. Endothelial secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a within the apical follicular wall (prospective site of rup-ture) was not altered by indomethacin; notwithstanding, the ap-optosis (DNA-fragmentation) -inducing effect of TNF-a (a deter-minant of ovulatory stigma formation) was attenuated by 800 (but not 200) mg indomethacin. A suprapharmacological con-centration of indomethacin also was necessary to protect ovar-ian surface epithelial cells from a (prostaglandin-independent) cytotoxic effect of TNF-a in vitro. It is concluded that indo-methacin inhibits ovulation by anti-apoptotic mechanisms that can be dissociated from the paradigm of prostanoid down-reg-ulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} airway inflammation {{for the development of}} late asthmatic reactions, we examined sensitized subjects during late asthmatic reactions induced by exposure to toluene diisocyanate (TDI) in the laboratory. Late asthmatic reactions are associated with a transient increase of bronchial responsiveness and, at the same time, with an increase of neutrophils followed by eosinophils, and of LTB 4 and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Late asthmatic reactions, increased bronchial responsiveness, and increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, LTB 4, and albumin concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage induced by exposure to TDI are all prevented by pretreatment with prednisone but not with the <b>nonsteroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>agent</b> indomethacin. Aerosolized steroids (beclomethasone and dexamethasone isonicotinate) completely inhibit late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI, whereas theophylline has a partial, and verapamil, ketotifen, and cromolyn have no protective effect. These results suggest that late asthmatic reactions induced by TDI may be caused by airway inflammation, and that anti-inflammatory steroids should be recommended in the prophylaxis of TDI asthma...|$|R

40|$|Gastric acid is {{believed}} to be an important etiological factor in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus. Pulsatile acid exposure increases cell proliferation in ex vivo Barrrett's tissue and normalization of esophageal pH reverses this. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the mainstay of therapy in Barrett's esophagus, and have numerous beneficial effects including symptom control, reduction of inflammation, and promotion of the development of squamous islands. However, PPI therapy causes hypergastrinemia and has not prevented recent increase in the incidences of esophageal cancer. Additionally, evidence presented here by Feagins et al. suggests that acid exposure has a p 53 -mediated, antiproliferative effect on a nondysplastic Barrett's epithelial cell line, an effect that acid suppression might abrogate.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} antiasthma drugs on asthmatic reactions and airway inflammation, we studied several groups of sensitized subjects treated with active drugs or placebo before and after exposure to toluene diisocyanate in the laboratory. We observed that the steroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>agent</b> prednisone, but not the <b>nonsteroidal</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>agent</b> indomethacin, inhibits the late (but not the early) asthmatic reactions induced by TDI. Prednisone also inhibits the increase of bronchial responsiveness and the increase of neutrophils, eosinophils, and albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that are associated with late asthmatic reactions induced by exposure to TDI. Beclomethasone has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on TDI-induced late asthmatic reactions, whereas theophylline has a partial inhibitory effect on both early and late asthmatic reactions, and verapamil, ketotifen, cromolyn. Beta 2 -adrenergic agonists have variable effects: salbutamol has no effect on early and late asthmatic reactions by itself, but it potentiates the inhibitory effect of low doses of beclomethasone. Broxaterol inhibits early asthmatic reactions, but has no effect on the late asthmatic reactions and the associated inflammatory response. These results suggest that, in sensitized subjects, late asthmatic reactions induced by toluene diisocyanate can be prevented by steroidal <b>anti-inflammatory</b> <b>agents,</b> whereas early asthmatic reactions may be prevented either by an association of inhaled steroids and beta-adrenergic agonists, or by beta-adrenergic agonists (e. g., broxaterol) with more complex mechanisms of action...|$|R

In the present study, we assessed whether indomethacin can inhibit salmonella-induced intestinal secretion when administered after infection and net intestinal secretion are well established. A physiological model of salmonellosis, salmonella-infected rhesus monkeys, was used. This model also permitted an examination of the effects of indomethacin in both the small and large intestines. The effect of indomethacin in control monkeys was also studied. Indomethacin caused a striking enhancement of net intestinal water transport in the jejunum,, ileum, and colon of salmonella-infected monkeys. These effects occurred promptly and were of sufficient magnitude in the ileum and colon to cause a reversal in the direction of net transport from net secretion to net absorption. Indomethacin also enhanced net water transport in the jejunum ileum, and colon of normal animals.

A total number of 24 rats were used, randomly assigned to one of four groups of 6 rats each. Group 1 : colitis without treatment (disease control), group 2 : normal animals (control), group 3 : induction of experimental colitis treated with methylprednisolone (5. 3 x 10 - 3 mmol/kg i. v., every day for 7 days) and group 4 : induction of experimental colitis plus administration of compound A (0. 6 mmol/kg i. v., every day for 7 days). The administration of compound A resulted in a statistically significant reduction (p< 0. 05) of the histological damage (score) and the levels of serum TNF-ᬠcompared to controls. This beneficial effect was probably due to the combination in a single molecule of the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant properties and the basic character of this compound.
