5|$|<b>Now</b> <b>imagine</b> a {{stack of}} {{hyperbolic}} disks where each disk represents {{the state of the}} universe at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid cylinder in which any cross section is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder {{plays an important role in}} the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is curved in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.|$|E

Student radio stations include Fuse FM at the University of Manchester and MMU Radio at the Manchester Metropolitan University. A community radio network is coordinated by Radio Regen, with stations covering Ardwick, Longsight and Levenshulme (All FM 96.9) and Wythenshawe (Wythenshawe FM 97.2). Defunct radio stations include Sunset 102, which became Kiss 102, then Galaxy Manchester), and KFM which became Signal Cheshire (<b>now</b> <b>Imagine</b> FM). These stations and pirate radio {{played a significant role in}} the city's house music culture, the Madchester scene, which was based in clubs like The Haçienda.|$|E

25|$|The most {{defining}} {{property of}} modernity, according to Giddens, {{is that we}} are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can <b>now</b> <b>imagine</b> what other spaces look like, even if he has never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|<b>Now</b> <b>imagine</b> {{that this}} woman grows up and has {{children}} with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing {{one or the other}} of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, these children have a chance of getting either brown or red hair, since they could get a genotype of BB = brown hair, Bb = brown hair or bb = red hair. In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the recessive allele showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have red hair like their grandfather.|$|E
25|$|<b>Now,</b> <b>imagine</b> {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), {{to the state of}} the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E
25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. <b>Now</b> <b>imagine</b> the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer.|$|E

It all came of her having allowed her niece to associate with those children at Bournemouth. She would be more careful for the future.|$|R
50|$|Worse, Arthur {{reveals that}} he had been {{recording}} the entire episode on tape, with which he blackmails Louise. Louise, hysterical at the collapse of her plan, chases her husband with the gun. A brief struggle ensues, and she is shot dead. Ironically, Louise's accidental death implicates Arthur for murdering her. Arthur was only bluffing about the tape, leaving no evidence that the shooting was an accident other than the word of Jackie, his mistress. All of the evidence points to Arthur deliberately murdering his wife. Arthur <b>now</b> <b>imagines</b> himself in court, his imaginary self now his prosecutor.|$|R

He was captured in the Korean War and was brainwashed into becoming a Communist. Stuart was ordered to indoctrinate a fellow prisoner, but instead the prisoner's unwavering patriotism reformed him. Stuart's captors pronounced him insane and he was returned to the US in a prisoner exchange, after which he received a dishonorable discharge and was publicly reviled as a traitor.

500|$|Bush {{appeared}} on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, {{along with the}} former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, [...] "I don't think it's {{good for the country}} to have a former president criticize his successor." [...] Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Barack Obama {{at a meeting of the}} Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: [...] "You think the Middle East is chaotic <b>now?</b> <b>Imagine</b> what it looks like for our grandchildren. That's how Americans should view the deal." [...] Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a [...] "strategic blunder", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.|$|E

2500|$|A power-law [...] has a {{well-defined}} mean over [...] only if , {{and it has}} a finite variance only if most identified power laws in nature have exponents such that the mean is well-defined but the variance is not, implying they are capable of black swan behavior.

Suppose you don't believe in gravity: jump over a cliff and you'll still fall. Natural science {{is the study}} of facts of this kind. [...] "Institutional facts" [...] are fictions accorded factual status within human social institutions. Monetary and commercial facts are fictions of this kind. The complexities of today's global currency system are facts only while we believe in them: suspend the belief and the facts correspondingly dissolve. Yet although institutional facts rest on human belief, that doesn't make them mere distortions or hallucinations. Take my confidence that these two five-pound banknotes in my pocket are worth ten pounds. That's not merely my subjective belief: it's an objective, indisputable fact.

2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? <b>Now</b> <b>imagine</b> what it must be like to spend every day surrounded by people who don't know how to use the ATM." ...|$|E
