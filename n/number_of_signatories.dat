To this day such programs are funded by the Commonwealth Government. This <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatories</b> was a record which was only broken in 1993 by a petition calling for private health insurance to be tax deductible.|$|E

50|$|The {{ambiguous}} statement did {{not exclude}} other known evolutionary mechanisms, and most signatories were not scientists in relevant fields, but starting in 2004 the Institute claimed the increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> signatures indicated mounting doubts about evolution among scientists. The statement formed {{a key component}} of Discovery Institute campaigns to present intelligent design as scientifically valid by claiming that evolution lacks broad scientific support, with Institute members continued to cite the list through at least 2011. As part of a strategy to counter these claims, scientists organised Project Steve which gained more signatories named Steve (or variants) than the Institute's petition, and a counter-petition, A Scientific Support for Darwinism, which quickly gained similar <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatories.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In {{occupied}} Poland, {{the status}} of Volksdeutscher gave many privileges, but one big disadvantage: Volksdeutsche were subject to conscription into the German army. In occupied Pomerania, the Gauleiter of the Danzig-West Prussia region Albert Forster issued a secret order which mandated a creation of {{a list of people}} who were considered to be of German ethnicity, in 1941. Since the number of supposedly ethnic Germans who signed up voluntarily was insignificant by 1942, in February of that year Forster made signing of the Volksliste mandatory and empowered local police and other authorities to employ various methods, including physical force and threats, to implement the decree. Consequently, the initially insignificant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatories</b> rose to almost a million persons, or about 55% of the population by 1944.|$|E

30|$|While Paul Ginsparg at the Los Alamos National Laboratory {{started the}} “e-print archive” in 1991 by making physics preprints {{publicly}} available, {{it was impossible}} to foresee the future impact of the so-called open-access movement. The Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) 1 and the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities” 2 represented significant milestones of this development. Its current international impact is obvious if one takes into account the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatories</b> <b>of</b> the EU “Petition for Guaranteed Public Access to Publicly-funded Research Results”. 3 On a national level, the importance of open access is documented by the information platform open-access.net, 4 funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation, DFG) and supported by the German Rectors’ Conference, the Volkswagen Foundation, the Helmholtz Association, the Max Planck Society, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the German Initiative for Networked Information, and additionally by two learned societies of psychology and linguistics, others will probably follow soon.|$|R

40|$|International {{environmental}} agreements are increasingly {{important in a}} globalised economy. Beyond their specific interest, these agreements are also important {{in the context of}} coalition formation theory. Given the incentives to free ride, associated to the environment as a public good and to the presence of spillovers, the profitability and the optimality of {{environmental agreements}} are separated from their stability (i. e. self-enforcement) : hence, a whole set of political economy issues. This paper reviews the recent advances in this area. In particular it discusses mechanisms and strategies aimed at offsetting the incentives to free ride and increasing welfare, such as transfers, issue linkages, threats and multiple agreements. The main results show that partial coalitions and multiple agreements tend to prevail among subsets of players, and that agreements among all players are most unlikely to exist. The design of the agreements, moreover, can be crucial in determining the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatory</b> countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the conditions}} under which a group of firms has the incentive to sign a Voluntary Agreement (VA) in order to control its emission flows even in the presence of free-riding by other firms in the industry. For {{the purpose of this paper}} it is assumed that free-riders cannot be completely excluded from the expected benefits of the VA, which increase with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatory</b> firms and with the abatement level achieved. The paper focuses on policy design by discussing the features that a VA should possess in order to increase its economic and environmental effectiveness. The results support some important conclusions. First, VAs cannot emerge in the case of a pure public good, i. e. when spillovers are such that all firms benefit from the abatement <b>of</b> the <b>signatory</b> firms. Second, even in the case of partial spillovers, the regulator has to impose a minimum participation constraint for the VA to be signed. In this case, if the minimum participation constraint is met, all firms have an incentive to sign the VA. Third, a VA with a minimum amount of regulation improves welfare with respect to a VA in which firms are free to set their profit maximising abatement level...|$|R
40|$|Trans-national {{externalities}} {{are increasingly}} {{important in the}} globalized economy, being related to knowledge, information, migrations, pollution, crime and similar flows. Their importance and close link to economic development may affect growth and welfare at a macroeconomic level: hence the need for global policies to correct their undesired effects. In the present institutional setting- with no supranational governing bodies- global externalities cannot be corrected by global institutions,which do not exist, but need to be corrected by voluntary agreements among sovereign States. This situation gives rise to several difficulties and sub-optimal outcomes. This paper reviews some recent advances in this area, with special reference to coalition formation theory. In particular it discusses mechanisms and strategies aimed at offsetting the incentives to free-ride and/or exclude countries for international agreements, such as transfers, issue linkages, and treatise design. The main results show that, {{in the presence of}} global externalities, partial coalitions and multiple agreements tend to prevail among subsets of countries, and that agreements among all players are unlikely to exist. The design of the agreements, however, can be crucial in determining the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatory</b> countries and in promoting the creation of global institutions...|$|R

40|$|The {{premise of}} this {{dissertation}} is that Article 79 of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods-which concerns exemptions for contractual non-performance {{due to an}} ""impediment"" beyond a party's control-should be interpreted autonomously, that is, as an international norm, without reference to domestic legal concepts and principles. To this end, this dissertation considers the application of Article 79 by courts and arbitral tribunals across a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>signatory</b> states. By studying the treatment of Article 79 by the courts and arbitral tribunals of various states, differences in doctrine and case law have been discerned. The extent of conceptual differences towards the doctrine of excuses for nonperformance also helps {{to determine whether the}} CISG's goal of uniformity is achievable. This research concludes {{that there has been a}} convergence in the treatment of Article 79, and this supports the premise that a legal doctrine-in this case, the excuse for non- performance-germinating in various legal systems, ultimately evolved into an autonomous principle, towards a conceptual goal of uniformity in a body of international commercial law, regardless of its unique development in separate and distinct legal jurisdictions. ...|$|R
