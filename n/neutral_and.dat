5|$|As well as {{fighting}} demons, {{the protagonist}} can negotiate {{with them in}} a variety of ways: demons can be bribed, scared away, or recruited depending on responses given during conversation. After they are recruited, different demons can be fused together to create new demons. The new demon inherits skills from its parents, and some demons can only be obtained through fusion. The game includes 300 recruitable demons, all of which take inspiration from various world mythologies including Welsh, Egyptian, Norse, and Christian. Two main alignments govern the way demons must be approached: one that represents light, <b>neutral</b> <b>and</b> dark alignments; and one representing law, <b>neutral</b> <b>and</b> chaos alignments. The choices made in the story also effect how demons respond to player commands, and whether they will remain loyal. As with earlier titles, a Moon Phase divided into eight segments dictates how demons will behave. When the Moon is full, demons will refuse to talk. Fused demons can be shared between players using thirty-two character passwords generated when a new demon is fused. These passwords can be traded between different players.|$|E

These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is <b>neutral</b> <b>and</b> is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in the nitrogen cycle in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil (nitrogen fixation). In addition to being a model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. Azotobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria found in <b>neutral</b> <b>and</b> alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the inquiry}} opened, a poll was {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve the best deal it could for the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall <b>neutral</b> <b>and</b> Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of the inquiry examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E

5|$|David and Cowan {{finally left}} Antibes in May 1940, sailing to Corsica {{and then to}} Sicily. They had reached the Strait of Messina when Italy entered the war on 10 June. They were {{suspected}} of spying and were interned. After 19 days in custody {{in various parts of}} Italy, they were allowed to cross the border into Yugoslavia, which at that point remained <b>neutral</b> <b>and</b> non-combatant. They had lost almost everything they owned—the boat, money, manuscripts, notebooks, and David's cherished collection of recipes. With the help of the British Consul in Zagreb, they crossed into Greece, and arrived in Athens in July 1940. By this time, David was no longer in love with her partner but remained with him from necessity. Cowan found a job teaching English on the island of Syros, where David learnt to cook with the fresh ingredients available locally. When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, the couple managed to leave on a civilian convoy to Egypt.|$|E

The first book dealt directly with the advent of war in Norway, and was released in Swedish in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of Norway. It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948.

Although {{there is some}} previous work on vapor breakdown by microsecond laser pulses, {{there have been no}} attempts made on vapor breakdown by nanosecond laser pulses. This work intends to fill the gap. A kinetic model is developed considering following factors: (1) two temperatures of both electrons and heavy-body particles (ions, <b>neutrals,</b> <b>and</b> excited states of neutrals), (2) absorption mechanisms of laser energy include inverse bremstrahlung (IB) processes and photoionization of excited states, (3) ionization acceleration mechanisms included are electron-impact excitation of ground state neutrals, electron-impact ionization of exited states of neutrals, photoionization of excited states of <b>neutrals,</b> <b>and</b> all necessary reverse processes. The rates of various processes considered are calculated according to the formula given by Zel`dovich and Raizer. The authors use a second order predictor-corrector numerical scheme for iterations of the rate equations. The rate equations are solved for five quantities, namely, densities of electrons, <b>neutrals,</b> <b>and</b> excited states of <b>neutrals,</b> <b>and</b> the temperatures of electrons and heavy-body particles. The total breakdown times (sum of evaporation time and vapor breakdown time) at different energy fluences are then calculated. The results are compared with experimental observations of Si target ablation using a KrF laser. A more detailed description of the model and the results will be published later...|$|R
5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, <b>neutral,</b> <b>and</b> food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify who else has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is <b>neutral</b> <b>and</b> cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices, not to create more goods.|$|E
40|$|The {{success or}} failure of {{alternative}} dispute resolution (ADR) depends heavily on effective implementation, which in turn is founded on a good understanding of the principles and features of ADR. This paper reports a study on the features of ADR based on interviews with practitioners who have experience with using ADR in construction projects with a contract sum in excess of $HK 10 million. The interviews were conducted with 20 accredited mediators/arbitrators of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center (representing the <b>neutrals)</b> <b>and</b> 42 construction practitioners (representing the users). A total of 19 key features, identified and categorized in four categories - nature, <b>neutral,</b> settlement, <b>and</b> benefits - were prioritized according to their relative importance by using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The inconsistency ratio of the AHP helped ensure the reliability of the ranking scores mathematically. Six of the top eight features as ranked by the <b>neutrals</b> <b>and</b> the users are common to both groups. These are preservation of business relationship, enforceability, neutrality, cost to obtain, speed to obtain, and fairness. These suggest that the <b>neutrals</b> <b>and</b> users have similar expectations from ADR processes. The ranking also assists ADR process designers to focus on the fundamentals and avoid overly complicated processes. © ASCE. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
