In 1986, he released his DOS Houdini <b>network</b> <b>browser</b> program that supported 2500 topics cross-connected with 7500 links in each file along with hypertext links among unlimited numbers of external ASCII, batch, and other Houdini files, these capabilities were included in his then popular shareware DOS file browser programs HyperRez (memory resident) and PC Hypertext (which also added jumps to programs, editors, graphic files containing hot spots jumps, and cross-linked thesaurus/glossary files). These programs introduced many to the browser concept and 20 years later, Google still lists 3,000,000 references to PC Hypertext. In 1989, he created both HyperBBS and HyperLan which both allow multiple users to create/edit both topics and jumps for information and knowledge annealing which, in concept, the columnist John C.

40|$|AbstractLogic {{programming}} {{has great}} potential for reducing the cost of software development. We argue that, with an appropriate programming methodology, a logic programming system provides {{a powerful tool for}} rapid software prototyping. It is sufficiently formal and high-level to allow reasoning about specifications, and it provides an immediate operational validation of the programmer's intuitions. The methodology is introduced by means of an example larger than those usually used to illustrate the advantages of logic programming. We start with an informal specification of a structure-editor, show how it is formalized into a directly executable prototype, and introduce guidelines for validating logic programming code as implemented in Prolog. The developed prototype can be used for a number of applications: syntax-directed editor, semantic <b>network</b> <b>browser,</b> etc. The editor is compact but readable, and is quite efficient...|$|E

30|$|After MAS {{normalization}} of all Affymetrix microarray samples, outliers were detected using the arrayQualityMetricsBioconductor package, which uses three different statistical tests to identify outliers (Gentleman et al.[2004]; Kauffmann et al.[2009]). Seventy-four samples failed {{at least one}} test and were considered as outliers and removed from the dataset. As a result, a total of 1, 081 Affymetrix samples remained for co-expression analysis. For genes with multiple Affymetrixprobesets matched, the probeset with highest expression profile was used. There are several kinds of methods to evaluate the strength of co-expression, such as Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), mutual rank (MR) based on rank transformations of the weighted PCC (Obayashi and Kinoshita[2009]) and correspondence analysis (CA) (Yano et al.[2006]). Although PCC takes a long-calculation time and was considered to contain many false-positives (Hamada et al.[2011]; Obayashi et al.[2011]), it has been widely used as an index in the co-expression analysis, such as RiceArrayNet (Lee et al.[2009]), RiceXPro (Sato et al.[2011]) and Gene Co-expression <b>Network</b> <b>Browser</b> (Ficklin et al.[2010]). The success in functional study of plant genes using PCC has also been reported (Fujii et al.[2010]; Matsuura et al.[2010]; Soeno et al.[2010]). Therefore, we adopted PCC to measure tendency of co-expression between genes based on these 1, 081 Affymetrix samples. To choose an appropriate PCC cutoff value to construct co-expression network, we examined {{the changes in the}} node number, edge number, and network density as a function of PCC cutoff values. As the cutoff value increased, both the node number and edge number decreased; however, as the cutoff reached a relatively high value, the decreasing rate of edges became slower than that of nodes, which might lead to an increase in the network density. Indeed, the network density showed minima around 0.75 (general) and 0.8 (abiotic and biotic stresses) PCC cutoff values and increased thereafter. Therefore, we selected default values of the PCC cutoff as 0.75 and 0.8, for general and abiotic and biotic stresses, respectively. Cytoscape Web, an interactive web-based <b>network</b> <b>browser,</b> was used as the network viewer (Lopes et al.[2010]).|$|E

The following algorithms, such as neuron by neuron (NBN) [1][2], error back propagation (EBP), Levenberg Marquardt (LM) and its improved versions are implemented {{in two different}} computing methods, traditional forward-backward computation and newly developed forward-only computation.

There are several benefits that make this network training tool desirable.
