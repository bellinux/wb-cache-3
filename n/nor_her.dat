5|$|He {{was born}} into a {{military}} landowning family from the south of the Russian Empire, and followed the family tradition by entering the army. In 1903, he was noticed by Grand Duchess Olga during a military review, and they became close friends. Olga wanted to divorce her first husband, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, and marry Kulikovsky, but neither her husband <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> brother, the Tsar, would allow it.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{the name}} of Lady Saigō's mother <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> dates of birth or death are {{recorded}} in any existing documents, although {{it is known that}} she was the elder sister of Saigō Kiyokazu. Lady Saigō's father was Tozuka Tadaharu of Tōtōmi Province, under direct control of the Imagawa clan. The marriage between Tadaharu and his wife was very likely arranged by the Imagawa clan.|$|E

5|$|Hathaway wrote {{extensively}} about {{her relationship with}} her first husband in her 1961 autobiography. Dudley Beaumont, who served in the British army as an officer during the First World War, died on 24 November 1918 during the Spanish flu pandemic. His death left her a pregnant widow deprived of most of her income. Neither her father <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> father-in-law, the army officer William Spencer Beaumont, were willing to give financial support to the widow and her six surviving children. She learned German and started working for the YMCA in Cologne. She also worked for the British Army of the Rhine and raised prize cattle.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|Neither Henrietta Lacks <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> family {{gave her}} {{physicians}} permission to harvest her cells. At that time, permission was neither required nor customarily sought. The cells {{were used in}} medical research and for commercial purposes. In the 1980s, family medical records were published without family consent. A similar issue {{was brought up in}} the Supreme Court of California case of Moore v. Regents of the University of California in 1990. The court ruled that a person's discarded tissue and cells are not their property and can be commercialized.|$|E

5|$|Pelé had {{at least}} two more {{children}} from former affairs. Sandra Machado, who was born from an affair Pelé had in 1964 with her housemaid Anizia Machado, fought for years to be acknowledged by Pelé, who refused to submit to DNA tests. Although she was recognized by courts as his biologically daughter based on DNA evidence in 1993, Pelé never acknowledged his eldest daughter even after her death in 2006, <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> two children, Octavio and Gabriel. Pelé also had another daughter, Flávia Kurtz, in an extramarital affair in 1968 with journalist Lenita Kurtz. Flávia was recognized by him as his daughter.|$|E
5|$|White {{retired in}} 1965 after 48 years of {{teaching}} and administration. In her retirement, White {{was appointed to the}} university's Institute for Research in the Humanities. She suffered a heart attack in 1966, whereupon her health declined, though she continued to work at the university's Memorial Library. In the next spring, White became sick and died on June 7, 1967. Neither she <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> three siblings had married. A memorial service was held in Madison's St. Paul's University Chapel on May 19, 1968.|$|E
5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin IV died {{in early}} 1185. His successor, the child BaldwinV died {{in late summer}} 1186. The High Court of Jerusalem had ruled that neither BaldwinV's mother, Sybilla (who was Guy of Lusignan's wife), <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> sister, Isabella (who was the wife of Raynald's stepson), could be crowned without the {{decision}} of the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the kings of France and England about BaldwinV's lawful successor. However, Sybilla's uncle, JoscelinIII of Courtenay, took control of Jerusalem with the support of Raynald and other influential prelates and royal officials. Raynald urged the townspeople to accept Sybilla as the lawful monarch, according to the Estoire de Eracles. The bailli, RaymondIII of Tripoli, and his supporters tried to prevent her coronation and reminded her partisans of {{the decision of the}} High Court. Ignoring their protest, Raynald and Gerard of Ridefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar, accompanied Sybilla to the Holy Sepulchre, where she was crowned. She also arranged the coronation of her husband, although he was unpopular even among her supporters. Her opponents tried to persuade Raynald's stepson, Humphrey, to claim the crown on his wife's behalf, but Humphrey deserted them and swore fealty to Sybilla and Guy. Raynald headed the list of secular witnesses in four royal charters issued between 21October 1186 and 7March 1187, showing that he had become a principal figure in the new king's court.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Saran {{acted in}} two Telugu and two Hindi films, {{including}} Nenunnanu, where {{she played a}} student in classical singing. She had ten 2005 releases, nine of which were Telugu films, the most notable for her being Chatrapathi. There she appeared opposite Prabhas and earned her first nomination for the Filmfare Best Telugu Actress Award. A reviewer for Moviebuzz said that as an action film, Saran's character of the lead's love interest was not well developed {{and that she was}} there primarily for the songs. Meanwhile, she tried to make her comeback in Tamil with Mazhai, a remake of the Telugu film Varsham. Neither the movie <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> performance were received well. Also in 2005, she appeared as one of only three characters in the film Mogudu Pellam O Dongodu, which was about a married couple's first night together, and made a guest appearance in a children's film called Bommalata, which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu. Saran's only lead role in 2006, excluding three special appearances, was in the Tamil film Thiruvilayadal Arambam.|$|E
5|$|The widowed Amélie never remarried, {{and spent}} her time {{overseeing}} her daughter's upbringing in Portugal, where they remained despite not being {{members of the}} Portuguese Royal Family, though closely related. Neither Amélie <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> daughter ever visited Brazil, but Amélie unsuccessfully petitioned the Brazilian government to recognize her daughter {{as a member of}} Brazil's Imperial Family, which would have entitled her to an income. Maria Amélia's half-brother PedroII was a minor, and the government of Brazil was {{in the hands of a}} precarious regency. The government refused to acknowledge Maria Amélia as a Brazilian princess owing to her foreign birth, and forbade both her and her mother from setting foot in Brazil. The situation would only change after PedroII was declared of age in 1840 and was in a position to insist that she be recognized as a member of his household. Aureliano Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba), the Minister of Foreign Affairs, requested the Brazilian parliament to grant Maria Amélia recognition, which occurred on 5 July 1841.|$|E

25|$|The {{investments}} of the Genshaft Family Foundation (GFF) {{in corporate}} bonds of the Industrial Development Bank of Israel came under scrutiny in September 2002. Several internet petitions also cited Genshaft's Jewish faith to raise support against Al-Arian. Genshaft denied knowing about the corporate bonds and said her decisions were neither affected by her investments <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> {{religion in the}} Al Arian case. John Esposito, a prominent scholar of Middle East, cancelled his USF speech in October 2002 to protest Genshaft's contraventions on academic freedom.|$|E

25|$|Heidi was {{the only}} other Shirley Temple film {{released}} in 1937. Midway through the shooting of the movie, the dream sequence was added into the script. There were reports that the little actress was behind the dream sequence and she had enthusiastically pushed for it, but in her autobiography, she vehemently denied it. Her contract gave neither her <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> parents any creative control over the movies she was in. She saw this as the collapse of any serious attempt by the studio to build upon the dramatic role from the previous movie Wee Willie Winkie.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, {{determined}} {{to get rid of}} his wife, Grand Duke Nicholas expelled Alexandra from the Nicholas Palace publicly accusing her of infidelity with her confessor Vasily Lebedev. Grand Duchess Alexandra, leaving behind her jewelry, clothes and possessions, had to move to her parents' house. The same year, Alexandra suffered a carriage accident which left her almost completely paralyzed. She could move neither her legs <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> right arm. Alexandra asked her brother-in-law, Tsar Alexander II, for help. Appalled by the scandal, Alexander II was not sympathetic towards Alexandra and instead made her leave Russia indefinitely to look for medical treatment abroad. Alexander II himself paid for the trip expenses.|$|E
25|$|One of {{her more}} unusual {{commissions}} came in 1896, when Emily Dickinson's sister Lavinia arranged for Hills to retouch {{one of the}} few existing photographs of the deceased poet, an austere formal portrait that had been taken when Dickinson was around 16 and which neither Dickinson <b>nor</b> <b>her</b> sister had thought was a good likeness. Hills used the photograph as a base to create a memorial portrait; the result, featuring a softened, curlier hairline and a frilly-necked dress, pleased Lavinia. Between 1913 and 1937, this portrait appeared in half a dozen volumes of work by and about the poet that were produced by Dickinson's niece Martha Dickenson Bianchi.|$|E
