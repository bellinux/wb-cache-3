50|$|Best {{practice}} for maintenance of pin sites is unclear and requires more study. Common practice involves the regular cleaning of the pin sites with chlorhexidine gluconate solution (advice varies from {{every day to}} every week), regular showering, and dressing of sites that exude liquid with <b>non-woven</b> <b>gauze</b> soaked in chlorhexidine gluconate. This dressing can be held in place with bungs or makeshift clips or by twisting around the wire.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most current}} {{generation}} of QuikClot products use a mineral known as kaolin, which replaces zeolite as the active clotting agent. ‘’’Kaolin’’’ is an inert, naturally occurring inorganic mineral which has been proven to promote clotting by activating ‘’factor XII’’ of the coagulation cascade. [...] The product consists of a <b>non-woven</b> <b>gauze</b> coated in kaolin which {{can be applied to}} the region of trauma to promote clotting without an exothermic reaction. Originally sold as QuikClot Combat Gauze, the product now has a variety of packaging options available for military, law enforcement, EMS, and hospital use. Consumer versions of the product, which use the same kaolin formulation, are also available at a variety of retailers.|$|E
40|$|The loggerhead Caretta caretta is {{the most}} common sea turtle in the Mediterranean. Currently, sea turtles are {{considered}} endangered, mainly due to the impact of human activities. Among traumatic lesions, those involving the skull, if complicated by brain exposure, are often life-threatening. In these cases, death could be the outcome of direct trauma of the cerebral tissue or of secondary meningoencephalitis. This uncontrolled study aims to evaluate the use of a plantderived dressing (1 Primary Wound Dressing®) in 3 sea turtles with severe lesions of the skull exposing the brain. Following surgical curettage, the treatment protocol involved exclusive use of the plant-derived dressing applied on the wound surface as the primary dressing, daily for the first month and then every other day until the end of treatment. The wound and peri-wound skin were covered with a simple secondary dressing without any active compound (<b>non-woven</b> <b>gauze</b> with petroleum jelly). Data presented herein show an excellent healing process in all 3 cases and no side effects due to contact of the medication with the cerebral tissue...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChronic wounds usually {{remain in}} the {{inflammatory}} phase of the healing process during several months or even years. Hence, a continuous research has been resulting {{in the development of}} wound dressings with improved performance. Herein, we report a delivery system for cutaneous wound healing, consisting of a textile material (<b>non-woven</b> <b>gauzes)</b> covered with lipidic vesicles containing diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). This study also aims to compare the entrapment efficiency data with previous works and confirm that this parameter and drug amount are not directly correlated. A method of dehydrationrehydration of the liposomes presenting different sizes and lamellarities was used to assess the best conditions to attain the highest drug entrapment efficiency. Optimum conditions for the NSAID release were achieved with high phospholipid concentrations and dried-rehydrated vesicles (DRVs) prepared from multilamellar liposomes (MLVs). A chemical activation of the gauzes was performed to enhance the vesicles attachment, also contributing to a higher drug amount in the surrounding media. In spite of the entrapment efficiency being lower comparatively with other values presented by us previously, the diclofenac concentration was considerably higher in this formulation. Entrapment efficiency is, therefore, not sufficient per se to define the real amount of drug contained in the formulation. The cytocompatibility assessment in human skin fibroblasts showed that DRVs from MLVs and DRVs from large unilamellar liposomes (LUVs) with less than 750 ??M of egg-yolk phosphatidylcholine (EPC), containing diclofenac, were not cytotoxic after 72 ?h of contact, greatly implying potential for their application in the chronic wounds healing.

40|$|Abstract: Tissue {{engineering}} is a multidisciplinary field focused on in vitro reconstruction of mammalian tissues. In {{order to allow}} a similar three-dimensional organization of in vitro cultured cells, biocompatible scaffolds are needed. This need has provided immense momentum for research on “smart scaffolds ” for use in cell culture. One {{of the most promising}} materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine is a hyaluronan derivative: a benzyl ester of hyaluronan (HYAFF ®). HYAFF ® can be processed to obtain several types of devices such as tubes, membranes, <b>non-woven</b> fabrics, <b>gauzes,</b> and sponges. All these scaffolds are highly biocompatible. In the human body they do not elicit any adverse reactions and are resorbed by the host tissues. Human hepatocytes, dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, chondrocytes, Schwann cells, bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells and adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells have been successfully cultured in these meshes. The same scaffolds, in tube meshes, has been applied for vascular tissue engineering that has emerged as a promising technology for the design of an ideal, responsive, living conduit with properties similar to that of native tissue...|$|R
