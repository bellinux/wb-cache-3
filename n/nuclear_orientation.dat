The analysis {{is focused on}} the electron helicity-dependent (HD) piece of the cross section. For the case of in-plane emission a new symmetry is found in the HD cross section, which takes opposite values for specific opposing pairs of <b>nuclear</b> <b>orientations,</b> explaining why the fifth response (involving polarized electrons, but unpolarized nuclei) is zero for this choice of kinematics. Even when this symmetry breaks down in the case of nucleon emission out of the scattering plane, it is shown that it is still present in the separate response functions. A physical explanation of these results is presented using a semi-classical model of the reaction based on the PWIA and on the concept of a nucleon orbit with its implied expectation values of position and spin.

40|$|AbstractThe density {{distributions}} of large nuclei are typically modeled with a Woods–Saxon distribution {{characterized by a}} radius R 0 and skin depth a. Deformation parameters β are then introduced to describe non-spherical nuclei using an expansion in spherical harmonics R 0 (1 +β 2 Y 20 +β 4 Y 40). But when a nucleus is non-spherical, the R 0 and a inferred from electron scattering experiments that integrate over all <b>nuclear</b> <b>orientations</b> cannot be used directly as the parameters in the Woods–Saxon distribution. In addition, the β 2 values typically derived from the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability B(E 2) ↑ are {{not directly related to}} the β 2 values used in the spherical harmonic expansion. B(E 2) ↑ is more accurately related to the intrinsic quadrupole moment Q 0 than to β 2. One can however calculate Q 0 for a given β 2 and then derive B(E 2) ↑ from Q 0. In this paper we calculate and tabulate the R 0, a, and β 2 values that when used in a Woods–Saxon distribution, will give results consistent with electron scattering data. We then present calculations of the second and third harmonic participant eccentricity (ε 2 and ε 3) with the new and old parameters. We demonstrate that ε 3 is particularly sensitive to a and argue that using the incorrect value of a has important implications for the extraction of viscosity to entropy ratio (η/s) from the QGP created in Heavy Ion collisions...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{variation}} in hemodynamic stresses {{acting on the}} arterial wall may explain the nonuniform distribution of atherosclerosis. In thoracic aortas of LDL receptor/apolipoprotein E double knockout mice, lesions develop preferentially around the entire circumference of intercostal branch ostia, regardless of age, with the highest prevalence occurring upstream. Additional chevron-shaped lesions occur further upstream of the ostia. This pattern differs from the age-related ones occurring in people and rabbits. In the present study, patterns of near-wall blood flow around intercostal ostia in wild-type mice were estimated from the morphology of endothelial nuclei, which were shown in vitro to elongate in response to elevated shear stress and to align with the flow, and wall structure was assessed from confocal and scanning electron microscopy. A triangular intimal cushion surrounded the upstream part of most ostia. Nuclear length-to-width ratios were lowest over this cushion and highest {{at the sides of}} branches, regardless of age. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>orientations</b> were consistent with flow diverging around the branch. The pattern of nuclear morphology differed from the age-related ones observed in rabbits. The intimal cushion and the distribution of shear stress inferred from these observations can partly account for the pattern of lesions observed in knockout mice. Nuclear elongation in nonbranch regions was approximately constant across animals of different size, demonstrating the existence of a mechanism by which endothelial cells compensate for the dependence of mean aortic wall shear stress on body mass...|$|R

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} {{for maximum}} entropy reconstruction of NMR data is proposed. We use the conventional entropy expression, -Σxjln xj, identifying xj as either {{the distribution of}} <b>nuclear</b> spin <b>orientations</b> (in a classical treatment) or the spin density operator (in a quantum mechanical treatment). Maximization of this entropy, subject to the usual x 2 constraint imposed by the experimental data, is shown to be equivalent to maximizing a more complicated entropy expression with respect to Mx(ω) and My(ω), the x and y components of magnetization present {{at the start of}} acquisition. Specifically, for nuclei of spin- 1 2, the entropy is -Σ [(zj) arc sinh(zj) - (1 + zj 2) 1 2] with zj proportional to the modulus of the complex magnetization, |Mx(ω) + iMy(ω) |.

40|$|International audienceRadial glial {{cells have}} been shown to act as {{neuronal}} precursors in the developing cortex and to maintain their radial processes attached to the basement membrane (BM) during cell division. Here, we examined a potential role of direct signalling from the BM to radial glial cells in three mouse mutants where radial glia attachment to the BM is disrupted. This is the case if the nidogen-binding site of the laminin gamma 1 chain is mutated, in the absence of alpha 6 integrin or of perlecan, an essential BM component. Surprisingly, cortical radial glial cells lacking contact to the BM were not affected in their proliferation, interkinetic <b>nuclear</b> migration, <b>orientation</b> of cell division and neurogenesis. Only a small subset of precursors was located ectopically within the cortical parenchyma. Notably, however, neuronal subtype composition was severely disturbed at late developmental stages (E 18) in the cortex of the laminin gamma 1 III 4 -/- mice.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{coherent}} spin motion of electron-hole pairs localized in band gap states of silicon can influence charge carrier recombination.

The 31 P quantum bit (qbit) is connected via hyperfine coupling to the spin of the localized donor electron. When a second localized and singly occupied electronic state with an energy level deep within the band gap or close to the valence edge is in proximity, a gate controlled exchange between the 31 P nucleus and the two electronic states can be activated that leaves the donor-deep level pair either unchanged in a |T->-state or shifts it into a singlet state |S>.
