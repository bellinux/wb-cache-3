Wood properties are well known to be improved, to some extent, by treatment with an appropriate substance (for example, [1]). The method of treatment, however, has not been well studied. Several {{studies have shown that the}} amount of a substance in wood cell walls mainly determines the wood properties such as dimensional stability (for example, [2]). Thus, filling up cell walls with a substance is necessary for the efficient treatment.|$|E
30|$|The bulking effect {{prevents}} {{intrusion of}} water into the amorphous region by introducing the bulking agent into the region and swelling it. When the chemical substance is hydrophobic, solid, has high viscosity, or has high molecular weight, however, the substance itself may not easily impregnate into the amorphous region. In such cases, the chemicals are often dissolved in a solvent with a high ability to swell the amorphous region. The solvent is usually removed once the impregnation is completed. Both the solvent and the substance {{are present in the}} amorphous region, and thus after the solvent is removed, the region contains space that can absorb water. To treat wood completely with the chemical substance, this space has to be also filled with the substance. Therefore, we focused on the mechanism whereby a <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substance</b> diffuses into cell walls during the conditioning, or process of moderate drying of solvent, of wood impregnated with a solution of the substance, as suggested by Stamm [3].|$|E

25|$|Initially {{wine was}} {{distilled}} as a preservation method {{and as a}} way {{to make it easier for}} merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. <b>Non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.|$|R
40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{procedure for}} incorporation of model contaminants in polymers was developed {{as part of}} a general scheme for testing the efficiency of functional barriers in food packaging. The aim was to progressively pollute polymers in a controlled fashion up to a high level in the range of 1000 ppm and use them as input for the core layer of a tri-layer package, in order to monitor migration phenomena difficult to study in real conditions. To this end, a contamination recipe was initially formulated by a set of selected surrogates. The experimental procedure developed, led to satisfactory results as far as homogeneity and final concentration in the polymer s concerned. High temperature data were also used in order to evaluate the efficiency of typical thermoforming processes in reducing possible volatile and <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> from recycled polymeric materials...|$|R

The amounts and composition of the cuticular waxes of the needles of Picea abies and the leaves of Fagus sylvatica were investigated with special attention to the effects of age and environmental factors.

50|$|Salami is {{homogeneous}} {{in appearance}} and highly ductile. Its quality {{is dependent on}} the quality of the raw materials and the level of technology used in its production. The aroma and taste of salami are developed by enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. The characteristic fermented meat flavour is believed to be developed by a combination of endogenous enzymatic activities and the lactic acid produced by the starter culture. Lactic acid bacteria develop the tangy flavor of salami through the fermentation of carbohydrates and produces an appealing red color to the meat after fermentation, while coagulase-negative cocci can catabolize amino acid and fatty acid to produce volatile compounds. The flavour itself consists of odour properties, which comes from volatile substances, and taste and tactile properties, which comes from <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> that are a result of enhancers and synergists.|$|R

It {{has been shown that}} pine and spruce needle litter emits monoterpene hydrocarbons into the gas phase with the rates comparable to those in emissions from live needles of these trees. This suggests that leaf litter is an important source of atmospheric terpenes. It has also been proved that the litter contains considerable amounts of <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> that can be precursors of oxidized volatile compounds formed as a result of enzymatic reactions.

40|$|SWARMING by proteus bacilli, first {{described}} by Hauser (1885), {{has continued to}} puzzle microbiologists. It {{is thought to be}} caused by negative chemotaxic metabolites (Lominski and Lendrum, 1947; Hughes, 1957; Hoeniger, 1964; Brogan, Nettleton and Reid, 1971) that accumulate during growth. When a threshold concentration is reached, division is inhibited and the bacteria develop into highly motile long forms which swarm down the concentration gradient. On escape from the inhibitory concentration, the long forms fragment into short rods which multiply until the metabolites again accumulate to the critical swarming concentration. The process is then repeated and results in the well-known pattern of concentric circles seen on certain media. These chemotaxic metabolites have not been isolated and their chemical composition is unknown (Hughes); they appear to be volatile (Lominski and Lendrum; Hughes) and to be inactivated by ether (Lominski and Lendrum). Hughes showed that proteus bacilli also form stable <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> which may be responsible for the line of demarcation (Dienes, 1946, 1947) between swarms of different strain...|$|R
40|$|Most QSARs for dermal {{absorption}} predict the permeability coefficient, K p, of a molecule, which is valid for infinite dose conditions. In practice, dermal exposure mostly occurs under finite dose conditions. Therefore, a simple model to predict finite dose {{dermal absorption}} from infinite dose data (K p and lag time) and the stratum corneum/water partition coefficient (K SC,W) was developed. To test the model, {{a series of}} in vitro dermal absorption experiments was performed under both infinite and finite dose conditions using acetic acid, benzoic acid, bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, butoxyethanol, cortisone, decanol, diazinone, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, ethacrynic acid, linolenic acid, octylparaben, oleic acid, propylparaben, salicylic acid and testosterone. For six substances, the predicted relative dermal absorption was not statistically different from the measured value. For all other substances, measured absorption was overpredicted by the model, {{but most of the}} overpredictions were still below the European default absorption value. In conclusion, our finite dose prediction model provides a useful and cost-effective estimate of dermal absorption, to be used in risk assessment for <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> dissolved in water at non-irritating concentrations. © 2010 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} specifications and unique functionality of chromatographic techniques is a demand of pharmaceutical industry and research. This {{leads to the}} origin of Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC). It is a rapidly expanding analytical technique. The main feature that differentiates SFC from other chromatographic techniques is the replacement of either the liquid or gas mobile phase with a supercritical fluid mobile phase. It is considered a hybrid of GC and LC technique. High diffusion coefficient and low viscosity of supercritical fluids is responsible for high speed analysis, high efficiency and high sensitivity. Low mobile-phase flow rate, density programming and compatability with GC and LC detectors make SFC a versatile chromatographic technique in analytical re-search and development. It has a unique characteristic of analyzing thermo labile or <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances.</b> This review highlights the role of supercritical fluid chromatography in the separation of polymers, thermally labile pesticides, fatty acids, metal chelates and organometallic compounds, chiral and achiral molecules, identification and analysis of polar samples, explosives, drugs of abuse and application of SFC in forensic science (fingerprint-ing) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} an apparatus which can deliver a pulse of aerosol to a preparation of olfactory tissue. Non-volatile compounds in the aerosol produce {{an increase in}} the electro-olfactogram response of the rat. The concentration of the non-volatile compounds at which a response is seen is — 1800 times higher than that of the volatile odorant i-pentyl acetate, which is used as the reference stimulus. If non-volatile compounds reach the olfactory epithelium of terrestrial animals they may act like odorants and stimulate the olfactory neurones. This opens up the possibili-ty of a range of stimulants and chemical messengers acting in the terrestrial environ-ment which have received little attention by researchers. Evidence that <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> may stimulate the olfactory tissue comes from Shirley et al. (1986) who observed that 270 mM sucrose doubled the specific activity of rat olfactory adenylate cyclase, and odorants added to this cyclase preparation in the presence of sucrose caused no further stimulation. Aerosols provide a means of carrying such substances to the olfactory tissue. However, whether or not the aerosol reaches the olfactory epithelium depends on several factors such as the flow rate of the carrier airstream, the particle size of the aerosol and the morphology of the airways. There are many situations i...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Exhaled breath {{condensate}} (EBC) is {{a rapidly}} expanding {{area of research}} to study airway inflammation through the detection of volatile and <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> in the airways. AIMS: To determine the safety and feasibility of EBC procedure {{in a group of}} children with asthma of varying severity. METHODS: In a cross sectional study of children aged 4 - 17 years, 18 healthy and 91 asthmatic children (69 in stable condition and 22 with asthma exacerbation) underwent the EBC procedure. Outcomes assessed included completion of the procedure, decrease in FEV 1, change in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)), and adverse effects. No pretreatment with beta 2 agonists was given. All children were able to successfully complete the EBC procedure. RESULTS: Median fall in FEV 1 after the procedure was - 1 % (IQR - 3. 5, 1. 8) in asthmatics and was comparable to that observed in healthy children. In only one asthmatic child did the drop in FEV 1 exceed 12 %. No significant changes in FE(NO) were observed after EBC. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that EBC is a simple and well tolerated method for evaluating biological samples from the lower airway.

For its increasing incidence among the common population, the interest of researchers and clinicians has been recently directed {{to the study of}} pathological mechanisms underlying sleep disorders. Current opinion is that airway inflammation and oxidative stress {{play a crucial role in}} the pathophysiology of OSAS. Recently there has been increasing interest in the investigation of lungs by non-invasive means measuring the exhaled breath volatile mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), ethane and pentane and finally the <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> in the liquid phase of exhalate, termed breath condensate. The non-invasiveness of these techniques for the study of airways affected by different respiratory disorders and among those, the OSAS, makes these ideally suited for the evaluation and serial monitoring of patients.

An important contribution to the increase of our knowledge on exhaled markers and for their possible concrete application in clinical practice may come from future studies using proteomics, genomics and metabolomics.

30|$|As {{a complex}} mixture, various {{components}} have been separated and identified from CCA, including collagen, amino acids, proteins, polysaccharides, volatile substances, trace elements, etc. [8, 9]. Authentic CCA {{is characterized by}} its typical sweet and neutral fragrance, {{which is one of}} the most significant factors that shape the quality and affect consumer behaviors. However, most of the current investigations on CCA have been devoted to the analysis and bioactive effects of the <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> [10, 11] and the investigations on volatile components of CCA have been rarely reported. A series of methods can be used to obtain the volatile flavour compounds of CCA like distillation [12], Headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) [13], solid-phase extract (SPE) [14], simultaneous distillation and extraction (SDE) [15, 16] and so on. Mao et al. [17] studied the volatile components of CCA from Shangdong by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis of distilled samples. They identified 23 volatile ingredients and 12 of them have characteristic smells. However, the contributions of the specific components to CCA aroma and the composition variations of volatiles in CCAs from different producing areas were not investigated. Although CCA contains many volatile components, only a small fraction of them contributes to its overall aroma. Therefore, besides qualitative and quantitative analysis of volatile components, some complementary sensory techniques, such as gas chromatography–olfactometry (GC–O), are required to evaluate the aroma contributions of volatile components. Aroma extract dilution analyses (AEDA) is a frequently used method combined with GC–O, which has been used to identify the key aroma compounds in foods [18], beverage like mushroom [19, 20], durian wine [21] and so on.|$|R

Methods Essential oils from each L. alba chemotype (LP 1 -LP 7) were characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and extracted non-volatile compounds were analysed by HPLC and GC-MS. The anticonvulsant actions of file extracted compounds were studied in pentylenetetrazole-induced clonic seizures in mice and then effect oil motor coordination was studied using the rota-rod test in rats. The synaptosomes and synaptic membranes of the rats were examined for the influence of LP 3 chemotype extract oil GABA uptake and binding experiments. Key findings Behavioural parameters encompassed by the pentylenetetrazole test indicated that 80 % ethanolic extracts of LP 1, LP 3 and LP 6 L. alba chemotypes were more effective as anticonvulsant agents. Neurochemical assays using synaptosomes and synaptic membranes showed that L. alba LP 3 chemotype 80 % ethanolic extract inhibited GABA uptake and GABA binding ill a dose-dependent manner. HPLC analysis showed that LP 1, LP 3 and LP 6 80 % ethanolic extracts presented a similar profile of constituents, differing from those seen in LP 2, LP 4, LP 5 and LP 7 80 % ethanolic extracts, which exhibited no anticonvulsant effect. GC-MS analysis indicated the Occurrence of phenylpropanoids in methanolic fractions obtained from LP 1, LP 3 and LP 6 80 % ethanolic extracts and also the accumulation of inositol and flavonoids in hydroalcoholic fractions.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of the unique saiga nose in vocal production has been neglected so far. Rutting male saigas produce loud nasal roars. Prior to roaring, they tense and extend their noses in a highly stereotypic manner. This change of nose configuration includes dorsal folding and convex curving of the nasal vestibulum and is maintained until the roar ends. Red and fallow deer males that orally roar achieve a temporary increase of vocal tract length (vtl) by larynx retraction. Saiga males attain a similar effect by pulling their flexible nasal vestibulum rostrally, allowing for a temporary elongation of the nasal vocal tract by about 20 %. Decrease of formant frequencies and formant dispersion, as acoustic effects of an increase of vtl, are assumed to convey important information {{on the quality of}} a dominant male to conspecifics, e. g. on body size and fighting ability. Nasal roaring in saiga may equally serve to deter rival males and to attract females. Anatomical constraints might have set a limit to the rostral pulling of the nasal vestibulum. It seems likely that the sexual dimorphism of the saiga nose was induced by sexual selection. Adult males of many mammalian species, after sniffing or licking female urine or genital secretions, raise their head and strongly retract their upper lip and small nasal vestibulum while inhalating orally. This flehmen behaviour is assumed to promote transport of <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> via the incisive ducts into the vomeronasal organs for pheromone detection. The flehmen aspect in saiga involves the extensive flexible walls of the greatly enlarged nasal vestibulum and is characterized by a distinctly concave configuration of the nose region, the reverse of that observed in nasal roaring.

40|$|In The Netherlands, the web-based tool called 'Stoffenmanager' was {{initially}} developed to assist {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} to prioritize and control risks of handling chemical products in their workplaces. The {{aim of the}} present study was to explore the accuracy of the Stoffenmanager exposure algorithm. This was done by comparing its semi-quantitative exposure rankings for specific substances with exposure measurements collected from several occupational settings to derive a quantitative exposure algorithm. Exposure data were collected using two strategies. First, we conducted seven surveys specifically for validation of the Stoffenmanager. Second, existing occupational exposure data sets were collected from various sources. This resulted in 378 and 320 measurements for solid and liquid scenarios, respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficients between Stoffenmanager scores and exposure measurements appeared to be good for handling solids (rs = 0. 80, N = 378, P 10 Pa (rs = 0. 56, N = 104, P < 0. 0001) and <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> with a vapour pressure ≤ 10 Pa (rs = 0. 53, N = 216, P < 0. 0001). The mixed-effect regression models with natural log-transformed Stoffenmanager scores as independent parameter explained a substantial part of the total exposure variability (52 % for solid scenarios and 76 % for liquid scenarios). Notwithstanding the good correlation, the data show substantial variability in exposure measurements given a certain Stoffenmanager score. The overall performance increases our confidence in the use of the Stoffenmanager as a generic tool for risk assessment. The mixed-effect regression models presented in this paper may be used for assessment of so-called reasonable worst case exposures.

In the current study, the major volatile compounds besides ethanol as: methanol, ethyl acetate, 1 -propanol (n-propanol), 2 -propanol (i-propanol), 1 -butanol(n-butanol), i-butanol (2 -methylpropan- 1 -ol), n-amyl alcohol (n-pentanol), i-amyl alcohol (3 -methyl- 1 -butanol),were characterized by gas chromatography (GCFID) on HP-Inowax column and Supecowax column, respectively. For that purpose, hundred samples of three types of grape brandies (lozova rakia, komova rakia and vinjak) and thirty samples of plum brandies (slivova rakia) from domestic producers were analyzed. In order to evaluate the difference in composition regarding the type of brandy it has been compared the mean value (MV) obtained for each volatile. When compared the mean values of volatiles in plum vs grape brandies, for methanol, ethyl acetate and n-propanol, the MV of plum brandies were significantly higher. Mean value for methanol in plum brandy was 1903 mg/ 100 mL anhydrous alcohol a. a, in grape brandy lozova was 464. 7 mg/ 100 mL a. a, in grape brandy komova was 721 mg/ 100 mL a. a and in grape brandy vinjak was 169 mg/ 100 mL a. a. Mean value for ethyl acetate in plum,brandy was 132. 5 mg/ 100 mL a. a, which was 2. 2 as high as mean value for ethyl acetate in grape brandy lozova,(60. 3 mg/ 100 ml a. a.). Mean value for n-propanol in plum brandy was 110. 4 mg/ 100 mL a. a, in grape brandy lozova was 28. 52 mg/ 100 mL a. a, in grape brandy komova was 42 mg/ 100 mL a. a., and in grape brandy vinjak was 33. 2 mg/ 100 mL a. a. The highest mean value for i-amyl alcohol content was found in grape brandy komova rakia 176. 6 mg/ 100 mL a. a. The content {{and the type of}} volatile congeners in some strong spirits which are produced by process of fermentation of fruits and distillation could be considered as a marker of fermentation and (or) botanical origin. Ethyl acetate in fruit brandies is formed by enzymes reactions during fermentation. Higher alcohols and fusel alcohols (1 -propanol, 2 -methylpropan- 1 -ol, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol and phenyl ethyl alcohol) are formed in biochemical reactions by yeast on amino acids and carbohydrates. The amounts in different beverages vary considerably. Methanol represented the major volatile component, characteristic to fruit brandies which is released by enzymatic degradation of methoxylated pectin’s and is not a by-product of yeast fermentation Therefore this molecule can be considered not only a parameter of distillate safety, but also as an indicator of natural origin of distillate.

40|$|Absorption {{of toxic}} {{substances}} via the skin is an important phenomenon {{in the assessment of}} the risk of exposure to these substances. People are exposed to a variety of substances and products via the skin, either directly or indirectly, while at work, at home or in public space. Pesticides, organic solvents and metalworking fluids are seen to be important contributors to adverse health effects due to occupational exposure via the skin. In daily life, cosmetics, clothing and household products are the most relevant commodities with respect to exposure via the skin. Given the importance of skin exposure in the assessment of the risk {{of toxic substances}},  the objective of this thesis was to further develop, evaluate and improve methods for including skin absorption data this assessment. In this thesis, four factors influencing dermal absorption, namely dermal loading (chapters 3 and 6), irritative/corrosive potential (chapters 3 and 4), frequency of exposure (chapters 3, 4 and 5) and the vehicle used (chapter 5), were investigated in more detail. Furthermore, a model to extrapolate infinite dose absorption data to finite dose conditions, baptized Dermal Absorption Model for Extrapolation (DAME), was developed and tested. I   n chapter 2 of this thesis, the relationship between relative dermal absorption and dermal loading was investigated. Hundred-and-thirty-eight dermal publicly available absorption experiments with 98 substances were evaluated. The results obtained revealed that dermal loading ranged mostly between 0. 001 and 10 mg/cm 2. In 87 experiments (63 %), an inverse relationship was observed between relative dermal absorption and dermal loading. On average, relative absorption at high dermal loading was 33 times lower than at low dermal loading. Known skin irritating and volatile substances less frequently showed an inverse relationship between dermal loading and relative absorption. It was concluded that when using relative dermal absorption in regulatory risk assessment, its value should be determined at or extrapolated to dermal loadings relevant for the exposure conditions being evaluated. I   n chapter 3 of this thesis, a literature search was presented with the aim to investigate whether neglecting the effects of repeated exposure may lead to an incorrect estimate of dermal absorption. The results demonstrated that the effect of repeated versus single exposure does not demonstrate a unique trend. Nevertheless, an increase in daily absorption was frequently observed upon repeated daily exposure. The little information available mostly concerned pharmaceuticals. However, consumers and workers may be repeatedly exposed to other types of chemicals, like disinfectants and cleaning products, which often contain biocidal active substances that may decrease the barrier function of the skin, especially after repeated exposure. These biocidal products, therefore, may present a safety risk that is not covered by the current risk assessment practice since absorption data are usually obtained by single exposure experiments. Consequently, it was decided to investigate the importance of this issue for biocide safety evaluation. As the literature search revealed that hardly any data on absorption upon repeated dermal exposure to biocides are available, it was concluded that data need to be generated by testing. To cover the entire range of biocidal products in such testing, a representative series of biocidal substances should be tested, making in vitro testing of dermal absorption the preferred choice over in vivo testing. Based on an inventory made, it appeared that the 16 product types represented among the biocidal products authorised in the Netherlands could be clustered into 6 more or less homogeneous categories based on similarity in active substances. This result could facilitate experimental testing by providing a basis for selection of a limited number of representative compounds to be evaluated. I   n chapter 4 of this thesis, the importance of the effect of repeated dermal exposure on skin permeability for biocide safety evaluation was investigated, using a selection of nine representative biocides from the inventory made in chapter 3. The in vitro dermal penetration of tritiated water and [14 C]propoxur was chosen as a measure of the permeability and integrity of human abdominal skin after single and repeated exposure. The results indicated that single and repeated exposure to specific biocidal products (e. g. the quaternary ammonium chlorides DDAC and ADBAC) may significantly increase skin permeability, especially when the compounds are applied at high concentrations, while a substance like formaldehyde may reduce skin permeability under specific conditions. I   n chapter 5 of this thesis, the in vitro dermal absorption kinetics of the quaternary ammonium compound didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) during single and repeated exposure was studied in more detail. In addition, the influence of biocidal formulations on the absorption of DDAC was investigated, because it was expected that formulation characteristics may be another factor influencing its dermal absorption. The analysis of biocidal products on the Dutch market, reported in chapter 3, indicated that DDAC is often used in combination with other active ingredients. DDAC was most frequently combined with formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and/or alkyldimethylbenzyl­ammo­nium chloride (ADBAC). Consequently, commercial formulations containing {{one or more of these}} additional active ingredients were selected, in addition to one formulation containing only DDAC as an active ingredient. The selected commercial formulations tended to reduce skin penetration of DDAC. This was most pronounced with the formulation containing the highest concentration of formaldehyde (196 mg/mL) and glutaraldehyde (106  mg/mL), which reduced the flux of DDAC across the skin by 95 %. The reduction caused by the only tested formulation containing no other active ingredients than DDAC, and thus incorporating no aldehydes, was smallest, and did not reach statistical significance. I   n chapter 6 of this thesis, a simple in silico model to predict finite dose dermal absorption from infinite dose data (kp and lag time) and the stratum corneum/water partition coefficient (KSC,W) was developed. This model was tentatively called D ermal Absorption Model for Extrapolation (DAME). As dermal exposure may occur under a large variety of conditions leading to quite different rates of absorption, such a predictive model using simple experimental or physicochemical inputs provides a cost-effective means to estimate dermal absorption under different conditions. To evaluate the DAME, a series of in vitro dermal absorption experiments was performed under both infinite and finite dose conditions using a variety of different substances. The kp’s and lag times determined in the infinite dose experiments were entered into DAME to predict relative dermal absorption value under finite dose conditions. For six substances, the predicted relative dermal absorption under finite dose conditions was not statistically different from the measured value. For all other substances, measured absorption was overpredicted by DAME, but most of the overpredicted values were still lower than 100 %, the European default absorption value for the tested compounds. In conclusion, our finite dose prediction model (DAME) provides a useful and cost-effective estimate of in vitro dermal absorption, to be used in risk assessment for <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> dissolved in water at non-irritating concentrations. I   n chapter 7 of this thesis, the results of the research reported in chapters 2 to 6 were put into perspective, the pitfalls and promises emanating from them discussed and general conclusions drawn. The possible influence of vehicles on absorption and the possible impact of irritative or corrosive vehicles or chemicals on the skin barrier have been demonstrated in this thesis. An in silico predictive model tentatively called DAME was developed, which enables the user to evaluate a variety of dermal exposure scenarios with limited experimental data (kp and lag time) and easy to obtain physicochemical properties (MW and log KOW). The predictions of our experiments reported in chapter 6 were compared to those of the Finite Dose Skin Permeation (FDSP) model published on the internet by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). DAME outperformed FDSP (R 2 of the correlation predicted/measured potential absorption 0. 64 and 0. 12, respectively). At present, the applicability domain of DAME is limited to <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances</b> dissolved in aqueous solvents. However, in future the model will be adapted to include volatile substances as well. Altogether, it is concluded that dermal exposure can be an important factor in risks posed by chemicals and should be taken into account in risk assessment. The methods to actually do this are still open for further improvement to better account for the various factors influencing skin penetration and to develop adequate combinations of in vitro and in silico models that can accurately predict human dermal absorption.  ...|$|R
5000|$|Both hairy {{and smooth}} pads in {{arthropods}} act {{to maximize the}} amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. [...] Hairy pads can be classified as pulvillus, fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy attachment pads employed few other features, such as flaw tolerance, lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the attachment strength in hairy systems is realized by {{increasing the number of}} single contact points. [...] Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. [...] Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. [...] Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the terminal plate, which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy attachment pads of reduviid bugs, flies [...] and beetles [...] secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains <b>non-volatile,</b> lipid-like <b>substances,</b> but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. [...] Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration.|$|R
40|$|Foods {{are complex}} multi-component systems which are {{composed}} of volatile and <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances.</b> The flavour profile of a food is an important criterion for the selection of our foodstuffs. The main objective {{of this study was}} the clarification of the complex relationships of the flavour release {{as a function of the}} composition of the food matrix at molecular level. Therefore the influence of matrix effects onto the partition coefficients, odour activity values and sensory properties of selected flavour compounds, in model and in real food systems were investigated. Different matrices were selected to measure their influence onto the partition coefficients of odorants: water, water-ethanol- mixtures, matrices containing lipids and more complex samples, such as mixtures of water, oil, proteins and polysaccharides. The studies included a series of lactones, esters and alcohols (γ-octalactone, γ-nonalactone, γ- decalactone, δ-octalactone, δ-nonalactone, δ-decalactone, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol and 2 -phenylethanol). The vapour pressures and partition coefficients were determined using static headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC) techniques. The influence of the model systems on the adsorptions of the odorants at the gas-tight syringes were taken into account. The results obtained, showed that the vapour pressures of the flavour compounds are decreasing with the increasing of the molecular weight of the compounds. The comparison of water/air partition coefficients (logP W/A) with miglyol/air partition coefficients of selected odorants (logP M/A) showed that for miglyol system, the logP M/A are higher than the logP W/A for all flavour compounds studied. The measurement of the partition coefficients of selected aroma compounds in water-oil matrices (emulsions) revealed that the fat content of emulsions influence significantly the partition coefficients of odorants. The highest partition coefficients were obtained in emulsions where the portion between water/miglyol/emulsifier was: 47. 5 + 47. 5 + 5, w/w/w. In the present study the flavour release of different aroma compounds (ethyl hexanoate and S- (-) -limonene) in carbohydrate-water solutions was examined. The static headspace method allows the measurement of the released odour components that interact with β -cyclodextrin. The HS-GC analysis of β -cyclodextrin-water/odorant mixtures showed a reduction of the odorant in presence of the carbohydrate. The influence of the various matrices on the human biological response of odorants was investigated by an olfactometer (e. g. determination of the threshold values of odorants in air and in the presence of ethanol) and the headspace odour activity values (HOAV’s) were calculated. The results showed that the threshold values in air in absence of ethanol were lower than the values in presence of ethanol, which means the presence of ethanol in the matrix increase the threshold value of the odorant. The studies also included the influence of wine matrix onto the partition coefficients of important wine flavour compounds. The quantification of the aroma compounds in white wine samples was achieved by isotope dilution analyses and standard addition method. Odorants in the headspace above wines were analysed by HS-GC techniques and the partition coefficients (wine/air) calculated. The results pointed out that the presence of ethanol in wine matrix does not influence the partition coefficients of selected aroma compounds. The highest partition coefficients in wines were found for the two alcohols: 2 -phenylethanol and 3 - methyl- 1 -butanol. Concerning COST Action 921 custard samples were investigated as real foodstuff and the aroma compounds were quantified in the matrix and in the headspace above the food. The research data indicated that the partition coefficients custard/air are located between the partition coefficients water/air and partition coefficients miglyol/air, but closer to the miglyol/air values. Furthermore the mass transfer rates of selected odorants were investigated in custard- and milk powder/water samples. The values of the mass transfer rate were found higher in milk powder/water systems than in custard model. Nevertheless the results indicated that the viscosity of the matrix did not significantly influence the values of mass transfer rate of selected flavour compounds. Molecular Modelling methods have been used for the prediction of solvation free energies of the flavour compounds studied in different model solutions, e. g. water and water-oil systems. The results showed that the predicted values (Mopac 97) for γ-decalactone, γ-nonalactone and 2 -phenylethanol in water are in good agreement with experimentally solvation free energies...|$|R

These studies included visual assessment, sampling and laboratory analysis of oil slicks, seawater and sediment cores. The analysis of samples were carried out with the use of thin layer and column chromatography, optical and gravimetric methods making possible to determine separately the concentrations of hydrocarbons and asphaltic substances as well as the presence of hydrocarbons of contemporary biological origin. The results of the investigations show that the spill of heavy fuel oil composed mostly of macromolecular, <b>non-volatile</b> and insoluble <b>substances</b> hasn’t increased considerably the water pollution level during the first months after the accident. In winter 2007 / 2008 the concentrations of hydrocarbons were stably high: 0. 19 − 0. 22 mg/dm 3. However such values have always been observed here because of intensive navigation and port activity. Nevertheless the notable augmentation of concentrations up to 0. 34 − 0. 60 mg/dm 3 in summer 2008 and their relatively high levels during next two aestival seasons might be caused by natural destruction of oil slicks stranded on the shore. In contrast to water column and bottom sediments, the coasts were hardly polluted by the spilled fuel oil. Even after the termination of clean-up operations, numerous weathered oil slicks were still present in certain sectors, especially on limestone blocks of the Tuzla dam. In the course of time an exponential decrease in their quantities and in the ratio between hydrocarbons and asphaltic components was revealed. The values of half-period of oil pollution natural transformation varied from one to two years. The highest activity of natural cleaning process was observed for the small pollutant traces stranded on the rocky substrate and sandy beaches exposed to the influence of fresh air, solar radiation, storm waves and surf action. On the northern windward coast of the Strait of Kerch influenced by shallow, low-salinity and highly bio-productive waters of the Sea of Azov the spilled fuel oil trends to disappear more rapidly than on its southern coast washed by the Black Sea...|$|R
40|$|Two {{preliminary}} {{biological control}} screens were developed, using lettuce & strawberry as model systems, to test potential biocontrol micro-organisms {{for their ability}} to control Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of grey mould. The first screen evaluated a range of saprophytic yeasts, bacteria & fungi {{for their ability to}} inhibit Botrytis lesions on whole lettuce plants. In a controlled environment (18 - 22 °C, 85 - 90 % relative humidity & 12 h photoperiod), lettuce leaves were spray inoculated with antagonists (10 ⁷ fungal spores mL⁻¹ or 10 ⁸ bacterial cells mL⁻¹), allowed to dry & challenged by spray inoculation with the pathogen (10 ⁶ conidia mL⁻¹). After 7 days Pseudomonas fluorescens LU 1001 & LU 1003, P. synxantha LU 1004 & P. veronii LU 1002 had significantly reduced lesion areas by an average of 79 % on whole lettuce plants. An Ulocladium sp. LU 865 & Epicoccum purpurascens LU 148 reduced lesion areas by 94 % & 78 %, respectively. The second screen evaluated selected saprophytic bacteria & filamentous fungi, with previously identified antagonistic properties (against a range of plant pathogens), for the ability to inhibit B. cinerea on detached strawberry tissues & whole strawberry plants. The most successful isolates, E. purpurascens LU 148 & Trichoderma atroviride LU 132, inhibited lesion development by up to 32 % & suppressed sporulation on detached strawberry leaves by up to 87 %. They were further evaluated on detached strawberry flowers & whole strawberry plants in a controlled environment (18 °C & 85 - 95 % relative humidity). The most consistently effective antagonist was T. atroviride LU 132, which inhibited B. cinerea in all experiments, significantly (P≤ 0. 05) suppressing B. cinerea sporulation on detached strawberry flowers & leaf discs removed from inoculated whole plants by 100 % & 81 %, respectively. This was similar to the level of disease suppression given by the commercial biocontrol product, Prestop & the fungicide, fenhexamid. The mechanism of action of T. atroviride LU 132 was investigated. Competition for glucose & sucrose occurred on detached strawberry leaf pieces & on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes, significantly inhibiting B. cinerea germ tube length at low sugar concentrations. The isolate also produced <b>non-volatile</b> inhibitory <b>substances</b> in minimal medium that inhibited B. cinerea germ tube elongation & in dual culture, T. atroviride LU 132 was found to directly parasitize B. cinerea hyphae leading to cell collapse. The biological activity of T. atroviride LU 132 against the grey mould pathogen was investigated on three cultivars of strawberry under field conditions. The study also examined the effect of commonly used botryticides on germination & growth of T. atroviride LU 132 to allow selection of a fungicide for mixed application. The fungicide fenhexamid significantly increased conidial germination frequency by up to 34 % & was later used in mixed tank applications. The field trials demonstrated that treatment with T. atroviride LU 132, fenhexamid, & the tank-mix of both could all equally suppress B. cinerea sporulation, significantly, on strawberry leaves & stamens by 42 - 100 %. These treatments increased yield of strawberry fruit by up to 36 % but they did not reduce disease incidence in the fruit in a 7 day ambient storage trial. This research has identified T. atroviride LU 132 as a successful biological control agent (BCA) of B. cinerea in strawberry. The more obvious mechanisms of action such as antibiosis, competition for nutrients & mycoparasitism have been investigated & the use of the BCA within an integrated management strategy, with the fungicide fenhexamid, has been successfully implemented. Future work will focus on developing a suitable formulation for the BCA in order to increase its efficacy under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobility}} of contaminants in soil {{is an important}} factor in determining their ability to spread into the wider environment. For <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances,</b> transport within the soil is generally dominated by transport of dissolved fractions in the soil water phase, via either diffusion or convection. During this process the {{mobility of}} reactive ions is strongly affected by adsorption. Adsorption processes regulate the distribution of ions over an immobile fraction that is attached to soil particles and a mobile fraction that is present in the soil water phase, and therefore determine which fraction of ions is available for transport via the water phase. In structured soil the conditions are more complex as water flow is not homogeneous. The flow of water is fast through cracks and macropores in between soil peds and aggregates, but at the same time a significant part of the soil water can be stagnant inside the smaller pores inside peds and aggregates. In order to reach adsorbing particles inside the peds and aggregates, ions have to diffuse through the smaller pores inside the aggregates or soil peds. Depending on the size of the aggregates, this can cause a significant delay in sorption and a marked different behaviour from the instantaneous equilibrium assumption that is usually adhered to for homogeneous systems. The effect this has on ion transport is referred to as physical nonequilibrium. Adsorption of ions onto charged surfaces in soil is a complex process. Soils are multicomponent systems in which the behaviour of contaminant ions is influenced by other ions, for example through competitive sorption. Recent developments in surface complexation models start to become increasingly successful in accounting for competitive effects during sorption. This thesis addresses the combination of multicomponent chemistry, diffusion-limited sorption and transport. Transport and sorption processes were studied in flow experiments with well-defined artificial model systems and by computer modelling. The modelling was stepwise validated against experimental results. An artificial flow system was developed in the first part of this thesis by gradually increasing the complexity of the system from non-reactive transport to multicomponent reactive transport. The model progressed accordingly by including the relevant sorption models into the transport model. The model simulations were then used to evaluate the effects of multicomponent chemistry on transport. The initial flow system was prepared from a column filled with spherical gel beads made from alginate gel. The gel acts as a stagnant water phase, in which ions can only move by diffusion. Transport through the column with gel beads was modelled with a two-region transport model. An immobile region represented the solution inside the beads and an immobile region represented the flowing solution in between the beads. Ion transport was modelled by convection in the mobile region and by diffusion in the immobile region. First, diffusion of nitrate and phosphate out of the gel beads was measured in a batch system. The model predicted the release of ions from the gel beads accurately using reported diffusion coefficients for diffusion of the ions in water. Leaching of nitrate through a bead filled column was measured at different flow rates. The concentration in the effluent was plotted against time to give breakthrough curves. The breakthrough curves predicted by the model matched the measurements accurately. The next experiments evaluated proton transport through a column with alginate gel beads. Proton sorption on alginate occurs by ion-exchange with the calcium ions that cross-link the alginate polymer structure. The sorption parameters were measured separately in acid-base titrations of the gel at different calcium levels. The ion-exchange model was incorporated in the two-region transport model. The combined model described the proton leaching curves at different calcium concentrations very well. The results showed the combined effects of nonlinear sorption and competition, which added to the effects of physical nonequilibrium. The third set of experiments considered sulphate and chromate sorption and transport in a column with goethite. Column experiments were performed with goethite embedded in polyacrylamide gel beads. The two-region transport model was combined with a surface complexation model to predict reactive transport in the goethite-gel bead system. Chromate and sulphate breakthrough curves were measured in a set of transport experiments, along with corresponding changes in the effluent pH. Model parameters for the surface complexation model were obtained from literature data and sorption measurements. The model predicted the breakthrough curves well for transport of chromate and sulphate in separate column experiments. However, the model overestimated the pH changes in the effluent, possibly because of proton buffering by the polyacrylamide gel. The effect of competitive sorption on transport was examined in experiments with both anions present. The model predicted the effect of competition very well in a system initially equilibrated with sulphate, followed by infiltration with chromate. However, when sulphate was infiltrated after equilibration with chromate, chromate desorption and sulphate adsorption were clearly underestimated by the transport model. The exchange between the more strongly bound chromate and the sulphate added subsequently may be too slow to cause a substantial chromate peak in the effluent. The second part of the thesis applied multicomponent chemistry and transport modelling to strontium sorption in microscopic aggregates of hydrous ferric oxide (HFO). Previous studies found that it takes days to months to reach equilibrium sorption probably due to slow diffusion into the porous particles. A novel mechanistic approach was suggested to explain slow diffusion into the small aggregates. A model was developed that relates diffusion to the electrostatic potential inside the aggregate pores. At pH values below 8, the surfaces are positively charged which causes an electrostatic potential that stretches across the whole pore diameter. Positively charged ions such as strontium are repulsed and remain at very low concentrations in the pore space. Here a Donnan electrostatic model was used to calculate the electrostatic potential inside the pores based on the assumption that the potential gradients in the small pores are overlapping. The electrostatic model is directly linked to the surface complexation model (CD-MUSIC) that describes the surface charge dependent on protonation of the surface groups and adsorption of counter ions and strontium. Strontium sorption is pH-dependent and in its turn influences the local pH inside the aggregates by causing desorption of protons from the oxide surface. Therefore the model accounts for sorption and diffusion of both ions. Diffusion is calculated from the local concentrations and electrostatic gradient in the pores using the Nernst-Planck diffusion equation. The diffusion flux of strontium is small at the low concentrations in the pores. The time it takes to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent on pH which determines the amount of strontium sorption, but above all, the mineral charge and the repulsion from the pores. The Donnan-diffusion model was compared with non-electrostatic pore diffusion, which does not take electrostatic interactions into account. The Donnan model predicts very low concentrations of strontium in the pores and diffusion rates that are up to 8000 times lower than predicted with a non-electrostatic model. The Donnan-diffusion mode] was validated against strontium transport in a column of hydrous ferric oxide. Microscopic aggregates of hydrous ferric oxide (230 nm) were prepared by freezing and thawing ferrihydrite. The resulting aggregates have pores with a number-average size of 2 nm and a size distribution ranging from 1 to 12 nm. The surface complexation parameters were assessed by acid-base titrations and strontium sorption experiments. Strontium transport in the columns was measured at pH 4 and 7. The Sr breakthrough curves showed that sorption was virtually instantaneous on part of the hydrous ferric oxide, bistantaneous sorption was explained by unrestrained diffusion in the largest pore fraction of the aggregate pores. The accessible pore fraction was determined by salt pulses and was found to be dependent on pH. Taking the fast accessible pore fraction into account in the transport simulations, the model matched the experimental breakthrough curves well at both pH values. This thesis demonstrates that the combination of multicomponent chemistry, diffusion-limited sorption and transport can be modelled by combining mechanistic process descriptions. There were often more influencing factors than initially anticipated, even in relatively simple systems. Nevertheless, mechanistic modelling provides valuable insights into the processes that are involved in multicomponent transport in soil systems...|$|R
40|$|Activities of honeybees Apis mellifera L. colony are {{coordinated by}} an {{effective}} communication network {{in which the}} queen plays a central role by controlling behavior and reproduction of workers through pheromones. Most pheromones are produced in the mandibular (QMP) and tergal gland and distributed over the queen?s cuticle. The acquisition of these pheromones from the cuticular body surface of the queen is performed by antennating and licking of the retinue workers. Workers of a colony are able to recognize their own queen. Foreign queens which are introduced without protection are normally killed by the workers. While {{a lot of work}} has been performed on the primer and releaser effect of certain queen pheromones, it is still unknown how the workers distinguish their own queen from foreign ones. The fact that queens can be exchanged successfully by protecting the foreign queen for some days demonstrates that workers are able to ?learn? their queen. It is likely that a certain chemical pattern of the cuticle (odor or taste) is finally responsible for the recognition and acceptance as ?own?. In this context, this work has three different objectives: - To better understand the bees? behavior to ?own? and ?foreign? queens and to quantify certain behavioral traits of the queen-workers interaction. - To study the learning ability for own and foreign queens by the use of the Proboscis Extension Reflex (PER) {{in order to have a}} tool for future tests of odorous compounds. - To compare the cuticular pattern of queens of different origin. In all three approaches, virgin and mated queens and queens of different kin relation to each other were reared and established in Kirchhainer nuclei colonies. These queens were compared due to the following hypothesis: If the workers perceive their own queen by a distinct smell and if closely related queens have a more similar chemical pattern on the cuticle, then a related foreign queen should be easier ?learned?/ accepted than a non related one. For this purpose, first a specific bioassay had to be developed and established to enable the record of workers behavior to the queen without an inhibition of the complex social interactions between queens and workers. This ?cage bioassay? consists of a small wooden box with a glass front, a wax comb, 30 - 40 worker bees and a queen. For the tests, the own queen of this mini-colony was removed and a foreign queen was introduced. For a period of about 2 hours certain aggressive and benign actions, respectively, of the workers toward the queen were recorded. In the first set of tests, queens of different kin relations were compared. The results showed, in general, an aggressive reaction against the introduced foreign queens. However, there were clear lower benign and stronger aggression behaviors against unrelated queens compared to the related ones. Some of the unrelated queens were even killed. However, these differences were only significant when virgin queens were exchanged but not when mated queens were used. Concerning the duration of the aggressive action of workers, aggression generally decreased between the beginning and the end of the test; again, this was significant only in the experiments with virgin queens. This indicates, that at least in virgin queens the individual recognition by the worker bees depends on a kin specific odorous pattern of the queen. The same types of queens used in the cage bioassays were used for the learning experiments. A classical olfactory conditioning (PER) of worker honeybees was applied by using a living queen as the source of odor. Hereby the queen was offered in a way that the worker bees could not touch the body surface. The gradual increase in the learning curves was a good indication that the workers are able to learn the queen?s odor and, therefore, can be used as a kind of ?biosensor?. After having learned a queen?s odor, the conditioned workers were tested by offering virgin and mated queens, respectively, with defined kin relation to the queen used for the conditioning before. The results revealed clear differences in the cues used for the ?learning? of individual mated and individual virgin queens, respectively. The workers could significantly discriminate between the learned odor of a mated queen and any other mated queen irrespective of the relatedness. In contrast, worker bees could not discriminate virgin queens from each other. As the worker could only use volatile substances for the associative learning, one can conclude the following: In virgin queens the volatile ?bouquet? is neither individual specific nor kin specific. In mated queens the bouquet has only an individual specificity. Probably, the huge amount of many volatile gland products (including the main component 9 -ODA) makes each mated queen ?unique?. But as in the cage bioassays the worker could recognize whether an introduced virgin queen was related to the own queen or not, these recognition must depend on non volatile substances of the virgin queens cuticle which are perceived by licking. If learned and tested queens were of different mating status the worker bees could significantly discriminate between such individuals (except learned odor of mated queens/ tested odor of related virgin queens). This is not surprising because the GC-MS analysis confirmed the huge differences in the odorous pattern (and here mainly the volatile polar gland products) between virgin (= young) and mated (=elder) queens. From the same types of queens used for the cage bioassays and PER, queens? heads and abdomens were extracted in a solvent and the obtained extracts were analyzed using GC-MS. From the extracts of queen abdomens 32 substances (hydrocarbons and polar compounds) were identified and chosen to calculate the ?chemical distance? between queens of different kin relation (sister vs. unrelated) and between sister queens having different ages and mating status. For that purpose, a matrix of Nei-distances was applied as a measure for the similarity of different patterns. The results showed a significantly higher concordance in the chemical pattern within sister queens compared to non related ones. The ?chemical distance? increased from sister queens over half sister to non-related queens. Cluster analyses of the Nei distance and multidimensional scaling clearly confirmed the differentiation between unrelated queens and the similarity of sister queens. Using the same statistical methods, also a clear differentiation between queens of different ages and mating status could be demonstrated. The results presented in this work confirmed with 3 different approaches that workers are able to learn their own queen with different learning cues depending on the mating status of the queen. In virgin queens it could be demonstrated for the first time that the kin relation between different queens can be recognized, presumably by low or <b>non-volatile</b> <b>substances.</b> The chemical analyses confirmed that the cuticular pattern of queens could be used for the differentiation not only according to age but also according to kin. Das Sozialverhalten innerhalb eines Bienenvolkes (Apis mellifera L.) wird durch ein wirkungsvolles Kommunikationsnetzwerk koordiniert, in dem Königinnenpheromone eine zentrale Rolle bei der Kontrolle von Verhalten und Reproduktion der Arbeiterinnen spielen. Die meisten Pheromone werden in der Mandibel- und der Tergittaschendrüse gebildet. Die Perzeption dieser Pheromone durch die Arbeiterinnen erfolgt durch Betasten mit den Antennen und Lecken an der Kutikula der Königinnen. Die Arbeiterinnen eines Volkes sind in der Lage ihre eigene Königin zu erkennen. Ungeschützt ins Bienenvolk eingebrachte fremde Königinnen werden normalerweise von den Arbeiterinnen getötet. Es gibt zahlreiche Untersuchungen zu Primer- und Releaser-Effekten von bestimmten Bestandteilen des Königinnenpheromons. Nach wie vor ist aber nicht bekannt, wie die Arbeiterinnen zwischen ihrer eigenen und fremden Königinnen unterscheiden. Die Tatsache, dass Königinnen erfolgreich ausgetauscht werden können, nachdem man sie einige Tage lang durch einen Käfig geschützt hat, zeigt, dass die Arbeiterinnen in der Lage sind, den Geruch der Königin zu lernen. Vermutlich ist ein bestimmtes chemisches Muster der Kutikula (Duft oder Geschmack) für die Erkennung und Akzeptanz als ?eigen? verantwortlich. Diese Arbeit hat daher drei verschiedene Zielsetzungen: - das Verhalten von Bienen gegenüber eigenen und fremden Königinnen besser zu verstehen und bestimmte Verhaltensmerkmale der Interaktion zwischen Königin und Arbeiterinnen in einem Biotest zu quantifizieren - mit Hilfe des Rüssel-Reflexes (PER) zu prüfen, ob fremde und eigene Königinnen anhand von Duftstoffen ?erlernt? werden können - die Zusammensetzung der Kutikuladuftstoffe von Königinnen unterschiedlicher Verwandtschaft und Paarungsstatus zu untersuchen Für alle drei Ansätze wurden unbegattete und begattete Königinnen mit unterschiedlichen Verwandtschaftsverhältnissen zueinander aufgezogen und in Kirchhainer Begattungskästchen gehalten. Der Arbeit lag die folgende Hypothese zu Grunde: Wenn Arbeiterinnen ihre Königin anhand eines eindeutigen Dufts wahrnehmen und verwandte Königinnen ein ähnlicheres chemisches Muster besitzen, sollte der Duft einer verwandten Königinnen leichter gelernt oder akzeptiert werden, als der einer nicht verwandten Königin. Zunächst war es notwendig, einen speziellen Biotest zu entwickeln und zu etablieren, der eine quantitative Erfassung des Verhaltens der Arbeiterinnen gegenüber der Königin erlaubt, ohne die sozialen Interaktionen zwischen Königinnen und Arbeiterinnen zu stören. Dieser ?Käfig-Biotest? besteht aus einer kleinen Holzkiste mit einer Glasscheibe, einer Wabe mit 30 - 40 Arbeiterinnen und einer Königin.
