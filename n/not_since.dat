5|$|The 1983 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in 53years, during which only four tropical storms formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season had very little activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher.

5|$|Following the All Blacks' semi-final {{loss in the}} 1999 Rugby World Cup, Wayne Smith succeeded John Hart as All Blacks coach.

In Deans' {{first year}} in charge, the Crusaders won their third title in a row − a feat that has <b>not</b> <b>since</b> been repeated. The Crusaders {{finished second in the}} round-robin, earning them the right to host a semi-final in which they faced the Highlanders at Jade Stadium. Two tries in the final 20 minutes by Marika Vunibaka helped the Crusaders to a 37–15 win. The 2000 Super 12 Final was played against the Brumbies in Canberra, Australia, where the weather for the final was icy, with sleet and snow. The game was low-scoring, with only one try each. Four penalties by Mehrtens gave the Crusaders a 12–6 half time lead. Following a Brumbies penalty four minutes from time, the Brumbies led 19–17. However, the Crusaders were awarded a penalty from the resulting kick-off, and after Mehrtens converted the penalty, the Crusaders {{went on to win the}} game 20–19.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the growth}} of phylogenetic studies in the 1980s, Coelurus has usually {{been found to be}} a coelurosaurian of {{uncertain}} affinities, not fitting with the better-known clades of the Cretaceous. Along with several other generalized coelurosaurians such as the compsognathids, Ornitholestes, and Proceratosaurus, it has had multiple placements around the base of Coelurosauria. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut (2003) and Smith et al. (2007) found that Coelurus was more closely related to compsognathids than to other coelurosaurs. Oliver Rauhut (2003) proposed that Coeluridae was composed of Coelurus plus the compsognathids, but he and others have <b>not</b> <b>since</b> found the compsognathids to group with Coelurus. However, a work published by Phil Senter in 2007 following the description of Tanycolagreus found it and Coelurus to be closely related at the base of Tyrannosauroidea. Senter proposed that Coelurus and Tanycolagreus were the only coelurids and were actually tyrannosauroids, but the phylogenetic analysis of Turner et al. (2007b) found that Coelurus was a basal coelurosaur, although more derived than the tyrannosaurids. Zanno in 2010 recovered Coelurus as a basal maniraptoran. Coelurus is sometimes put into its own family, Coeluridae, although the membership of the family has not been stable.|$|E
5|$|Following a spell in England {{playing for}} Sheffield Wednesday and Grimsby Town, Roy Coyle joined the club as player-manager, {{taking over the}} reigns from {{outgoing}} manager Billy Campbell. After a tough start to his managerial career at the club, Coyle {{went on to become}} the most successful Linfield manager in history, winning numerous trophies during his time at Windsor Park. His first season in charge was without silverware. In fact, having been Irish Cup runners-up the previous season when Coleraine defeated the Blues 1–0 after two replays, Linfield suffered one of the biggest upsets in Northern Irish football history when B Division club Carrick Rangers defeated the Blues 2–1 in the 1975–76 Irish Cup final on 10 April 1976. This giant-killing act in which a junior club defeated a senior club in the Irish Cup final had only happened twice before in the cup's history, and <b>not</b> <b>since</b> 1955 – 21 years earlier. The club stuck by Coyle however, and it was not long before he brought silverware to the club. His first honour arrived in the 1976–77 season in the form of the County Antrim Shield. However, the Blues suffered defeat in the Irish Cup final for the third consecutive season when they once again lost out against Coleraine – losing 4–1. The 1977–78 season saw the club win an Irish League, Irish Cup and Ulster Cup treble. Runners-up in the last three Irish Cup finals, this time they were not to be denied. A 3–1 victory over Ballymena United secured the club's third trophy of the season.|$|E
