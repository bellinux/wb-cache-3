40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} a content {{analysis}} of news sent by China to CNN <b>World</b> <b>Report.</b> Significant differences are found between the <b>news</b> sent before <b>and</b> that sent after the 1989 Pro-democracy Movement. During the pre-movement period, economic news {{was the type of}} story from China most frequently aired on CNNWR while news that was supportive as well as news that was critical of the government were both well-represented. After the student movement, political <b>news</b> increased dramatically <b>and</b> there was much less negative <b>news</b> <b>and</b> more supportive <b>news</b> during this period. Another interesting finding is that the news patterns of the stories sent by China to CNNWR in 1994 resembled the news patterns of those sent before the 1989 student movement, both in <b>news</b> categories <b>and</b> <b>news</b> direction. 1. Statement of research problem On October 26, 1987, Cable News Network inaugurated one of its new international newscasts, CNN <b>World</b> <b>Report.</b> For the first time, television viewers in the United States could see news from around the world from the perspectives of non-American journalists (Dilawari et al., 1991). As an international newscast <b>and</b> <b>news</b> exchange, <b>World</b> <b>Report</b> is unprecedented in terms of its scope, diversity and balance of its coverage and in the nature of its content. It represents a dramatic shift in the historic pattern of international <b>news</b> content <b>and</b> <b>news</b> flow (Flournoy, 1992). Beginning in May 1988, the People’s Republic of China started to send news to CNN <b>World</b> <b>Report.</b> This paper examines what kinds of report...|$|R

5|$|Given {{the losses}} of {{industry}} and jobs, St. Louis has had significant and persistent problems with both crime and perceptions of crime. In 2011 St. Louis was named by U.S. <b>News</b> <b>and</b> <b>World</b> <b>Report</b> as the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of firearm deaths for the metropolitan statistical area was one-fifth of the city rate.|$|E
