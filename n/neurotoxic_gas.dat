Human Rights Watch's witnesses reported [...] "symptoms and delivery methods consistent with the use of chemical nerve agents." [...] Activists and local residents contacted by The Guardian said that [...] "the remains of 20 rockets to have been carrying <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>gas</b> were found in the affected areas. Many remained mostly intact, suggesting that they did not detonate on impact and potentially dispersed gas before hitting the ground." ...|$|E
50|$|Love {{manages to}} obtain a Speed inhaler while in custody and inhales it, helping her to escape and destroy the entire police station, killing {{everyone}} present including Aayushi. Akhilan finds out that Love had made a satellite call to Chang, the Transport Minister of Malaysia who had allowed Love to send shipments of Speed inhalers to India to perpetrate terror attacks there in return for money. He rushes to the hospital where Chang is admitted and interrogates him. During the interrogation, Love sneaks into the hospital and hiding in the AC vent, sprays a <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>gas</b> in Chang's room, causing Akhilan and Chang to get paralysed. She then kills Chang and puts the knife on Akhilan's hand, framing him as Chang's assassin. Now a wanted criminal, Akhilan, despite being paralysed, somehow manages {{to escape from the}} hospital and the Malaysian police.|$|E

Frogs were intoxicated 3 days before the test with parcially purified toxins of Cl. perfringens, Cl. oedematiens and Cl. septicum. The intoxication produced a shortening of spinal reflexes duration time of such preparations, showing a typical alteration of the reflex activity of the spinal cord...|$|R

This paper describes and shows {{the results of a}} novel method of visualizing environmental emissions of corrosive gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) exposure using photographic paper. H 2 S is a <b>neurotoxic</b> and flammable <b>gas</b> that smells like rotten eggs and is frequently associated with oil and natural gas extraction. Communities living with oil and gas development in Wyoming report odors of rotten eggs and describe symptoms of H 2 S exposure. H 2 S is recognized as an acute and chronic threat to human and environmental health and oil and gas companies are required to have plans in place to prevent and respond to accidental, high concentration releases of H 2 S. They are not, however, required to monitor, report or prevent routine daily emissions. Yet 15 - 25 % of the oil and gas wells in the US are predicted to contain H 2 S, and some communities surrounded by multiple wells report chronic, routine exposure. Chronic exposure is difficult to represent with current tools for monitoring H 2 S because they are designed to measure acute workplace exposure. Informed by STS theories of black boxes and regimes of imperceptibility that focus on the need to revise not only regulations but also material tools of science, this paper describes the development of an indexical approach to visualizing this hazard. In indexical design, the reactive sensing element of a scientific instrument is brought to the foreground. The silver in the photopaper is an index as it tarnishes with H 2 S exposure. Discolored tests strips can be arranged together to form data-rich maps of the exposure landscape where this discoloration both represents how the gas spreads through a space and is a physical trace of the gas. Preliminary results in the form of data-rich maps show that regulating H 2 S emissions as primarily accidental is inappropriate and fails to adequately protect human health...|$|R
