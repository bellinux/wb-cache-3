50|$|With {{different}} CAD systems {{the approach}} varies slightly {{depending on whether}} the ownership, and therefore authorship, of components changes or not. If geometry only has to be viewed then a Product visualization <b>neutral</b> <b>file</b> format (e.g.JT) can be used for tasks such as viewing, markup (redlining) or multi-cad digital mock-up (DMU). It maybe that authorship does not change but components from one group needs to be placed in the assembly of another group so that they can construct their parts, so called work in context. This requires transfer of geometry from one format to another by means of a visualization format or full data translation. Between some systems there is the possibility of ‘data interoperability’ where geometry from one format can be associatively copied to another. If the ownership of a particular file is being transfer, then full data translation is required using some form of CAD data exchange technology. For the translation process Product Data Quality (PDQ) checkers are often employed to reduce problems in transferring the work.If different PDM/EDM systems are in use, then either data structures or metadata can be transferred using STEP or communication between databases can be achieved with tools based around XML data transfer.|$|E

Secondly, when the B-Rep model is projected to generate a number of aspect views {{that make up an}} aspect graph, the edge sets from each aspect view that correspond to certain pose parameters are computed for next matching. In the same way, the edges in the search image containing real B-Rep object are detected and merged according to contiguity and continuity rule, and then the search image is characterized into the edge set.

40|$|CAD-models {{of parts}} {{produced}} by injection moulding or die casting are often complex making {{the task of}} automated geometrical idealisation for finite element analysis difficult. Conventional tools for geometric idealisation are not ideal for the task as will be shown in the thesis. To address the idealisation problem this thesis proposes a novel method of creating geometric idealisations of CAD-models for finite element analysis. Knowledge about the production and design processes is used to support the idealisations. The key idea is simplify the idealisation problem by using the fact that die-cast and injection-moulded parts have a clearly defined tooling draft direction. It is primarily the mid-surfaces of the thin-walled geometry that are extracted for shell element meshing. The ideas have been tested by {{the creation of a}} CAD-integrated system which reads the construction history tree of the CAD-model and creates an idealised geometry in the same CAD-model automatically. It is also shown how the system can be used for idealising <b>neutral</b> format <b>files</b> by creating a virtual construction history tree in interaction with the user.

40|$|AbstractFatigue {{failures}} {{have sometimes}} {{taken place in}} weld joints due to stress concentration and tensile residual stress at the weld toe. Therefore managements of fatigue crack initiation and propagation contribute to the enhancement of the fatigue life of welded steel structures. The hammer peening process is well {{known as one of}} methods to improve the fatigue life of weld joints by generating the compressive residual stress field near the weld toe where recognized as the fatigue crack initiation site. With respect to the fatigue life estimation of the welded steel structure which applied the compressive residual stress field near the weld toe, it is important not only fatigue life estimation for the fatigue crack initiation but also that for the fatigue crack propagation. However there is few research work which deal with the fatigue crack estimation in the compressive residual stress field. In this study, mechanism of fatigue crack propagation in the compressive residual stress field was clarified by experimental observation of crack propagation from a surface crack after hammer peening. Morphology of a propagating surface crack in plate and gusset weld joint specimens were measured by the beach mark method.

40|$|CAD) tools, {{which were}} {{introduced}} in the 1960 s, represented tremendous productivity gains over paper drawings, such as ease to revise and archive. CAD tools also opened new opportunities, such as enabling manufacturing instructions to be derived automatically and executed directly from the drawing. Nevertheless, as computer design and manufacturing tools proliferated to meet increasingly complex and diverse engineering needs, so did the formats that each tool used to capture and store product data. While paper drawings can be marked up by anyone with a pencil, a product model that cannot be interpreted by the necessary CAD tool is useless. For organizations to share designs across various CAD and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) tools, their data files must be formatted {{in a manner that}} the tool can recognize. This requirement has become increasingly important in an age where large manufacturers often form joint ventures to address a business opportunity, and where partners in a supply chain are being called upon to deliver an increasingly complex array of services. Most companies find it difficult to enforce the use of a common set of CAD/CAM tools within their organiza-tion, much less across (multiple) supply chains and among joint venture partners. Because of the lack of any common set of tools, a common format for <b>neutral</b> <b>file</b> exchange is needed. Using a neutral standard for transferring information across systems drastically reduces the requirements for translators. The cost benefits are suggested by the reduction in necessary translators shown in Fig. 1. It illustrates that by using a <b>neutral</b> <b>file</b> exchange, the number of translators (for N systems) can be reduced from scaling as n (n– 1) to 2 n. In 1979, a series of events catalyzed the CAD vendor and user community to create the first national standard for CAD data exchange, which is documented in the report Initial Graphics Exchange Specification, Version 1. 0 [1]. CAD systems were less than ten years old, and only a handful of products had any significant market penetration.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Soil {{microorganisms}} are key {{determinants of}} soil fertility and plant health. Soil phytopathogenic fungi {{are one of}} the most important causes of crop losses worldwide. Microbial biocontrol agents have been extensively studied as alternatives for controlling phytopathogenic soil microorganisms, but molecular interactions between them have mainly been characterised in dual cultures, without taking into account the soil microbial community. We used an RNA sequencing approach to elucidate the molecular interplay of a soil microbial community in response to a plant pathogen and its biocontrol agent, in order to examine the molecular patterns activated by the microorganisms. RESULTS : A simplified soil microcosm containing 11 soil microorganisms was incubated with a plant root pathogen (Armillaria mellea) and its biocontrol agent (Trichoderma atroviride) for 24 h under controlled conditions. More than 46 million paired-end reads were obtained for each replicate and 28, 309 differentially expressed genes were identified in total. Pathway analysis revealed complex adaptations of soil microorganisms to the harsh conditions of the soil matrix and to reciprocal microbial competition/cooperation relationships. Both the phytopathogen and its biocontrol agent were specifically recognised by the simplified soil microcosm: defence reaction mechanisms and neutral adaptation processes were activated in response to competitive (T. atroviride) or non-competitive (A. mellea) microorganisms, respectively. Moreover, activation of resistance mechanisms dominated in the simplified soil microcosm in the presence of both A. mellea and T. atroviride. Biocontrol processes of T. atroviride were already activated during incubation in the simplified soil microcosm, possibly to occupy niches in a competitive ecosystem, and they were not further enhanced by the introduction of A. mellea. CONCLUSIONS : This work represents an additional step towards understanding molecular interactions between plant pathogens and biocontrol agents within a soil ecosystem. Global transcriptional analysis of the simplified soil microcosm revealed complex metabolic adaptation in the soil environment and specific responses to antagonistic or <b>neutral</b> intruders.
