50|$|Following {{a change}} {{back to the}} {{original}} system in 1946 a new system was introduced on 1 January 1948. Each company was allocated a number which followed the British <b>nationality</b> <b>marking</b> G and then followed by an individual identity number. For example Blackburn Aeroplane & Motor Company were allocated G-2 and the first allocation G-2-1 was used on a Miles Messenger used as an engine testbed for the Cirrus Bombardier. Companies could allocate and re-use the identities as they liked, some ran in sequence from 1 and others used the aircraft manufacturers serial number as part of the marking, for example G-51-200 was a Britten Norman Islander with a manufacturers serial number of 200. Allocations of codes from defunct companies have been reallocated.|$|R

Depending on the country of registration, this suffix is a numeric or alphanumeric code, and consists of one to five digits or characters respectively. A supplement to Annex 7 provides an updated list of approved <b>nationality</b> and common <b>marks</b> used by various countries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first use}} of {{aircraft}} registrations {{was based on the}} radio callsigns allocated at the London International Radiotelegraphic Conference in 1913. The format was a single letter prefix followed by four other letters (like A-BCDE). The major nations operating aircraft were allocated a single letter prefix. Smaller countries had to share a single letter prefix, but were allocated exclusive use of the first letter of the suffix. This was modified by agreement by the International Bureau at Berne and published on April 23, 1913. Although initial allocations were not specifically for aircraft but for any radio user, the International Air Navigation Convention held in Paris in 1919 (Paris Convention of 1919) made allocations specifically for aircraft registrations, based on the 1913 callsign list. The agreement stipulated that the <b>nationality</b> <b>marks</b> were to be followed by a hyphen then a group of four letters that must include a vowel (and for the convention Y was considered to be a vowel). This system operated until the adoption of the revised system in 1928.|$|R

The recent introduction of the first level nursing education at university in Italy primed many changes processes and required to think new methods and contents. The study was descriptive and retrospective. The setting is an Italian School of Nursing. It was considered a sample constituted by 2 three years. Academic success was defined such as the capability of the student to finish formative pathway in three years with a final mark > 90 / 110. An half of sample (53. 7 %, 66 / 123) finished the studies in three years. Variables that more influenced academic success were age, <b>nationality,</b> admission <b>mark,</b> evaluations obtained in professionals and tutorship formative activity. To know factors influenced academic success provides some indications that should be useful to define "at risk" students for which to plan formative pathways and specific supports...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the Sakhalin Korean repatriates in South Korea and how it exemplifies the politics of inclusion and exclusion and how these are intertwined with one another through interactions and negotiations among different interests and discourse that take place in multi-scale regulatory processes. Sakhalin Koreans moved to Sakhalin as early as the 1920 s as subjects of Imperial Japan to work at the coal mines in Sakhalin. Many of them could not return to Japan nor Korea even after the end of the Second World War and many were forced to take North Korean or Soviet (Russian) <b>nationalities.</b> 1989 <b>marked</b> a turning point for the repatriation of Sakhalin Koreans as the South Korean government, in cooperation with the Japanese government, as well as the Japanese and Korean Red Cross, worked together to “bring back” the Sakhalin Koreans to their home. This paper examines the historical background to the Sakhalin Koreans, the repatriation or “return home” policy, how the politics of both inclusion and exclusion affect the Sakhalin Koreans, and the challenges that they face in Korean society today...|$|R

The persons who could not provide evidence in favour of their Indian <b>nationality</b> were <b>marked</b> with D in the electoral rolls, to indicated doubtful or disputed status of their Indian nationality. During the survey, the absentee voters too were marked with D. Around 370,000 persons were thus declared as D voters by the Election Commission of India. The persons marked as D voters were barred from contesting the elections and casting their votes. The Election Commission of India further directed the D voters {{to be put on}} trial before the Foreigners Tribunals set up under the Foreigner (Tribunal) Order of 1964.

60|$|He haunted {{the studios}} a good deal, {{and through a}} {{retrospective}} affinity with art, and a human sympathy with the sacrifice which it always involves, he was on friendly terms with sculptors and painters who were not in every case so friendly with one another. More than once he saw the scars of old rivalries, and he might easily have been an adherent {{of two or three}} parties. But he tried to keep the freedom of the different camps without taking sides; and he felt the pathos of the case when they all told the same story of the disaster which the taste for bric-à-brac had wrought to the cause of art; how people who came abroad no longer gave orders for statues and pictures, but spent their money on curtains and carpets, old chests and chairs, and pots and pans. There were some among these artists whom he had known twenty years before in Florence, ardent and hopeful beginners; and now the backs of their grey or bald heads, as they talked to him with their faces towards their work, and a pencil or a pinch of clay held thoughtfully between their fingers, appealed to him as if he had remained young and prosperous, and they had gone forward to age and hard work. They were very quaint at times. They talked the American slang of the war days and of the days before the war; without a mastery of Italian, they often used the idioms of that tongue in their English speech. They were dim and vague about the country, with whose affairs they had kept up through the newspapers. Here and there one thought he was going home very soon; others had finally relinquished all thoughts of return. These had, perhaps without knowing it, lost the desire to come back; they cowered before the expensiveness of life in America, and doubted of a future with which, indeed, only the young can hopefully grapple. But in spite of their accumulated years, and the evil times on which they had fallen, Colville thought them mostly very happy men, leading simple and innocent lives in a world of the ideal, and rich in the inexhaustible beauty of the city, the sky, the air. They all, whether they were ever going back or not, were fervent Americans, and their ineffaceable <b>nationality</b> <b>marked</b> them, perhaps, all the more strongly for the patches of something alien that overlaid it in places. They knew that he was or had been a newspaper man; but if they secretly cherished the hope that he would bring them to the dolce lume of print, they never betrayed it; and the authorship of his letter about the American artists in Florence, which he printed in the American Register at Paris, was not traced to him for a whole week.|$|R
60|$|I am {{told that}} it is not {{scientific}} to treat national character as a product of climate. This only shows the wide difference between common knowledge and the intellectual game called science. We have men of exactly the same stock, and speaking the same language, growing in Great Britain, in Ireland, and in America. The result is three of the most distinctly <b>marked</b> <b>nationalities</b> under the sun. Racial characteristics are quite another matter. The difference between a Jew and a Gentile {{has nothing to do with}} the difference between an Englishman and a German. The characteristics of Britannus are local characteristics, not race characteristics. In an ancient Briton they would, I take it, be exaggerated, since modern Britain, disforested, drained, urbanified and consequently cosmopolized, is presumably less characteristically British than Caesar's Britain.|$|R
40|$|Tracing a {{route through}} the recent 'ugly history' of British citizenship, this article {{advances}} two central claims. Firstly, British citizenship {{has been designed}} to fail specific groups and populations. Failure, it argues, is a design principle of British citizenship, in the most active and violent sense of the verb to design: to mark out, to indicate, to designate. Secondly, British citizenship is a biopolitics - a field of techniques and practices (legal, social, moral) through which populations are controlled and fashioned. This article begins with the 1981 Nationality Act and the violent conflicts between the police and black communities in Brixton that accompanied the passage of the Act through the British parliament. Employing Michel Foucault's concept of state racism, it argues that the 1981 <b>Nationality</b> Act <b>marked</b> a pivotal moment in the design of British citizenship and has operated as the template for a glut of subsequent nationality legislation that has shaped who can achieve citizenship. The central argument is that the existence of populations of failed citizens within Britain is not an accident of flawed design, but is foundational to British citizenship. For many 'national minorities' the lived realities of biopolitical citizenship stand in stark contradistinction to contemporary governmental accounts of citizenship that stress community cohesion, political participation, social responsibility, rights and pride in shared national belonging...|$|R
60|$|In {{nearly all}} of Goldoni's Venetian comedies, and in many which he wrote in Italian, appear the {{standard}} associates of Facanapa,--Arlecchino, il Dottore. Pantalon dei Bisognosi, and Brighella. The reader is at first puzzled by their constant recurrence, but never weary of Goldoni's witty management of them. They are the chief persons of the obsolete commedia a braccio, and have their <b>nationality</b> and peculiarities <b>marked</b> by immemorial attribution. Pantalon is a Venetian merchant, rich, and commonly the indulgent father of a wilful daughter or dissolute son, figuring also sometimes as the childless uncle of large fortune. The second old man is il Dottore, who is a Bolognese, and a doctor of the University. Brighella and Arlecchino are both of Bergamo. The one is a sharp and roguish servant, busy-body, and rascal; the other is dull and foolish, and always masked and dressed in motley--a gibe at the poverty of the Bergamasks among whom, moreover, the extremes of stupidity and cunning are most usually found, according to the popular notion in Italy.|$|R
40|$|In this study, I {{establish}} that language textbooks are sites of discursive struggle through which nationalist imagined communities are reproduced. I use critical discourse analysis to analyze how these textbooks construct Canadian identities that position students {{in relation to}} an imagined community of Canada. I analyze twenty-four textbooks and three Citizenship and Immigration Canada publications used in government-funded language instruction in Ontario. Representations of Canada and Canadianness in the texts examined include and exclude student readers, participate in banal nationalism, and legitimate particular understandings of Canada. The identified textbooks <b>mark</b> <b>nationality</b> through flags, maps, references to nation, {{and the use of}} nation as a frame of reference. The textbooks also make claims about how 'Canadians' think and behave. This banal nationalism naturalizes and essentializes imaginings of 'Canada' and 'Canadianness' supporting particular and interested constructions and positive evaluations of 'Canadian' identity. Both government produced publications and identified textbooks legitimate constructions of Canadian identity through repeated positive representations of Canadianness; the marginalising inclusions of 'others'; the subordination of gendered, racialised, and classed social positions to nation; and by maintaining a low level of dialogicality overall...|$|R
2500|$|Shenhav {{described}} {{the operation of}} a cultural machine which fixated the Jews from Arab countries as Arab Jews, but did so without [...] "purifying" [...] them from their Arabism, and portrayed the wide border zone along which that conversion took place. He presented a critical inquiry of the relations between Zionism and the Arab Jews by displaying Zionism as an ideological practice with three simultaneous and symbiotic categories: [...] "Nationality", [...] "Religion" [...] and [...] "Ethnicity". In order {{to be included in}} the national collective, they had to be [...] "de-Arabized". Religion distinguished between Arabs and Arab Jews, thus <b>marking</b> <b>nationality</b> among the Arab Jews. Thus, in order to belong to the Zionist-national discourse, the Arab Jews had to perform and practice Judaism. Religion, in that sense, was a means to the recruitment of the Mizrahi Jews into the Jewish nationality. Yet religion at the same time also marked them as an [...] "Ethnic" [...] group separate from the secular (Ashkenazi) Israeliness. For Shenhav, religion and nationality are not binary categories but are connected in dynamic relations. Zionist nationalism confiscated Judaism and did contain religious lineaments, but those were nationalized and re-formed. Shenhav does not suggest that Zionism made the Mizrahi Jews religious, but that Zionism orientalized them through religion. Thus, They could only exist within the national Zionist discourse by being classified as religious Jews, and that is why the intermediate category of Masortim was created.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{two prominent}} meanings of citizenship in Hong Kong: {{as a set}} of legal rules defining a person's relationship to the state, and as the values and influence that a person has as a citizen, {{in the context of the}} Basic Law. The transfer of sovereignty did not produce a significant change in either the legal or social status of citizenship, which in Hong Kong's case means 'a permanent resident with the right of abode'. Colonial rule did not provide a positive, engaged, and empowered model of citizenship, and carried few political rights. Rules on citizenship changed over the colonial period and were characterised by pragmatism. The emphasis placed on a laissez-faire market devolved responsibility on to the private sector but did little to encourage the development of 'civil society' or the even the rise of the community. The right of abode is not necessarily attached to a specific <b>nationality,</b> and thus <b>marks</b> off Hong Kong residents from other Chinese nationals and confers political and economic rights on Chinese non-nationals who are long-term residents. Through provisions relating to the autonomy of Hong Kong, the protection of human rights, and safeguards for civil society, the Basic Law appears to promise an active and engaged citizenry. However, the political structure, the restrictions on franchise, and the dominance of the executive and the weakness of the legislature tend to nullify that promise. The subordination of the executive, and to some extent the legislature and judiciary, to the Mainland authorities, which have a narrower conception of citizenship, reduces possibilities of political and social reforms through actions of political parties and social movements. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
