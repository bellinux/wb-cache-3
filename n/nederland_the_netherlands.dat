We define Automatic Accent Location as the task to describe the accent of a speaker in terms of the location of the speaker and its history. We discuss possible ways of describing accent location, the consequence these have for the task of automatic accent location, and potential evaluation metrics.

40|$|Various {{non-invasive}} {{imaging techniques}} {{are available for}} the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) is an upcoming technique that allows direct visualization of the coronary arteries. Apart from the assessment of atherosclerosis, MSCT can also provide important information on the global and regional left ventricular (LV) function. However, it should be realized that the hemodynamic consequences of atherosclerosis can not be obtained by MSCT imaging, and that functional testing, with for example nuclear imaging, will remain necessary to determine therapeutic strategy. CAD {{is the most common}} cause of chronic heart failure. Recently, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has become implemented in the treatment of patients with severe heart failure. Although the improvement in systolic function after CRT implantation can be considerable, 20 % to 30 % of patients do not respond to CRT. It has been shown that the presence of LV dyssynchrony is an important predictor of response to CRT. Gated SPECT allows not only the assessment of myocardial perfusion (scar tissue and viable myocardium) but also the evaluation of LV dyssynchrony. As many patients with heart failure undergo nuclear imaging with SPECT, integrated assessment of LV dyssynchrony, viability and scar tissue may be an attractive option. Promotores: J. J. Bax, J. W.

40|$|Background: Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a common {{debilitating}} dementia with known heritability, for which 20 late onset susceptibility loci have been identified, but more remain to be discovered. This study sought to identify new susceptibility genes, using an alternative gene-wide analytical approach which tests for patterns of association within genes, in the powerful genome-wide association dataset of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project Consortium, comprising over 7 m genotypes from 25, 580 Alzheimer's cases and 48, 466 controls. Principal Findings: In addition to earlier reported genes, we detected genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 8 (TP 53 INP 1, p = 1. 4 × 10 - 6) and 14 (IGHV 1 - 67 p = 7. 9 × 10 - 8) which indexed novel susceptibility loci. Significance: The additional genes identified in this study, have an array of functions previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease, including aspects of energy metabolism, protein degradation and {{the immune system and}} add further weight to these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's diseaseThe i-Select chips was funded by the French National Foundation on Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. The French National Fondation on Alzheimer's disease and related disorders supported several I-GAP meetings and communications.

40|$|Original title: <b>Nederland</b> deeltijdland. <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands</b> is at <b>the</b> top of {{the league}} {{when it comes to}} {{part-time}} working. Women in particular very frequently work part-time. This is blamed on the difficulty of combining paid employment with care tasks, thus limiting the scope for participation in the labour market. Is this picture correct? In this report we identify the key facts about the labour participation and working hours of women and examine the extent to which part-time working correlates with (views on) the role of the woman in the family.
