5|$|The <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic (also {{known as}} Artsakh among Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized. Today, the Republic of Armenia and <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic are de facto {{functioning}} as one entity, although the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic territory is internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan. <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> is more monoethnic than the Republic of Armenia, with 99.7% {{of its population}} being Armenian. The Azerbaijani minority {{was forced to leave}} during the war. The areas outside the original NKAO borders taken over by the Armenian forces during the war are mostly uninhabited or very sparsely inhabited, with the city of Lachin being exception. Between 2000 and 2011, 25,000 to 30,000 people settled in NKR.|$|E
5|$|Armenia {{has participated}} in the Eurovision Song Contest, a pan-European music competition, since 2006, while Azerbaijan has participated since 2008. The {{continuing}} conflict {{between the two countries}} over the region of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh,</b> which {{is considered to be a}} de jure part of Azerbaijan by the United Nations, but has been under control of the Armenia-backed de facto <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic since 1993, has affected the Eurovision Song Contest on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{estimate}} {{that with the}} accession of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic would not {{be integrated into the}} Eurasian Union. Armenia is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia will build no customs border including the region of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh.</b>|$|E

50|$|During the Soviet era, state atheism was enforced, which {{resulted}} in all of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> Churches and Mosques being closed.|$|R
5|$|In early April 1993, the Armenian forces {{captured}} Kelbajar, a city {{outside the}} originally contested areas, causing international {{attention to the}} conflict. Turkey closed its border with Armenia, while the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the act. In the summer of 1993, Armenian forces gained more territories and, by August controlled Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan. By early 1994, both countries were devastated by the war. On 5 May, the Bishkek Protocol was signed by {{the heads of the}} parliaments of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh,</b> Armenia and Azerbaijan. The <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic, backed by Armenia, established de facto control of these lands. <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> (also known as Artsakh to Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized and a de jure part of Azerbaijan. However, it is in de facto unified with Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Kelbajar lay {{outside the}} contested enclave {{of the former}} <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Autonomous Oblast, but within <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> {{geographic}} region of Azerbaijan, that Armenian and Azerbaijani forces had been fighting over for five years. The offensive {{was the first time}} Armenian forces from <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> had advanced beyond the boundaries of the enclave. Kelbajar rayon, located between Armenia and the western border of former NKAO, was composed of several dozen villages and its provincial capital, also named Kelbajar. According to Russian sources mountain troops from the 128th Regiment (7th Russian Army) stationed in Armenia participated in the seizure of Kelbajar in a blitzkrieg operation. After initial heavy resistance, the Azerbaijani defenses quickly collapsed and the provincial capital fell on April 3, 1993. Kelbajar is currently {{under the control of the}} <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic.|$|E
5|$|Armenia {{declared}} its independence on September 21, 1991 after the unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow by the CPSU hardliners. Greece {{became the first}} country to recognize the newly minted Armenian nation a few days later. Tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan continued to escalate, ultimately leading to {{the outbreak of the}} <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> War. Despite a cease-fire in place since 1994, Armenia has yet to resolve its conflict with Azerbaijan over <b>Nagorno-Karabakh.</b> The Soviet Union itself ceased to exist on December 26, 1991 and Armenia became an sovereign independent state in the international stage. The United States recognized Armenia's independence a day before.|$|E
50|$|Due to <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> being de jure part of Azerbaijan, {{recognised}} as such by {{the international}} community, the election did not receive international support.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2015, unrecognized <b>Nagorno-Karabakh’s</b> defense minister, Levon Mnatsakanyan, {{was cited}} as saying: [...] "This {{is a very}} serious {{financial}} resource for Azerbaijan and we need to deprive them of these means".|$|R
50|$|On March 7, 2008 <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> De facto {{news agency}} reports a {{concentration}} Azerbaijani troops at the contact line where the prior ceasefire violation occurred. On March 8-9 another exchange of gunfire {{occurred at the}} contact line near Agdam. Azerbaijani Defense Ministry spokesman Eldar Sabiroglu said two Azerbaijani civilians were killed and two wounded in the shooting overnight on March 8, in the Agdam region. Sabiroglu claimed that additional small arms gunfire between Armenian and Azeri troops occurred on March 9, killing one Azerbaijani soldier and injuring another. He also claimed that an Armenian soldier was also killed which <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> defense minister, Lt. Col. Senor Asratian, denied.|$|R

5|$|Pro-independence {{members were}} elected in the {{majority}} to the Armenian parliament in the 1990 election. On 23 August 1990, the Armenian parliament passed a resolution on sovereignty. The tensions grew even larger after the Soviet and Azeri forces deported thousands of Armenian from Shahumyan during Operation Ring in April and May 1991. After the unsuccessful August Putsch, more Soviet republics declared independence. On 2 September 1991, the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic proclaimed independence. On 21 September 1991, the Armenian independence referendum was held with the overwhelming majority voting for the independence of Armenia from the Soviet Union. On 26 November 1991, the Azerbaijani parliament abolished the autonomy of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh.</b> On 10 December 1991, an independence referendum was held in <b>Nagorno-Karabakh,</b> boycotted by the Azeri minority, and gained a vote of 99% in favor of independence.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kelbajar {{took place}} in March and April 1993, during the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> War. It {{resulted}} in the capture by Armenian military forces of the Kelbajar region of Azerbaijan.|$|E

5|$|Armenia {{fiercely}} contested {{the legality}} of the operation and within two months declared its independence and seceded from the Soviet Union. Within several months, the fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia would worsen and precipitate the open-phased segment of the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> War.|$|E
5|$|Every year, on 5 March (his birthday) and 27 October (the {{day of his}} assassination), Sargsyan is commemorated in Armenia and <b>Nagorno-Karabakh.</b> His comrades {{from the}} Yerkrapah Volunteer Union, high state {{officials}} and many others visit the Yerablur cemetery, where Sargsyan is buried next to many Armenian military figures.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} semi-final of the 2009 contest, the [...] "postcard" [...] video {{introducing}} {{the performance of}} the Armenian entry [...] "Jan Jan" [...] depicted, amongst other monuments, We Are Our Mountains, an art piece located in <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> capital city of Stepanakert. Due to the country's claims over the region, Azerbaijani officials objected to the portrayal of We Are Our Mountains as being an Armenian landmark. For the finals telecast, the video was edited to remove the statue.|$|R
2500|$|In 1926, {{municipal}} authorities {{adopted a}} new city layout designed by the prominent Armenian architect Alexander Tamanian; two additional designs for expansion were approved {{later on in the}} 1930s and 1960s, both of which retained Tamanian's initial plan. Several schools and two [...] "polyclinics" [...] were established, and an Armenian drama theater was founded in 1932 and named after Maxim Gorky. Stepanakert served as <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> main economic hub, and by the mid-1980s there were nineteen production facilities in the city.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy of}} Artsakh is small, but rapidly growing. The war torn economy of Karabakh shows a {{relatively}} quick and confident recovery. In 1999, the GDP figure was $59 million, 80 percent {{down on the}} figure in Soviet times. Yet, its GDP reached $114 million in 2005, double the figure in 2001, registering economic growth of 14% (in current prices) in 2005, and in 2009 it registered a GDP of $260 million, which increased to $320 million by 2010. <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> GDP (PPP) for 2010 is estimated at $1.6 billion.|$|R
5|$|In February 1988 {{a popular}} {{nationalist}} movement emerged in Soviet Armenia and the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Autonomous Oblast (NKAO), a small Armenian-populated enclave {{under the jurisdiction}} of Soviet Azerbaijan since 1923. The movement demanded the unification of the two entities, reviving the idea of a united Armenia.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013 Armenia {{announced}} its intentions {{of joining the}} Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia. The region of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh,</b> however, is disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Tensions rose further in the Caucasus region on 30 July 2014 due to clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Kelbajar {{is located}} between Armenia {{and the western}} {{boundary}} of former <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Autonomous Oblast. Situated between a steep mountain range, its wartime population of approximately 45,000–60,000 was primarily made up of ethnic Azeris and Kurds. Throughout the war, the Armenians of <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> had been voicing their discontent over seventy years of Azeri rule {{and said that they}} were defending themselves from Azerbaijan's aggression. Their capture of the towns of Khojaly and Shusha stemmed from security concerns in silencing artillery bombardments positioned in those towns. They stated that Karabakh had historically been an Armenian region and that their claims for territory did not extend beyond its boundaries.|$|E
50|$|In late August 1992, <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> {{government}} {{found itself}} in a disorderly state and its members resigned on 17 August. Power was subsequently assumed by a council called the State Defense Committee and chaired by Robert Kocharyan, which stated it would temporarily govern the enclave until the conflict ended. At the same time, Azerbaijan also launched attacks by fixed-wing aircraft, often bombing civilian targets. Kocharyan condemned what he believed were intentional attempts to kill civilians by the Azerbaijanis and also Russia's alleged passive and unconcerned attitude toward allowing its army's weapons stockpiles to be sold or transferred to Azerbaijan.|$|R
5|$|After Soviet units {{completed}} the {{operation in the}} towns, they ordered a full-scale deportation of all resident Armenians in the two towns, helicoptering them to <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> capital, Stepanakert, and later to Armenia proper. Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described the acts of violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May.|$|R
50|$|Emerging {{from the}} {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union as nascent states and due to the near-immediate fighting, it was not until mid-1993 that Armenia and Azerbaijan became signatories of international law agreements, including the Geneva Conventions. Allegations from all three governments (including <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's)</b> regularly accused the other side of committing atrocities which were at times confirmed by third party media sources or human rights organizations. Khojaly Massacre, for example, was confirmed by both Human Rights Watch and Memorial. Maraghar Massacre was testified by British-based organization Christian Solidarity International and by the Vice-Speaker of the British Parliament's House of Lords Caroline Cox in 1992. Azerbaijan was condemned by HRW for its use of aerial bombing in densely populated civilian areas and both sides were criticized for indiscriminate fire, hostage-taking and the forcible displacement of civilians.|$|R
5|$|Russian {{secret service}} {{defector}} Alexander Litvinenko accused the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of having organised the Armenian parliament shooting, ostensibly {{to derail the}} peace process, which would have resolved the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> conflict, but he offered {{no evidence to support}} the accusation. Russian and Armenian officials denied this claims.|$|E
5|$|Vazgen Sargsyan {{was awarded}} the Hero of Artsakh title, the highest award of the <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> Republic, in 1998. On 27 December 1999, {{two months after the}} {{parliament}} shooting, Sargsyan was posthumously given the National Hero of Armenia title. He widely is recognized as the founder of the Armenian army.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Arzumanyan, {{a singer}} from <b>Nagorno-Karabakh</b> {{representing}} Armenia, won the 2010 Junior Eurovision Song Contest. It was alleged by Armenian media outlets that the {{broadcast of the}} contest in Azerbaijan was interrupted when {{it became apparent that}} Armenia had won.|$|E

50|$|In January 1919, the {{commander}} of British forces in the Caspian General William M. Thomson approved Khosrov bek Sultanov's appointment by the Baku government as provisional governor general of Karabakh and Zangezur (control over Zangezur was ultimately never established), pending a final decision at the Paris Peace Conference. Sultanov was an Azerbaijani of Kurdish origin known for his anti-Armenian views, and this decision was strenuously opposed by the Armenian population of Karabakh, led by the Karabakh’s Armenian Council, which favored <b>Nagorno-Karabakh’s</b> unification with the newly established Republic of Armenia. There was also opposition voiced by the Armenian government, {{as well as a}} number of American diplomats and relief officials working in the region, who cited Sultanov’s past collaboration with the Ottoman armies that had occupied the area in 1918.|$|R
5000|$|As bombardments {{against the}} <b>Nagorno-Karabakh's</b> {{indigenous}} civilian population emanating from Agdam intensified, on July 4, an artillery bombardment was commenced by Armenian forces against the region's capital of Agdam. As the civilians began to evacuate Agdam, {{so did the}} soldiers. As house to house fighting took place, the Azeris, conflicted by desertions, undisciplined troops, and low morale, made little effort to defend the town. Within {{the end of the}} month, Armenian forces had taken hold of Agdam and an estimated 120,000 civilians had left the Agdam region. On July 29, the second UNSC resolution, 853, was passed condemning the offensive and reaffirming the previous points it had made. Despite calls to halt their advances, the Armenian government said that they had no control over the enclave's military leaders in order to call off the offensive.|$|R
