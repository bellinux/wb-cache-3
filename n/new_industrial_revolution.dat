This was the period when ‘world economies’ first began to be organized structurally through trade which led to the launch of international commerce as a form of capitalism with the Mediterranean as one of the main marketplaces (Braudel, 1993 a, 1993 b).

25|$|One of {{the real}} impetuses for United States {{entering}} the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> was {{the passage of the}} Embargo Act of 1807, the War of 1812 (1812–14) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15) which cut off supplies of <b>new</b> and cheaper <b>Industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> products from Britain. The lack of access to these goods all provided a strong incentive to learn how to develop the industries and to make their own goods instead of simply buying the goods produced by Britain.|$|R

50|$|Cullen's close {{study of}} {{economic}} trends {{has led to}} a more nuanced understanding of aspects of Irish life in 1700-1850. A traditional view had been that the economic decline of Dublin from 1801 was linked to the 1800 Act of Union with Britain, and the loss of the Parliament of Ireland and local political control. Cullen considered that the decline was inevitable, given the <b>new</b> steam-powered <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution,</b> and would have happened even if no union had occurred, and if Grattan's Parliament had managed to secure a high level of Irish autonomy.|$|R
5000|$|The largely {{differentiated}} {{agricultural landscape}} of the New England of 1850 [...] was distinct from the subsistence-dominated landscape that existed 40-60 years prior. This period of time, therefore, was not only noteworthy in terms of <b>New</b> England’s <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution,</b> but {{also in terms of}} New England’s agricultural revolution.MIT economic historian Peter Temin has pointed out that the “transformation of the New England economy in the middle fifty years of the nineteenth century was comparable in scope and intensity to the Asian ‘miracles’ of Korea and Taiwan in the half-century since World War II.” [...] The extensive changes in agriculture that occurred were an important aspect of this economic process.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the education system are largely determined by scientific and technical progress.

It is obvious that the education system needs to respond to these challenges. For the solution of relevant problems the article describes a number of urgent measures to be taken in education in the coming years. These measures are systematized depending on the factors of the fourth <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution.</b> In particular, special training of teachers, establishment of a closer partnership organizations vocational education with industry, fundamentalization of training of students, is invariant to rapidly changing technologies, and other measures.

40|$|Abstract: Now days, {{automated}} {{factories are}} ushering a <b>new</b> era of <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution,</b> such factories {{are becoming more}} complicated {{and as a result}} more difficult for diagnosis operations. The advent of hybrid diagnosis systems in recent years, has allowed the overcoming of some challenging problems related to the application of systems based on a unique model. This paper presents an approach based on reliability methods for the design of hybrid expert systems, which are a <b>new</b> trend in <b>industrial</b> diagnosis systems. First, we introduce some aspects of diagnosis problem complexity in industrial field, and then we present some of the well-known specifications and advantages of hybrid expert systems. Finally, a reliability based approach for the design of such systems is proposed and applied to a milk production unit. ...|$|R
5000|$|Since the series-wound DC motor {{develops}} {{its highest}} torque at low speed, {{it is often}} used in traction applications such as electric locomotives, and trams. The DC motor was the mainstay of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. The introduction of DC motors and an electrical grid system to run machinery starting in the 1870s started a <b>new</b> second <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution.</b> DC motors can operate directly from rechargeable batteries, providing the motive power for the first electric vehicles and today's hybrid cars and electric cars as well as driving a host of cordless tools. Today DC motors are still found in applications as small as toys and disk drives, or in large sizes to operate steel rolling mills and paper machines. Large DC motors with separately excited fields were generally used with winder drives for mine hoists, for high torque as well as smooth speed control using thyristor drives. These are now replaced with large AC motors with variable frequency drives.|$|R

This interview addressed {{the prevalence of}} the Internet of Things in manufacturing and the consequent technology-driven changes which promise to trigger a <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution.</b> At Bosch, and generally in Germany, this phenomenon {{is referred to as}} Industry 4.0. The basic principle of Industry 4.0 is that by connecting machines, work pieces and systems, businesses are creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can control each other autonomously.|$|E
5000|$|From this {{perspective}} (and from hindsight {{by comparison with}} other [...] "maturing" [...] economies) {{the growth of the}} financial sector, absolutely and relative to other sectors of the Dutch economy, may not only be seen neutrally, but even as a good thing. The sector might have been the basis for further growth during the 19th century, maybe even supported a <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> after the British model. Ironically, however, crises in the financial sector brought about the downfall of first the political structures of the old Republic, and finally the near-demise of the Dutch economy (most of all the financial sector) {{in the first decade of}} the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|The first {{transformation}} to {{an industrial}} economy from an agricultural one, {{known as the}} <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> took place from the mid-18th to early 19th century in certain areas in Europe and North America; starting in Great Britain, followed by Belgium, Germany, and France. Characteristics of this early industrialisation were technological progress, a shift from rural work to industrial labor, financial investments in <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> structure, and early developments in class consciousness and theories related to this. Later commentators have called this the First <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution.</b>|$|R

40|$|The UK {{government}} has made significant investment into so called ‘fourth-generation’ biofuel technologies. These biofuels are based on engineering the metabolic pathways of bacteria {{in order to create}} products compatible with existing infrastructure. Bacteria {{play an important role in}} what is promoted as a potentially <b>new</b> biological <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution,</b> which could address some of the negative environmental legacies of the last. This article presents results from ethnographic research with synthetic biologists who are challenged with balancing the curiosity-driven and intrinsically fulfilling scientific task of working with bacteria, alongside the policy-driven task of putting bacteria to work for extrinsic economic gains. In addition, the scientists also have to balance these demands with a new research governance framework, Responsible Research and Innovation, which envisions technoscientific innovation will be responsive to societal concerns and work in collaboration with stakeholders and members of the public. Major themes emerging from the ethnographic research revolve around stewardship, care, responsibility and agency. An overall conflict surfaces between individual agents assuming responsibility for ‘stewarding’ bacteria, against funding systems and structures imposing responsibility for economic growth. We discuss these findings against the theoretical backdrop of a new concept of ‘energopolitics’ and an anthropology of ethics and responsibility...|$|R
