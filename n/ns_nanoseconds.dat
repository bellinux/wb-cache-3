40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The g-factor of the 482 Key (Kiloelectron volt) {{state in}} Ta¹⁸¹ and the half-lives of the 25. 6 Key and 74. 5 Key states in Dy¹⁶¹ have been {{measured}} by the delayed coincidence method. The g-factor of the 482 Key state in Ta¹⁸¹ was determined by observing the effects of an external magnetic field on the angular correlation of the 133 - 482 Key gamma-ray cascade. A liquid source known to exhibit the unperturbed angular correlation was used. The source was prepared by dissolving neutron irradiated hafnium metal in 27 N hydrofluoric acid. There {{have been a number}} of determinations of the g-factor for this level by the differential-delay and integral methods; while giving information of a more detailed nature than the integral method, the main advantage of the differential method is that it yields the interaction strength directly, independent of the lifetime of the state. The value of 1. 32 + 0. 04 obtained for the g-factor in this investigation is consistent with previous determinations. The Dy¹⁶¹ source was polycrystalline in the form of the oxide and was formed by the chain decay of neutron irradiated Gd₂O₃. A measurement of the anisotropy revealed that during the interval of interest, and within the limits of statistical fluctuations, there were no time-dependent interactions tending to reorient the nuclei. The slope of the delayed coincidence curve sufficiently far removed from zero time yielded the value of 27. 78 + 0. 28 <b>ns</b> (<b>Nanoseconds)</b> for the half-life of the state intermediate to the 48. 9 - 25. 6 Key transition and agrees well with the results of previous determinations. The evaluation of data by a method of numerical integration was required for the determination of the lifetime of the state intermediate to the 57. 2 - 74. 5 Key transition due to the effects of finite time resolution. This yielded a value of 2. 91 + 0. 26 ns, which also was consistent with the results of measurements by other methods...|$|E
