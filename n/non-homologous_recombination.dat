5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. <b>Non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E

40|$|A {{new class}} of low {{molecular}} weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) genes was isolated and characterized from Aegilops comosa (2 n = 2 x = 14, MM). Although their DNA structure displayed high similarity to LMW-i type genes, there are some key differences. The deduced amino acid sequences of their mature proteins showed that the first amino acid residue of each gene was leucine and therefore they were designated as LMW-l type subunits. An extra cysteine residue was present in the signal peptide and the first cysteine residue of mature proteins located {{at the end of}} repetitive domain. Additionally, a long insertion of 10 - 22 residues (LGQQPQ(5 - 17)) occurred in the end of the C-terminal II. Comparative analysis demonstrated that LMW-l type glutenin genes possessed a great number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions. A new classification system was proposed according to the gene structure and phylogenetic analysis. In this new system, LMW-GS is classified into two major classes, LMW-M and LMW-I, with each including two subclasses. The former included LMW-m and LMW-s types while the latter contained LMW-l and LMW-i types. Analysis of their evolutionary origin showed that the LMW-l genes diverged from the group 2 of LMW-m type genes at about 12 - 14 million years ago (MYA) while LMW-i type evolved from LMW-l type at approximately 8 - 12 MYA. The LMW-s type was a variant form of group 1 of LMW-m type and their divergence occurred about 4 - 6 MYA. In addition to homologous <b>recombination,</b> <b>non-homologous</b> illegitimate <b>recombination</b> could be an important molecular mechanism for the origin and evolution of LMW-GS gene family. The secondary structure prediction suggested that the novel LMW-l type subunits, such as AcLMW-L 1 and AcLMW-L 2, may have positive effects on dough properties...|$|R

50|$|HSV-1-infection {{has been}} shown to result from the {{phosphorylation}} of Nbs1. It {{has been shown}} in studies that activation of the MRN complex and ATM biochemical cascade is consistent for a resulting HSV-1 infection. When there is an HSV-1 infection, the nucleus is reorganized causing the formation of RCs (replication compartments) where gene expression and DNA replication occurs. Proteins in the host used for DNA repair and damage response are needed for virus production. ICP8, which is a viral single-strand binding protein, is known to interact with several DNA repair proteins, such as Rad50, Mre11, BRG1, and DNA-PKcs. Ul12 and ICP8 viral proteins function together as a recombinase, possibly showing that while working with the host's recombination factors, work to form a concatemer by stimulating homologous recombination. These proteins may move the MRN complex towards the viral genome so it is able to promote homologous recombination, and to prevent <b>non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> as <b>non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> can have anti-viral effects. This possibly shows that the reaction between UL12 and MRN regulates the complex in a way that benefits the herpes virus.|$|E

Previously it {{was demonstrated}} that local hybridization between BMV RNAs (RNA–RNA heteroduplex formation) efficiently promotes <b>non-homologous</b> RNA <b>recombination.</b> In addition, {{studies on the}} role of the BMV polymerase in RNA recombination suggested that the location of non-homologous crossovers depends mostly on RNA structure. As a result, a detailed analysis of a large number of non-homologous recombinants generated in the BMV-based system was undertaken. Recombination hot-spots as well as putative elements in RNA structure enhancing non-homologous crossovers and targeting them in a site-specific manner were identified. To verify these observations the recombinationally active sequence in BMV RNA 3 derivative was modified. The results obtained with new RNA 3 mutants suggest that the primary and secondary structure of the sequences involved in a heteroduplex formation rather than the length of heteroduplex plays the most important role in the recombination process. The presented data indicate that the sequences proximal to the heteroduplex may also affect template switching by BMV replicase. Moreover, it was shown that both short homologous sequences and a hairpin structure have to accompany a double-stranded region to target non-homologous crossovers in a site-specific manner...|$|R

We previously identified the first known causative mutations for this disorder in a non-consanguineous Swiss family. The four affected male individuals (two brothers and their first two cousins) were shown to have homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) gene. Haplotype data suggested that the deletions occurred on three distinct ancestral chromosomes, implying that the FGA region of the fibrinogen locus is susceptible to deletion by a common mechanism, but the sequences responsible for the recombination remained to be identified. Here, we report the detailed characterisation of the deletion by nucleotide sequence analysis of all three deletion junctions and comparison with normal sequences. We found that all three deletions were identical to the base-pair and probably resulted from <b>non-homologous</b> (illegitimate) <b>recombination.</b> The centromeric and telomeric deletion junctions featured both a 7 bp direct repeat, AACTTTT, situated in FGA intron 1 and in the FGA-FGB intergenic sequence {{and a number of}} inverted repeats which could be involved in the generation of secondary structures.

Equal proportions of maternally and paternally derived rearrangements were seen in Aldred's series. No common breakpoints for the deletion were identified indicating that the 2q37 rearrangement is unlikely to be mediated by <b>non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> and low-copy repeats.

40|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of influenza viruses occurs both clonally and non-clonally {{through a variety}} of genetic mechanisms and selection pressures. The non-clonal {{evolution of}} influenza viruses comprises relatively frequent reassortment among gene segments and a more rarely reported process of <b>non-homologous</b> RNA <b>recombination.</b> Homologous RNA recombination within segments has been proposed as a third such mechanism, but to date the evidence for the existence of this process among influenza viruses has been both weak and controversial. As homologous recombination has not yet been demonstrated in the laboratory, supporting evidence, if it exists, may come primarily from patterns of phylogenetic incongruence observed in gene sequence data. Here, we review the necessary criteria related to laboratory procedures and sample handling, bioinformatic analysis, and the known ecology and evolution of influenza viruses that need to be met in order to confirm that a homologous recombination event occurred in the history of a set of sequences. To determine if these criteria have an effect on recombination analysis, we gathered 8307 publicly available full-length sequences of influenza A segments and divided them into those that were sequenced via the National Institutes of Health Influenza Genome Sequencing Project (IGSP) and those that were not. As sample handling and sequencing are executed to a very high standard in the IGSP, these sequences should be less likely to be exposed to contamination by other samples or by laboratory strains, and thus should not exhibit laboratory-generated signals of homologous recombination.

Conventional tools to study the frequencies of genetic recombination often rely on stable transformation-based approaches, with these systems being rarely capable of high-throughput or combinatorial analysis. We developed a series of vectors that use chemiluminescent (LUC and REN) reporter genes to assay the relative frequency of homologous and <b>non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in plants. These transient assay vectors were used to screen 14 candidategenes for their effects on recombination frequencies in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Over-expression of Arabidopsis genes with sequence similarity to SNM 1 from yeast and XRCC 3 from humans enhanced the frequency of <b>non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> when assayed using two different donor vectors. Transient N. benthamiana leaf systems were also used in an alternative assay for preliminary measurements of homologous recombination frequencies, which were found to be enhanced by over-expression of RAD 52, MIM and RAD 51 from yeast, as well as CHR 24 from Arabidopsis. The findings for the assays described here are in line with previous studies that analyzed recombination frequencies using stable transformation. The assays we report have revealed functions in <b>non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> for the Arabidopsis SNM 1 and XRCC 3 genes, so the suppression of these genes' expression offers a potential means to enhance the gene targeting frequency in plants. Furthermore, our findings also indicate that plant gene targeting frequencies could be enhanced by over-expression of RAD 52, MIM, CHR 24, and RAD 51 genes...|$|E

We have identified the first causative mutations for this disorder in a non-consanguineous Swiss family; these were homozygous deletions of approximately 11 kb of the fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA) gene. Haplotype data implied that the deletions occurred on distinct ancestral chromosomes, suggesting that this region may be susceptible to deletion by a common mechanism. All the deletions were identical to the base pair, and probably resulted from <b>non-homologous</b> (illegitimate) <b>recombination.</b> In a subsequent study of 13 unrelated patients with congenital afibrinogenemia we analyzed the FGA gene {{in order to identify}} the causative mutations, and to determine the prevalence of the 11 -kb FGA deletion. Although this deletion was found in an additional unrelated patient, the most common mutation was at the donor splice site of FGA intron 4 (IVS 4 + 1 G > T). Three frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, and one other splice site mutation were also characterized. Other studies identified one further FGA nonsense mutation, two FGB missense mutations, and one FGG nonsense mutation, all in homozygosity in a single patient. In conclusion, the majority of patients have truncating mutations in the FGA gene although, intuitively, all three fibrinogen genes could be predicted to be equally implicated.

Mapping of the translocation breakpoints of t(3; 8) and t(3; 17) found in patients with the typical clinical features of ZLS defined a common breakpoint region of 280 kb located in 3 p 14. 3, which includes the genes CACNA 2 D 3 and WNT 5 A.

Southern hybridization analysis and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) did not detect submicroscopic deletion or duplication in either CACNA 2 D 3 or WNT 5 A in ZLS-affected individuals. Mutation analysis of nine conserved nongenic sequence elements (CNEs) in 3 p 21. 1 -p 14. 3, which were identified by interspecies comparison and may represent putative regulatory elements for spatiotemporally correct expression of nearby genes, did not show any sequence alteration associated with ZLS.

DI-RNAs emerge during virus passaging in both cell-culture and their hosts as a result of <b>non-homologous</b> RNA <b>recombination.</b> However, the principles of DI-RNA emergence and their subsequent evolution have remained elusive. Using a combination of long- and short-read Next-Generation Sequencing, we have characterized the formation of DI-RNAs during serial passaging of Flock House virus (FHV) in cell-culture over a period of 30 days in order to elucidate the pathways and potential mechanisms of DI-RNA emergence and evolution. For short-read RNAseq, we employed 'ClickSeq' due to its ability to sensitively and confidently detect RNA recombination events with nucleotide resolution. In parallel, we used the Oxford Nanopore Technologies's (ONT) MinION to resolve full-length defective and wild-type viral genomes. Together, these accurately resolve both rare and common RNA recombination events, determine the correlation between recombination events, and quantifies the relative abundance of different DI-RNAs throughout passaging. We observe the formation of a diverse pool of defective RNAs at each stage of viral passaging. However, many of these 'intermediate' species, while present in early stages of passaging, do not accumulate. After approximately 9 days of passaging we observe the rapid accumulation of DI-RNAs with a correlated reduction in specific infectivity and with the Nanopore data find that DI-RNAs are characterized by multiple RNA recombination events. This suggests that intermediate DI-RNA species are not competitive and that multiple recombination events interact epistatically to confer 'mature' DI-RNAs with their selective advantage allowing for their rapid accumulation. Alternatively, it is possible that mature DI-RNA species are generated in a single event involving multiple RNA rearrangements. These insights have important consequences for our understanding of the mechanisms, determinants and limitations in the emergence and evolution of DI-RNAs...|$|R

We have developed a genetic screen to help identify mutant Arabidopsis plants that are hypersensitive to the damaging effects of UV light. Six mutants, designated uvh 1 through uvh 6, were isolated by this screening procedure. The uvh mutants, which behave as single recessive traits, form six complementation groups. Although isolated as hypersensitive to UV-C light wavelengths, all of the uvh mutants are also hypersensitive to small fluences of UV-B wavelengths that do not affect wild type plants. UV-induced damage in the uvh mutants could be reduced or eliminated by subsequent exposure to light containing photoreactivating wavelengths, suggesting that the damage is pyrimidine dimers. One of the mutants, uvh 1, was shown not to be defective in protection of chloroplast and nuclear DNA from UV-induced damage, suggesting that the defect in uvh 1 may be in repair or toleration of UV-induced damage. Further analysis revealed that levels of UV-induced DNA damage removal were the same in chloroplast and nuclear DNA of uvh 1 and wild type plants. uvh 1 was more sensitive than wild type to the rosette-inhibiting effects of ionizing radiation, suggesting a possible defect in recombinational repair in uvh 1, however, the frequency of meiotic recombination was normal in uvh 1. In a collaborative study with Dr. E.

The two parts of protein-coding genes in each Group I chimeric minichromosome are joined at a microhomologous nucleotide sequence; microhomologous nucleotide sequences are hallmarks of <b>non-homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> Group II chimeric minichromosomes contain all of the genes and the non-coding regions of two different minichromosomes. The conserved sequence blocks in the non-coding regions of Group II chimeric minichromosomes resemble the “recombination repeats” in the non-coding regions of the mt genomes of higher plants. These repeats are essential to homologous recombination in higher plants. Our analyses of the nucleotide sequences of chimeric mt minichromosomes indicate both homologous and <b>non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> between minichromosomes in the mitochondria {{of the human}} body louse...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{more than}} three decades, RNA {{recombination}} remained a puzzle and has only begun to be solved {{in the last few}} years. The available data provide evidence for a variety of RNA recombination mechanisms. <b>Non-homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> seems to be the most common for RNA. Recent experiments in both the in vitro and the in vivo systems indicate that this type of recombination may result from various transesterification reactions which are either performed by RNA molecules themselves or are promoted by some proteins. The high frequency of homologous recombination manifested by some RNA viruses can be easier explained by a replicative template switch...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Calorie or dietary {{restriction}} extends {{life span}} {{in a wide}} range of organisms including the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. Under dietary restricted conditions, P. anserina isolates are several-fold longer lived. This is however not the case in isolates that carry one of the pAL 2 - 1 homologous mitochondrial plasmids. Results We show that the pAL 2 - 1 homologues act as 'insertional mutators' of the mitochondrial genome, which may explain their negative effect on life span extension. Sequencing revealed at least fourteen unique plasmid integration sites, of which twelve were located within the mitochondrial genome and two within copies of the plasmid itself. The plasmids were able to integrate in their entirety, via a <b>non-homologous</b> mode of <b>recombination.</b> Some of the integrated plasmid copies were truncated, which probably resulted from secondary, post-integrative, recombination processes. Integration sites were predominantly located within and surrounding the region containing the mitochondrial rDNA loci. Conclusion We propose a model for the mechanism of integration, based on innate modes of mtDNA recombination, and discuss its possible link with the plasmid's negative effect on dietary restriction mediated life span extension. </p...|$|R
40|$|Topoisomerase II is a {{ubiquitous}} {{enzyme that}} removes knots and tangles from the genetic mater-ial by generating transient double-strand DNA breaks. While the enzyme cannot perform its essen-tial cellular functions without cleaving DNA, this scission activity is inherently dangerous to chromo-somal integrity. In fact, etoposide and other clinic-ally important anticancer drugs kill cells by increasing levels of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks. Cells {{rely heavily on}} recombination to repair double-strand DNA breaks, but the speci®c path-ways used to repair topoisomerase II-generated DNA damage have not been de®ned. Therefore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{was used as a}} model system to delineate the recombination pathways that repair DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase II. Yeast cells that expressed wild-type or a drug-hypersensitive mutant topoisomerase II or over-expressed the wild-type enzyme were examined. Based on cytotoxicity and recombination induced by etoposide in different repair-de®cient genetic backgrounds, double-strand DNA breaks generated by topoisomerase II appear to be repaired primarily by the single-strand invasion pathway of homolo-gous <b>recombination.</b> <b>Non-homologous</b> end joining also was triggered by etoposide treatment, but this pathway was considerably less active than single-strand invasion and did not contribute signi®cantly to cell survival in S. cerevisiae...|$|R
40|$|Regenerative {{medicine}} {{is a very}} rapidly developing discipline. Its progress contributes to elongated life expectancy and improved {{quality of life of}} patients suffering from so far incurable diseases. Stem cells (SCs) are undifferentiated cells that are able to undergo unlimited number of cell divisions and differentiation into specialized cells. Therapies based on SCs constitute a relatively new and promising approach in regenerative medicine. Radiotherapy is the most often used method in the treatment of cancer. In the future, the usage of SCs will be connected with the inevitable exposure of SCs to ionizing radiation during both treatment and diagnosis. The issue of genetic stability of SCs and cells differentiated from them is crucial, particularly regarding the application of these cells in clinical practice. It is important to emphasize that differentiated and undifferentiated cells possess different cell cycle, metabolism, initial level of reactive oxygen species, DNA repair mechanisms, susceptibility to apoptosis and frequency of mutations. All these factors contribute to the distinct radiosensitivity of SCs and differentiated cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} present the latest literature data concerning DNA repair mechanisms in pluripotent SCs (Homologous <b>Recombination,</b> <b>Non-homologous</b> End Joining, Mismatch Repair, Base Excision Repair and Nucleotide Excision Repair) in response to the influence of cyto- and genotoxic agents, such as ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutics. Evaluation the efficacy of DNA repair mechanisms is relevant for pluripotent SCs, because ineffective DNA repair mechanisms may result in the accumulation of mutations and, consequently, to cancer...|$|R
