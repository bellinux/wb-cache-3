25|$|There are {{numerous}} deposits of oil sands in the world, {{but the biggest}} and most important are in Canada and Venezuela, with lesser deposits in Kazakhstan and Russia. The total volume of non-conventional oil in the oil sands of these countries exceeds the reserves of conventional oil in all other countries combined. Vast deposits of bitumen – over 350 billion cubic metres (2.2 trillion barrels) of oil in place – exist in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

500|$|In The True Cost, Morgan {{examines}} the garment industry—specifically the fast fashion business— and links it to consumerism, globalization, capitalism, structural poverty, and oppression. In the film, it is stated {{that in the}} 1960s, the American fashion industry produced 95% of the clothes its people wore, while in the 2010s only 3% percent are produced in the United States, with the rest produced in developing countries. Operating {{in countries such as}} Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, and China, major brand manufacturers minimize costs and maximize profits by having companies in those countries competing against each other. The international brands pressure the factory owners, threatening to close and move production to another country if the clothes are <b>not</b> <b>cheap</b> enough; the owners in turn pressure their workers and, as one owner says, [...] "They're hampering me, I'm hampering my workers".|$|E

[...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself.

500|$|Rilke {{uses the}} images of love and of lovers {{as a way of}} showing mankind's {{potential}} and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels. [...] In the Second Elegy, Rilke writes that [...] "Lovers, if they knew how, might utter / wondrous things in the midnight air." [...] (Liebende könnten, verstünden sie's, in der Nachtluft / wunderlich reden.) He depicts [...] "the inadequacy of ordinary lovers" [...] and contrasts a feminine form of [...] "sublime love" [...] and a masculine [...] "blind animal passion." [...] At the time the first elegies were written, Rilke often [...] "expressed a longing for human companionship and affection, and then, often immediately afterwards, asking whether he could really respond to such companionship if it were offered to him..." [...] He notices a [...] "decline in the lives of lovers... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving." [...] Later, during World War I, he would lament that [...] "the world has fallen into the hands of men." [...] In the face of death, life and love is <b>not</b> <b>cheap</b> and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unity—that [...] "the nature of every ultimate love... is only able to reach the loved one in the infinite." ...|$|E

2500|$|While the 1965 Corvair was {{received}} as a well-engineered high performance driver's car, that accomplishment was overshadowed by the phenomenal market success of the Ford Mustang. [...] GM saw advantages to the route adopted by Ford with the Mustang, a four-seat semi-coupe body on a standard compact (Falcon) chassis with a small-block V8 motor and four-on-the-floor offered as power options. [...] The Corvair was <b>not</b> <b>cheap</b> to produce; developing and marketing a Mustang-style sport cruiser based on the Nova platform had cost advantages. [...] Unlike the Corvair, a sport cruiser could evolve within GM's standard lines of technology as competition (which in the sport sedan category of the Corvair meant BMW) demanded.

Kate White from Inside Soap later opined that Michael would be able to get the money for the flat as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement. In relation to the flat, Soaplife focussed on Ray following the dance between him and Kat, and thought that if it was him, then he is [...] "either a secret millionnaire or EastEnders hasn't thought this one through."

2500|$|Elaborately painted vases were good, {{but not the}} best, table wares {{available}} to a Greek. Metal vessels, especially from precious metals, were held in higher regard. Nonetheless, painted vases were <b>not</b> <b>cheap</b> products; the larger specimens, especially, were expensive. Around 500 BC, a large painted vase cost about one drachma, equivalent to the daily wage of a stonemason. It {{has been suggested that}} the painted vases represent an attempt to imitate metal vessels. It is normally assumed that the lower social classes tended to use simple undecorated coarse wares, massive quantities of which are found in excavations. Tablewares made of perishable materials, like wood, may have been even more widespread. Nonetheless, multiple finds of red-figure vases, usually not of the highest quality, found in settlements, prove that such vessels were used in daily life. A large proportion of production was taken up by cult and grave vessels. In any case, it can be assumed that the production of high-quality pottery was a profitable business. For example, an expensive votive gift by the painter Euphronios was found on the Athenian Acropolis. [...] There {{can be little doubt that}} the export of such pottery made an important contribution to the affluence of Athens. It is hardly surprising that many workshops appear to have aimed their production at export markets, for example by producing vessel shapes that were more popular in the target region than in Athens. The 4th century BC demise of Attic vase painting tellingly coincides with the very period when the Etruscans, probably the main western export market, came under increasing pressure from South Italian Greeks and the Romans. A further reason for the end of the production of figurally decorated vases is a change in tastes at the start of the Hellenistic period. The main reason, however, should be seen in the increasingly unsuccessful progress of the Peloponnesian War, culminating in the devastating defeat of Athens in 404 BC. After this, Sparta controlled the western trade, albeit without having the economic strength to fully exploit it. The Attic potters had to find new markets; they did so in the Black Sea area. But Athens and its industries never fully recovered from the defeat. Some potters and painters had already relocated to Italy during the war, seeking better economic conditions. A key indicator for the export-oriented nature of Attic vase production is the nearly total absence of theatre scenes. Buyers from other cultural backgrounds, such as Etruscans or later customers in the Iberian Peninsula, would have found such depiction incomprehensible or uninteresting. In Southern Italian vase painting, which was mostly not aimed at export, such scenes are quite common.|$|E
