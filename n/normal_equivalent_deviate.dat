The treatment objectives for reconstructive procedures in children with craniofacial dysmorphologies are to achieve normality. Currently ‘normality’ is defined by a set of averaged facial anthropometric data either based on averaged distances of skeletal landmarks retrieved from plain head films or facial anthropometrics. The advent of high dimensional capture of facial profile with three-dimensional surface scanners, computing power and geometric morphometrics has facilitated a {{statistical analysis}} of spatial relationships of faces. In collaboration with the Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Unit at PMH and the Melbourne Dental School we have established the first objective means to generate virtual threedimensional‘normalised’ facial profiles of patients (a <b>normal</b> <b>equivalent)</b> {{to be used as a}} primary surgical objective in cranio-maxillo-facial reconstructive procedures. This has been achieved by ‘mapping’ a patient’s 3 D image to a reference range that is referred to as a ‘normative face space’. The patient ‘mapped’ facial manifold is statistically fitted to the normal face space to establish the confidence limits of variation for all vertices (9000 pts). By applying thresholding to these confidence intervals the dysmorphic parts of the face can be isolated and colour coded images/maps generated that assist the treating clinician to define the problem. The use of statistical generated <b>normal</b> <b>equivalent</b> patient images is rapidly being introduced into clinical practice, despite being still in a development phase. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Snow {{stratigraphy}} {{and water}} percolation are key contributing factors to avalanche formation. So far, only destructive methods can provide {{this kind of}} information. Radar technology allows continuous, non-destructive scanning of the snowpack so that the temporal evolution of internal properties can be followed. We installed an upward-looking ground-penetrating radar system (upGPR) at the Weissfluhjoch study site (Davos, Switzerland). During two winter seasons (2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12) we recorded data {{with the aim of}} quantitatively determining snowpack properties and their temporal evolution. We automatically derived the snow height with an accuracy of about ± 5 cm, tracked the settlement of internal layers (± 7 cm) and measured the amount of new snow (± 10 cm). Using external snow height measurements, we determined the bulk density with a mean error of 4. 3 % compared to manual measurements. Radar-derived snow water <b>equivalent</b> <b>deviated</b> from manual measurements by ± 5 %. Furthermore, we tracked the location of the dry-to-wet transition in the snowpack until water percolated to the ground. Based on the transition and an independent snow height measurement it was possible to estimate the volumetric liquid water content and its temporal evolution. Even though we need additional information to derive some of the snow properties, our results show {{that it is possible to}} quantitatively derive snow properties with upGPR...|$|R

An analytical description of evolving contact and no-contact areas with respect to the closure pressure is also provided, resulting consistent with theoretical Hertz-based asymptotic predictions and in good agreement with available numerical estimates. Proposed model has been successfully validated through comparisons with some theoretical and experimental results available in literature, as well as with other well-established modeling approaches. Finally, the influence of main model parameters is addressed, proving also the model capability to catch the experimentally-observed dependence of the tangent-to-normal contact stiffness ratio on the closure pressure...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} {{procedure is}} presented for reliability analysis involving correlated nonnormals. <b>Equivalent</b> <b>normal</b> transformation is performed {{as in the}} first order reliability method; the correlation matrix is used as it is without orthogonal transformation. Performance functions appear as simple spreadsheet cell objects but may embody substantial user-created program codes. The multidimensional equivalent dispersion ellipsoid is likewise a single cell object that contains various spreadsheet routines for <b>equivalent</b> <b>normal</b> transformation and matrix operations. The procedure {{can be viewed as}} the constrained optimization of the equivalent hyperellipsoid (yielding the reliability index) in the original space, and is automatic and efficient in the ubiquitous spreadsheet platform. Different probability distributions can be selected at ease and conveniently transformed to <b>equivalent</b> <b>normals</b> using a short program code given in the paper. Illustrations are presented using a three-variate simple performance function and various combinations of ten common distributions. This is followed by two relatively complicated examples, namely an asymmetrically loaded beam on Winkler medium, and a complex strut with implicit performance function. The probabilities of failure inferred from reliability indices are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. The simplicity, transparency and flexibilities of the object-oriented constrained optimization approach are demonstrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
