5000|$|In 1966, Gibson {{changed the}} Thunderbird's design and construction. The {{original}} Thunderbirds (and Firebirds) had a [...] "reverse" [...] body, with the treble horn extended and the bass horn recessed. Due to a lawsuit brought by Fender {{because of the}} resemblance to the Fender Jazzmaster, the body styles were modified, with the result being called the [...] "non-reverse" [...] body. Also, the expensive neck-through construction was replaced by traditional Gibson set-neck construction. The <b>non-reverse</b> Thunderbird was continued until 1969, when the Thunderbird was discontinued. Though fewer <b>non-reverse</b> Thunderbirds were shipped, the original reverse-body instruments retain a higher collector's value. Gibson started producing the <b>non-reverse</b> Thunderbirds again for the public in late 2012.|$|R

50|$|A <b>non-reversing</b> mirror (sometimes {{referred}} to as a flip mirror) is a mirror that presents its subject as it would be seen from the mirror. A <b>non-reversing</b> mirror can be made by connecting two regular mirrors at their edges at a 90 degree angle. If the join is positioned so that it is vertical, an observer looking into the angle will see a non-reversed image. This can be seen in public toilets when there are mirrors on two walls which are at right angles. Looking towards the corner, such an image is visible. The problem with this type of <b>non-reversing</b> mirror {{is that there is a}} big line down the middle interrupting the image. However, if first surface mirrors are used, and care is taken to set the angle to exactly 90 degrees, the join can be made invisible.|$|E

40|$|Two studies {{evaluated}} {{the psychometric properties}} and the latent structure of the Portuguese version of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) in a large Brazilian college student sample. Results indicated that PSWQ had an adequate internal consistency. Exploratory factor analyses yielded a two-factor solution. One factor {{was related to the}} worry presence and incorporated all the <b>non-reversed</b> items. The other factor was associated to worry absence and incorporated all the reversed items. Confirmatory factor analysis leaded to a three-factor solution. One factor included all the PSWQ items whereas the two other factors were linked to the reversed and <b>non-reversed</b> worded items. Correlations coefficients of these two reversed and <b>non-reversed</b> factors with the total scores of the PSWQ and the trait form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory suggest that PSWQ has a single meaningful construct...|$|R

50|$|Another type of <b>non-reversing</b> mirror {{can be made}} {{by making}} the mirror concave (curved inwards like a bowl). At a certain {{distance}} from the mirror a non-reversed image will appear. The disadvantage of this is that it only works at a certain distance.|$|E

However, this relation does not hold in the general case: if, for instance, a constant, unidirectional acceleration is reversed after (t1 &minus; t0)/2 then the velocity difference is 0, but delta-v is the same as for the <b>non-reversed</b> thrust.|$|R
50|$|Acute graft {{occlusion}} is the occlusion (blockage) of a vascular {{bypass graft}} {{shortly after the}} bypass is performed. Its causes, which are distinct from those of chronic graft occlusion, include technical failure (e.g. anastomotic stricture, incomplete valve lysis in <b>non-reversed</b> vein) and thrombosis. It is rare, but almost always requires reoperation.|$|R
50|$|They {{are made}} for {{applications}} requiring a strict reflection without a ghosting effect as seen with a second surface mirror, where a faint secondary reflection could be observed, coming from the front surface of the glass. This includes most optics applications where light is being manipulated in a specific manner. Telescopes, rear-projection televisions, periscopes, <b>non-reversing</b> mirrors, high quality kaleidoscopes, and the animation process Spectrafocus use this type of mirror.|$|E
5000|$|A third type of <b>non-reversing</b> mirror {{was created}} by {{mathematics}} professor R. Andrew Hicks in 2009. It was created using computer algorithms to generate a [...] "disco ball" [...] like surface. The thousands of tiny mirrors are angled to create a surface which curves and bends in different directions. The curves direct rays from an object across the mirror's face before sending {{them back to the}} viewer, flipping the conventional mirror image.|$|E
50|$|Modulated {{temperature}} conditions are where {{the temperature is}} changed in a cyclic manner such as in a sine, isothermal-heating, isothermal-cooling or heat-cool. The underlying temperature can increase, decrease or be constant. Modulated {{temperature conditions}} enable separation of the data into reversing data that is in-phase with the temperature changes, and <b>non-reversing</b> that is out-of-phase with the temperature changes. Sf-TM is required since the force should be constant while the temperature is modulated, or at least constant for each modulation period.|$|E
40|$|Two {{studies were}} conducted, during the {{development}} of the YY male technology for production of genetically male tilapia, to test hypotheses related to maximizing the probability of identifying males with YY genotype during progeny testing. The first study investigated the hypothesis of differential feminization of XY and YY genotypes following only partial sex reversal of progeny from XY x YY crosses. The second study compared the morphometric and meristic characters in sibling XY and YY male genotypes using discriminant function analysis. In the first study <b>non-reversed</b> males and sex reversed females from three treated families of XY x YY crosses in the Egypt-Swansea strain were progeny tested. Among the three families tested only one family seems to support the hypothesis (P< 0. 05), the rest have genotypes in accordance with the expected (1 : 1) in both sex-reversed females and <b>non-reversed</b> males.

30|$|According to the {{simulation}} results shown above, we can further analyse meaningful guidelines in practical implementation of sensor networks. As illustrated in Figure 8, we observe {{that even in}} suboptimal vertex angle such as 1.7, the reverse process can still make the network more energy efficient than <b>non-reverse</b> one as the energy saving gain keeps increasing {{with respect to the}} ratio of coverage radius and transmission radius growth.|$|R
50|$|This has {{a number}} of advantages. It {{facilitates}} the direct measurement of the heat capacity in one measurement, even in (quasi-)isothermal conditions. It permits the simultaneous measurement of heat effects that respond to a changing heating rate (reversing) and that don't respond to the changing heating rate (<b>non-reversing).</b> It allows for the optimization of both sensitivity and resolution in a single test by allowing for a slow average heating rate (optimizing resolution) and a fast changing heating rate (optimizing sensitivity).|$|E

50|$|Mills are {{designed}} {{in different types}} of configurations, with the most basic being a two-high <b>non-reversing,</b> which means there are two rolls that only turn in one direction. The two-high reversing mill has rolls that can rotate in both directions, but the disadvantage is that the rolls must be stopped, reversed, and then brought back up to rolling speed between each pass. To resolve this, the three-high mill was invented, which uses three rolls that rotate in one direction; the metal is fed through two of the rolls and then returned through the other pair. The disadvantage to this system is the workpiece must be lifted and lowered using an elevator. All of these mills are usually used for primary rolling and the roll diameters range from 60 to 140 cm.|$|E
40|$|Complete {{nonlinear}} analysis {{is carried out}} for cyclically loaded reinforced concrete (RC) beams made of normal-and high-strength concrete. The loading stage covers not only the pre-peak stage but also the post-peak stage in particular. The analysis {{is based on a}} numerical method that employs the actual stress-strain curves and takes into account the stress-path dependence of concrete and steel reinforcement. The complete nonlinear behavior of RC beams under both <b>non-reversed</b> and reversed cyclic loading is studied based on the moment-curvature relationship obtained. Generally, the response under cyclic loading is found to be dependent on the loading path in bending. The variation of neutral axis depth is different for under- and over-reinforced sections during cyclic loading. The Bauschinger effect of steel reinforcement is insignificant for <b>non-reversed</b> cyclic loading but notable for reversed cyclic loading, especially when the loading extends into the post-peak stage. The beneficial effects of concrete tension stiffening are only observed at the service stage and are more significant for under-reinforced RC beams than over-reinforced ones.

40|$|AbstractObjectives:to {{compare the}} result of vein valve {{disruption}} with two different valvulotomes during <b>non-reversed</b> saphenous vein bypass. Design:a randomised, blinded clinical study. Materials and methodstwenty patients undergoing femorodistal <b>non-reversed</b> saphenous vein arterial bypass were randomised into two equal groups. Valve leaflet disruption was performed either with a standard size plastic valvulotome or with a metal valvulotome with an exchangeable cutting head. Valvulotomy was done after full exposure of the vein and completion of the proximal anastomosis. The result was evaluated by a surgeon blinded to the valvulotome used, using angioscopy. Results:a total of 219 valve cusps were inspected with angioscopy. There were 83 completely lysed cusps (69 %) by plastic and 76 (78 %) by metallic valvulotomes (p= 0. 14). Of all the incompletely lysed cusps 12 (29 %) occurred in the most proximal valve pocket treated with valvulotomy. Conclusions:no significant difference in performance between the investigated valvulotomes was found. Incomplete valvulotomy occurred mainly in the proximal part of the vein and was obviously caused by a size mismatch between the diameter of vein and the valvulotome. Construction of a valvulotome with a variable diameter cutting head is therefore recommended...|$|R
