40|$|An {{important}} {{condition for}} convergence is that countries {{share the same}} technology for the aggregate production function (Solow, 1956). If countries produce a different mix of products, however, {{they will have a}} different aggregate production function. We argue that the inclusion of a fixed factor, such as natural resources, strongly determines the pattern of production and trade, and thus the path of development (Leamer, 1987) and the level of per capita consumption of a small open economy. We build a dynamic model of comparative advantages that naturally leads to different steady-state equilibria. Our main findings are, first, that differences in income and capital per worker between countries with and without natural resources (and with different types of natural resources) are explained by the relative rent of the <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> <b>factor</b> and the capital-labor ratio used in the natural resource sector relative to the other sectors. An economy that discovers a natural resource will almost alwaysenjoy a higher level of consumption in steady state, although we describe one specific case in which it is not optimal to exploit the natural resource. Second, for economies without natural resources, becoming industrialized is always good (in terms of consumption). Nevertheless, countries with natural resources could end up with a less industrialized productive sector, but a higher level of consumption. ...|$|E

In recent years, the evolution of parameters studied revealed that the imbalance in terms of the sustainable development of the region has damaged the health of this body of water.

In the Southeastern United States, a region with a culturally diverse population and legislative mandates to implement recruitment and retention programs in federal and state agencies, the field of <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> is still facing professional shortages from underrepresented populations. Identifying and targeting selected <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> interest <b>factors</b> (e. g., outdoor experiences and role models) among minority and majority populations may guide future recruitment strategies. A mail survey addressing selected factors including educational background and personal characteristics, career skills and influences, and job advocacy was administered to minority and majority professional employees of selected federal and state agencies affiliated with the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (SEAFWA). Respondents included professional <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> personnel. Chi-square and GEM tests were used to test for differences between groups on selected questionnaire items. Significant differences between minority and majority respondents were found in: (1) experience in a <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> agency, (2) type of work they did, (3) previous work experience, (4) present incomes, (5) recruitment mechanisms resulting in initial state or federal agency employment, (6) factors contributing to job acceptance, (7) job skill requirements, (8) events and individuals influencing interest in a <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> career, (9) perceptions of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> careers, (10) job satisfaction ratings, (11) participation in outdoor activities, (12) recommendations to promote ethnic diversity in the <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> workforce, (13) educational backgrounds, (14) values of past academic training, (15) age, and (16) current and preferred residences.

Ensuring environmental competitiveness of producers and their products {{should be based on}} the creation of conditions for access to restricted environmentally friendly <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> as <b>factors</b> of production. Environmentally friendly products may not be carried out under conditions of companies that pollute the environment. Environmental competitiveness of producers is provided based on two of its constituent factors. First it's impact on the environment: the value of economic - environmental damage inflicted terms of air emissions, discharges into water, waste disposal in water and land facilities, depletion of all <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> in the process of extraction and application economic-environmental damage to the environment in the extraction of <b>natural</b> <b>resources.</b> The second <b>factor</b> is the production of environmentally viable products. Environmental competitiveness of goods is determined by environmental parameters as a commodity and its price are acceptable to consumers and appropriate to the effective demand for certain markets in certain time periods. An important condition for the formation of the competitive nature of the process is the qualitative state factors of production, which, in turn, depends on the environmental component condition, performance, environment, sustainability of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> base of the national economy. To environmental performance include:level (content) contaminants in combustion engines of vehicles, equipment, machinery, facilities,the probability of harmful particles, gases emissions during storage, transportation, use or consumption of goods;radioactivity of the final product and others. Methods of assessing the environmental performance of the enterprise should consist of the following steps:Gathering and analyzing baseline information used to assess the actual absolute indicators of specific environmental areas of the company and the process of nature. Calculation of actual partial indicators (relative and specific) on the basis of absolute performance and actual formation of standard indicators. Determination of the ratio of actual performance with standard private values. Definition of general indicators and integral indicator of environmental competitiveness. The method of environmental assessment will allow businesses to create and accumulate knowledge base, identify hot spots in the organization and management of <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> in the enterprise and its level of environmental safety, competitiveness and environmental component to attractiveness.
