5|$|With funding {{provided}} by the Fitch and the Jamaica Tourist Board, training was conducted in Canada and Austria {{in preparation for the}} 1988 Winter Olympics. Sepp Haidacher was recruited as a coach, and the team began to be featured in North American media with a comical angle. An agreement was reached with the Fédération International de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing in order to allow for entrance in both the four-man and the two-man events at the Games. Once in Calgary, the team conducted test runs on a frozen lake in order {{to get used to the}} conditions, but Allen fell and was injured. Chris Stokes, who was only in Canada in order to support his brother Dudley, was added to the four-man team three days before the first run having <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bobsleigh before.|$|E

25|$|A {{feature film}} version of the serial was shot in eleven days in December 1973 in colour on 16mm film and then blown up to 35mm. The film {{features}} nearly all the show's regular cast {{as well as more}} revealing nudity than was allowed on TV at the time. A gay kiss between Don and Simon was mysteriously cut from the movie after its Sydney season. Critics were not kind but even Mike Harris from The Australian had to admit he had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cinema before where every character's first appearance got a roar of approval from the crowd.|$|E
25|$|Some {{crystals}} {{have formed}} by magmatic and metamorphic processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline rock. The {{vast majority of}} igneous rocks are formed from molten magma {{and the degree of}} crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as granite, which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of lava were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or glassy matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as marbles, mica-schists and quartzites, are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like limestone, shale and sandstone and have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> molten condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of metamorphism have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.|$|E

500|$|... "I'm used to riding {{roughshod over}} studio executives," [...] Gilliam explained, [...] "but the Weinsteins rode roughshod over me." [...] Gilliam got so upset, filming {{was shut down}} for nearly two weeks. Matt Damon {{reflected}} on the situation: [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> situation like that. Terry was spitting rage at the system, at the Weinsteins. You can't try and impose big compromises on a visionary director like him. If you try {{to force him to}} do what you want creatively, he'll go nuclear." [...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism. Filming was scheduled to end in October, but due to various problems during filming, principal photography did not end until the following 27 November.|$|E
500|$|Although Crane {{once wrote}} in a letter, [...] "You can tell nothing... unless you are in that {{condition}} yourself," [...] he wrote The Red Badge of Courage without any experience of war. He would, however, later serve as a war correspondent during the Greco-Turkish and Spanish–American Wars. Nevertheless, the realistic portrayal of the battlefield in The Red Badge of Courage has often misled readers into thinking that Crane (despite being born six {{years after the end}} of the Civil War) was himself a veteran. While trying to explain his ability to write about battle realistically, Crane stated: [...] "Of course, I have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> battle, but I believe that I got my sense of the rage of conflict on the football field, or else fighting is a hereditary instinct, and I wrote intuitively; for the Cranes were a family of fighters in the old days".|$|E

John Chapman of the Daily News stated, [...] "Perhaps Hammerstein and Rodgers are too gentlemanly {{to be dealing with}} Steinbeck's sleazy and raffish denizens." [...] Walter Kerr of the Herald Tribune suggested, [...] "Someone seems to have forgotten to bring along that gallon of good, red wine." [...] John McClain of the Journal-American stated, [...] "This {{is a far cry from}} the exalted talents of the team that produced South Pacific. They must be human, after all." [...] Steven Suskin, in his book chronicling Broadway opening night reviews, stated that Pipe Dream received one favorable review from the seven major New York critics, two mixed, and four unfavorable. Louis Kronenberger, in Time magazine, summed it up as [...] "roficient, professional, and disappointing." [...] Billy Rose said of Pipe Dream, [...] "You know why Oscar shouldn't have written that?

Badland explained that Babe [...] "deals with {{things in the}} way that she knows how but it doesn't always work out the way that she wants it to". Badland described Babe's actions as [...] "instinctive", which makes her [...] "often [...] on impulse". She questioned whether Babe could be [...] "an optimist and doesn't fully consider the damage she can cause." [...] Kathy Beale (Taylforth) decides to tip the authorities and after a series of undercover investigations, the police arrest Babe, Mick and Shirley. In her interview, Babe blames Mick and tells the police she was [...] "only acting on instructions". Despite this, they all spend the night in police custody. Badland revealed that Babe [...] "was assuming she could {{find a way out of}} it" [...] when blaming Mick because [...] "it's about staying alive in that moment." [...] She explained that Babe's actions stem from a fear of being arrested and said, [...] "For all she has ever been up to, she has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prison cell so it was about her staying afloat in that precise moment." [...] Badland believed that Babe would be able to [...] "talk her way out of trouble with the Carters" [...] again and explained that [...] "the family have a lot to talk about – and a lot to find out about..." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{departure}} of Broadrick and Bullen, the band had to look for new members. Guitarist Bill Steer played in a band based in Liverpool, [...] called Carcass and given the affinity between the bands, he joined Napalm Death while still playing {{an active role in}} Carcass. [...] The band asked a friend (Lee Dorrian) to join as vocalist due to his good relationship with the band (he had organised a number of concerts for the band), even though he had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> band before. This line-up recorded the B side of the Scum LP at Rich Bitch studios in May 1987, and the album was released through Earache Records.

2500|$|Later, Steve relives some {{repressed}} {{memories of}} {{a visit to the}} house with his drunken mother during which a ghostly Ellen Rimbauer appeared to him and called on Steve to aid her in continuing Rose Red's unending construction. Meanwhile, Emery suspects that Annie, not some [...] "spirit of Rose Red", is keeping the house sealed. Nick confirms Emery's suspicions, and then informs the group that Bollinger appeared to have hanged himself in the library. The group begins to speculate that Rose Red has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dormant state, and that the mansion's supernatural powers are linked to Annie and Steve (whose psychic abilities become apparent only when he is in the house because of his familial connection to the property). Nick correctly guesses that Joyce brought the psychics to the house in an attempt to reawaken Rose Red rather than simply investigate it.|$|E

2500|$|For much of {{its early}} history, the Smith Center's {{atmosphere}} was compared unfavorably to that of Carmichael and other college arenas. Florida State player Sam Cassell was famously {{quoted as saying that}} the Dean Dome “is not a Duke kind of crowd. It’s more like a cheese-and-wine crowd, kind of laid back." [...] In contrast, Carmichael Auditorium was known for its noise level; before one game, the Virginia Cavaliers couldn't hear their names announced during player introductions because of the din. Over time, however, the Smith Center developed its own tradition as a basketball mecca. After the Tar Heels defeated then top-ranked Ohio State in 2006, Buckeyes coach Thad Matta stated, [...] "I think I’ve <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> building that was as loud as that building was at times." [...] Earlier, after the then top-ranked Connecticut Huskies were defeated by Carolina at the Dean Dome in 2004, Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said, [...] "I don't know what they are talking about because there was no 'wine and cheese' crowd here today." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his 2002 campaign, Romney had {{expressed}} broad support for {{embryonic stem cell}} research, {{and said he would}} lobby President Bush (who the year before had banned most federal funding for such research) to support it. [...] In particular, Romney stated that he supported the use of surplus embryos from fertility clinics for stem-cell research. [...] In early 2005, Romney announced his position on therapeutic cloning for the first time, saying he was against it, but was still in favor of research on unused embryos from fertility treatments. [...] Per this stance, he vetoed a Massachusetts bill to fund stem-cell research because the legislation allowed such cloning of human embryos. [...] "I am not in favor of creating new human embryos through cloning," [...] said Romney, calling the practice [...] "a matter of profound moral and ethical consequence". Romney also opposed the legislation because of its assertion that life does not begin until an embryo is implanted in a uterus. [...] "It is very conceivable that scientific advances will allow an embryo to be grown for a substantial period of time outside the uterus," [...] Romney {{said in an interview with}} the Boston Globe. [...] "To say that it is not life at one month or two months or four months or full term, just because it had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> uterus, would be absurd." [...] The state legislature overrode Romney's veto, with many legislators feeling that stem-cell research will be important in the future to the state's biotech industry.|$|E
