5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's <b>nerve</b> <b>cells,</b> causing direct mechanical interference with the {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E

We proposed a multi-scale watershed-based approach {{to cope with this}} microscopic image analysis problem. There are three stages in the proposed segmentation algorithm: (1) a multi-scale watershed scheme is used to estimate an initial location of <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei; (2) we can identity <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei according to properties of <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> and watershed results in different scale; (3) Once the possible <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> is identified as a true one, a fuzzy rule based Active Contour Model (ACM) is applied to find the optimal outer contour. Our approach can segment <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> automatically and accurately. The cell detection rates in the experiments are above 95 %.

5|$|Some species, such as {{electric}} eels, {{can produce}} powerful electric currents, {{strong enough to}} stun prey.

5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the <b>nerve</b> <b>cells,</b> leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of <b>nerve</b> <b>cells,</b> the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without nerve stimulation, the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E

40|$|Myelin-associated {{glycoprotein}} (MAG) binds to the <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> {{surface and}} inhibits nerve regeneration. The <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> surface ligand(s) for MAG are not established, although sialic acid-bearing glycans have been implicated. We identify the <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> surface gangliosides GD 1 a and GT 1 b as specific functional ligands for MAG-mediated inhibition of neurite outgrowth from primary rat cerebellar granule neurons. MAG-mediated neurite outgrowth inhibition is attenuated by (i) neuraminidase {{treatment of the}} neurons; (ii) blocking neuronal ganglioside biosynthesis; (iii) genetically modifying the terminal structures of <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> surface gangliosides; and (iv) adding highly specific IgG-class antiganglioside mAbs. Furthermore, neurite outgrowth inhibition is mimicked by highly multivalent clustering of GD 1 a or GT 1 b by using precomplexed antiganglioside Abs. These data implicate the <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> surface gangliosides GD 1 a and GT 1 b as functional MAG ligands and suggest that {{the first step in}} MAG inhibition is multivalent ganglioside clustering...|$|R

5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on the <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. The <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin sheath by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E
5|$|There is {{polyadenylation}} in the cytosol of some {{animal cell}} types, namely in the germ line, during early embryogenesis and in post-synaptic sites of <b>nerve</b> <b>cells.</b> This lengthens the poly(A) tail of an mRNA with a shortened poly(A) tail, {{so that the}} mRNA will be translated.

5|$|Autism {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors.

Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E
5|$|Mice {{have been}} used as an {{experimental}} system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of nerve-cell GABA receptor subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are inhibitory, <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} {{in which the}} insulating covers of <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{mechanism}} of Sodium aescinate combined with Xuesaitong for cerebral thrombosis treatment and offer clinical help to cerebral thrombosis treatment. Methods: A total of 92 patients with cerebral thrombosis were selected and randomly divided into groups: the observation group (46 people) and the control group (46 people). The patient {{in the control group}} were treated with conventional therapy and the patients in the observation group were treated with Sodium aescinate combined with Xuesaitong on the basis of conventional therapy. Inflammatory factors (IL- 6, IL- 10, TNF-α and CRP), <b>Nerve</b> <b>cell</b> factor (NSE, NGF and NTF) and blood rheology indexes (Fg, BVH, BVL and PV) were detected and analyzed before and after treatment. Results: The comparison of inflammatory factors, <b>Nerve</b> <b>cell</b> factor and blood rheology indexes in the two groups before treatment were not statistically significant. Inflammatory factors (IL- 6, TNF-α and CRP), <b>Nerve</b> <b>cell</b> factor (NSE) and blood rheology indexes (Fg, BVH, BVL and PV) in both groups after treatment significantly decreased compared with that before treatment. Inflammatory factors (IL- 10), <b>Nerve</b> <b>cell</b> factor (GF and NTF) in both groups after treatment significantly increased compared with that before treatment. The changes were statistically significant. Inflammatory factors (IL- 6, TNF- α and CRP), <b>Nerve</b> <b>cell</b> factor (NSE) and blood rheology indexes (Fg, BVH, BVL and PV) in observation group after treatment decreased more significantly than that in control group, and inflammatory factors (IL- 10), <b>Nerve</b> <b>cell</b> factor (GF and NTF) increased more significantly than that in control group. The difference between two groups was considered statistically significant. Conclusion: Sodium aescinate combined with Xuesaitong could inhibit the inflammatory reaction, improve the blood flow condition and promote rehabilitation in patients with cerebral thrombosis.

5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, <b>nerve</b> <b>cells</b> that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of <b>nerve</b> <b>cells.</b> It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule L 1 in the neuronal growth cone {{of the central}} nervous system is strongly associated with the direction of growth of the axon, but its role in the regeneration of the peripheral nerve is still unknown. This study explored the problem in a femoral nerve section model in rats. L 1 and semaphorin 3 A mRNA and protein expressions were measured over the 4 -week recovery period. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule L 1 expression was higher in the sensory nerves than in motor nerves at 2 weeks after injury, but vice versa for the {{expression of}} semaphorin 3 A. Western blot assay results demonstrated that <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule L 1 expression was higher in motor nerves than in the sensory nerves at the proximal end after injury, but its expression was greater in the sensory nerves at 2 weeks. Semaphorin 3 A expression was higher in the motor nerves than in the sensory nerves at 3 days and 1 week after injury. <b>Nerve</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule L 1 and semaphorin 3 A expressions at the distal end were higher in the motor nerves than in the sensory nerves at 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks. Immunohistochemical staining results showed that <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecule L 1 expression at the proximal end was greater in the sensory nerves than in the motor nerves; semaphorin 3 A expression was higher in the motor nerves than in the sensory nerves at 2 weeks after injury. Taken together, these results indicated that <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion molecules L 1 and semaphorin 3 A exhibited different expression patterns at the proximal and distal ends of sensory and motor nerves, and play a coordinating role in neural chemotaxis regeneration...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of inflammation decreases local anesthetic efficacy, especially in dental anesthesia. Although inflammatory acidosis is {{most frequently cited}} {{as the cause of}} such clinical phenomena, this has not been experimentally proved. We verified the acidosis mechanism by studying the drug and membrane lipid interaction under acidic conditions together with proposing an alternative hypothesis. Liposomes and <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> model membranes consisting of phospholipids and cholesterol were treated at different pH with lidocaine, prilocaine and bupivacaine (0. 05 %– 0. 2 %, w/v). Their membrane-interactive potencies were compared by the induced-changes in membrane fluidity. Local anesthetics fluidized phosphatidylcholine membranes with the potency being significantly lower at pH 6. 4 than at pH 7. 4 (p < 0. 01), supporting the acidosis theory. However, they greatly fluidized <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> model membranes even at pH 6. 4 corresponding to inflamed tissues, challenging the conventional mechanism. Local anesthetics acted on phosphatidylserine liposomes, as well as <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> model membranes, at pH 6. 4 with almost the same potency as that at pH 7. 4, but not on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin liposomes. Since the positively charged anesthetic molecules are able to interact with <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> membranes by ion-paring with anionic components like phosphatidylserine, tissue acidosis is not essentially responsible for the local anesthetic failure associated with inflammation. The effects of local anesthetics on <b>nerve</b> <b>cell</b> model membranes were inhibited by treating with peroxynitrite (50 μM), suggesting that inflammatory cells producing peroxynitrite may affect local anesthesia...|$|R
