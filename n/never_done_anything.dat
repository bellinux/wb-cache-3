25|$|In 1860 the spoorwegwet was {{approved}} {{in which the}} government stated its intention to build a large rail network. Previously, the government had subsidized certain lines, but <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> of this scale. The network was designed for efficiency, which meant that as many cities as possible had to be connected with the least amount of track. Another aspect of this efficiency was that, save for a few major stations, all stations along the line were built to a standardised design based on the expected volume of travellers.|$|E
500|$|In {{a series}} of {{articles}} published in 1932, Von Neumann made foundational contributions to ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics that involves the states of dynamical systems with an invariant measure. Of the 1932 papers on ergodic theory, Paul Halmos writes that even [...] "if von Neumann had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> else, they would have been sufficient to guarantee him mathematical immortality". By then von Neumann had already written his famous articles on operator theory, and the application of this work was instrumental in the von Neumann mean ergodic theorem.|$|E

500|$|None of {{the columns}} after Dunne joined The American Magazine {{attracted}} the attention the earlier ones had, but Mr. Dooley continued {{to comment on the}} issues of the day. [...] Andrew Carnegie was a repeated target, as was John D. Rockefeller, whom Dooley summed up with [...] "he <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> wrong, save in the way of business" [...] In 1909, during the debates over the Payne–Aldrich Tariff, Dunne examined the bill and came out of it with an exotic item called [...] "divvy-divvy", which Mr. Dooley allowed, [...] "was let in as a compliment to [...] Senator Aldrich. It's his motto." [...] A seventh Dooley book was published in 1910, but given disappointing sales, the publishers abandoned plans for another in 1911. Although Dunne was a strong supporter of Roosevelt in the contentious 1912 presidential election, Mr. Dooley retained his customary above-the-fray attitude, mocking Roosevelt's excited oratory with Dooley feeling there was a large fire somewhere, a mystery solved when he opens the newspaper and learns [...] "much to my relief, that it was not my pants but the Republic that was on fire".|$|E
500|$|In an interview, {{recording}} engineer Gordon [...] "Commissioner Gordon" [...] Williams recalled {{the recording of}} [...] "Lost Ones", stating: [...] "It was our first morning in Jamaica and I saw all of these kids gathered around Lauryn, screaming and dancing. Lauryn was {{in the living room}} next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song." [...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can tell my story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album. Chris Swartz at Ruffhouse, my label, said, 'Listen, you've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> stupid thus far, so let me let you do your thing.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Indestructible" [...] was {{directed}} by Max Vitali and Nils Ljunggren. Vitali had previously worked with Robyn on the music videos for [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and [...] "Dancing on My Own". For the video, Australian artist Lucy McRae, who makes [...] "body architecture", designed a special [...] "tube dress" [...] for Robyn to wear. McRae also designed the outfits Robyn wore on the Body Talk album covers. The dress for the video {{was made up of}} plastic pipes that were periodically filled with colored fluids and wrapped around Robyn's body. Robyn recalled that the machine that kept the liquid flowing was [...] "very complicated". It was powered by drills and required [...] "a whole lot of complex machinery to function". The machine was built by McRae, who had to do it quickly because of the video's budget. McRae said, [...] "Me and the dream team had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> like this before, the whole project was happening for the first time. The machine was super loud." [...] The shooting stopped four times due to leaks, and the team had to mop and re-set the technology. The shooting took twenty hours, and by 3 a.m. McRae said that Robyn was wrapped [...] "in a kilometre of tubing draped over her head and body". She praised Robyn's stamina throughout the shoot, saying that [...] "there were chaotic moments that could have been potentially disastrous and the entire time Robyn was working with us, smiling, moving when the tubes were stuck and just super happy we were making it happen." ...|$|E

500|$|First Class {{employed}} 1,150 {{visual effects}} shots, which {{was done by}} six companies: Rhythm & Hues was responsible for Emma Frost, Mystique and Angel, as well as set extensions; Cinesite handled Azazel, the visuals for Cerebro and environment effects; Luma Pictures did Banshee, Havok and Darwin; Moving Picture Company did Beast, Riptide, and the scene where Shaw's yacht is destroyed and he escapes in a submarine; Digital Domain created Sebastian Shaw's powers, and Weta Digital {{was responsible for the}} climactic battle in Cuba. The overall coordination was provided by visual effects designer John Dykstra, who said the biggest difficulty was the tight schedule: [...] "It was slightly less than a year and I've <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> like that before (Spider-Man was frequently two years)." [...] British company 4dMax employed special 3D scanners to digitize data of the sets and actors which would be used by the effects companies. This allowed for computer-generated sets such as the mirrored nuclear reactor where Magneto battles Shaw—for which the effects team used the mirror maze fight in Enter the Dragon as a reference—and the domed walls of Cerebro. Digital models of Washington and Moscow were also created based on photographs of the actual cities, with the Russian one in particular having vehicles and military hardware based on videos of a 1962 Red Square, and a digital army doing an actual Soviet-style march. With the exception of scenes featuring the actors on ships (shot on a small bridge set) and the X-Jet (done on a set replicating the front two-thirds of the aircraft, which was mounted atop a roller wheel so it could be spun) the naval battle was entirely digital, featuring a simulated ocean and high resolution 3D models of the X-Jet, Shaw's submarine and 16 warships. The designs were mostly based on real vehicles, with the jet being a modified SR-71 Blackbird, the submarine a combination of various models from the 1940s and 1950s, and replicas of the actual US and USSR fleets in the 1960s — though a few were not in service in 1962. A particular Soviet cruiser was a larger version of the Kresta I and II, leading Weta to dub it the Kresta III. Practical effects were still used whenever possible, such as having on location most of the objects young Erik throws after his mother's death, actors and stuntmen dangled from wires, and real explosions and light effects as reference for Havok's beams.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2006, Ramsay won a High Court {{case against}} the London Evening Standard newspaper, in which Victor Lewis Smith had alleged, after reports from {{previous}} owner Sue Ray, that scenes and the general condition of Bonaparte's had been faked for Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Ramsay was awarded £75,000 plus costs. Ramsay said at the time: [...] "I won't let people write anything they want to about me.

Ramsay said at the time, [...] "We have <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> in a cynical, fake way." [...] However, a year later, Channel 4 admitted that a scene in another of Ramsay's programmes had been faked, and apologised to viewers.|$|E
2500|$|However, Peto did not {{consider}} himself {{in any way to}} be at any fault. In his view, as it was the LCDR company solicitors that had suggested this course of action, and had drawn up the fraudulent statutory declaration and the loan documentation papers, he did not think that he should shoulder any of the blame. When they heard how Peto had implicated them, the company solicitors retorted that they had <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> of the kind, and that they regarded any attempt to borrow money, except on the basis of [...] "a bona fide subscription and a bona fide payment of half the capital," [...] as [...] "utterly indefensible." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reviewer}} in the London Review in 1865 {{denounced the}} characters of Wegg and Venus, [...] "who appear to us in all the highest degree unnatural—the one being a mere phantasm, {{and the other a}} nonentity." [...] However he applauded the creation of Bella Wilfer: [...] "Probably the greatest favourite in the book will be—or rather is already—Bella Wilfer. She is evidently a pet of the author's, and she will long remain the darling of half the households of England and America." [...] E.S. Dallas, in his 1865 review, concurred that [...] "Mr Dickens has <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> in the portraiture of women so pretty and so perfect" [...] as Bella.|$|E

[...] He said he had disappointed sponsors, managers and directeurs sportifs, even though they continued to show confidence in him. [...] "I had become schizophrenic," [...] he said.

2500|$|During {{the retreat}} to France, Durutte led his troops in a clash at Freyburg on 21 October. He fought at the Battle of Hanau on 30 and 31 October under Marshal Auguste Marmont's command. In 1814 {{he was given}} command of the {{fortress}} of Metz which resisted a blockade {{until the end of}} the war. At one point, Napoleon heard a rumor that Metz had fallen. He asked an aide-de-camp who commanded the garrison. When told it was Durutte, he replied, [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> good for that man. Metz is still ours." [...] (Napoleon was becoming convinced that generals on whom he had showered favors were not performing well, while those who had yet to prove themselves could be counted on.) Upon the return of King Louis XVIII, Durutte recognized the new sovereign and was given command of the 3rd Division and made a Chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis on 27 June. He was made a Grand Officer of the Légion d'Honneur on 23 August and received a gold sword from the mayor of Metz.|$|E
2500|$|The digital {{intermediate}} {{was completed}} by a team at Technicolor led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on Gravity, but needed to approach Birdman differently because of the continuous-shot approach. According to Scott, [...] "we have <b>never</b> <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> like it before." [...] The color timing {{had to be done}} {{in such a way that}} the transitions between color-corrected environments were invisible, in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts. To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to [...] "do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another." [...] Inserting the dissolves required rotoscoping methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the mattes used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, Iñárritu remarked that [...] "everyone was out of their comfort zone", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.|$|E
