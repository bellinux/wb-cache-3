40|$|Enveloped viruses {{often require}} {{cleavage}} of a surface glycoprotein by a cellular endoprotease such as furin for infectivity and virulence. Previously, {{we showed that}} Ebola virus glycoprotein {{does not require the}} furin cleavage motif for virus replication in cell culture. Here, we show that there are <b>no</b> <b>appreciable</b> differences in <b>disease</b> progression, hematology, serum biochemistry, virus titers, or lethality in nonhuman primates infected with an Ebola virus lacking the furin recognition sequence compared to those infected with wild-type virus. We conclude that glycoprotein cleavage by subtilisin-like endoproteases is not critical for Ebola virus infectivity and virulence in nonhuman primates...|$|R
40|$|Health {{survey was}} done on farmers using an organofluoride (N-methyl-N-(1 -naphthyl) monofluoroacetate) and the {{following}} results were obtained. 1. Forty-five point seven percent of the farmers had some complaints after spraying the agent, which included fatigue, headache, nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, insomnia or abdominal pain. 2. Blood pictures of the farmers after spraying the agent indicated slight decrease or no change or hemoglobin and erythrocytes with the tendency of a higher color index than normal, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. These blood changes, however, returned to normal in 6 months after {{the use of the}} agent. 3. Increased urinary urobilinogen and glycosuria were present in some cases, but none showed proteinuria. 4. Liver function tests revealed an increased icterus index and positive CCLF in some cases, but no abnormalities were found in TTT, ZTT, transaminases. There appeared to be <b>no</b> clinically <b>appreciable</b> liver <b>disease.</b> 5. ECG showed slight bradycardia and elongated P-Q intervals within normal ranges but no arrhythmia. No heart disease was clinically manifested in any cases...|$|R
