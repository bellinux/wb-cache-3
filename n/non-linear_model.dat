This {{is because the}} covariance is propagated through linearization of the underlying <b>non-linear</b> <b>model.</b> The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) uses a deterministic sampling technique known as the unscented transform to pick a minimal set of sample points (called sigma points) around the mean.
