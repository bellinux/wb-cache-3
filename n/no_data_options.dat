The review of satellite sensors available in NZ for aquatic mapping has identified three <b>data</b> <b>options,</b> which have been purchased for a case study area (Tongariro river delta). These <b>data</b> <b>options</b> are Landsat- 5 (30 m resolution), ALOS (10 m and 2. 5 m) and QuickBird- 2 (2. 4 m and 0. 6 m). There is no perfect option available as each option is a compromise between spatial and spectral resolution and cost...|$|R
