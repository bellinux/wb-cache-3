25|$|A player {{must make}} their own move before {{offering}} a draw, and must not stop their own clock and start their opponent's clock before they have made the offer. If a player {{does not make a}} move before offering a draw, the opponent can request a move before considering the draw offer (which cannot be retracted). <b>No</b> <b>conditions</b> may be attached to a draw offer. If a player claims a draw according to the rules of chess, the player is allowed to stop both clocks and record the draw claim as long as his or her opponent agrees to the claim. If the opponent disputes the draw claim the director may be called to come to a conclusion. If the claim is found to be correct, the game is drawn. Once a player has made a move from a position eligible for a draw, they lose their rights to claim a draw in that position.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{proposed}} Klaipėda Convention reserved extensive rights for Poland to access, use, and govern {{the port of}} Klaipėda. This was completely unacceptable to Lithuania, which had terminated all diplomatic ties with Poland over the Vilnius Region. The stalled negotiations were referred to the League of Nations. The three-member commission, chaired by American Norman Davis, prepared the final convention which was signed by Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and Lithuania in May 1924. The Klaipėda Region became an autonomous region under unconditional sovereignty of Lithuania. The region had extensive legislative, judicial, administrative, and financial autonomy and elected its own local parliament. The port of Klaipėda was internationalized allowing freedom of transit. The convention was hailed as a major Lithuanian diplomatic victory as it contained none of the special rights initially reserved for Poland and placed <b>no</b> <b>conditions</b> on Lithuanian sovereignty in the region. However, the convention severely limited {{the powers of the}} Lithuanian government and caused frequent debates on the relationship between central and local authorities. In the 1920s, the relations between Lithuania and Germany under Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann were rather normal. However, tensions began to rise after Adolf Hitler came to power. Weaknesses of the convention were exploited by Nazi Germany when it supported anti-Lithuanian activities and campaigned for reincorporation of the region into Germany, culminating in the 1939 ultimatum.|$|E

25|$|The French army {{arrives at}} the {{barricade}} and demands that the students surrender ("At the Barricade—Upon These Stones"). Though Javert tells the students {{that the government will}} not attack that night ("Javert's Arrival"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert ("Little People"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. Éponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms ("A Little Fall of Rain"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over Éponine's death. Valjean {{arrives at the}} barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier ("Night of Anguish"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras {{to be the one to}} execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are <b>no</b> <b>conditions</b> to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty. ("The First Attack").|$|E

500|$|The {{conditions}} for {{leave to appeal}} are laid out in Section 1(4). <b>No</b> <b>conditions</b> attach to an appeal where all parties consent, but when {{the permission of the}} High Court is sought, the judge may only grant leave if he [...] "considers that...the question of law concerned could substantially affect the rights of one or more parties to the arbitration agreement". Under Sections 1(5) and 1(6), the High Court may ask for additional reasons as to why the arbitrator reached the decision that he did, but only if one of the parties gave notice to the arbitrator that reasons would be required, or there was [...] "some special reason why such a notice was not given". In Universal Petroleum Co v Handels und Transport GmbH, the Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of Sections 1(4) and 1(5). The dispute came from a highly detailed [...] "Schedule of Further Reasons" [...] ordered by the High Court because the judge felt that there was an ambiguous element in the reasons given. The appellate judges found that Section 1(5) required judges to order further reasons only to deal with points of law arising from the award. Material ambiguity was [...] "inadmissible and irrelevant for the purpose of the exercise of any jurisdiction under section 1 of the Act".|$|E

500|$|On February 18, 1907, the Zanesville Signal {{reported}} that Hogan had received {{permission from the}} McDonald brothers to negotiate a $3,000 deal {{for the sale of}} the Youngstown club, including its players, to a group of investors in Zanesville, Ohio. [...] In an interview with the Signal, the manager expressed frustration with the team's former backers, when he said, [...] "Youngstown couldn't or didn't raise enough money to cover a sparrow's blanket". [...] The Zanesville investors reportedly raised an additional $15,000 to enter the team into the Ohio–Pennsylvania League, although they were forced to settle for the less prestigious Pennsylvania–Ohio–Maryland League. The eight-team P-O-M league included clubs from Braddock, Pennsylvania; Charleroi, Pennsylvania; East Liverpool, Ohio; McKeesport, Pennsylvania; Steubenville, Ohio; Uniontown, Pennsylvania; and Washington, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, Hogan reportedly had some difficulty securing new players for the team. In June 1907, the Marion Daily Mirror described Zanesville's efforts to sign Bill Dithridge, a player in the Baltimore Eastern League, as [...] "merely another of the pipe dreams of one Marty Hogan". [...] The article added, [...] "Dithridge is not to be sold to Zanesville, and he has informed Hogan that he will play with his team under <b>no</b> <b>conditions</b> whatever". [...] The paper did observe, however, that Hogan had signed a Cleveland player named Tate and planned to secure another outfielder, [...] "when three members of the present team will be canned". After settling in Zanesville, Hogan apparently received offers from other teams. [...] Sporting Life reported in June 1907 that Hogan was invited to manage a team in Rochester, New York, but had turned down the offer. [...] Then, in October, Hogan was offered management of yet another league franchise in South Bend, Indiana, but, once again, he declined. [...] He managed the Zanesville ball club for two seasons. During its first season, the team placed first in the eight-team P-O-M League, with a record of 15 wins and seven losses.|$|E

The investigation ruled out a terrorist attack, explosion or fire on board the aircraft as the cause of the crash.

One of the voices was identified by sources as the Polish Air Force Commander, Lieutenant General Andrzej Błasik. However, according to the findings of the Polish prosecutor's office in January 2013, General Błasik had not stayed in the cockpit and was a regular passenger.

2500|$|Rudolf von Scheliha, the First Secretary at the German {{embassy in}} Warsaw {{had been working}} as a Soviet spy since 1937, keeping the Kremlin well {{informed}} {{about the state of}} German-Polish relations, and it was due to intelligence provided by him that the Soviets knew that Hitler was seriously considering invading Poland from March 1939 onward, giving the orders for an invasion of Poland in May. On 13 March 1939 Scheliha reported to Moscow that he had conversation with one of Ribbentrop's aides, a Peter Kleist, who told him Germany would probably attack Poland sometime that year. In his reports to Moscow, Scheliha made clear that the Auswärtiges Amt had attempted to reduce Poland down to a German satellite in the winter of 1938-39, and the Poles had refused to play that role. At the same time, the chief Soviet spy in Japan, Richard Sorge had reported to Moscow that the German attempt to convert the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance had failed, as Germany wanted the alliance to be directed against Britain while Japan wanted the alliance to be directed against the Soviet Union. [...] On 5 April 1939, Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker, the State Secretary at the Auswärtiges Amt ordered Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, the German ambassador to Poland, that he was under <b>no</b> <b>conditions</b> to engage in talks with the Poles over resolving the dispute over the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdansk) as the Danzig issue was just a pretext for war, and he was afraid if talks did begin, the Poles might actually agree to Danzig rejoining Germany, thereby depriving the Reich of its pretext. Scheliha in his turn informed Moscow that the Auswärtiges Amt would not engage in talks for a diplomatic solution to the Danzig issue, indicating that German policy towards Poland was not a policy with a high risk of war, but was a policy aimed at causing a war.|$|E
