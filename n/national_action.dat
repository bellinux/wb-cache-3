5|$|A popular {{uprising}} {{occurred between}} 1994 and 2000 in which leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces. The event resulted in approximately forty deaths and ended after Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa became the Emir of Bahrain in 1999. He instituted elections for parliament, gave women {{the right to}} vote, and released all political prisoners. A referendum on 14–15 February 2001 massively supported the <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> Charter. As part of {{the adoption of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> Charter on 14 February 2002, Bahrain changed its formal name from the State (dawla) of Bahrain to the Kingdom of Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|Appearing on {{the state}} media, king Hamad {{announced}} that each family would be given 1,000 Bahraini Dinars ($2,650) to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> Charter referendum. Agence France-Presse linked payments to the 14 February demonstration plans.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, al-Jamri was {{released}} {{along with other}} opposition activists. The new emir, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, proposed a reform plan, the <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> Charter of Bahrain, which was accepted by the opposition and later gained widespread popular support. A year later, Hamad issued a new constitution which al-Jamri said fell short of the opposition's demands. Disappointed, al-Jamri soon fell ill, suffering {{from a series of}} strokes and eventually dying of multiple organ failure.|$|E

5|$|The plan {{came into}} force on June 28, 2012. After the {{establishment}} of the <b>national</b> <b>action</b> plan, British Columbia established a provincial action plan informed by the national one to coordinate its anti-human-trafficking efforts with the federal government's. OCTIP then became involved in implementing the national and provincial action plans. The provincial action plan, published in March 2013, states that contributing to development of the NAP-CHT through consultation and information sharing was an immediate priority.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring <b>national</b> <b>action,</b> 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E
5|$|In late 1927, Quwatli {{headed the}} Istiqlal-dominated Executive Committee of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress, {{although}} Lutfallah headed a separate rival committee that also called itself the Congress's Executive Committee. Both were based in Cairo. In 1930, Quwatli {{was allowed to}} return to Syria under a general amnesty. Thereafter, he joined the National Bloc, the preeminent opposition movement in Syria—though tolerated by the French. Although he opposed the moderate stances of the Bloc's Damascene leaders, he determined he could only remain a major political player by joining the group. He sought to steer it towards a more determined nationalist course and worked to expand his support base, relying on his relationships with residents in some of Damascus' traditionally nationalist neighborhoods (al-Midan and al-Shaghour) and among the city's merchant and emerging industrialist classes. He also worked to draw support from the staunch pan-Arabists of the League of <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> (LNA) beginning in 1933. He managed to co-opt much of the LNA's members by 1935–36 by financing its land development company (which aimed to prevent land sales to Zionist organizations in Palestine) and assigning some of its leaders to the director boards of companies affiliated with the Bloc.|$|E
40|$|This report assesses how {{the set of}} <b>national</b> <b>actions</b> {{presented}} in America’s Global Warming Solutions would affect Florida’s energy systems, carbon emissions and economy. This study finds that by 2010, the set of <b>national</b> <b>actions</b> to reduce global warming would decrease Florida’s primary energy use by 26 percent and its carbon emissions by 36 percent. They would also provide increasing annual savings reaching about $ 300 per-capita in 2010 and averaging about $ 110 per-capita per year between now and 2010. Thus, the State would cumulatively save about $ 17 billion over that period. The set of <b>national</b> <b>actions</b> would also create approximately 39, 000 net additional jobs in Florida by 2010. They would reduce emissions of other pollutants and begin to shift {{the basis of the}} State’s economy towards more advanced, energy-efficient technologies and cleaner resources.

5|$|Bahrain also {{encourages}} {{institutions of higher}} learning, drawing on expatriate talent and the increasing pool of Bahrain nationals returning from abroad with advanced degrees. The University of Bahrain was established for standard undergraduate and graduate study, and the King Abdulaziz University College of Health Sciences, operating {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Health, trains physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and paramedics. The 2001 <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> Charter paved the way for the formation of private universities such as the Ahlia University in Manama and University College of Bahrain in Saar. The Royal University for Women (RUW), established in 2005, was the first private, purpose-built, international University in Bahrain dedicated solely to educating women. The University of London External has appointed MCG (Management Consultancy Group) as the regional representative office in Bahrain for distance learning programmes. MCG is one of the oldest private institutes in the country. Institutes have also opened which educate South Asian students, such as the Pakistan Urdu School, Bahrain and the Indian School, Bahrain. A few prominent institutions are DePaul University, Bentley University, the Ernst & Young Training Institute, NYIT and the Birla Institute of Technology International Centre. In 2004, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) set up a constituent medical university in the country. In addition to the Arabian Gulf University, AMA International University and the College of Health Sciences, these are the only medical schools in Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2012, Mancera {{resigned}} {{as attorney general}} to become candidate for the Head of Government in the July 1, 2012 election. Jesús Rodríguez Almeida took his place as Attorney General. On January 8, Mancera registered as a precandidate for Mayor of Mexico City, {{as a member of}} the PRD. On January 19, he became the official Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) candidate for Mayor of Mexico City, running against Alejandra Barrales, Gerardo Fernández Noroña, Martí Batres and Joel Ortega Cuevas, representing the leftist Progressive Movement coalition, which is formed by the PRD party, the Labor Party, and the Citizen's Movement Party. The adversaries of Mancera were Beatriz Paredes Rangel, for the Commitment to Mexico coalition, an alliance of political parties Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), Isabel Miranda de Wallace for the <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> Party (PAN), and Rosario Guerra for the New Alliance Party (PANAL). According to surveys made in late January, Mancera was between 18 and 30 points ahead of Paredes. However, the following month, electoral preferences that favored him decreased by nine points. Electoral preference for Mancera then increased from 36% in March to 41% in April in an El Universal daily poll. In May, Mancera favorability increased to 57.5%; in the same month, Adolfo Hellmund, Luis Mandoki, and Costa Bonino, in the house of Luis Creel, borrowed six million dollars on behalf of Mancera and López Obrador, but both politicians disassociated themselves from the incident, and Mancera filed a complaint against the people responsible for using his name without authorization with the Attorney General of Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|On June 19, 2008, the New York Post {{reported}} that the Internal Revenue Service had sent subpoenas to several corporations that had donated to Sharpton's <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> Network. In 2007 New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo began investigating the <b>National</b> <b>Action</b> Network, because it failed to make proper financial reports, as required for non-profits.
