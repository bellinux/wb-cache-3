500|$|When Mackenzie King {{retired in}} 1948, he was succeeded by his Minister of Justice, Louis St. Laurent, a bilingual Quebecer who took {{office at the}} age of 66. An adept politician, St. Laurent {{projected}} a gentle persona and was affectionately known to many Canadians as Uncle Louis (or, among francophones, Oncle Louis). In actuality, St. Laurent was uncomfortable away from Ottawa, was subject to fits of depression (especially after 1953), and on political trips was carefully managed by advertising men from the firm of Cockfield Brown. St. Laurent led the Liberals to an overwhelming triumph in the 1949 election, campaigning under the slogan [...] "You <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> so good". The Liberals won a fifth successive mandate in 1953, with St. Laurent content to exercise a highly relaxed leadership style.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the band}} broke up in 1970, their {{material}} {{continued to be}} circulated through reissues and compilation albums. Following the inclusion of [...] "I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)" [...] as the first track on the seminal [...] in 1972, a slow return {{of interest in the}} band's music began. On the 1998 release of the album, [...] "Get Me to the World on Time" [...] was included as well. In Europe, the band's albums were re-released, with 1986 seeing the reissue of Underground, Release of an Oath, and, essentially The Electric Prunes's first greatest hits album, Long Days Flight. This was the first album to include their first single, [...] "Ain't It Hard", the non-LP track [...] "You <b>Never</b> <b>Had</b> <b>It</b> Better", and the first to be released on the compact disc format in 1989.|$|E
500|$|As for the criticisms, she said, [...] "I am who I am and I will {{continue}} to be." [...] She portrayed some of her views on her life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with Gloria Steinem: [...] "Now, I have friends in all {{the countries of the}} world. I haven’t just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I’ve stayed interested in people. I’ve kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the levity on their first train ride, the company was downcast and exhausted en route from Cleveland to Boston for the final tryouts. The show opened previews in Boston on May 6. A majority of the Boston critics liked the show, and expressed confidence that Rodgers and Hammerstein could fix {{the problems with the}} plot. The pair took out one song, [...] "Meat and Potatoes", which was felt to be too raunchy. After watching it performed by Joan McCracken, who played Betty (Carmen in the play-within-the-play), the pair decided it had too many double entendres and cut it. It was replaced by [...] "We Deserve Each Other", which the pair had written in a Cleveland hotel room. Another cut song, [...] "You <b>Never</b> <b>Had</b> <b>It</b> So Good", included lyrics which satirized the duo's own earlier efforts. Its lyrics, [...] "I'll sew, I'll bake / I'll try to make your evenings all enchanted. / My honeycake, / I'm yours to take, but don't take me for granted", alluded to two songs from South Pacific, [...] "Some Enchanted Evening" [...] and [...] "Honey Bun".

500|$|Nixon gave {{a speech}} from the rear {{platform}} of the train. He praised {{the size of the}} crowd, stating, [...] "There are four times as many people here than live in the town and more than the number that were here in 1960." [...] The candidate asserted that though his opponent, Vice President Humphrey, claimed that Americans had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> so good, he should tell that to the farmer. Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer's advocate to the White House. He promised to restore order: [...] "The most important civil right is the right to be free from [...] violence." [...] He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, [...] "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and mine are too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that she did not even look at the sign until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, [...] "Bring Us Together Again" [...] was about boys, not politics. She kept the dress, but told the media she threw away the sign.|$|E
500|$|As a whole, {{the album}} {{contains}} {{a mixture of}} several different genres of music, particularly pop standards. Commenting on the diverse musical nature of the album, author Tom Santopietro described as the singer being able to [...] "cover [...] all fan bases without seriously alienating any". Lazy Afternoon opens with the title track, originally written by John La Touche and Jerome Moross. A [...] "poetic nature song" [...] where [...] "Streisand gives her voice totally over to the lyrics", director Francis Ford Coppola suggested to the singer over dinner that she record the song in order to revive it. [...] "My Father's Song" [...] was written solely by Holmes and is the first original song on the track listing. Being about the singer's late father, Holmes began work on the track after Streisand shared personal, childhood stories of her father to him. Like other album tracks, it {{was considered to be}} a [...] "sympathetic" [...] ballad that relies on Streisand's vocals, according to AllMusic's William Ruhlmann. [...] "By the Way", the record's third track, is noted as Streisand's first songwriting credit in her entire career. While creating the track, Streisand decided to write from a [...] "sense of resolute rather than desperate emotions". It is followed by a cover of Four Tops' [...] "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)". The original version, set in a gospel rock tempo, was updated into a disco track. Lyrically, the story of a lost love is told, with her neighbors supposedly discussing the matter during [...] "long and sleepless night". The previously unreleased [...] "I <b>Never</b> <b>Had</b> <b>It</b> So Good" [...] is the fifth track on Lazy Afternoon and was written by Paul Williams and Roger Nichols. She wrote in the album's liner notes that she had always wanted to sing it and accompany it with someone playing the harmonica.|$|E

2500|$|Macmillan led the Conservatives {{to victory}} in the 1959 general election, {{increasing}} his party's majority from 67 to 107 seats. The campaign {{was based on the}} economic improvements achieved as well as the low unemployment and improving standard of living; the slogan [...] "Life's Better Under the Conservatives" [...] was matched by Macmillan's own remark, '"indeed let us be frank about it– most of our people have <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> so good," [...] usually paraphrased as [...] "You've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> so good." [...] Such rhetoric reflected a new reality of working-class affluence; {{it has been argued that}} [...] "the key factor in the Conservative victory was that average real pay for industrial workers had risen since Churchill's 1951 victory by over 20 per cent". The scale of the victory meant that not only had the Conservatives won three successive general elections, but they had also increased their majority each time. And it sparked debate as to whether Labour (now led by Hugh Gaitskell) could win a general election again. The standard of living had risen enough that workers could participate in a consumer economy, shifting the working class concerns away from traditional Labour Party views.|$|E
2500|$|The Conservatives {{increased}} their Commons {{majority in the}} general election of 8 October 1959, their first with Harold Macmillan as prime minister, who famously said that most people [...] "had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> so good". Ernest Marples, previously the Postmaster General, was made Transport Minister two weeks later in a cabinet reshuffle; Marples was described by some as [...] "cocky", [...] "flash", [...] "slick" [...] and as a [...] "construction tycoon", and Macmillan noted that the Northern working-class boy who had won a scholarship to a grammar school was one of only two [...] "self-made men" [...] in his cabinet.|$|E

[...] Said {{in the middle of a}} severe economic crisis and widening poverty, Virata and his quote were harshly criticized by numerous opinion makers as an example of the disconnect between the Marcos government and ordinary Filipinos.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>it.</b> It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E
2500|$|Opinions differ as {{to whether}} or not a player should learn this checkmate procedure. [...] James Howell omits the checkmate with two bishops in his book because it rarely occurs but {{includes}} the bishop and knight checkmate. [...] Howell says that he has had it three times (always on the defending side) and that it occurs more often than the checkmate with two bishops. [...] On the other hand, Jeremy Silman includes the checkmate with two bishops but not the bishop plus knight checkmate because he has had it only once and his friend John Watson has <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>it.</b> Silman says: ... mastering it would take a significant chunk of time. [...] Should the chess hopeful really spend many of his precious hours he's put aside for chess study learning an endgame he will achieve (at most) only once or twice in his lifetime? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} nearly {{finished}} on the whiteboards when Chibnall began writing the script. After about two weeks, Chibnall had {{a draft of}} the first few episodes. Ellie Miller was a lesbian in the first draft of the script, and there was no Joe Miller. But this didn't work well narratively, so Chibnall changed the character to a married heterosexual. But he had not yet settled on a killer. [...] "Often as a writer, you get your first draft out, and then you look and think, 'Now, what have I got here'," [...] Chibnall {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly. [...] "You're really just throwing mud at the wall and then going, 'Oh, there's a pattern there.' [...] " [...] Chibnall knew, however, that the killer had to be someone close to Ellie. About two weeks later, Chibnall woke one morning and realised the murderer should be Joe Miller, DS Ellie Miller's husband. [...] "t was the lightbulb moment above my head—which you never get as a writer, frankly. I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> before, probably won't ever have it again. I was, like, 'Ohmygod, it's Joe. It can't be anyone else.' [...] " [...] By making Joe the killer, Chibnall focused the series more closely on Ellie Miller, and improved the narrative structure so that it became about two families (the Millers and the Latimers). He then redrafted the first script and re-plotted and re-outlined the series. The killer's identity was [...] "embedded" [...] (as Chibnall described it) into the script before he brought the project to ITV. However, Chibnall kept the script loose enough that he could choose another character as the murderer, in case his preferred solution leaked to the press during shooting.|$|E
