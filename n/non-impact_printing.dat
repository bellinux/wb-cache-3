50|$|Digital Printers are {{sometimes}} erroneously {{referred to as}} being “Digital Printing Presses”. The term Printing Press refers {{to the nature of}} the process, in which there is contact between the system that applies the ink to the substrate and substrate that the ink is pressed onto. Digital Printers however are <b>non-impact</b> <b>printing</b> processes; to print, a devices “fires” drops of ink from the print heads onto the substrate.|$|E
5000|$|Letter-quality impact printers, however, were slow, noisy, {{incapable}} of printing graphics or images (unless the programmable microspacing and over-use of the dot were employed), sometimes limited to monochrome, and {{limited to a}} fixed set (usually one) of typefaces without operator intervention, though certain font effects like underlining and boldface could be achieved by overstriking. Soon, dot-matrix printers (such as the Oki Microline 84) would offer [...] "Near Letter Quality" [...] (NLQ) modes which were much faster than daisy-wheel printers, could produce graphics well, but were still very noticeably lower than [...] "letter quality". Nowadays, printers using <b>non-impact</b> <b>printing</b> (for example laser printers, inkjet printers, and other similar means) have replaced traditional letter-quality printers in most applications. The quality of inkjet printers can approach the old letter-quality impact printers (but can be limited by factors such as paper type).|$|E

We will describe a unique and new printing technology which enables maskless patterning of surfaces or coatings on thin (insulating) substrates. For volume production of many applications in printed electronics, very thin, patterned layers of (semi-) conducting and/or insulating polymers need to be created with high precision and extremely uniform thickness. Printing of such layers can result in significant cost reductions compared to other techniques.

It is time to look back and assess first of all how we got here, and then what were our goals for the future when we started. I will keep my presentation at a fairly abstract level, without mention of specific <b>non-impact</b> <b>printing</b> technologies, and the daily struggles thereof. For the first task—how we got here—it is useful to review the problems we were trying to resolve ten years ago, and what became of them.

40|$|<b>Non-impact</b> <b>printing</b> {{is gaining}} wider {{acceptance}} in the printing world, {{with one of}} the rapid growing applications being fine art color printing technology. With the right amount of artist’s imagination and combination of the right substrate and ink, it is possible to create a piece of art work that will last for a long time. This study includes a comprehensive look into ink/substrate combinations. The choice of proper substrate and coating, ink jet inks, together with some form of protection for ink jet printouts, is discussed here. Substrates with special ink jet receptive layers, with and without optical brightening agents (OBAs), were chosen for this work. The correlation between substrate’s characteristics and final print performance was established. Ink stability of prints with time was observed and lightfastness tests were performed in order to evaluate the stability of printed color patches on specific substrates. A special UV coating was applied to study its protection level. Results of accelerated lightfastness tests for the different substrates are interpreted in terms of change of color gamut volumes and ∆E...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{research into}} three different but interrelated technologies that can add value to commodity printing substrates by {{taking advantage of}} developments in synthetic chemistry, materials science and plasma physics. These investigations have been conducted in a Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) in Australia, called CRC Smartprint. Research into ink receptive coatings based on pigments possessing a positive surface charge has led to coatings that display improved resolution and colour saturation compared with silica based formulations. Although silica exhibits a high level of liquid absorption, it has relatively poor affinity for dye molecules contained in ink-jet ink. The second development involves the use of plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition at atmospheric pressure to change surface functionality with particular emphasis on absorptive and printing properties. Thirdly, the development of a prototype labelling system based on the application of electrochromic conductive polymer to a flexible substrate that responds to electrical stimuli is discussed. Taken together, these three developments illustrate how both impact and <b>non-impact</b> <b>printing</b> technologies can be judiciously used to apply not only improved visual imagery to paper and paperboard, but also have the potential to enable printing of micro-electronic circuitry directly onto packaging materials, or onto labels that will enable a wide range of improved tracking, security and marketing functions to be incorporated cost-effectively into packaged goods in future...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the original work carried {{out into the}} novel application of high intensity ultrasound to the de-inking of waste papers printed with digitally printed inks. These inks include fused toners, Indigo inks (ElectroInks) and UV cured coatings. They were previously considered to be ‘difficult to de-ink’ when present in conventional recycling de-inking plants because they are difficult both to detach from paper fibres and to break down into particle sizes that can be removed by conventional flotation techniques. The significance of this work is that for all the systems investigated {{it was possible to}} both detach and reduce the size of ink particles down to a desired flotatable size range of between 20 to 120 microns. Thus digitally printed papers that had been seen as presenting a treat to effective paper recycling can be recycled using the techniques described. Temperature was found {{to play a role in}} heat fusible toner printed materials. De-inking of the tough films produced by UV curing inks showed no temperature dependence. Indigo ink that had been feared to present problems to the recycling industry was found to be relatively easy to de-ink using these techniques. The general conclusions are that the application of ultrasound can be used to aid the de-inking of waste paper and reduce the number of chemicals used. The paper was an invited presentation for the <b>Non-impact</b> <b>Printing</b> Conference (NIP 23) held in Anchorage, Alaska during September 2007. The NIP conference is organised the Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS&T) with assistance from the Imaging Society of Japan and is considered to be the premiere event in evaluating the latest research developments in digital printing, attracting world class researchers from Japan and the USA...|$|E
40|$|Variable {{data will}} play a decisive role {{in the future of}} {{packaging}} and product promotion. Variable data printing (VDP) is a technique whereby certain information can be altered in an otherwise static layout {{with the help of a}} digital printing system, and in the packaging industry a wide range of applications is possible. Inkjet printing, due to its <b>non-impact</b> <b>printing</b> (NIP) principle, is the most suitable technology to use when applying variable data on packaging and to offer customized and even personalized prints for the industry and the end-consumer (van Daele, 2005). The aim of the work described in this thesis was to evaluate the practicability of attaining high quality variable data print (VDP) at high speed. The thesis is divided into three major parts. Part one focussed on the surface topography of corrugated board and applicable analytical methods to describe the printability of the substrate. In the second part the performance of inkjet on corrugated board liners printed at high speed was investigated and how to achieve maximum printing resolution. The final part of the thesis is devoted to a market survey of variable data printing on the North American and European markets. Part 1 concentrated on corrugated board as substrate and its pre-conditions regarding surface topography before the printing operation. Most critical for the quality are print defects such as mottling, gloss and stripiness, all of which occur in the printing of corrugated board. Stripiness is especially critical because it is one of the most disturbing print defects on corrugated board since it is periodical and more easily perceived than random print defects (Netz, 1996). Part 1 revealed that there is a difference in surface micro-roughness between the regions on the peak line of the fluting and the regions in the valley between two peaks of the corrugation which leads to glossy lines on the peak areas. The aim of the second part was to assess the practicability of attaining high quality VDP at high speed on a variety of liners for corrugated board production. The trial was conducted on a Kodak Versamark DP 5240 press in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, in cooperation with the Mid-Sweden University - Digital Printing Centre (DPC). Nine different substrates were printed at speeds between 0. 5 and 5  m/s. The results revealed that the paper type rather than the printing speed has the greatest influence on the print quality. Speed, however, is the most important technical factor for inline implementation of inkjet. To obtain a picture of the industries’ view of variable data print on fibre-based packaging, a market survey was initiated and was addressed to people in the development, marketing and decision-making sectors of the packaging and printing industry, including manufacturers of machinery, producers of packaging and prints, and print buyers. The goal was to draw an overview map covering the people’s view of their market, trends in their fields and how they envision the future of VDP on fibre-based packaging. The conclusion was that inkjet technology has to prove itself first and to increase its technical capability, and the printing industry will then start investing more in this technology and in applications such as VDP.
