5|$|A PlayStation Portable (PSP) {{version of}} the game was {{released}} in Japan on February 15, 2007 by Prototype. The first release of the PSP version came with a special DVD featuring a message from five of the voice actors and a recompiled opening video from the video game version. The five voice actors on the DVD included: Mariko Kōda as Nayuki Minase, Akemi Satō as Shiori Misaka, Mayumi Iizuka as Makoto Sawatari, Yūko Minaguchi as Akiko Minase, and Tomokazu Sugita as Yuichi Aizawa. Yui Horie as Ayu Tsukimiya voiced the short introduction of the DVD, but was not featured in {{the contents of the}} DVD itself. A downloadable {{version of the}} PSP release via the PlayStation Store was released by Prototype on October 9, 2009. A version playable on FOMA and SoftBank 3G mobile phones was released by Prototype through VisualArt's Motto in May 2007. A version playable on Android devices was released on November 30, 2011. A version playable on iOS devices was released on April 4, 2013.

5|$|A version playable on SoftBank 3G {{mobile phones}} was {{released}} by Prototype through VisualArt's Motto on May 1, 2007. Prototype later released a VGA edition produced by NTT DoCoMo playable on FOMA phones in February 2008. The version for the FOMA phones was split into two separate files: the Dream story arc comprised the first file, and the remaining Summer and Air arcs comprised the second file. A version of the Dream arc playable on Android devices was released on July 27, 2012. A version containing the Summer and Air arcs for Android devices was released on August 15, 2012. A full version Air on Android devices was released on October 24, 2012 in two editions: one without voice acting, and one with voice acting, including Yukito. Two versions were released on May 2, 2013: an adult version for Android devices and an all ages version playable on iOS devices. A PlayStation Portable (PSP) version of the game was released in Japan on November 22, 2007 by Prototype. A downloadable version of the PSP release via the PlayStation Store {{was released by}} Prototype on September 2, 2010. A PlayStation Vita (PSV) version was released by Prototype on September 8, 2016. In the original release, there was <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> acting for the characters, though this was later changed for the DC version, which except for Yukito included full voice acting, and the PS2, PSP and PSV versions, which had full voice acting.|$|E
25|$|The Clip Sport was {{announced}} on February 10, 2014, with capacities of 4GB, 8GB. It {{is similar to}} previous Clip models, with a larger screen and longer battery life, but with <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> recorder. Later firmware uses the menu button for locking.

25|$|Simultaneously, also in 2005, Drummer Steve (ex-Ghosts of Lovers, Kronstadt Uprising, Sinyx) {{was putting}} {{together}} a website called ‘Southend Punk History 1976–1986’ which focused on the towns Punk History and its lost generation of bands whom hitherto had <b>no</b> <b>voice.</b> In compling this site, Steve {{got in touch with}} Nick, and soon established a dialogue, based on a mutual love of High Energy Punk Rock’n’ Roll, as played by bands like The New York Dolls, The Ramones and Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers.|$|E

25|$|Akio Suyama voiced Ogami. At the time, Suyama {{had little}} to <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> acting experience, and was working {{part-time}} at Red Company while training as a voice actor. Hiroi was {{still looking for a}} voice actor for Ogami, but there was limited budget to hand. Upon hearing of Hiroi's situation, Suyama offered to take on the role despite there only being a few lines of any note. Faced with his budget and time limitations, Hiroi accepted Suyama's offer. Ogami was the last main character to be cast.|$|E
25|$|While {{growing up}} in Puerto Rico in the 1950s and 1960s, La Luz’s {{grandfather}} used {{to take him to}} the tobacco, coffee and sugarcane fields in Puerto Rico where he witnessed first hand the plight of poor Puerto Ricans who were toiling these fields to earn their meager livelihoods. Having seen the swollen bellies of their children who were malnourished and whose fathers pushed relentlessly to work the fields while living in the poorest of conditions – many in shacks without running water, electricity and with poor hygienic conditions – La Luz began to understand the importance of working for the sensible human rights of those who had <b>no</b> <b>voice.</b> The fight for basic rights and justice for all people, no matter who they were or where they were from became his life’s passion.|$|E

25|$|All games {{made for}} the Xbox 360 are {{required}} to support at least Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The console works with over 256 audio channels and 320 independent decompression channels using 32-bit processing for audio, with support for 48kHz 16-bit sound. Sound files for games are encoded using Microsoft's XMA audio format. An MPEG-2 decoder is included for DVD video playback. VC-1 or WMV is used for streaming video and other video is compressed using VC-1 at non-HD NTSC and PAL resolutions or WMV HD. The Xbox 360 also supports H.263 and H.264 MPEG-4 videos. Unlike the original Xbox, voice communication is handled by the console, not by the game code, allowing for cross-game communication. There is <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> echo to game players on the same console; voice only goes to remote consoles.|$|E
25|$|The British {{controlled}} India (including modern Pakistan and Bangladesh) {{either directly}} through the British Raj or indirectly through local princes. The colonial government of India supported the war enthusiastically, and enlarged the British Indian army {{by a factor}} of 500% to 1.4 million men. It sent 550,000 overseas, with 200,000 going as labourers to the Western Front and the rest to the Middle East theatre. Only a few hundred were allowed to become officers, but there were some 100,000 casualties. The main fighting of the latter group was in Iraq, where large numbers were killed and captured in the initial stages of the Mesopotamian campaign, most infamously during the Siege of Kut. The Indian contingent was entirely funded by the Indian taxpayers (who had no vote and <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> in the matter).|$|E
25|$|There were {{normally}} {{no special}} signs for indicating the higher divisions of modus and maximodus. However, groups of longa rests {{at the beginning}} of a piece (which occurred frequently, as often some voices in a polyphonic composition would enter later than others) could be used as an indicator of the intended meter. If longa rests were written across three staff spaces, they were perfect; moreover, if they occurred in groups of three written together on the same staff line they indicated perfect maximodus. Occasionally, if <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> happened to have a sufficiently long rest {{at the beginning of}} the piece, a dummy rest symbol of one maxima's worth of longae would be written to the left of the mensuration sign; in that case it was understood as part of the time signature and not actually executed as a rest.|$|E

25|$|Divisions {{organised}} attacks {{according to}} SS 135 (Instructions {{for the training}} of Platoons for Offensive Action) of December 1916. The pamphlet {{was derived from the}} experience of the Somme in 1916 for divisions to organise according to a common pattern and prescribed the siege warfare methods necessary for trench-to-trench attacks, the semi-open fighting, when defensive positions had been captured and open warfare techniques, for when the defence collapsed. All the sections of SS 135 addressed the problem of command when <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> communication existed by prescribing that a commander's intention must be communicated and that the infantry should make every effort to send back information by any means available, primarily by visual methods which needed specialist parties to advance with the infantry to set up relay stations, carrier pigeons, experimental wireless sets, power buzzers, signal lamps and runners, who were trained to use the terrain and know the trench systems for maximum protection.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a {{sophisticated}} {{do it yourself}} infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement {{as a way to}} activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.|$|E
25|$|Although {{written in}} the 19th century, The Brothers Karamazov {{displays}} a number of modern elements. Dostoyevsky composed the book {{with a variety of}} literary techniques. Though privy to many of the thoughts and feelings of the protagonists, the narrator is a self-proclaimed writer; he discusses his own mannerisms and personal perceptions so often in the novel that he becomes a character. Through his descriptions, the narrator's voice merges imperceptibly into the tone of the people he is describing, often extending into the characters' most personal thoughts. There is <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> of authority in the story (see Mikhail Bakhtin's Problems of Dostoyevsky's Poetics for more on the relationship between Dostoyevsky and his characters). In addition to the principal narrator there are several sections narrated by other characters entirely, such as the story of the Grand Inquisitor and Zosima's confessions. This technique enhances the theme of truth, making many aspects of the tale completely subjective.|$|E

25|$|The colonists did {{not object}} that the taxes were high; they were {{actually}} low. They objected {{to the fact that}} they had no representation in the Parliament, and thus <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> concerning legislation that affected them. Benjamin Franklin testified in Parliament in 1766 that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said that local governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the French and Indian War alone. London had to deal with 1,500 politically well-connected British Army soldiers. The decision was to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a standing army in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so the decision was made to station them in America and have the Americans pay them. The soldiers had no military mission; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no threat to the colonies.|$|E
25|$|Like many {{intellectuals in}} Mexico, her {{focus is on}} human rights issues and {{defending}} various social groups, especially those she considers to be oppressed by those in power, which include women, the poor and others. She speaks and writes about them even though she herself {{is a member of}} Mexico's elite, using her contacts as such on others’ behalf. She is not an impartial writer as she acts as an advocate for those who she feels have <b>no</b> <b>voice.</b> She feels that a personal relationship with her subjects is vital. She stated to La Jornada that the student movement of 1968 left a profound mark on her life and caused her consciousness to change as students were murdered by their own police. It was after this that she was clear that the purpose of her writing was to change Mexico. She has visited political and other prisoners in jail, especially strikers and the student protestors of 1968. According to one biography, her house was watched around the clock. She was arrested twice (one in jail for twelve hours and once detained for two) when observing demonstrations. However, she has never written about this.|$|E
25|$|The Mailers Trade District Union (MTDU) was an {{internal}} {{part of the}} ITU. Lawsuits from 1926-1944 were fought for mailer rights. The MTDU was eventually abolished by court injunction and referendum vote. In 1929, ITU president Charles P. Howard selected third vice-president C. N. Smith (a printer) to represent the MTDU. The mailers were allowed to vote in 1930 for their MTDU representative; John Mc Ardle and Harold Mitchell served in 1934. Munro Roberts was elected as MTDU member of the executive council, (19351937) but he had <b>no</b> <b>voice</b> or vote. After many heated arguments with ITU President Howard and Secretary Randolph, Roberts became committed to a separate mailer union. Moreover, the International Mailers' Union (IMU), was created and many shops would have two boards, ITU and IMU. With the departure of Roberts, Thomas J. Martin represented the MTDU (19381944). The MTDU continued by court order; however, the mailers were again without an observer to the executive council. The 1947 Cleveland convention {{paved the way for}} the demise of the MTDU and the election of a mailer to the executive council. Joe Bailey (San Francisco-Oakland Mailers #M-18), was elected third vice-president before the 1948 Milwaukee convention. ITU President Woodruff Randolph saw a way to appease mailers returning after service in World War II. The agreement made between ITU President Randolph and Joe Bailey: only a Printer would ever be President, first and second Vice-President or Secretary-Treasurer of the ITU. The position of third Vice-President would be held only by a Mailer. The IMU lost much power to draw new membership. The IMU finally was finally fully merged into the ITU only in 1982, only five years before the union's demise. Joe Bailey served on the ITU executive council until 1973. A mailer would remain ITU third vice-president: Robert F. Ameln, (19741975) and the Canadian mailer, Allen J. Heritage, (19761986).|$|E
