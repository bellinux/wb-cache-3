5000|$|As the weir is not {{as popular}} as the nearby Boondooma Dam the weir doesn't provide any picnic or toilet facilities. Fuel-powered vessels are not {{recommended}} on the weir because of the limited space, though electric and <b>non-motorized</b> <b>vessels</b> are permitted.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{commercial}} outfitters offer guided trips through Cataract Canyon. These trips vary in length {{between one and}} six days and utilize both motorized and <b>non-motorized</b> <b>vessels.</b> Private groups are required to obtain a permit from the National Park Service prior to embarking on a Cataract Canyon trip.|$|R

Surrounding the Town Hall is Mills River Park, whose Master Plan {{includes}} ball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, playgrounds, multiuse trails, a dog park, shelters and support facilities. The Mills River {{runs along the}} northern boundary of the property. The Plan also proposes fishing piers with handicapped access and a boat launch for <b>non-motorized</b> <b>vessels</b> along with picnic areas to enjoy the river.|$|R
25|$|Since settlement, {{all people}} and cargo had arrived by flatboats and later keelboats, {{both of which}} were <b>non-motorized</b> <b>vessels,</b> meaning that it was prohibitively costly to send goods {{upstream}} (towards Pittsburgh and other developed areas). This technical limitation, combined with the Spanish decision in 1784 to close the Mississippi River below Vicksburg, Mississippi to American ships, meant there was very little outside market for goods produced early on in Louisville. This improved somewhat with Pinckney's Treaty, which opened the river and made New Orleans a Free trade zone by 1798.|$|R

Results showed that catches have been fairly stable while fishing effort has been increasing leading to decline in CPUE. This could be attributed to population growth, poor fishing technology, use of <b>non-motorized</b> small <b>vessels,</b> and competition. Ring nets dominated the fishery in terms of catch landed per gear. Beach seines, and spears, which are illegal, have been increasing overtime. A linear regression analysis showed that fishers, vessels, gears, and catch value were significant variables in explaining variations in landed catch over the time period (r 2 = 0. 7833). Dar es Salaam recorded the highest catch (p = 2. 6 E- 06) because of better markets and facilities while the lowest was observed in Mtwara (p = 0. 01126). Coast region recorded more vessels and gears. Catch was significantly different (p = 2. 2 E- 06) across districts within five regions. Ilala district recorded the highest. Average income was significantly high in Dar es Salaam (p = 0. 008469) because of urbanization and concentration of economic activities. Two clusters of regions that were similar according to species landed were observed. Coast, Tanga, Lindi and Dar es Salaam were similar in species composition whereas Mtwara was different with fewer species. Data collection, entry and analysis need to be done in a consistent manner. Proper data collection, management, and analysis could lead to fisheries sector being more representative towards the GDP of the country...|$|R
