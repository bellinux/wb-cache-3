5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and <b>need</b> <b>protection</b> {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of ecotourism.|$|E

Both Kmart and O'Donnell denied publicly that Kmart had terminated the contract. In May 2000, O'Donnell's bodyguard applied for a concealed firearm permit.

25|$|Western special {{operations}} forces are considered strategic assets with core missions including FID and UW. They may have other capabilities relevant to specific situations, such as demining. United States Army Special Forces {{are among the most}} versatile organizations, but not all their capabilities may be needed for a specific FID situation. For example, the most urgent need might be for public health specialists or airfield construction crews, which operate on a level far beyond the medical or engineering specialists of a US Special Forces unit. Public health or construction organizations, however, have limited or no self-defense capability and will <b>need</b> <b>protection</b> in insecure areas.|$|E
25|$|After the Soviet Union {{disintegrated}} in {{the early}} 1990s, the term hyperpower began {{to be applied to}} the United States, as the sole remaining superpower of the Cold War era. This term, popularized by French foreign minister Hubert Védrine in the late 1990s, is controversial and the validity of classifying the United States in this way is disputed. One notable opponent to this theory, Samuel P. Huntington, rejects this theory in favor of a multipolar balance of power. Other international relations theorists, such as Henry Kissinger, theorize that because the threat of the Soviet Union no longer exists to formerly American-dominated regions such as Western Europe and Japan, American influence is only declining {{since the end of the}} Cold War, because such regions no longer <b>need</b> <b>protection</b> or have necessarily similar foreign policies as the United States.|$|E

500|$|The Bishop of Mangalore Diocese Aloysius Paul D'Souza {{stated that}} Christians were [...] "deeply hurt" [...] over the desecration of the Holy Cross and Sacred Sacrament in the Adoration monastery. The Archbishop of Bangalore Archdiocese, Bernard Moras, {{who met with}} Yeddyurappa in the {{aftermath}} of the attacks said, [...] "I want to tell you, Mr. Yeddyurappa we are wounded!" [...] Fr. William Menezes, the public relations officer of the Mangalore Diocese, said: [...] "After consulting various leaders and based on the assurance given by Chief Minister B. S. Yeddyurappa, district in-charge Minister J. Krishna Palemar, the police and district administration, we hereby appeal to our community to stop agitation immediately to maintain peace." [...] Fr. Prashant Madtha, former principal of St. Aloysius College said in response to the attacks and resultant protests, [...] "The retaliation from the Christian community you saw was happening for the very first time in the history of the state. It was not the correct response, I condemn it, but then our youth have started imitating the enemy. There is a lot of fear. We don't know when the stones will rain on our roofs. We are even scared to talk." [...] Fr. Joseph Valiaparambil, Bishop of Belthangady, also said that Christian community of Belthangady was deeply hurt and shocked at the attacks, saying that [...] "We strongly condemn the act. We are not violent and do not believe in violence. We respect the administration and the law of the country. We respect all religions. We, the Christian minority community, <b>need</b> <b>protection</b> from kinds of anti-social, anti-religious activities". The community leaders in a press conference also appealed internationally, stating [...] "we want to bring to the notice of the world and human right commissions and authorities in Canada to use their diplomatic channels about the total collapse of law and order in Mangalore and other parts of India, and the failure of the state to protect the lives of the clergy and the minority community".|$|E
2500|$|Resident orcas {{living in}} British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, United States live in {{extremely}} stable family groups. The {{basis of this}} social structure is the matriline, consisting of {{a mother and her}} offspring, who travel with her for life. Male orcas never leave their mothers' pods, while female offspring may branch off to form their own matriline if they have many offspring of their own. Males have a particularly strong bond with their mother, and travel with them their entire lives, which can exceed 50 years. It is interesting behavior, as it may seem {{that there would be no}} benefit from this except perhaps in hunting techniques, although they could join other groups to hunt. There are two interesting examples of this familial bond in males. Two male sons, identified as A38 and A39, constantly accompany their mother A30, despite the fact that she does not <b>need</b> <b>protection</b> and they can all hunt by themselves, and rarely leave her side. Researchers have noted that if one son wanders away, one always remains with the mother. Another example are the brothers A32, A37 and A46, whose mother (A36) died. Instead of the family disbanding, the three brothers remain constantly together [...]|$|E
2500|$|Once a trust {{has been}} validly formed, the trust's terms guide its operation. While professionally drafted trust {{instruments}} often contain a full {{description of how}} trustees are appointed, how they should manage the property, and their rights and obligations, the law supplies a comprehensive set of default rules. Some were codified in the Trustee Act 2000 but others are construed by the courts. In many instances, English law follows a laissez-faire philosophy of [...] "freedom of trust". In general, it will {{be left to the}} choice of the settlor to follow the law or to draft alternative rules. Where a trust instrument runs out or is silent, the law will fill the gaps. In contrast, in specific trusts, particularly pensions within the Pensions Act 1995, charities under the Charities Act 2011, and investment trusts regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, many rules regarding trusts' administration, and the duties of trustees are made mandatory by statute. This reflects the view of Parliament that beneficiaries in those cases lack bargaining power and <b>need</b> <b>protection,</b> especially through enhanced disclosure rights. For family trusts, or private unmarketed trusts, the law can usually be contracted around, subject to an irreducible core of trust obligations. The scope of compulsory terms may be subject of debate, but Millett LJ in Armitage v Nurse viewed that every trustee must always act [...] "honestly and in good faith {{for the benefit of the}} beneficiaries". In addition to general principles of good administration, trustees' primary duties include fulfilling a duty of [...] "undivided loyalty" [...] by avoiding any possibility of a conflict of interest, exercising proper care, and following the terms of the trust to fulfil their purpose.|$|E
