25|$|After the Yongle Emperor's {{overthrow}} of the Jianwen Emperor, China's countryside was devastated. The fragile <b>new</b> <b>economy</b> {{had to deal with}} low production and depopulation. The Yongle Emperor laid out a long and extensive plan to strengthen and stabilise the <b>new</b> <b>economy,</b> but first he had to silence dissension. He created an elaborate system of censors to remove corrupt officials from office that spread such rumors. The emperor dispatched some of his most trusted officers to reveal or destroy secret societies, bandits, and loyalists to his other relatives. To strengthen the economy, he fought population decline by reclaiming land, utilising the most he could from the existing labour force, and maximising textile and agricultural production.|$|E
25|$|Greenspan entered {{government}} in the 70s, and became Chairman of the Federal Reserve. In 1992, he visited the newly elected Bill Clinton. He persuaded him to let the markets grow, cut taxes, and to let the markets stabilise themselves {{with the help of}} computer technology, to create the <b>New</b> <b>economy.</b> This involved using computer models to predict risks and hedge against them, in accordance with the Californian Ideology. However, by 1996, the production figures had failed to increase, but profits were nevertheless rising, and Greenspan suggested that it wasn't working. After political attacks from all sides, Greenspan changed his mind and decided that perhaps the <b>New</b> <b>Economy</b> was real after all, but that it couldn't be measured using normal economic measures, and so the apparent boom continued.|$|E

25|$|Set {{against a}} {{backdrop}} of rapid economic development and social changes in post-Mao China, the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy which benefitted some people but seriously disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, limited preparedness of graduates for the <b>new</b> <b>economy,</b> and restrictions on political participation. The students called for democracy, greater accountability, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech, though they were loosely organized and their goals varied. At the height of the protests, about a million people assembled in the Square.|$|E

The largest civil rights protests in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro in May and June 1963.

25|$|The {{trading post}} of Ville-Marie, {{established}} {{on the current}} island of Montreal, quickly became the economic hub for the French fur trade.

From here a <b>new</b> <b>economy</b> emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the Company of New France was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of furs from French territories. By trading with native populations and securing the main markets its power grew steadily for the next decade. As a result, {{it was able to}} set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.|$|E
