5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing exactly {{how it feels to}} hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E

500|$|When {{the first}} patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine {{recalled}} that the crowd—most {{of whom were}} homosexual—had grown to at least ten {{times the number of}} people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet. Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, [...] "Gay power!", someone began singing [...] "We Shall Overcome", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with [...] "growing and intensive hostility". An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author Edmund White, who had been passing by, recalled, [...] "Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing." [...] Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.|$|E

So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with {{the concerns of the}} ordinary citizen. The result of this is that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues.|$|E
2500|$|At least 20 people, {{including}} {{government officials}} and the two airline employees, were arrested on suspicion of being linked to the attack. A Serbian pilot, Vlatko Vodopivec, criticised the lack of security around the aircraft at the airport, describing the facility as [...] "chaotic". In {{an interview with the}} Associated Press, Vodopivec explained that [...] "the security is zero. When we park there, some 20 to 30 people come to the tarmac ... <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> badge or those yellow vests. They enter and leave the aircraft, and no one knows who is who...

There is, however, a popular perception stating that there are 330 million (or [...] "33 crore") [...] deities in Hinduism. Most, by far, are goddesses, state Foulston and Abbott, suggesting [...] "how important and popular goddesses are" [...] in Hindu culture. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> list of the 330 million goddesses and gods, but scholars state all deities are typically viewed in Hinduism as [...] "emanations or manifestation of genderless principle called Brahman, representing the many facets of Ultimate Reality".|$|E

5000|$|Since his election, some Catholics criticized Sosa for {{his alleged}} lack of orthodoxy.
