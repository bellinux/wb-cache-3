40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, the {{development}} of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines has seen a plethora of part programming languages being developed. The large majority of these languages {{are based on the}} ISO 6983 standard which is commonly known as G&M codes, but other languages from machine tool suppliers are also used for programming machine tools. These programming languages have provided major barriers for the interoperability of such information between computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines and also from computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines to computer-aided systems. Thus, the process knowledge in existing part programs cannot be recycled and reused easily, due to an inability to interpret these forms of data. In this article, a new meta-model of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> part programming languages has been proposed. The meta-model aims to abstract the characteristics of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machine activities and interpret/represent process information within computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> part programs written in different languages or dialects. Realising the translation between the meta-model and different part programming languages, it is possible to capture the shopfloor knowledge from computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines without the need to develop individual interpreting interfaces for each programming language. The valuable process knowledge can thus be captured from the part programs and represented in a neutral presentation to facilitate the knowledge accumulation and management, which is vital for manufacturing companies to gain competitive advantages in the globalised market...|$|R

40|$|The <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> {{oscillator}} has wide {{application in}} radar, digital receiver, and software radio system. Firstly, this paper introduces the traditional CORDIC algorithm. Then {{in order to}} improve computing speed and save resources, this paper proposes a kind of hybrid CORDIC algorithm based on phase rotation estimation applied in <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator (NCO). Through estimating the direction of part phase rotation, the algorithm reduces part phase rotation and add-subtract unit, so that it decreases delay. Furthermore, the paper simulates and implements the <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator by Quartus II software and Modelsim software. Finally, simulation results indicate that the improvement over traditional CORDIC algorithm is achieved in terms of ease of computation, resource utilization, and computing speed/delay while maintaining the precision.

The paper tape could be changed without changing the mechanical design of the loom. This was a landmark achievement in programmability. His machine was an improvement over similar weaving looms.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Peninsula Technikon, Cape Town, 1996 In {{answer to}} the needs of the growing number of smaller {{manufacturers}} of Printed Circuit Boards, the "Computer <b>Numerical</b> <b>Controlled</b> Drill interfaced to a Computer Aided Design software package" was conceptualised. This development would considerably improve both productivity and efficiency and consequently would improve cost effectiveness. The smaller manufacturer is unable to afford the more sophisticated Computer <b>Numerical</b> <b>Controlled</b> Drill equipment and the software packages which drive them. It was necessary for the Computer <b>Numerical</b> <b>Controlled</b> machine to possess all the capabilities and versatility of the more sophisticated and expensive equipment, and yet still be affordable to the smaller manufacturer. Furthermore, since such equipment would need to be operated in fairly hostile environments, it would need to be robust and reliable. This interdisciplinary development has required the knowledge and skill from many different engineering fields, and made them readily available to industry which otherwise would not have had access to them. The South African economy at present, has a growing need for smaller and medium business enterprises, and the needs of these must be appropriately served. It is envisaged that this development will make a significant contribution to greater economic activity...|$|R

25|$|The {{hand tool}} form of router is the {{original}} form. It is a specialized type of hand plane with a broad base and a narrow blade projecting well beyond its base plate (gaining it the nickname old woman's tooth). Today the power tool form of router, with an electric-motor-driven spindle, is the more common form, and the hand tool is now often called a router plane. Although the hand tool has a few advantages over the power tool and retains favour with some workers, it has been mostly replaced by the modern spindle router, which was designed for the same work. Some workers consider {{it to be the}} single most versatile woodworking power tool. Becoming more popular is the use of a CNC wood router, which implements the advantages of CNC (Computer <b>Numerical</b> <b>Control).</b>|$|E
