25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become the person that he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan {{fell in love with the}} sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's <b>never</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to change, to become a better man.|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written {{from the perspective of}} one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, [...] "Desiring a Love Story", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, [...] "Preparing for a Love Story", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, [...] "Waiting for a Love Story", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, [...] "Sweetening a Love Story", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, [...] "Discovering a God-written Love Story", argues that it is <b>never</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.|$|E

It's <b>never</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for a man to be held accountable for his crimes." [...] Jones then recited Blanton's extensive history with the Ku Klux Klan, before referring to the audio recordings presented earlier in the trial.

2500|$|Before Ellie died, {{she left}} a piece of advice for Peyton {{regarding}} Peyton's love life, telling her that it is <b>never</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to pursue her romantic interest. Peyton decides to give love another try and dates Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy. Their relationship does not work out, since Pete is busy with touring. Peyton's father tells her to follow her heart and listen to it, so Peyton, considering Ellie's advice as well, decides to give Jake a visit in Savannah; she knows that she still loves him and feels {{that this will be}} enough for her to be happy. She renews her relationship with Jake and Jenny, and even goes far enough to propose marriage to Jake, who gladly accepts. This happiness fades once Jake overhears Peyton say, [...] "I love you, Lucas" [...] in her sleep. Peyton is then forced to confront Jake about the kiss she and Lucas shared {{on the day of the}} shooting. Jake figures that while Peyton loves him, she is in love with Lucas. He tells her to go back to Tree Hill, and to find out if Lucas is still in her heart. If he is not, Jake promises to still be there waiting. Peyton does as Jake has advised. In the finale, Brooke once again ends her friendship with Peyton after Peyton tells her that she still has romantic feelings for Lucas. Lucas later tells Brooke about the kiss in the library. At the end of the episode, Peyton burns pictures of herself with Brooke. She then picks up a picture of the three of them (herself, Brooke and Lucas) and burns it.|$|E

There was also another man in white garments standing upright in her stern, and Desmond was wholly sure of his identity. Then she was lost for awhile, and only swept into sight again abreast of the Palestrina's dipping bows, hove high with half her length lifted out of the crest of a breaking sea.|$|R
6000|$|My own {{motive for}} {{opposing}} {{the bill is}} founded on its palpable injustice, and its certain inefficacy. I have seen the state of these miserable men, {{and it is a}} disgrace to a civilized country. Their excesses may be condemned, but cannot be subject of wonder. The effect of the present bill would be to drive them into actual rebellion. The few words I shall venture to offer on Thursday will be founded upon these opinions formed from my own observations on the spot. By previous inquiry, I am convinced these men would have been restored to employment, and the county to tranquillity. It is, perhaps, not yet <b>too</b> <b>late,</b> and is surely worth the trial. It can <b>never</b> be <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to employ force in such circumstances. I believe your Lordship does not coincide with me entirely on this subject, and most cheerfully and sincerely shall I submit to your superior judgment and experience, and take some other line of argument against the bill, or be silent altogether, should you deem it more advisable. Condemning, as every one must condemn, the conduct of these wretches, I believe in the existence of grievances which call rather for pity than punishment.

2500|$|Many {{episodes of}} the show have dealt with Lemon's ongoing search for love. According to Pete, Liz has had some [...] "really terrible boyfriends" [...] in the ten years that he's known her. It is implied that she once dated Conan O'Brien, first when she {{identifies}} the [...] "tall, gangly red-haired guy who played guitar all the time" [...] whom she dated as Conan in [...] "Blind Date"; {{there seems to be}} romantic tension between them during a brief encounter. During an in-flight nap induced by a drug which may cause [...] "sexual nightmares," [...] Liz growls something that arguably sounds very much like, [...] "No, Conan, no!" [...] ("Believe In the Stars"). It has become apparent that Lemon has very high standards in men, personified in her imaginary perfect husband, [...] "Astronaut Mike Dexter". She appears to take a somewhat more realistic view her dream man after learning of her mother's premarital relationship with then-future astronaut Edwin [...] "Buzz" [...] ("Eddie" [...] to her) Aldrin and subsequently conversing with Aldrin. She shares [...] "sexual history" [...] with Grizz who alone addresses her as [...] "Beth", and they are seen passionately kissing in the footage from Kenneth's party in [...] "Greenzo". In season 4, Liz uncharacteristically instigates a one-night stand with James Franco and his Japanese body pillow, Kimiko. At one point in season 5, in the episode [...] "It's <b>Never</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late</b> For Now", Liz decides to give up on love and embrace spinsterhood by adopting a cat she calls Emily Dickinson, attending book clubs and wearing a fanny pack and baggy sweaters.|$|E

60|$|I would fain {{have the}} conduct of my sex a little {{regulated}} in this particular, which is the thing in which, of all the parts of life, I think at this time we suffer most in; 'tis nothing but lack of courage, the fear of not being married at all, and of that frightful state of life called an old maid, of which I have {{a story to tell}} by itself. This, I say, is the woman's snare; but would the ladies once but get above that fear and manage rightly, they would more certainly avoid it by standing their ground, in a case so absolutely necessary to their felicity, that by exposing themselves as they do; and if they did not marry so soon as they may do otherwise, they would make themselves amends by marrying safer. She is always married too soon who gets a bad husband, and she is <b>never</b> married <b>too</b> <b>late</b> who gets a good one; in a word, there is no woman, deformity or lost reputation excepted, but if she manages well, may be married safely one time or other; but if she precipitates herself, it is ten thousand to one but she is undone.|$|R

She fascinates him from the very first moment, winks at him, and so he is prepared to pay an entire month's salary for her. From this day on (which is point-of-no-return in the story), his life changes. Since he is not allowed to bring Fantasía into his flat, he tries to hide her at work. At work their friendship begins. Don Cornelio opens the window, since this is what the vivid Fantasía is asking for, and Fantasía takes him out for a flight. For Fantasía Don Cornelio gives up his job after 20 years of loyal work, and starts a whole new life.

She had held out her arms to him--and he, cold, churlish, unfeeling brute, had let her shame herself, fighting for her happiness, for the joy that is a woman's divine right.

I have got health to a {{wonderful}} extent; and as I have the most interesting matter for my book, bar accidents, I ought to get all I have laid out and a profit. But, second (what I own I <b>never</b> considered till <b>too</b> <b>late),</b> there was the danger of collisions, of damages and heavy repairs, of disablement, towing, and salvage; indeed, the cruise might have turned round and cost me double.
