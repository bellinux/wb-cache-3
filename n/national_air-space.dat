50|$|The extra-regio {{territory}} {{is made up}} of parts of the economic territory of a country which cannot be assigned to a single region. It consists of the <b>national</b> <b>air-space,</b> territorial waters and the continental shelf lying in international waters over which the country enjoys exclusive rights, territorial exclaves, deposits of oil, natural gas etc. worked by resident units. Until 2011, the gross value added (GVA) produced in the extra-regio was allocated pro-rata to the inhabited regions of the country concerned. The order of magnitude of the extra-regio GVA depends in particular on the resource endowment in terms of natural gas and oil. In 2011, Member States and the European Commission agreed to give countries the possibility to calculate regional GDP also for the extra-regio. The resulting GDP is available only in absolute values, because the extra-regio territory by definition does not have a resident population.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a multi-agent platform Agent-Fly used for large-scale high-detail simulation of air traffic. The platform introduces {{spatial and temporal}} planning within 3 D space, multi-layer architecture using several collision avoidance algorithms. To be able to simulate {{a huge amount of}} airplanes, distributed simulation is introduced using spatial partitioning and dynamic loadbalancing. The platform has been used to support simulation of an entire civilian air traffic touching <b>National</b> <b>Air-Space</b> of United States. Thorough evaluation of the system has been performed, confirming that it can scale up to a very high number of complex agents operating simultaneously (thousands of aircraft) with full detailed models. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a distributed architecture for situated largescale agent-based simulations with predominately local interactions. The approach, implemented in AglobeX Simulation platform, {{is based on}} a spatially partitioned simulated virtual environment and allocating a dedicated processing core to the environment simulation within each partition. In combination with dynamic load-balancing, such partitioning enables virtually unlimited scalability of the simulation platform. The approach has been used to extend the AgentFly air-traffic testbed to support simulation of a complete civilian air-traffic touching <b>National</b> <b>Air-Space</b> of United States. Thorough evaluation of the system has been performed, confirming that it can scale up to a very high number of complex agents operating simultaneously (thousands of aircraft) and determining the impact of different configurations of the simulation architecture on its overall performance. ...|$|E
