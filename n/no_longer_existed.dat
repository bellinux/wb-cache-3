5|$|The {{painting}} {{can be seen}} as Matejko's {{warning to}} Otto von Bismarck, whose Germanization policies (Kulturkampf) targeted Polish culture, reminding him of the Polish victory over the Teutons. Overall, the painting was intended to raise the spirits of the Polish people during the period when Poland had been partitioned and <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed</b> as an independent state.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the plans}} {{did not fully}} work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks, and the slaves did not join the army in the {{expected}} numbers. The Argentine provinces could not send the supporting army that San Martín had requested earlier, and the Army of the North <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed.</b> As a result, he wrote to Simón Bolívar, trying to coordinate actions with him.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was set in}} a {{contemporary}} world, albeit a world of magic and supernatural conflict behind the scenes. The series is largely isolated {{from the rest of}} the DC Universe, in which the supernatural or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most ordinary people, and in Earth-threatening circumstances no superhero interventions were shown or hinted at, suggesting that superheroes <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed</b> there. However, some DC Comics characters—most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, The Phantom Stranger, Shade, The Changing Man, Dream of the Endless, and Swamp Thing made appearances.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed,</b> and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his Tour de France championship.|$|E
5|$|The KRRC's 3rd Battalion, {{including}} {{a platoon of}} 70 Rhodesians, was transferred from France to the Salonika Front in 1915. On this comparatively quiet front, they were slowly whittled down {{over the course of}} the war: 26 of them remained in January 1917, and by the end of the war so few were left that the platoon <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed.</b> Most of the men had been killed in action, while others were prisoners of the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Viceroy Cisneros {{tried to}} {{maintain}} the political status quo, but a group of criollo lawyers and military officials organized an open cabildo (a special meeting of notables of the city) on May22 to decide {{the future of the}} Viceroyalty. Delegates denied recognition to the Council of Regency in Spain and established a junta to govern in place of Cisneros, since the government that had appointed him Viceroy <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed.</b> To maintain a sense of continuity, Cisneros was initially appointed president of the Junta. However, this caused much popular unrest, so he resigned under pressure on May25. The newly formed government, the Primera Junta, included only representatives from Buenos Aires and invited other cities of the Viceroyalty to send delegates to join them. This resulted in the outbreak of war between the regions that accepted the outcome of the events at Buenos Aires and those that did not.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century the small {{population}} of Ch'ol Maya in southern Petén and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, {{where the people}} were absorbed into the Q'eqchi' population. The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in Huehuetenango in the early 18th century. By 1699 the neighbouring Toquegua <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed</b> as a separate people because {{of a combination of}} high mortality and intermarriage with the Amatique Indians. At around this time the Spanish decided on the reduction of the independent Mopan Maya living to the north of Lake Izabal. Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702–1703. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled in 1704, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén, compared to ten times that number in 1697. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.|$|E
5|$|Lezica {{informed}} Cisneros of {{the request}} for an open cabildo and the Viceroy consulted Leiva, who spoke in favor of it. The Viceroy summoned military commanders {{to come to the}} fort at 7pm, to demand military support. There were rumors that it could be a trap to capture them and take control of the barracks. To prevent this, they took command of the grenadiers that guarded the Fort and seized the keys of all entrances while meeting with the Viceroy. Colonel Cornelio Saavedra, head of the Regiment of Patricios, responded on behalf of all the criollo regiments. He compared the current international situation with that prevailing {{at the time of the}} mutiny of Álzaga over a year earlier, pointed out that Spain was now almost entirely under Napoleonic control and that the undefeated Spanish provinces were very small in comparison with the Americas. He rejected the claim of sovereignty of Cadiz over the Americas, and concluded that the local armies wanted to look after themselves, rather than following the fate of Spain. Finally, he pointed out that the Supreme Central Junta that appointed Cisneros as Viceroy <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed,</b> so he rejected Cisneros' legitimacy as Viceroy and denied him the protection of the troops under his command.|$|E
5|$|In 1908 Reading Central Goods {{railway station}} was {{opened on the}} Coley branch line {{diverting}} at Southcote Junction. During the first few decades of the 20th century, however, most of Southcote remained rural and undeveloped. An Ordnance Survey map of 1914 shows the majority of land as agricultural (farms and nurseries) {{with a number of}} gravel pits and smithies. The 1930s saw the construction of the Southcote Park Estate, a housing estate built on land inherited after the death of William Berkeley Monck of Coley Park. An Ordnance Survey map of 1938 shows greater provision for the population (as opposed to industry); some of the gravel pits <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed</b> and Presentation College, a boys' school, had opened in two large Victorian buildings—Rotherfield Grange and Oakland Hall, the latter a suburban villa built in the 1870s. By the advent of World War II, Southcote had begun to experience urban sprawl from Reading and the land bordering the Great Western Railway had begun to be used for housing. Following the war, Denton's Field on the Bath Road in Southcote was used for celebratory events; Battle of Britain commemorative fêtes were held in September 1949 and 1950, and featured a performance by three Alsatians—Rocky, Lindy and Irma—to recognise their work in the war. Denton's Field gained reputation as a location for outdoor community events, and was comparable to places such as Caversham Park and Palmer Park.|$|E

5|$|Remains {{of various}} extinct {{elephants}} were known by Europeans for centuries, but were generally interpreted, based on biblical accounts, as {{the remains of}} legendary creatures such as behemoths or giants. It was also theorised that they were remains of modern elephants that {{had been brought to}} Europe during the Roman Republic, for example the war elephants of Hannibal and Pyrrhus of Epirus, or animals that had wandered north. The first woolly mammoth remains studied by European scientists were examined by Hans Sloane in 1728 and consisted of fossilised teeth and tusks from Siberia. Sloane was the first to recognise that the remains belonged to elephants. Sloane turned to another biblical explanation for the presence of elephants in the Arctic, asserting that they had been buried during the Great Flood, and that Siberia had previously been tropical prior to a drastic climate change. Others interpreted Sloane's conclusion slightly differently, arguing the flood had carried elephants from the Tropics to the Arctic. Sloane's paper was based on travellers' descriptions and a few scattered bones collected in Siberia and Britain. He discussed {{the question of whether or}} not the remains were from elephants, but drew no conclusions. In 1738, the German zoologist Johann Philipp Breyne argued that mammoth fossils represented some kind of elephant. He could not explain why a tropical animal would be found in such a cold area as Siberia, and suggested that they might have been transported there by the Great Flood. In 1796, the French anatomist Georges Cuvier was the first to identify the woolly mammoth remains not as modern elephants transported to the Arctic, but as an entirely new species. He argued this species had gone extinct and <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed,</b> a concept that was not widely accepted at the time.|$|E
5|$|There {{are further}} {{multiple}} problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street {{could not have}} been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4–14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>existed.</b> Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor, but were paupers who occasionally lived in workhouses. Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy. The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook, who lived {{on the other side of}} Central London. Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed. Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak. Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890. Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury, nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons, and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he drown in the Thames. He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van. The forensic evidence indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved, and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered. Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage. Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street, and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales. Anderson was in Switzerland at the time of the double murder, and so was not one of the perpetrators.|$|E
