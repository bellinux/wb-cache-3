The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent <b>noise,</b> <b>data</b> loss, impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E

A key issue was {{the refusal of}} RES to release the background <b>noise</b> <b>data</b> to Mr Hulme, to allow independent analysis. Although he criticised the approach taken by RES, Justice Mitting refused to overturn {{the result of the}} inquiry, since the planning inspector had not made a legal error in coming to his decision. In May, RES released the <b>noise</b> <b>data,</b> and errors were subsequently discovered by DBJRG, although RES denied that they were significant. DBJRG then took their case to the Court of Appeal, and permission to appeal was granted in June 2008. To avoid the need for another court hearing a consent order was agreed between DBJRG and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (the defendant in the case), which had the effect of overturning the planning inquiry, and returning the matter to the Planning Inspectorate.|$|E

50|$|A new {{approach}} to seismic noise studies will be introduced with the EarthScope project, in {{that there are no}} attempts to screen the continuous waveforms to eliminate body and surface waves from the naturally occurring earthquakes. Earthquake signals are not generally included in the processing of <b>noise</b> <b>data,</b> because they are generally low probability occurrences, even at low power levels. The two objectives behind the collection of the seismic <b>noise</b> <b>data</b> are to provide and document a standard method to calculate ambient seismic background noise, and to characterize the variation of ambient background seismic noise levels across the United States as a function of geography, season, and time of day. The new statistical approach will provide the ability to compute probability density functions (PDFs) to evaluate the full range of noise at a given seismic station, allowing the estimation of noise levels over a broad range of frequencies from 0.01-16 Hz (100-0.0625s period). With the use of this new method it will be much easier to compare seismic noise characteristics between different networks in different regions.|$|E

Various algorithms, most of them based on density func-tions approaches, have been developed lately.

The basic idea of the approach is to extend the information carried by an ant with an information concerning the density of data in its neighborhood. Experiments on some syn-thetic test data suggest that this approach could ensure the separation of <b>noise</b> from <b>data</b> without significantly increasing the algorithm’s complexity. ...|$|R

50|$|Possible {{applications}} of the efficient coding hypothesis include cochlear implant design.

The implants are considered to be successful and efficient and the only ones in use currently. Using frequency-place mappings in the efficient coding algorithm may benefit in the use of cochlear implants in the future. Changes in design based on this hypothesis could increase speech intelligibility in hearing impaired patients. Research using vocoded speech processed by different filters showed that humans had greater accuracy in deciphering the speech when it was processed using an efficient-code filter as opposed to a cochleotropic filter or a linear filter. This shows that efficient coding of <b>noise</b> <b>data</b> offered perceptual benefits and provided the listeners with more information.

The approach of sample-moment-based density approximant {{is an extension of}} the approach of moment-based density approximant, which is mathematically equivalent to traditional orthogonal polynomials ap- proaches to the probability density function (Provost, 2005).

Consequently, a density function can be reasonably approximated by its sample-moment-based density approximant.
