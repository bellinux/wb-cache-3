5|$|Gliese 876 has {{a notable}} orbital arrangement. It {{is the first}} {{planetary}} system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination of the planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced {{the value of the}} mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> significant improvements relative to coplanar solutions.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known botanical {{collection of}} B.verticillata {{was made by}} Scottish surgeon and naturalist Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791.

5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites have shown the males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|Another known form {{of solid}} {{tetravalent}} americium chloride is KAmF5. Tetravalent americium {{has also been}} observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum {{which is similar to}} that of AmF4 but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90°C did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.|$|E

The office of the United States High Commissioner was abolished and Conant became instead the first United States Ambassador to West Germany. His role was now to encourage West Germany to build up its forces, while reassuring the Germans that doing so would <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a United States withdrawal. Being fluent in German, Conant {{was able to give}} speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Brandenburg-Prussia {{tried to}} acquire Crab Island in 1687, but {{the island was}} claimed also by Denmark, England and Spain, and when a second {{expedition}} in 1692 found the island in Danish hands, the plan was abandoned. 1689, Brandenburg-Prussia annexed Peter Island, but the small rock proved ineligible for trade or settlement. In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by England, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with England did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia {{tried to get a}} hold of Tortola, but England denied them settlement. Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> any charges. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the antivenom.|$|E
5|$|In the Treaty of Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} to cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a reversal of the costly earlier peace. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E

5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy Viaticum for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E
5|$|Instead, he practised a {{different}} style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does <b>not</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.|$|E
5|$|Kronprinz saw limited duty {{during the}} Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871.
