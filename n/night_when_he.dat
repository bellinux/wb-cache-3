5|$|Peter Emmerson, a {{historian}} and {{supporter of the}} desertion theory, asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment. JP Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises {{that it would not}} be out of the ordinary for the major to do so again. In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too. Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach a standing position by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the <b>night,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E

25|$|In 233, someone {{reported}} to the imperial court that Cao Gun had violated a curfew by walking on the streets at <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> visited Luoyang {{in the winter of}} 231. Cao Rui knew that Cao Gun had a reputation for his virtuous and good behaviour, so he wanted to overlook this transgression and issue only an official warning to Cao Gun. However, after some officials pressured him, Cao Rui decided to punish Cao Gun by removing two counties, with a total of 750 taxable households, from his princedom. Cao Gun felt so distressed and upset that he instructed his subordinates to be more mindful in the future. Cao Rui appreciated Cao Gun's expression of remorse, so he returned the two counties to Cao Gun in the following year.|$|E

In 1945 August the couple moved to the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis, in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Over {{the next three years}} Koestler would become a close friend of George Orwell. The region had its own intellectual circle, which would have been sympathetic to Koestler: Williams-Ellis' wife, Amabel, a niece of Lytton Strachey was also a former communist; other associates included Rupert Crawshay-Williams, Michael Polanyi, Storm Jameson and, most significantly, Bertrand Russell, who lived {{just a few miles from}} the Koestler cottage.|$|E
25|$|Lü Meng {{rejected}} the coins and gold, but Sun Quan {{insisted that he}} accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had Lü Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure Lü Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as Lü Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see Lü Meng but {{felt that it was}} too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe Lü Meng's room. He was happy when he saw Lü Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw that Lü Meng did not eat anything. When Lü Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit Lü Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase Lü Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, Lü Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by Lü Meng's death. Before Lü Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their priced possessions – including gifts from Sun Quan – in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral. Sun Quan felt even more sad when found out that Lü Meng had made such arrangements before his death.|$|E

Country music star Tim McGraw, son of Phillies {{reliever}} Tug McGraw, spread his father's ashes on the pitching mound of Citizens Bank Park, prior to the game's start. The Phillies scored {{in the bottom of the}} first inning after Jimmy Rollins led off with a single and eventually scored when Chase Utley grounded out. In the next half inning, Tampa Bay's Carl Crawford doubled, stole third base and scored on a Gabe Gross sacrifice fly to center field. Carlos Ruiz gave the Phillies their second lead of the <b>night</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> hit a solo home run in the bottom of the second inning. Starting pitchers Matt Garza and Jamie Moyer pitched six and 6⅓ innings respectively. The 2–1 score remained unchanged until the sixth inning when Chase Utley and Ryan Howard hit the 14th back-to-back home runs in World Series history. Crawford scored his second run of the game in the top of the seventh inning when he was batted in by Gross again. Dioner Navarro continued the rally by scoring on a Jason Bartlett ground out—bringing the score to 4–3. In the top of the eighth inning, B.J. Upton led off with a single, stole second and third, and scored on a throwing error to tie the game. Eric Bruntlett was hit by a pitch leading off the bottom of the ninth, moved to second on a wild pitch and to third on a throwing error. Tampa Bay intentionally walked the next two batters to load the bases, creating a force play at the plate. They then brought the infield in (including right fielder Ben Zobrist who was brought in to be a fifth infielder) hoping to convert any groundball into a force out at home and preventing the game winning run. However, Bruntlett scored the winning run on Ruiz's 45-foot infield single, the first walk-off infield single in World Series history, giving the Phillies a 2–1 lead in the series.|$|E
