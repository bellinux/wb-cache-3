This enthusiasm resulted from the obviously favourable characteristics of the area for power development - good rainfall, cheap storage sites and favourable topography for developing suitable "drops" for power development. Furthermore, these resources were all located in relatively accessible areas.

50|$|More than 95% of Quebec's {{territory}} {{lies within}} the Canadian Shield. It is generally a quite flat and exposed mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points {{such as the}} Laurentian Mountains in southern Quebec, the Otish Mountains in central Quebec and the Torngat Mountains near Ungava Bay. The topography of the Shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages, which explains the glacial deposits of boulders, gravel and sand, and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay {{in parts of the}} Shield. The Canadian Shield also has a complex hydrological network of perhaps a million lakes, bogs, streams and rivers. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>resources</b> that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy.

40|$|Generally, we hear such {{questions}} as "what is the magnitude of our oil sardine or mackerel resources?" "Can we get more catch from these resources?" It is, therefore, proper that we carefully examine {{what is meant by}} a fishery resource e. g., oil sardine or mackerel resource. A fishery resource is just like any other natural resource (e. g., mineral <b>resource,</b> <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>resource</b> etc.) which is exploited by man. But at the same time, it differs considerably to character from other types like mineral resources. The coal resource in a region is limited in magnitude, even though sometimes we do not know the magnitude. From this fixed resource we can exploit at any desired rate. The resource will be completely exhausted after a period of time depending on the rate of exploitation. In this sense a mineral resource can be described as a non-renewable natural resource which is liable to get exhausted after some period of time. It is also a static resource because we always know how much of the resource remains, once we know how much has been removed. A fishery resource is very much different in character. It is a self-regulating renewable natural resource. Consider a fish population occupying a certain area of the sea. Now when a certain portion of the population is removed, the remaining portion in the habitat gets better food, more area to move about, and this results in faster growth rate, lesser mortality rates and also the spawns get better chance of survival- The result is that the resource resuscitates itself quickly. Apart from fishing, the population is also affected by many other fishery-independent environmental factors such as available food supply, change in salinity, temperature of the water, change in ocean-currents etc. Thus the fishery resource is a dynamic resource, ever changing due to impact of fishing and other fishery-independent factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} power industry {{is facing the}} prospect of integrating a significant addition of variable generation technologies {{in the next several}} decades, primarily from wind and solar facilities. Overall, transmission and generation reserve levels are decreasing and power system infrastructure in general is aging. To maintain grid reliability modernization and expansion of the power system as well as more optimized use of existing resources will be required. Conventional and pumped storage hydroelectric facilities can provide an increasingly significant contribution to power system reliability by providing energy, capacity and other ancillary services. However, the potential role of hydroelectric power will be affected by another transition that the industry currently experiences - the evolution and expansion of electricity markets. This evolution to market-based acquisition of generation resources and grid management is taking place in a heterogeneous manner. Some North American regions are moving toward full-featured markets while other regions operate without formal markets. Yet other U. S. regions are partially evolved. This report examines the current structure of electric industry acquisition of energy and ancillary services in different regions organized along different structures, reports on the current role of hydroelectric facilities in various regions, and attempts to identify features of market and scheduling areas that either promote or thwart the increased role that hydroelectric power can play in the future. This report {{is part of a larger}} effort led by the Electric Power Research Institute with purpose of examining the potential for hydroelectric facilities to play a greater role in balancing the grid in an era of greater penetration of variable renewable energy technologies. Other topics that will be addressed in this larger effort include industry case studies of specific conventional and hydro-electric facilities, systemic operating constraints on <b>hydro-electric</b> <b>resources,</b> and production cost simulations aimed at quantifying the increased role of hydro...|$|R

40|$|Woodland caribou inhabit most of Northeastern British Columbia. They live {{across a}} variety of climatic and {{geographic}} gradients and in areas with as many as seven other ungulate species and seven predatory species. This apparent variability in habitat use may suggest that caribou in the Northeast are wide ranging and ecologically plastic. Conversely, caribou in Northeastern B. C. may live in discrete groups that have adapted to local conditions. There are few published data of woodland caribou in Northeastern B. C. Information is lacking on the number of caribou, their seasonal movements, their habitat requirements, and their interactions with other species. Logging, seismic activity, pipeline construction, oil and <b>natural</b> gas drilling, <b>hydro-electric</b> dams, and prescribed burning have all impacted habitat in previously undeveloped areas. The manner and rate at which these activities are changing habitats far exceeds our growth in knowledge of caribou ecology. Given this combination of few data and rapid habitat alteration, resource managers cannot know the impact of these habitat changes. We believe that this jeopardises the conservation of viable caribou populations...|$|R
40|$|For {{years the}} Treasure Valley has enjoyed {{relatively}} cheap energy {{due to its}} ample <b>Hydro-electric</b> and geothermal <b>resources,</b> but as the population continues to grow and businesses continue to expand, more electric power {{will be required to}} sustain growth. Energy within this region is not limitless and new energy sources will not be cheap. Electric power needed to meet the rising demand of the Treasure Valley will be difficult to achieve. Our objective is to research how the Treasure Valley can cope with the rising demand for energy. We will first determine new energy resources available to the valley. We will also investigate which energy firms have already begun to invest in the Treasure Valley, and what impact their investments could have on the future of firm growth. Our research will focus on the following factors: • The amount of energy currently available • Prospective energy sources • How limitations on current energy, and barriers for new energy, affect new firms entering the treasure valley market. We expect to find that like many growing cities throughout our nation, the Treasure Valley will soon reach a limit on how much it can sustain due to a restriction in available energy. We also expect to find that this problem will occur soon, requiring us to invest in new and existing energy firms, allowing them to increase their capacity to meet the growing demand...|$|R
40|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} {{fruitful}} applications of financial and economic cost-benefit analysis has been in electricity systems planning. Because of the capital intensive nature of the production technology and the possibilities of substitution between capital and fuel, the potential for savings through correct choice of timing, technology and scale are immense. This particular project is unique because these decisions involve two political jurisdictions, India and Bhutan. Furthermore, the value of Bhutan’s unique <b>natural</b> <b>resources,</b> its <b>hydro-electric</b> sites, is entirely determined by their potential to save India’s scarce economic resources, both capital and fuel. The 336 MW Chukha hydro-electricity project was built by India on a turnkey basis, with India providing 60 % of the capital in a grant and 40 % in a loan at highly concessional terms and conditions. In the arrangement, India receives in turn all the electricity generated from the project in excess of Bhutan’s demand at much cheaper prices than India’s generation cost from alternative sources. The analysis, therefore involves an ex ante financial and economic evaluation of the project from viewpoint of Bhutan and India, taking into consideration the project’s terms and conditions, the alternative cost of power generation for India, and the engineering risks and environmental costs. The project is considered beneficial to both Bhutan and India, although its terms and conditions are not inflation-proof. international trade, electricity, Bhutan...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{industrial}} developments of Europe and North America {{in the nineteenth}} century, coal has been considered {{as the most important}} mineral wealth a country could possess. Coal was often referred to as King Coal, and it was not until around 1950 that its position as the major fuel for modern society was seriously threatened by oil, <b>natural</b> gas and <b>hydro-electric</b> power. Particularly on the North American continent the question is now raised: what will be the future of coal, and which part will it play in the ever increasing energy consumptions of modern civilization? A survey made in Canada by the Dominion Coal Board in 1953 on the future energy requirements of the country revealed some pertinent facts regarding the role that coal would play in this. After a careful evaluation of the future supply of oil, natural gas and hydro-power, it became apparent that the present coal consumption of 37, 500, 000 tons annually will be maintained until 1965, after which a substantial increase to 58, 000, 000 tons will be necessary to meet the energy demands. This conclusion, it should be pointed out, was arrived at {{on the basis of a}} population increase to 16, 500, 000 by 1965, an no net additions to the overall energy supply from atomic sources in that period (O’Brian, 1953). From this it may be seen that coal, although not the sole important fuel anymore, is still one of our major sources of energy, apart from being a large supplier of numerous organic compounds. Coal is a complex substance, both in its chemical and physical composition. Although coal may truly be defined as a rock, it is a most unusual one, because it does not consist of minerals, but of a petrified mass of vegetable matter, which has been modified chemically and physically in varying degrees. This mass consists of an agglomeration of all sorts of plant components, ranging from a simple cell to such highly modified forms as cuticles, spores and pollen grains. The proportion in which these components are present, -as well as their degree of metamorphism controls the chemical and physical properties of coal. Added to this, a greatly varying amount of inorganic matter is present which immediately affects the value of coal as a solid fuel...|$|R
