5|$|Unlike {{most other}} toll highways, Highway 407 {{features}} no toll booths. Rather, {{a system of}} cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection. It {{is one of the}} earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road tolling. Highway407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to surface streets. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSlip {{mechanism}} and plate theory were utilized {{to the investigation}} of computing formulas of five <b>plate</b> <b>numbers.</b> Column <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> and peak <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> were two different concepts. Peak <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> was a new concept which came from slip mechanism. A good relation existed between the peak <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> and the asymmetry of practical peak of chromatogram. Peak <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> could be regarded as an asymmetry index of chromatogram peak, as column <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> is regarded as an efficiency index of column. The plate in slip mechanism was mobile, which {{was different from the}} fixed plate in plate theory. The five <b>plate</b> <b>numbers</b> were four kinds of column <b>plate</b> <b>numbers</b> and one kind of peak <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> (q’); the four column <b>plate</b> <b>numbers</b> were theoretical <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> (n 0), real <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> (n), plate-model <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> (q 0) and slip-mechanism <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> (q) ...|$|R
50|$|Eight {{types of}} licence plates {{are used in}} Pakistan. Each {{province}} and territory issues its own number plate; the federal government issues <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> for foreign diplomats and vehicles owned by the military, police and federal departments (red for foreign diplomats and green for the federal government.) Sindh's <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> are yellow with black letters and numbers for private vehicles and Black <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> with white letters for commercial vehicles; Islamabad, NWFP, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Balochistan and Northern Areas have white <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> with black letters and <b>numbers.</b> The <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> also have the province or territory's name at the bottom.

5|$|The {{crossing}} {{had always}} been tolled, and from 1 April 2003 this became a charge, though since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am. An automatic <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> recognition charging scheme (Dart Charge) began in November 2014. As a result, the charge {{can no longer be}} paid in cash and the old toll booths have been removed. A residents' scheme is available, offering further discounts for people living near the crossing.|$|E

McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{measures}} to minimise conflicts with similar <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> formats, {{a number of}} vehicles in Sabah will bear exactly the same number plates {{to a number of}} private vehicles registered in Singapore due to the complicated history of its plate's algorithm and arrangement of the characters. In Singapore, letter Z are allowed to use and different colours are issued such as OPC <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> (white on red background), whereas Z are reserved for military vehicles in Malaysia. With the allow the usage of letter Z for Singapore number plates (suffix F, N, Q, V and W not used on Singapore number plates), only cars in Singapore bears S and OPC scheme <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> which bears white on red background plates, it minimises the confusion of Sabah and Singapore number plates.|$|E
