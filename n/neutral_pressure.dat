The E-H mode transition dynamics and its characteristic transition time scale are investigated by observing the high-speed imaging (13 500 fps) {{as well as}} the temporal change of plasma loading impedance. The experimental results reveal that the E-H mode transition time is not fixed at any operating conditions rather it depends on some important parameters such as the rf driving power, <b>neutral</b> gas <b>pressure,</b> gas type. It is found that the E-H mode transition time depends on the unique parameter Eθ/p; the so-called effective induced electric field, rather than the independent parameter: the if power or <b>neutral</b> gas <b>pressure.</b> It is also found that longer E-H mode transition time is required to ignite the high-pressure Ar-N 2 plasmas with a 2. 5 %- 10 % N 2 seeding than that of pure Ar plasmas with the same operating conditions.

Calculations suggest that plasma at a density of 1 - 100 times the ion beam density and at a length {approx} 0. 1 - 1 m would be suitable for achieving {{a high level of}} charge neutralization.

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this {{dissertation}} is to explore the impact of neutral depletion and coupling between plasma and neutral gas in weakly ionized unmagnetized plasma. Since {{there have been few}} systematic studies of the mechanism which leads to non-uniform neutral distribution in processing plasmas, this work investigated the spatial profiles of neutral temperature and pressure experimentally, and the mechanism of resulting neutral depletion by simulation. The experimental work is comprised of neutral temperature measurements using high resolution atomic spectroscopy and molecular spectroscopy, and <b>neutral</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements considering thermal transpiration. When thermal transpiration effects are used to correct the gas pressure measurements, the total pressure remains constant regardless of the plasma condition. Since the neutral gas follows the ideal gas law, the neutral gas density profile is also obtained from the measured neutral gas temperature and the corrected pressure measurements. The results show that neutral gas temperature rises close to 900 K and the neutral gas density at the center of plasma chamber has a significant (factor of 2 - 4) decrease {{in the presence of a}} plasma discharge. In numerical work, neutral and ion transport phenomena were simulated by a hybrid-type direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method of one dimensional (1 D) electrostatic plasma to identify the mechanism of the neutral gas density depletion in Ar/N 2 mixtures. The simulation reveals that the neutral depletion is the result of the interplay between plasma and neutral gas, and a parametric study indicates that neutral depletion occurs mainly due to gas heating and pressure balance for the typical condition of plasma processing. In high density plasma sources where the plasma pressure becomes comparable to <b>neutral</b> <b>pressure,</b> total pressure (<b>neutral</b> <b>pressure</b> and plasma pressure) is conserved before and after the discharge. Therefore the <b>neutral</b> <b>pressure</b> is reduced due the balance of total pressure with plasma pressure (mainly electron pressure). Neutral gas heating is due to the elastic scattering and charge exchange collisions with ions, which are accelerated by the bulk plasma ambi-polar electrostatic field. The excellent agreement between experiment and simulation, and parametric study reveal that gas heating and pressure balance are the main mechanisms of gas depletion in an inductively coupled plasma. Coupling between plasma and neutral gas was observed by both experiment and simulation. The resulting gas depletion enhances the plasma transport to the surrounding wall, increases the particle loss, and decreases the plasma densit...|$|E
40|$|A {{low-energy}} {{ventilation system}} is often incorporated {{as one of}} the major energy saving measures in sustainable building design. These systems often employ a hybrid strategy in which mechanical equipment, governed by a computer controlled building management system, is used to assist or manage a naturally-driven airflow – the latter occurring due to the density difference between warm air inside and cooler air outside the room. Hybrid ventilation flows are poorly understood and the principal aim of the research was to enhance our understanding of the fluid mechanics through complementary theoretical and experimental modelling. The research begins by comparing solely natural and solely mechanical ventilation of a room. The hybrid ventilation of a room is then considered under the combined effect of naturally occurring and mechanically imposed pressure differences, in which a mechanical fan imposes a fixed airflow rate through one vent, thereby altering the natural pressure distribution. Simplified theoretical models, to describe the ventilation airflow rate through a room and the resulting mean air temperature, were developed for solely natural ventila- tion, solely mechanical ventilation and, finally, hybrid ventilation. At each stage the theoretical model was compared with results from small-scale experiments, and good agreement was demonstrated. From the theoretical investigation, the <b>neutral</b> <b>pressure</b> level emerged as a key pa- rameter in determining the characteristics of the ventilation airflow. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} airflow rate through an open vent can be controlled remotely by managing the position of the <b>neutral</b> <b>pressure</b> level, and that this can be achieved by varying the magnitude of the mechanically imposed airflow rate.
