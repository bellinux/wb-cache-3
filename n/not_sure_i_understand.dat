40|$|A major {{paradigm}} shift {{in mental health}} {{has led to the}} ascendance of the view that chronic psychopathology results from perturbed neural development. While most work in this area examines schizophrenia, the current report extends the paradigm to bipolar disorder (BD) in youth, thus demonstrating traction (<b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> what you mean here) in the developmental-psychobiology perspective. To study the role of amygdala dysfunction, we examined the neural mechanisms mediating face processing in 22 youth (mean age 14. 21 + 3. 11 years) with BD and 21 controls of comparable age, gender, and IQ. Event-related fMRI compared neural activation when attention was directed to emotional aspects of faces (hostility, subjects’ own fearfulness) vs. non-emotional aspects (nose width). Compared to controls, patients perceived greater hostility in neutral faces, and reported more fear when viewing them. Also, compared to controls, patients had greater activation in the left amygdala, accumbens, putamen, and ventral prefrontal cortex when rating face hostility, and greater activation in the left amygdala and bilateral accumbens when rating their own fear of the face. There were no between-group behavioral or neural differences in the non-emotional conditions. Results implicate deficient emotion-attention interactions in the pathophysiology of BD in youth, and suggest that developmental psychobiology approaches to chronic mental illness have broad applicability...|$|E

It is always possible, of course, that such ideals may be abused; they have frequently been deployed, in particular, as clubs used to beat down views and modes of behavior that are threatening or otherwise disliked. But they need not be abused. Their proven and potential value is quite extraordinary. They offer us standards which pay explicit respect to the principle that the criteria we use for evaluating ideas and modes of behavior should be nonethnocentric and nonidiosyncratic. They offer us standards that we can appeal to in luring ourselves or others to step outside of our relatively narrow present points of view here and now and toward a broader perspective that can serve us better tomorrow and elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePatients {{are often}} exposed to medical terms, such as anosognosia, myelodysplastic, or hepatojejunostomy, {{that can be}} semantically complex and hardly {{understandable}} by non-experts in medicine. Hence, {{it is important to}} assess which words are potentially non-understandable and require further explanations. The purpose of our work is to build specific lexicon in which the words are rated according to whether they are understandable or non-understandable. We propose to work with medical words in French such as provided by an international medical terminology. The terms are segmented in single words and then each word is manually processed by three annotators. The objective is to assign each word into one of the three categories: <b>I</b> can <b>understand,</b> <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>understand.</b> The annotators do not have medical training nor they present specific medical problems. They are supposed to represent an average patient. The inter-annotator agreement is then computed. The content of the categories is analyzed. Possible applications in which this lexicon can be helpful are proposed and discussed. The rated lexicon is freely available for the research purposes. It is accessible online at [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|As promised, Darwin {{included}} {{a statement about}} Matthew having anticipated [...] "precisely the same view {{on the origin of}} species" [...] in the third and subsequent editions of On the Origin of Species, referring to the correspondence, and quoting from a response by Matthew published in the Gardener's Chronicle. Darwin wrote that. Unfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew very briefly in scattered passages in an Appendix to a work on a different subject, so that it remained unnoticed until Mr. Matthew himself drew attention to it in the 'Gardener's Chronicle,' on April 7th, 1860. The differences of Mr. Matthew's view from mine are not of much importance: he seems to consider that the world was nearly depopulated at successive periods, and then re-stocked; and he gives, as an alternative, that new forms may be generated without the presence of any mould or germ of former aggregates. <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> some passages; but it seems that he attributes much influence to the direct action of the conditions of life. He clearly saw, however, the full force of the principle of natural selection. In answer to a letter of mine (published in Gard. Chron., April 13th), fully acknowledging that Mr. Matthew had anticipated me, he with generous candour wrote a letter (Gard. Chron. May 12th) containing the following passage:—"To me the conception of this law of Nature came intuitively as a self-evident fact, almost without an effort of concentrated thought. Mr. Darwin here seems to have more merit in the discovery than I have had; to me it did not appear a discovery. He seems to have worked it out by inductive reason, slowly and with due caution to have made his way synthetically from fact to fact onwards; while with me it was by a general glance at the scheme of Nature that I estimated this select production of species as an à priori recognisable fact—an axiom requiring only to be pointed out to be admitted by unprejudiced minds of sufficient grasp." ...|$|R

40|$|My {{first serious}} {{exposure}} to sequence stratigraphy {{was in a}} grad-uate seminar over 10 years ago. To be honest, it was pretty hard go-ing; I had to read papers many times over and often still was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>I</b> fully <b>understood</b> them. For one thing, the jargon of sequence stratigraphy is remarkably dense (despite its usefulness once basic concepts are grasped). Also, many papers that are now regarded as canonical because they clarify certain theoretical or practical issues had not yet appeared or had only recently been published and {{had not yet been}} digested by the broader stratigraphic community (to say nothing of a very green graduate student). Despite the familiarity of many of the concepts, the fundamental connections were difficult to grasp and weave into an integrated whole. Nevertheless, reading about and discussing these ideas was exciting because, as they came together, I felt like I was learning something genuinely new (at least to me). Since that time, sequence stratigraphy has become a funda-mental part of my research as a paleontologist–to a large degree be-cause I still find the challenge of using these ideas exciting. From my personal point of view, I see sequence stratigraphy as fun-damentally related to paleontology: after all, it aims to understand rock in a temporal framework just as paleontology aims to under-stand past life in a temporal framework. This connection, hinted at very early by Cisne and Rabe (1978), was largely overlooked except by taphonomists (e. g., Kidwell, 1984). However, as paleontologists have begun seeing past the veil of jargon, the relevance of sequence stratig-raphy has become increasingly evident (e. g., Patzkowsky and Hol...|$|R

C similarly shows part of the series (all divisible by 3) of 6, 9, 15, 21, 27, 30, 33, 39, 60, 63, 66, 69, 90, 93, 96. B shows the way in which most numbers divisible by 4 appear. D shows the form of the numbers 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 41, 42-49, 81-83, 85-87, 89, 101-103, 105-107, and 109. E shows that of 31, 33-35, 37-39. The other numbers are not clear, viz. 50, 51, 53-55, 57-59.

The groups of figures are not seen together, but one or other starts up as the number is thought of. The form has no background, and is always seen in front. No Arabic or other figures are seen with it. Experiments were made as to the time required to get these images well in the mental view, by reading to the lady a series of numbers as fast as she could visualise them. The first series consisted of twenty numbers of two figures each--thus, 17, 28, 13, 52, etc.; these were gone through on the first trial in 22 seconds, on the second in 16, and on the third in 26. The second series was more varied, containing numbers of one, two, and three figures--thus 121, 117, 345, 187, 13, 6, 25, etc., and these were gone through in three trials in 25, 25, and 22 seconds respectively, forming a general result of 23 seconds for twenty numbers, or 2-1/3 seconds per number. A noticeable feature in this case is the strict accordance of the scale of the image with the magnitude of the number, and the geometric regularity of the figures. Some that I drew, and sent for the lady to see, did not at all satisfy her eye as to their correctness.|$|R
