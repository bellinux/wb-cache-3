Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon {{received}} positive reviews, both in 1995 and in retrospective coverage. Though {{sales were}} <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> Sega expected, possibly {{due to the}} success of Sony's PlayStation console over the Saturn, they were substantial enough for Sega to allow the series to continue with the 1996 prequel Panzer Dragoon II Zwei, also released on the Saturn.|$|E

Despite the decrease in viewers, however, reviews for the season were of praise, rather than criticism.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach , higher than on Jupiter, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> those on Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 2001 season having gone 111 the {{previous}} season, {{ending with a}} 4120 victory in the 2001 Gator Bowl against Clemson. Fans' hopes for the new season were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> the previous year, however. Star quarterback Michael Vick was selected with the first pick in the 2001 NFL Draft, and there were questions about how well the team would cope {{with the loss of}} Vick and several other important players. Despite those fears, the Hokies began the 2001 season ranked No. 9 in the coaches' poll and were picked in the annual poll of media covering the Big East to finish second in that conference.|$|E

25|$|The band gained {{critical}} {{praise and}} the attention of major record labels {{after the release of}} their 1992 album , leading to a recording contract with Interscope Records. They experienced a surge of popularity with the release of the albums Scream, Dracula, Scream! (1995) and RFTC (1998), accompanied by numerous vinyl singles and EPs released on independent labels. However, album sales were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> expected and Interscope soon turned their attention to higher-grossing acts. The band left the label, and shortly thereafter drummer Atom Willard departed the group.|$|E

The average quality of the {{soldiers}} in the garrison was probably <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> Lovell and Duncan would have liked; the most militant had been drawn off for other fields, leaving the irresolute and the unfit. Because New Orleans was something of an international city, the ranks contained {{a greater proportion of}} foreign-born soldiers than most units of the Confederate Army. Nevertheless, they could be expected to perform their duty, even if they would not make extraordinary exertions.|$|E

25|$|The {{turn of the}} {{millennium}} introduced digital television to Australia, {{as well as the}} transition to widescreen standard-definition and high-definition television production. Community stations also began to receive permanent transmitter licences, replacing temporary licences that were renewed yearly. At this time it was thought that allowing Commercial Multicasting would be detrimental so the publicly owned networks (ABC and SBS) were the only networks that were allowed to create new digital SD Channels. This was only revised after Digital Television Uptake was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> expected in many areas, and from 1 January 2009, Network Ten, Nine and Seven were allowed to create alternative SD channels.|$|E
25|$|Highways, on {{the other}} hand, {{complement}} the national network of expressways and federal roads and built under the JKR R5 rural highway standard, with relatively high design speed limit (although <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> the expressway speed limit) of 100km/h, allowing the maximum speed limit of 90km/h. The highways are built with partial access control, and grade-spearated interchanges and at-grade crossings are both permitted. However, {{it is possible for}} a federal or state highway to be built with almost equivalent standard of an expressway with the exception of lower speed limit, for example the Federal Highway. Highways can be built either as dual-carriageway or two-lane single carriageway.|$|E
25|$|Townsville is characterised as a {{tropical}} savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw). Owing to a quirk of geographical location, Townsville's winter rainfall {{in particular is}} <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> elsewhere in the eastern coastal tropics of Queensland, such as Cairns. The winter months are dominated by southeast trade winds and mostly fine weather. Further north the coastline runs north/south and the trade winds are lifted to produce rainfall right through the year. Townsville, however, lies on a section of coastline that turns east/west, so the lifting effect is not present. As a result, winter months are dominated by blue skies, warm days and cool nights, although at times significant rainfall may occur.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants {{may find}} {{that they are a}} part of a lower {{socioeconomic}} status group in the United States than they were in their home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs. This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost of living is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> in the United States. Individuals who may have held professional occupations in their country of origin may find themselves in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States. When families migrate to the United States from a country with a patriarchal society, men in particular may experience a loss of status.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the overall}} {{standard}} {{of the competition}} was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> other years, nine championships records were improved at the event. Liliana Allen, formerly of Cuba, won the women's 100m gold in a record of 11.32seconds. Alberto Sánchez bettered the men's hammer throw mark, while María Eugenia Villamizar won her third straight women's hammer title with another championships record. Dana Cervantes and Alejandra García established a new record in the women's pole vault, a contest whose introduction brought the 43-event programme to near parity for the sexes (the men's steeplechase being the sole remaining difference). National records were also set in Lisbon: Lisette Rondón beat the Chilean 100m record, Sebastian Keitel's winning time of 10.10seconds was also a new Chilean mark, while 100m and 200m medalist Carlos Gats set Argentine records in both disciplines.|$|E
25|$|The Red Army was {{substantially}} motorized from 1939–1941 {{but lost}} most of its war equipment in Operation Barbarossa. These losses were temporarily remedied by forming masses of mounted infantry which were used as strike forces in the Battle of Moscow. Heavy casualties and a shortage of horses soon compelled the Soviets {{to reduce the number}} of cavalry divisions. As tank production and Allied supplies made up for the losses of 1941, the cavalry was merged with tank units, forming more effective strike groups. From 1943–1944, cavalry gradually became the mobile infantry component of the tank armies. By the end of the war, Soviet cavalry was reduced to its pre-war strength. The logistical role of horses in the Red Army was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> it was in the German Army due to Soviet domestic oil reserves and American truck supplies.|$|E
