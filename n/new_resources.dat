5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to <b>new</b> <b>resources</b> (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E

25|$|The second {{aspect of}} the Fermi paradox is the {{argument}} of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new habitats, it seems possible {{that at least some}} civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out <b>new</b> <b>resources</b> in space, and colonize their own star system and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe of other intelligent life after 13.8billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} the universe itself is quite incomplete.|$|E

25|$|Using these <b>new</b> <b>resources,</b> the Red Army of the 1930s {{developed}} a highly sophisticated concept of mobile warfare which relied on huge formations of tanks, aircraft, and airborne troops designed {{to break through}} the enemy's line and carry the battle deep to the enemy's rear. Soviet industry responded, supplying tanks, aircraft and other equipment in sufficient numbers to make such operations practical. To avoid overestimating the power of the Soviet army, although before 1941 Soviet formations of a given level were at least equal to and often stronger than equivalent formations of other armies, huge wartime losses and reorganisation based on war experience reversed the trend during the later war years. Thus, for example, the Soviet Tank Corps was equivalent in armored vehicle power to an American armored division, and a Soviet rifle (infantry) division, unless specifically reinforced, was often equivalent to an American infantry regiment.|$|E

25|$|When European colonials {{entered a}} region, they {{invariably}} brought <b>new</b> <b>resources</b> and capital management. Different investment strategies were employed, which included focuses on health, infrastructure, or education. All colonial investments have had persistent effects on postcolonial societies, but {{certain types of}} spending {{have proven to be}} more beneficial than others. French economist Elise Huillery conducted research to determine specifically what types of public spending were associated with high levels of current development. Her findings were twofold. First, Huillery observes that the nature of colonial investments can directly influence current levels of performance. Increased spending in education lead to higher school attendance; additional doctors and medical facilities decreased preventable illnesses in children; and a colonial focus on infrastructure translated into more modernized infrastructure today. Adding to this, Huillery also learned that early colonial investments instituted a pattern of continued spending that directly influenced {{the quality and quantity of}} public goods available today.|$|E

25|$|Rubber {{had long}} been the main export; {{production}} levels held up but its importance fell from 77% of exports (by value) to only 15%. <b>New</b> <b>resources</b> were opened, especially copper mining in Katanga province. The British-owned Union Miniere company dominated the copper industry; it used a direct rail line to the sea at Beira. The war caused a heavy demand for copper, production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,000 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operated at Lubumbashi; before the war copper was sold to Germany; the British purchased all the wartime output, with the revenues going to the Belgian government in exile. Diamond and gold mining expanded during the war. The British firm of Lever Bros. greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war, {{and there was an}} increased output of cocoa, rice and cotton.

25|$|Trafficking {{diverted}} {{an estimated}} one cent of each SNAP dollar ($330 million annually) from SNAP benefits between 2006 and 2008. Trafficking has declined over time from nearly 4 {{percent in the}} 1990s. About 8.2 percent of all stores trafficked from 2006 to 2008 compared to the 10.5 percent of SNAP authorized stores involved in trafficking in 2011. A variety of store characteristics and settings {{were related to the}} level of trafficking. Although large stores accounted for 87.3 percent of all SNAP redemptions, they only accounted for about 5.4 percent of trafficking redemptions. Trafficking was much less likely to occur among publicly owned than privately owned stores and was much less likely among stores in areas with less poverty rather than more. The total annual value of trafficked benefits increased at about the same rate as overall program growth. The current estimate of total SNAP dollars trafficked is higher than observed in the previous 2002–2005 time period. This increase is consistent, however, with the almost 37 percent growths in average annual SNAP benefits from the 2002–2005 study periods to the most recent one. The methodology used to generate these estimates has known limitations. However, given variable data and resources, it is the most practical approach available to FNS. Further improvements to SNAP trafficking estimates would require <b>new</b> <b>resources</b> to assess the prevalence of trafficking among a random sample of stores.|$|E
40|$|The Decision Aids for Tunneling (DAT) are a {{computer}} based method with which distributions of tunnel construction time and cost as well as required and produced resources can be estimated considering uncertainties in geologic conditions, construction processes and resources. The results of the DAT in turn {{can be used for}} various decision making processes. Although the DAT included a resource management model, this was not at the same level as the other parts of the method. Hence, the main objectives of this research are to define the requirements for an adequate and comprehensive resource model for tunneling and develop a <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> model satisfying these new requirements. There are three major developments and contributions of the <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> models: 1. In order to have complete and accurate cost and time estimation, the <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> model can explicitly estimate the cost and time based on the actual amount of resources used for and produced from tunnel construction. 2. Resource scheduling and planning features have been implemented into the <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> model. This allows one to determine the optimal tunneling plan, which takes into account the technical precedence of the tunneling activities, the resource/space availability, the dynamic status of the process, and the work continuity. In addition, this optimal tunneling plan also satisfies the requirements for the special characteristics of the tunnel construction process such as different construction methods, cyclic operation, distance requirements between the headings and preempting activities. Most importantly, the optimal tunneling plan obtained from the <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> model optimizes resource allocation and leads to the shortest construction time. 3. The <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> model enhances the ability to represent the resource handling activities considering the locations where they are actually performed; thus the construction time can be estimated more accurately. In addition, it improves the distance-based capability so that the construction time for the resource handling activities can be estimated based on the actual travel distances of these activities. The <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> model developed in this thesis provides a <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> management model for the DAT, which allows one not only to predict and obtain the distributions of the construction time and cost with associated uncertainties and resources but also allows one to manage and schedule tunnel construction in detail to complete the project within budget and schedule. Very importantly, the <b>new</b> <b>resource</b> model can enhance the practical applicability of the DAT to actual tunnel projects by providing the tunneling plan which can be practically used in the field to plan the construction process and resource allocation most effectively. by Sangyoon Min.
