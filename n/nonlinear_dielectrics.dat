In particular, the EMA estimates exhibit a nonlinearity-independent percolation threshold, and critical exponents that are consistent with recently developed bounds on these exponents.

The key element is a side-wall-passivating spacer structure (SWAPS) which is shaped for smooth crossline contacting and low parasitic capacitance. The SWAPS structure enables formation of junctions with dimensions at or below the lithography-limited linewidth. An additional benefit is avoiding the excessive use of amorphous dielectric materials which is favorable in sub-Kelvin microwave applications often plagued by <b>nonlinear</b> and lossy <b>dielectrics.</b> We apply the structure to niobium trilayer junctions, and provide characterization results yielding evidence on wafer-scale scalability, and critical current density tuning {{in the range of}} 0. 1 - 3. 0 kA/cm 2.

Further, the procedure is easily implemented, and leads in some cases to exact results. This, exact estimates are given herein for isotropic weakly nonlinear composites with general nonlinearity, and bounds of the Hashin-Shtrikman type are given for the class of two-phase, isotropic dielectric composites with strongly and perfectly non-linear constitutive behavior.

We have performed time-domain and frequency-domain experimental studies of simple waveguide structures and pursued a theoretical understanding of the propagation of signals on these nonlinear waveguides. To realistically assess the potential applications, we used a time-domain measurement and analysis technique developed during this project to perform a broadband electrodynamics characterization in terms of nonlinear, dispersive, and dissipative effects.

For the special case of an infinite one-dimensional dielectric rod, it is shown that, under relatively mild conditions on λ, solutions of the corresponding initial value problem for the electric induction field cannot exist globally in time in the L 2 sense if it is assumed that the electric field in the rod is perpendicular to the axis of the rod and varies with the coordinate along that axis. The results hold when the electromagnetic field in the rod has compact support. Growth estimates for solutions, which are valid on the maximal time-interval of existence are also derived; these are valid in the simple but physically important case where λ(D) = λ 1 + λ 0 ∥ D ∥ 2.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model, an effective algorithm and a self-consistent numerical analysis of the multifunctional properties of resonant scattering and generation of oscillations by nonlinear, cubically polarizable layered structures. The multifunctionality of such layered media is caused by the nonlinear mechanism between interacting oscillations—the incident oscillations (exciting the nonlinear layer from the upper and lower half-spaces) as well as the scattered and generated oscillations at the frequencies of excitation/ scattering and generation. The study of the resonance properties of scattering and generation of oscillations by a nonlinear structure with a controllable permittivity in dependence on the variation of the intensities of the components of the exciting wave package is of particular interest. In the present paper, we extend our former results, and furthermore we analyze the realizability of multifunctional properties of nonlinear electromagnetic objects with a controllable permittivity. The results of our investigations (i) demonstrate the possibility to control the scattering and generation properties of the nonlinear structure via the intensity of the incident field, (ii) indicate the possibility of increasing the multifunctionality of electronic devices, of designing frequency multipliers, and other electrodynamic devices containing <b>nonlinear</b> <b>dielectrics</b> with controllable permittivity...|$|E
40|$|Drastic cost {{reduction}} of phased-arrays {{will require a}} shift in design strategy. The emphasis must be on removing expensive active components, not developing more highly integrated components or exotic packaging techniques. The phase shifter circuit—an essential active component—is the primary obstacle in decreasing the cost and number of active components in a phased-array. The problem is multi-faceted: (1) current phase-shifter components are expensive MMICs (~ 40 % of a typical receive-array cost); (2) MMICs require careful packaging, further increasing costs; and (3) current phase shifters have significant RF loss and therefore additional amplification must be provided to compensate for this loss, which in turn may require limiting circuits (in a receive application in situations with strong local interference). If a phase shifter could be designed {{with little or no}} loss, it is believed that up to 80 % of the active devices in a typical phased-array could be deleted from the design. Two new technologies—thin-film <b>nonlinear</b> <b>dielectrics</b> and MEMS—have recently emerged and show significant promise for implementation of low-loss and low-cost phase shifters. Both technologies appear capable of ultimately providing < 3 dB insertion loss for a 360 degree phase shifter at considerably lower cost than existing MMIC designs. This paper wil...|$|E
40|$|Experimentalists have {{produced}} all-optical switches capable of 100 -fs responses. To adequately model such switches, nonlinear effects in optical materials (both instantaneous and dispersive) must be included. In principle, {{the behavior of}} electromagnetic fields in <b>nonlinear</b> <b>dielectrics</b> can be determined by solving Maxwell's equations subject to {{the assumption that the}} electric polarization has a nonlinear relation to the electric field. However, until our previous work, the resulting nonlinear Maxwell's equations have not been solved directly. Rather, approximations have been made that result in a class of generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equations (GNLSE) that solve only for the envelope of the optical pulses. In this paper, we present first-time calculations from the vector nonlinear Maxwell's equations of femtosecond soliton propagation and scattering, including carrier waves, in two-dimensional systems of dielectric waveguides exhibiting the Kerr and Raman quantum effects. We use the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method in an extension of our 1 -D work. There, in a fundamental innovation, we treated the linear and nonlinear convolutions for the electric polarization as new dependent variables. By differentiating these convolutions in the time domain, we derived an equivalent system of coupled, nonlinear second-order ODE's. These equations together with Maxwell's equations form the system that is solved to determine the electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous nonlinear dispersive media. Backstorage in time is limited to only that needed by the time-integration algorithm for the ODE's, rather than that needed to store the time-history of the kernel functions of the convolutions (1000 - 10, 000 time steps). Thus, a 2 -D nonlinear optics model from Maxwell's equations is now feasible...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the Maxwell’s {{equations}} for surface electromagnetic TM waves, propagating along the plane boundary between two <b>nonlinear</b> <b>dielectrics</b> with arbitrary diagonal tensor of dielectric permittivity, depending on |E|, can be integrated in quadratures. Surface electromagnetic waves, propagating along the boundary between two media with different optical properties were widely studied [1 - 7]. Nonetheless {{the integration of the}} corresponding equations presents difficulties because of their complicated nonlinear form. We will consider surface TM waves for the case of two dielectric media with the diagonal dielectric permittivity tensor εik = diag(εx, εy, εz), therewith εx, εy, εz are considered as arbitrary real functions of electric field strength E. Suppose the plane x = 0 to be that of separation and plane electromagnetic wave with frequency ω and wave vector k to propagate along z-axis. We will consider TM wave, assuming H = (0, H, 0); E = (Ex, 0, Ez). Putting ∂t = −v ∂z, where v = ω/k = β c is the wave velocity, we write the system of Maxwell’s equations in each medium: ∂x (εx Ex) + ∂z (εz Ez) = 0, (1) ∂x (H − β εx Ex) = 0, (2) ∂z Ex − ∂x Ez = β ∂z H. (3) Inasmuch at x = ± ∞ the field is supposed to vanish, from (2) we will find H = β εx Ex. (4) Assuming that ∂z = ik, Ex = iA, Ez = B, where A and B are real functions, from (1), (3) and (4) we deduce (εx A) ′ + k εz B = 0, (5) B ′ = k A(εx β 2 − 1), (6) where prime denotes differentiation with respect to x. Taking the functions εx(A 2 + B 2) and εz(A 2 + B 2) as given ones, we will admit that |E | 2 and εz can be expressed as some functions of εx, i. e. |E | 2 = A 2 + B 2 = I(εx), εz(|E | 2) = K(εx).

40|$|Diffusion {{effects on}} the {{stationary}} TE nonlinear surface waves and guided waves and the beam propagation characteristics at the interface separating two or more nonlinear diffusive Kerr-like media are studied extensively. The shape of the nonlinear surface and guided waves are computed for differing diffusion mechanisms and diffusion lengths. Stability of these waves is determined using the beam propagation method. The power and {{the shape of the}} nonlinear surface or guided waves are seen {{to be sensitive to the}} scaled diffusion length. However, many features including the stability criteria from the diffusionless case remain in the presence of the diffusion. An equivalent particle theory, describing the propagation of a self-focused light channel at the interface of two nonlinear dielectric media, is extended to include diffusion of the nonlinear excitation within each medium. The theory replaces the computationally intensive beam propagation problem by a much simpler Newtonian dynamical problem of studying the motion of an equivalent particle in an effective potential. This simpler Newtonian dynamical problem provides quantitative information on the asymptotes of the reflected, transmitted or trapped channels as well as the stability of the latter as a function of increasing diffusion length. The main results are that increased diffusion makes light transmission more difficult and tends to wash out the local equilibria of the equivalent potential representing unstable or stable TE nonlinear surface waves. The dynamics of two beams interacting at an interface separating two <b>nonlinear</b> <b>dielectrics</b> is studied. Using the two-soliton solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS) and performing a perturbation analysis, ordinary differential equations (ODE) approximation for the two beam interaction dynamics are derived. The numerical results of the ODE model are verified by comparison with numerical solutions of the governing full partial differential equation (PDE). This ODE model is reduced to a simple form to carry out a useful analysis for a special case where a single beam propagating as a trapped surface wave acts as a power controllable switch to direct a second beam incident at a finite angle to the interface. In this case the shape of the effective potential for the second beam is obtained and predicts the behavior of such a beam using the equivalent particle theory...|$|E

Understanding electromagnetic propagation of PD-induced pulses in shielded power cable, including attenuation and dispersion, {{is essential to}} the application of PD diagnostics and, especially, PD location. Dispersion is caused by the transition of cable semicon-ducting layers (between the cable conductors and dielectric) from 2 ̆ 2 resistive 2 ̆ 2 at low frequency to 2 ̆ 2 capacitive 2 ̆ 2 at high frequency. Methods are presented to compute dispersion as a function of semiconducting material properties and evaluate the effect of dispersion on pulse characteristics (amplitude, shape, and width, etc.) as a function of distance propagated, the results of which are applied to investigate the effects of dispersion for PD detection and location. The location error induced by dispersion can be compensated from calibration. ^ Electrochemical degradation of cable dielectrics, known as 2 ̆ 2 water treeing 2 ̆ 2, {{is one of the leading}} cause of premature failures in underground shielded power cable. Silane-based fluid has been used successfully for decades to rejuvenate HMWPE and XLPE dielectric cables to 2 ̆ 2 cure 2 ̆ 2 existing water trees and extend cable life. However the ability of the treatment to inhibit future water tree initiation is not known. A method for silane fluid treatment of un-aged cable insulation and semicon was developed based on the use of GC/MS to determine curing of the fluid within the dielectric. A wet electrical aging test at 5 kV/mm (127 V/mil) based on a sample which includes semicon electrodes on both sides of the XLPE insulation with a water electrode in contact with one semicon layer was used to age untreated samples, samples treated prior to the test, and samples treated at the mid-time of the test (3500 hrs). The result of aging is analyzed by microscopic examination to determine the number, length and types of water trees. The mechanism by which the silane-based fluid cures existing water trees and impedes the formation of future water trees is addressed. ^ To characterize polymeric capacitor film, a solid state, high voltage switch rated 8 kV with a turn-on time in the range of 100 ns and current capability from μA to kA was developed based on the use of two SCR 2 ̆ 7 s in series.
