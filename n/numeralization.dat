40|$|Abstract: Aiming at {{implementing}} <b>numeralization,</b> automatization and imaging of {{ultrasonic testing}} in rotary parts used in coal mine machinery, ultrasonic P-scan imaging technology of rotary parts is studied in this paper. Searching pixel units {{according to the}} incident direction of ultrasonic, and correcting non-isotropic resolution images to isotropic ones with linear interpolation algorithm to, multi-layer B-/C-/D-scan and 3 -D projection view imaging are achieved. Experimental results show P-scan image could accurately reflect the localization, quantification and orientation of flaws...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the project &# 39;&# 39;Computer-Aided Molecular Design of Pesticide&# 39;&# 39; running in LCC, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is presented. In this paper, the authors propose a structural frame model (SFM) method for <b>numeralization</b> of structural factors and report a user-friendly software named &# 39;&# 39;Computer-Aided Screening of Agricultural Chemicals&# 39; (CASAC) developed by LCC, including a prototype of structure-activity database (S-ADB) to support SAR/QSAR studies and computer-aided molecular design. Some typical case studies on herbicides, insecticides, and chemical hybridizing agents have been represented. The paper {{is focused on the}} SFM method for superimposing structural information and noteworthy functions of the CASAC system (version 1991) ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growing}} {{expansion}} of web services {{resources on the}} internet, more and more users come to appreciate the difficulty of searching self-gratification information from the mass information. This paper analyzes functional attributes and un-functional attributes of Web service resources, builds the mapping relationship between FQoS and QoS, and defines the index system structure of FQoS (Functional Quality of Service) and QoS (Quality of Service, also can be called non-functional attributes) based on the existing theories. It realizes QoS quantification of Web service resource by parameters <b>numeralization</b> and normalization, proposes a Web service description framework and selection mechanism towards balanced perceptions of FQoS and QoS, and then makes a theoretical foundation for Web service description, discovery and selection oriented equilibrium perception of FQoS and QoS...|$|E
