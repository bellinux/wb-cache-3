40|$|During {{a period}} of 11 1 / 2 months, 41 of 217 adult burn {{patients}} admitted to the U. S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center required endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy for management of the airway and/or ventilatory assistance. Permanent upper airway sequelae were recorded and related to presence of inhalation injury, duration of tube placement, cuff pressure, and pulmonary compliance. An "inhalation injury scoring system" based upon history, physical examination, bronchoscopic findings, and abnormalities at 133 xenon lung scan correlated well with postinjury alteration in compliance and subsequent sequelae. Significant inhalation injury was found in 35 patients. Seventeen of the study patients survived (Group I) and 24 patients expired (Group II). Group I patients were screened for permanent airway sequelae by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, xeroradiograms, and spirometry undertaken an average of 11 weeks after extubation or decannulation. Four patients developed tracheal stenosis and five patients had significant tracheal scar granuloma formation. Sequelae were generally more frequent and more severe after tracheostomy than after translaryngeal intubation, and duration of tube placement and presence of a tracheal stoma {{were the most important}} etiological factors in permanent damage. For initial respiratory support, we favor the use of translaryngeal (<b>nasotracheal)</b> <b>tubes</b> for periods up to 3 weeks.

40|$|Introduction: Blind {{nasotracheal}} intubation is an intubation method without observation of glottis {{that is used}} when the orotracheal intubation is difficult or impossible. One of the methods to minimize trauma to the nasal cavity is to soften the endotracheal tube through warming. Our aim {{in this study was}} to evaluate endotracheal intubation using endotracheal tubes softened by hot water at 50 °C and to compare the patients in terms of success rate and complications. Methods: 60 patients with ASA Class I and II scheduled to undergo elective jaw and mouth surgeries under general anesthesia were recruited. Results: success rate for Blind {{nasotracheal intubation}} in the control group was 70 % vs. 83. 3 % in the study group. Although the success rate in the study group was higher than the control group, this difference was not statistically significant. The most frequent position of <b>nasotracheal</b> intubation <b>tube</b> was tracheal followed by esophageal and anterior positions, respectively.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of sinusitis and middle ear effusions has frequently {{been attributed to}} the obstruction of the sinus ostia and/or eustachian tube. In {{the intensive care unit}} setting, edema caused by the irritation from nasogastric, <b>nasotracheal</b> and orotracheal <b>tubes</b> has been associated with this pathology and has been responsible for occult sepsis in this population. Our investigation was performed to determine the risk of chronic otitis media with effusion necessitating myringotomy with tympanostomy tubes among tracheotomized, ventilator dependent children in a consecutive series of children admitted to our recently created stable ventilator unit. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all tracheotomized, chronically ventilator dependent children P < 0. 01. We conclude chronic otitis media with effusion is a common finding among preschool-aged children who are tracheotomized and ventilator dependent. Routine periodic ENT evaluation may be indicated in all pediatric patients who require chronic mechanical ventilation. In this specific population of children, there may be a subset of patients who would benefit from prophylactic antibiotic therapy or tympanostomy tube insertion during the duration of positive pressure ventilation.

40|$|Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) is {{the most}} common nosocomial in-fection among patients requiring me-chanical ventilation. 1 The development of VAP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 1, 2 According to the National Nosocomial Infections Sur-veillance (NNIS) system report, the mean incidence of VAP in a medical in-tensive care unit (ICU) is 7. 3 episodes per 1000 ventilator-days, whereas the mean incidence in a surgical or trauma ICU reaches 13. 2 and 16. 2, respectively. 3 VAP occurs more than 48 hours fol-lowing intubation and the start of me-chanical ventilation. 4 Early-onset VAP typically occurs within 4 days of endotra-cheal intubation and is caused by antibiot-ic-sensitive pathogens, provided that no other risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens are present. 4, 5 Late-onset VAP occurs 5 or more days after mechanical ventilation is initiated and is usually asso-ciated with antibiotic-resistant pathogens. 4 Its pathogenesis involves bacterial colo-nization of the upper respiratory tract and subsequent aspiration. Risk factors for VAP can be classified as modifiable (eg, gastric residuals> 200 mL, achlorhydria, sinusitis, histamine 2 -antagonist use, dura-tion of mechanical ventilation> 2 days, supine position, use of antibiotics, frequent changes of ventilator circuit, reintubation, nasogastric <b>tube,</b> <b>nasotracheal</b> intubation, paralytic agents, continuous infusion of sedatives) or nonmodifiable (eg, age, male sex, coma, severity of illness, trauma, burns, preexisting pulmonary dis-ease, altered level of consciousness). 4, 6 Given the consequences of a VAP episode, implemen-tion of preventive measures is justified.

40|$|Background: Over {{the last}} years, {{we have used}} a flow-inflating bag circuit with a <b>nasotracheal</b> or nasopharyngeal <b>tube</b> as an {{interface}} to deliver effective CPAP support in infants (“Mapleson D CPAP system”). The primary goal {{of this study was to}} assess the usefulness of the “Mapleson D CPAP system” for weaning of mechanical ventilation (MV) in infants who received MV over 24 h. Materials and Methods: All infants who received MV for more than 24 h in the last year were enrolled in the study. Demographic data included age, gender, weight, and admission diagnosis. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were measured during MV, 2 h after the nasotracheal Mapleson D CPAP system and 2 h after extubation. Patients were classified into two groups: patients MV more than 48 h, and patients with MV fewer than 48 h. P < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 50 children were enrolled in the study, with a median age was 34 ± 45 months (range, 1 - 59 months) and median weight was 11. 98 ± 9. 31 kg (range, 1 - 48 kg). Median duration of MV was 480 h (range, 2 - 570). There were no significant differences in PaO 2, PaCO 2, and pH among MV, 2 h after the nasotracheal Mapleson D CPAP system and 2 h after extubation and spontaneous ventilation with the nasopharyngeal Mapleson D CPAP system or with nasal prongs. The overall extubation failure rate was 26 % (n = 13). Weight and age were significantly associated with extubation failure (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The Mapleson D CPAP system, in our opinion, is a useful and safe alternative to more complex and expensive noninvasive CPAP and BiPAP weaning from MV in infants...|$|R

30|$|The chief {{complaints}} {{of our patients}} were the asymmetry of nose and crooked shape of nose. Postoperative septal deviation after Le Fort I surgery would {{be attributed to the}} following causes. At first, if the septum was not resected similarly with a degree of impaction, it can cause a buckled, deviated septum by increased maxillary bony support if the surgeon needs to resect the inferior aspect of the septum or superior aspect of ANS when finishing maxillary superior impaction. However, reduction or recontouring of ANS is discouraged in patients with poor nasal tip projections or maxillary setback procedures [7]. Especially in oriental patients, most of the patients have weak nasal projection and it is not indicated to perform overzealous reduction of ANS. When the maxillary advancement is indicated, protruding ANS also can cause the bucking of the nasal cartilage. Second, the dissected periosteum and muscle adjacent to the nose were not replaced adequately. If these muscles were not brought back together in conjunction with the intraoral mucosal closure, the sides of the nostrils will flare outwards. The third reason is altered position or shape of the anterior nasal spine and postsurgical edema. However, there is not only intraoperative cause but also perioperative cause, it is usually {{due to the lack of}} clear vision of surgical field and restricted range of movement of the oro-cranial base during a Le Fort I osteotomy because of the nasotracheal intubation. This intubation method makes it difficult to estimate the amount of reduction in nasal septum and causes the nasal septum deviation [8, 9]. If the nasal septum is properly trimmed at operation, the deviation of the septum after the <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> removal should be uncommon. Another possible reason for septum deviation is dislocation of the quadrangular cartilage by a incomplete deflated cuff during extubation. Manual examination of the nose after extubation is important but often neglected. Visual inspection of the nose is important after repositioning of the maxilla before and after extubation to confirm the intact position of septum. If displacement of septum is detected after extubation and is generally due to <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> pressure, then limited manual manipulation in the recovery room would be available [10].|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} utility of {{nasotracheal}} tubes in postoperative oxygen supplementation in dogs following corrective surgery for brachycephalic syndrome. Design: Retrospective study 2003 – 2007. Setting: University teaching hospital. Animals: Thirty-six client-owned dogs that underwent corrective surgery for brachycephalic syndrome. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Medical records were reviewed for animals that underwent surgical interventions for brachycephalic syndrome including palatoplasty, ventriculectomy, and rhinoplasty. Data collected included signalment, presenting complaints, analgesic and surgical interventions, type of supplemental oxygen therapy, complications and mortality occurring during hospitalization. A <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> (NTT) was placed in 20 dogs {{at the end of}} surgery; 16 dogs received other forms of oxygen supplementation (8) or no oxygen supplementation (8) during recovery. The total number of postoperative complications was similar in both groups (8 / 20 dogs with NTTs and 7 / 16 in those without NTTs). However, respiratory distress was observed in 5 dogs without NTTs but was not observed in any dog while an NTT was in place. One dog in each group died postoperatively. Conclusion: Placement of an NTT was found to be easy and may offer benefit in dogs with brachycephalic syndrome as a noninvasive means of delivering oxygen.

The infection was caused by Staphylococcus aureus in seven, Haemophilus influenzae in three, Branhamella catarrhalis in one and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one. Both H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis were isolated in another patient, and no organism {{was found in the}} remaining patient. In addition to the bacteria, viruses were cultured from the tracheal secretions of two patients. The mean duration of intubation was 7. 6 days and of hospital stay 9. 2 days. Twelve of the cases occurred during the cold months of the year (October to March). Of the three deaths only one occurred in the pediatric intensive care unit and was due to severe bronchospasm and an air leak that caused bilateral pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess whether}} Chula formula can predict the proper length of {{nasotracheal}} intubation. Material and Method: This was a prospective study of 100 patients (50 males and 50 females) who underwent general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation (number 8. 0 for male and 7. 0 for female) between December 2005 and March 2007. The Chula formula {{was used to}} calculate the length of endotracheal tube (ETT) at the right external naris = 9 + (body height/ 10) cm. After intubation, a fiberoptic bronchoscope was inserted into the ETT to measure the distance from the tip of ETT to the carina and the distance from the upper border of the cuff of ETT to the vocal cords. Results: The mean length of <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> at the right external naris calculated by Chula formula was 25. 4 cm in males and 24. 4 cm in females. The mean distance from the tip of ETT to the carina was 3. 9 cm in males and 3. 1 cm in females. The mean distance from the upper border of the cuff of ETT to the vocal cords was 2. 6 cm in males and 3. 0 cm in females. Ninety-three patients with upper border of the cuff of ETT had it placed at least 2 cm below the vocal cords, and in seven patients, the distance from the tip of ETT to the carina was found to be 1 to 1. 9 cm. In every patient, {{it was found that the}} tip of ETT was placed at least 2 cm cephalad to the carina. Conclusion: In the present study, the Chula formula could be used to predict the proper length of nasotracheal intubation in 93 of 100 patients...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Existing {{guidelines}} for optimal positioning of endotracheal tubes in neonates {{are based on}} scanty data and relate to measurements that are either non-linear or poorly reproducible in sick infants. Foot length can be measured simply and rapidly and is related {{to a number of}} external body measurements.  OBJECTIVES—To evaluate the relation of foot length to nasotracheal length in direct measurements at post mortem examinations, and then compare its clinical relevance with traditional weight based estimates in a randomised controlled trial.  METHODS—The dimensions of the upper airway were measured at autopsy in 39 infants with median (range) postmenstrual age and birth weight of 32 (24 - 43) weeks and 1630 (640 - 3530) g. The regression equations with 95 % prediction intervals were calculated to estimate the optimal nasotracheal length from foot length. In a randomised trial, 59 neonates were nasally intubated according to foot length and body weight based estimates to assess the achievement of "optimal" and "satisfactory" tube placements.  RESULTS—In the direct measurements of the airway at autopsy, foot length was a better predictor of nasotracheal distances (r 2 = 0. 79) than body weight, gestational age, and head circumference (r 2 = 0. 67, 0. 58, and 0. 60 respectively). Measurement of foot length was easy and highly reproducible. In the randomised controlled trial, {{there were no significant differences}} between the foot length and body weight based estimates in the rates of optimal (44 % v 56 %) and satisfactory (83 % v 72 %) endotracheal tube placements.  CONCLUSIONS—Foot length is a reliable and reproducible predictor of <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>tube</b> length and is at least as accurate as the conventional weight based estimation. This method may be particularly valuable in sick unstable infants. ...|$|E

The ponies were mechanically ventilated and randomly allocated to receive IV treatment M [morphine 0. 15 mgkg(- 1) (T 10 -T 15) followed by a CRI (0. 1 mgkg(- 1) hour(- 1)) ] or treatment DM [dexmedetomidine 3. 5 mu gkg(- 1) plus morphine 0. 15 mgkg(- 1) (T 10 -T 15) followed by a CRI of dexmedetomidine 1. 75 mu gkg(- 1) hour(- 1) and morphine 0. 1 mgkg(- 1) hour(- 1) ]. At T 60, a stepwise MAC(NM) determination was initiated using constant current electrical stimuli at the skin of the lateral pastern region. Triplicate MAC(NM) estimations were obtained and then averaged in each pony. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to detect differences in MAC between treatments (alpha= 0. 05). Results : Sevoflurane-morphine MAC(NM) values (median (range) and mean +/- SD) were 2. 56 (2. 01 - 4. 07) and 2. 79 +/- 0. 73 %.

40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} the effects of premedication with thiopental on heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation during semi-elective nasotracheal intubation in neonates.  METHODS—A randomised, placebo controlled, non-blinded study design was used to study 30 neonates (mean birthweight 3. 27 kg) requiring semi-elective nasotracheal intubation. The babies were randomly allocated to receive either 6 mg/kg of thiopental (study group) or an equivalent volume of physiological saline (control group) one minute {{before the start of the}} procedure. Six infants were intubated primarily and 24 were changed from orotracheal to a <b>nasotracheal</b> <b>tube.</b> The electrocardiogram, arterial pressure wave, and transcutaneous oxygen saturation were recorded continuously 10 minutes before, during, and 20 minutes after intubation. Minute by minute measurements of heart rate, heart rate variability, mean blood pressure (MBP) and transcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO 2) were computed. The differences for all of these between the baseline measurements and those made during and after intubation were determined. Differences in the measurements made in the study and the control groups were compared using Student's t test.  RESULTS—During intubation, heart rate increased to a greater degree (12. 0 vs− 0. 5 beats per minute, p < 0. 03) and MBP increased to a lesser degree (− 2. 9 vs 4. 4 mm Hg; p < 0. 002) in the infants who were premedicated with thiopental. After intubation only the changes in MBP differed significantly between the two groups (− 3. 8 vs 4. 6 mm Hg; p < 0. 001). There were no significant changes in the oxygen saturation between the two groups during or after intubation. The time taken for intubation was significantly shorter in the study group (p < 0. 04).  CONCLUSIONS—The heart rate and blood pressure of infants who are premedicated with thiopental are maintained nearer to baseline values than those of similar infants who receive no premedication. Whether this lessening of the acute drop in the heart rate and increase in blood pressure typically seen during intubation of unmedicated infants is associated with long term advantages to the infants remains to be determined. ...|$|E
40|$|Twin nasal cannula for {{administration}} of continuous positive airway pressure to newborn infants Endotracheal intubation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) {{has been used}} successfully in infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (Gregory et al., 1971; De Lemos et al., 1972). The beneficial effects of CPAP are reflected {{by an increase in}} arterial 02 tension, a decrease in right to left shunt, and a reduction in the overall mortality (Gregory et al., 1971). The most frequent complications of this treatment are related to the prolonged endotracheal intubation (De Lemos et al., 1972). To prevent these complications, new methods have recently been proposed that make use of different devices such as a face mask (Harris, 1972; Shannon et al., 1972), a head box (Gregory et al., 1971), or a plastic bag around the head (Barrie, 1972). All these devices, however, have some drawbacks. High flows of inspired gas are usually needed {{in order to maintain the}} desired pressure in spite of leaks and this creates problems of thermoregulation and noise level. Furthermore, the access to the baby's face for suctioning or feeding is often limited. During the past 2 years we have used with good results a twin nasal cannula for delivering CPAP to newborn infants with RDS (Agostino et al., 1973). Different kinds of cannula have been tried and from the experience gained a final prototype has been designed which is presently used in our unit and is described here.
