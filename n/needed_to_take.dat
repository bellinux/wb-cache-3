5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{following}} year, Japan also proceeded with its expansion plans. The Invasion of French Indochina on 22 September 1940 (which by then {{was controlled by}} the collaborating government of Vichy France), and Japan's ongoing bloody conflict with China, put a severe strain on American-Japanese relations. On 26 July 1940, the United States had passed the Export Control Act, cutting oil, iron and steel exports to Japan. This containment policy was Washington's warning to Japan that any further military expansion would result in further sanctions. However, such US moves were interpreted by Japan's militaristic leaders as signals that they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> radical measures to improve the Empire's situation, thereby driving Japan closer to Germany.|$|E

Accompanying him was a sergeant who had been a physical therapist in civilian life, and who would massage Middleton's knees twice a day for the next year.

5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 41,169 at Anfield, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the first leg when Kevin Keegan scored in the 21st minute. Another goal by Keegan in the first half, {{extended}} Liverpool's lead and a further goal by Larry Lloyd meant Liverpool won the first leg 3–0. Therefore, in the second leg at the Bökelbergstadion, Liverpool had to avoid losing by three clear goals to win the competition. A crowd of 34,905 watched Borussia take the lead in the 29th minute courtesy of a Jupp Heynckes goal, he scored again 11 minutes later to double Borussia's lead. Borussia were unable to find the third goal they <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the match into extra-time and won the second leg 2–0.

5|$|Abram Lincoln Harris, Jr. (January 17, 1899 – November 6, 1963) was an American economist, academic, {{anthropologist}} and {{a social}} critic {{of blacks in the}} United States. Considered by many as the first African American to achieve prominence in the field of economics, Harris was also known for his heavy influence on black radical and neo-conservative thought in the United States. As an economist, Harris is most famous for his 1931 collaboration with political scientist Sterling Spero to produce a study on African-American labor history titled The Black Worker and his 1936 work The Negro as Capitalist, in which he criticized black businessmen for not promoting interracial trade. He headed the economics department at Howard University from 1936 to 1945 and taught at the University of Chicago from then until his death. As a social critic, Harris took an active radical stance on racial relations by examining historical black involvement in the workplace, and suggested that African Americans <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> more action in race relations.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of network analysis <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place before network synthesis was possible. The theorems of Gustav Kirchhoff and {{others and the}} ideas of Charles Steinmetz (phasors) and Arthur Kennelly (complex impedance) laid the groundwork. The concept of a port also {{played a part in}} the {{development of}} the theory, and proved to be a more useful idea than network terminals. The first milestone on the way to network synthesis was an important paper by Ronald M. Foster (1924), A Reactance Theorem, in which Foster introduces the idea of a driving point impedance, that is, the impedance that is connected to the generator. The expression for this impedance determines the response of the filter and vice versa, and a realisation of the filter can be obtained by expansion of this expression. It is not possible to realise any arbitrary impedance expression as a network. Foster's reactance theorem stipulates necessary and sufficient conditions for realisability: that the reactance must be algebraically increasing with frequency and the poles and zeroes must alternate.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} early 2014, and {{prompted}} skepticism from both Square Enix staff and its prospective platform managers, {{who were more}} used to the dominant 2D-based mobile games. One of the problems cited by project leader Naoki Hamaguchi was creating realistic facial expressions equivalent to those used in the 2013 film Frozen. For development, the team used the Unity game engine. The development team built {{a relationship with the}} team at Unity Technologies very early in the development of Unity 5 and this allowed them to have their opinions included in the engine. Despite being dependent on the Unity 5 engine, the team also customised the game editor portion themselves. The team <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> differences between different phone models into account to allow high performance. To help with development and overcome potential difficulties handling the Unity engine, a special development environment and structure was created. The team used physically based rendering to create realistic lighting and environmental effects. The budget was far lower than graphically equivalent console titles, so the team were reluctant to buy in helping tools and had restrictions on staff numbers: one person was working on all the game's backgrounds, while three were in charge of character designs. Using experience from the development of Final Fantasy XIII, the team were able to create high-end graphics within mobile restrictions.|$|E

5|$|Massa {{was slow}} to {{accelerate}} leaving the turn six hairpin on lap 49, giving Alonso the opening he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the lead. Smedley was later heard apologising to Massa over the radio. De La Rosa made his one and only pit stop of the event for super-soft compound tyres on lap 51. Di Grassi, at turn one on the same lap, hit a kerb damaging his car's rear suspension, which meant {{it was not possible}} for him to continue competing in the race. He was pushed into his garage by his team to retire. Vettel placed pressure on Massa by setting consecutive fastest laps to reduce the time gap between them. Petrov was on course to score one point but was told by his team to shift early into seventh gear on lap 58 otherwise his maximum revolutions per minute would be changed to a lower setting. De La Rosa attempted to lap Kovalainen around the inside of the second corner on the 60th lap but the two cars made contact. De La Rosa sustained damage to a section of his front wing while Kovalainen drove to his garage and got out of his car to become the race's fifth (and final) retirement on lap 61.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of Path of Radiance {{was handled}} by Nintendo of America's localization branch Nintendo Treehouse. During the process, the team {{worked closely with}} Intelligent Systems staff members. The biggest challenge for the team was translating from Japanese to English, which required staff from Japan {{to come over and}} check their work. When translating the dialogue, the localization team wanted to preserve the story's depth and serious tone, despite often having a limited text and character space for interaction and expression. While they had the option to add extra text boxes, this would potentially have made going through conversations tedious for players, so they worked to match the number of text boxes used in the Japanese version. The western version's difficulty was also toned down: the Japanese version's Maniac setting was removed, Hard Mode was toned down, and a new Easy was introduced. These adjustments were based on both western test player feedback, and feedback from Japanese players complaining about the game's high difficulty. The amount of dialogue and text that needed translating was estimated at less than that in Animal Crossing, but still enough to take several months to complete. Due to its serious nature, the team <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a different approach to its localization than other Nintendo titles. As far as possible, the team remained faithful to the original script, aside from pieces like jokes which would not have made sense to people unfamiliar with Japanese humor. While {{most of the time they}} refrained from putting out-of-context remarks in character dialogue, an exception was Anna, a recurring Fire Emblem character who featured in optional tutorial missions. As she existed outside the game to a degree, they had more freedom to have her make pop culture references.|$|E
