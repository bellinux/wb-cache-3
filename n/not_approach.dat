5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E

Farmer suffered a black eye during the game, which was notable for its physicality. Messenger-Inquirer sportswriter Jake Jennings also noted that Farmer relied on drives to the basket to score, as opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three-point shots.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of ASV {{this was not a}} problem; {{aircraft}} would <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> a ship on the surface more closely than its altitude of perhaps a few thousand feet, so a longer pulse width was fine. But in the AI role, the minimum range was pre-defined by the pilot's eyesight, at 300m or less for night interception, which demanded sub-microsecond pulse widths. This proved very difficult to arrange, and ranges under 1,000feet were difficult to produce.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} this type of {{supernova}} {{is similar to that of}} novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> the Chandrasekhar limit. In the case of a nova, the in-falling matter causes a hydrogen fusion surface explosion that does not disrupt the star. This type of supernova differs from a core-collapse supernova, which is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers of a massive star as its core implodes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the army}} was summoned to {{assemble}} at York on 24 June, it did <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> Scotland until mid-August. This {{was due to the}} gradual arrival of army supplies (in some cases, with much delay — the King's own tents, for example, were not despatched from Westminster until halfway through July). Brown suggests that Henry was well aware of the delays these preparations would cause the campaign. At some point before the army left for Scotland, the muster was met by the Constable of England, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and the Earl Marshal, Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. Individual leaders of each retinue present were then paid a lump sum to later distribute in wages to their troops: Men-at-arms reived one shilling a day, archers half that, but captains and leaders do not apear to have been paid at a higher rate. The army left York on 25 July and reached Newcastle-upon-Tyne four days later; it was plagued by shortages of supplies, particularly food, of which more had had to be requested before even leaving York. As the campaign progressed, bad weather exacerbated the problem of food shortages, and Brown has speculated that this was an important consideration in the short duration of the expedition.|$|E

5|$|Most Jews, {{religious}} and secular, consider {{the wall to}} be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap. There are, however, some haredi Jews who hold different views. Most notable are the adherents of the Satmar hasidic dynasty who retain the views espoused by their Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who would <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> the Wall after the 1967 conquest because of his opposition to Zionism, although he did visit the site during his visits to the Holy Land in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|New {{research}} indicates that many white dwarfs—at least in certain types of galaxies—may <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> that limit by way of accretion. It has been postulated {{that at least some}} of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another. It may be that in elliptical galaxies such collisions are the major source of supernovae. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the X-rays produced by those galaxies are 30 to 50 times less than what is expected to be produced by type Ia supernovas of that galaxy as matter accretes on the white dwarf from its encircling companion. It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs. The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae, which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova, given that two colliding white dwarfs could have a range of masses. This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as standard candles in determining distances.|$|E

5|$|The 1933 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the second}} most active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} on record, with 20storms forming in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, breaking the record set by 1887. The season ran through the summer and {{the first half of}} fall in 1933, with activity as early as May and as late as November. A tropical cyclone was active for all but 13days from June 28 to October 7. The year was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones by the 2005 season, which broke the record with 28storms. Tropical cyclones that did <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> populated areas or shipping lanes, especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration, may have remained undetected. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. Compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation, one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The 1940 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a generally average period of tropical cyclogenesis in 1940. Though the season had no official bounds, most tropical cyclone activity occurred during August and September. Throughout the year, fourteen tropical cyclones formed, of which nine reached tropical storm intensity; six were hurricanes. None of the hurricanes reached major hurricane intensity. Tropical cyclones that did <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> populated areas or shipping lanes, {{especially if they}} were relatively weak and of short duration, may have remained undetected. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As {{a result of a}} reanalysis project which analyzed the season in 2012, an additional hurricane was added to HURDAT. The year's first tropical storm formed on May19 off the northern coast of Hispaniola. At the time, this was a rare occurrence, as only four other tropical disturbances were known to have formed prior during this period; since then, reanalysis of previous seasons has concluded that there were more than four tropical cyclones in May before 1940. The season's final system was a tropical disturbance situated in the Greater Antilles, which dissipated on November 8.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch fleet raided up the Thames in June 1667, but did <b>not</b> <b>approach</b> Gravesend Blockhouse due to {{the threat}} posed by its guns. The fort, under the command of Sir John Griffith, was in reality not well {{prepared}} for war. £400 was spent on upgrading the blockhouse, artillery was sent from the Tower of London to reinforce the local guns and four infantry companies were detached to guard the site. The risk of attack ended with the signing of the Peace of Breda that July, and the blockhouse did not see action. Shortly after the Dutch raids, Sir John was removed from his post for apparently demanding payments from ships passing by the blockhouse, a complaint which was repeated in later years under subsequent captains.|$|E
40|$|Aposematic prey {{are thought}} to move slowly and openly near predators, but exhibit reduced escape behaviour. We studied {{conspicuousness}} and escape by aposematic poison frogs (Dendrobates auratus and Oophaga pumilio). In circles of leaf litter, observers detected poison frogs quickly. Flight initiation distance (FID, predator-prey distance when escape begins) increases with approach speed in non-cryptic palatable prey, but not for frogs in clearings, which permitted close approach. On trails frogs moved slowly into forest and FID in D. auratus increased with approach speed. Distance from cover and handling exposing predators to distastefulness may account for greater reliance on aposematism in clearings. We observed responses to a simulated predator (stick with painted face) in three conditions: <b>not</b> <b>approached,</b> approached, and touched. Latency to hop and time to exit circles decreased and exit from circles was directed further away from the approach path in the order <b>not</b> <b>approached,</b> approached, touched. Oophaga pumilio changed directions less when approached than not; many exhibited no escape behaviour. Aposematic dendrobatids move slowly near predators, but retain risk-assessment mechanisms due to occasional predation. Differences in escape between dendrobatids and palatable Craugastor frogs suggest that dendrobatid defensive behavior may have been molded to maximize the effectiveness of aposematism...|$|R
