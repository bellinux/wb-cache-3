40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{presence}} of endemic cretinism in a small district located inside an endemic goiter area in north-eastern Sicily, personally described. The study covers 19 mental defectives (11 females and 8 males, mean age 35. 8 ± 15. 5 yr) {{selected on the basis}} of severe mental retardation recognized by the local doctors. No systematic survey for cretinism was carried out in the total population. Marked mental retardation was evident in all subjects. Nine of them exhibited clinical and biochemical signs of hypothyroidism (myxedematous cretins). The 10 others were clinically euthyroid and had deaf-mutism and/or pyramidal tract dysfunction (<b>neurological</b> <b>cretinism).</b> Familial aggregation of cretinism was also observed. In both myxedematous and neurological cretins the urinary iodine excretion was very low, but not significantly different from that recorded in the euthyroid controls of the same area. The data available do not clarify the pathogenesis of endemic cretinism in Sicily. However, the marked height retardation, the observation of delayed bone maturation and the severity of mental deficiency suggest that thyroid failure was present in early life. The presence of endemic cretinism today in Sicily constitutes a strong argument in favour of the immediate introduction of adequate iodine prophylaxis. © 1981, Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).

40|$|The major {{clinical}} and geographical dif-ferences, {{characteristic of the}} three distinct forms of endemic cretinism, {{are thought to be}} due to unique thyroid hormone imbal-ances. <b>Neurological</b> <b>cretinism</b> appears to reflect the negative impacts of severe foetal T 4 deficiency, particularly during the second trimester. The dwarfism and mental retarda-tion seen in Kaschin-Beck disease (grade III) may be caused by foetal and postnatal T 3 inadequacy; whilst myxoedematous cretin-ism seems due to concurrent T 4 and T 3 defi-ciencies, especially during late foetal devel-opment and infancy. Such thyroid hormone inadequacies can occur in a variety of ways, most commonly reflecting maternal diets deficient in iodine and/or selenium, which also may contain goitrogens and heavy metals. Excesses of iodine and possibly of selenium also appear capable of depressing both maternal and foetal thyroid hormone production. This hypothesis, if correct, requires a reevaluation of both iodine deficiency disor-der control programmes in areas of myxo-edematous cretinism and of the treatment of congenital hypothyroidism. In both cases, iodine prophylaxis alone, whether as salt, oil or as L-thyroxine, will not prevent subse-quent developmental deficits if T 3 deficiency is due to either selenium shortage or excess, or to a biochemical abnormality preventing the conversions of T 4 to T 3...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of thyroid hormones during brain {{development has been}} appreciated for many decades. In humans, low levels of circulating maternal thyroid hormones, e. g. caused by maternal hypothyroidism or lack of iodine in diet, results in {{a wide spectrum of}} severe neurological defects, including <b>neurological</b> <b>cretinism</b> characterized by profound neurologic impairment and mental retardation, underlining the {{importance of}} the maternal thyroid hormone contribution. In fact, iodine intake, which is essential for thyroid hormone production in the thyroid gland, has been related to the expansion of the brain, associated with the increased cognitive capacities during human evolution. Because thyroid hormones regulate transcriptional activity of target genes via their nuclear thyroid hormone receptors, even mild and transient changes in maternal thyroid hormone levels can directly affect and alter the gene expression profile, and thus disturb fetal brain development. Here we summarize how thyroid hormones may have influenced human brain evolution through the adaptation to new habitats, concomitant with changes in diet and, therefore, iodine intake. Further, we review the current picture we gained from experimental studies in rodents on the function of maternal thyroid hormones during developmental neurogenesis. We aim to evaluate the effects of maternal thyroid hormone deficiency as well as lack of thyroid hormone receptors and transporters on brain development and function, shedding light on the cellular behavior conducted by thyroid hormones...|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} thyroid hormone {{response}} elements (TREs) {{in the region}} upstream of the Sox2 promoter. This region {{is known as the}} enhancer region. Studies have suggested that thyroid hormone (T3) controls Sox2 expression via the enhancer region. The expression of TRα1 (thyroid hormone receptor) is increased in proliferating and migrating neural stem cells. It has therefore been suggested that transcriptional repression of Sox2, mediated by the thyroid hormone signaling axis, allows for neural stem cell commitment and migration from the sub-ventricular zone. A deficiency of thyroid hormone, particularly during the first trimester, will lead to abnormal central nervous system development.Further supporting this conclusion is the fact that hypothyroidism during fetal development can result in a variety of <b>neurological</b> deficiencies, including <b>cretinism,</b> characterized by stunted physical development and mental retardation.|$|R
40|$|Severe iodine {{deficiency}} {{was the main}} cause of endemic goiter and cretinism. Most of the previously iodine-deficient areas are now supplemented, mainly with iodized salt. The geographical distribution of severe endemic areas has been progressively reduced, and at present, approximately 200 million people living in remote places are still at risk of severe {{iodine deficiency}}. International public health programs should be focused first on reaching these populations, and second on auditing and monitoring the operational work of supplementation programs. This second point is essential to prevent iodine-induced hyperthyroidism or interruptions of iodine supplement distribution, which could be catastrophic for the fetus and the young infant. Echography brings a complementary tool to clinical assessment of goiter by palpation. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry brings at least a definitive gold standard for iodine measurement and thyroid hormone measurement. Thiocyanate overload has been clearly documented as a goitrogen in Central Africa, and when associated with selenium deficiency, it may be included as risk factor for endemic myxedematous cretinism. Variable exposure to different environmental risk factors is likely the explanation of the variable distribution of two types of endemic <b>cretinism</b> (<b>neurological</b> and myxedematous), and the clinical overlap of the pathogeny of both syndromes is more important than previously described. It is possible that Kashin-Beck osteoarthropathy is another evanescent endemic disease that will disappear with the correction of iodine deficiency.

40|$|In 1895, iodine was {{characterized}} {{as an essential}} element of thyroid tissue by Baumann. The efficacy of iodine to prevent goiter was demonstrated by Marine in Northern USA in 1916 - 1920. Severe endemic goiter and cretinism had been almost entirely eliminated from continental Western Europe and Northern America before the 1930 's; however large populations elsewhere and even some places in Western Europe (Sicily) were still affected up to the 2000 's. Public health consequences of iodine deficiency are not limited to endemic goiter and cretinism. Iodine deficiency disorders include also increased neonatal death rate and decreased intellectual development, although these consequences are not included in the current estimation of the Global Burden Disease related to iodine deficiency. Severe iodine deficiency as a public health problem is now largely under control worldwide, but can still affect isolated places, in hard-To-reach and/or politically neglected populations. We emphasize the importance of maintaining international cooperation efforts, in order to monitor iodine status where iodine deficiency is now adequately controlled, and identify at-risk population where it is not. The goal should be now global eradication of severe iodine deficiency. Commercial distribution of iodized salt remains the most appropriate strategy. A randomized clinical trial in New Guinea clearly showed in the 1970 's that correcting severe iodine deficiency early in pregnancy prevents endemic <b>neurological</b> <b>cretinism.</b> This supports the essential role of thyroid hormones of maternal origin on the normal fetal development, during the first trimester of pregnancy (i. e. when fetal thyroid is still not functional). A randomized clinical trial in Congo (RD) in the 1970 's also showed that correcting severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy prevents myxoedematous cretinism, particularly prevalent in affected Congolese areas.

40|$|Thyroid hormone {{action on}} brain {{development}} is essentially exerted through {{regulation of the}} expression rate {{of a number of}} genes some of which have been identified in the past 10 years. In the present work we describe the thyroid hormone regulation of a novel Ras homolog which we have named Rhes (Ras homolog enriched in striatum). The rhes cDNA was previously isolated in subtractive hybridization experiments aimed at identifying cDNA clones corresponding to genes expressed preferentially in the rat striatum. The sequence was found to encode a small GTP-binding protein of the Ras family with highest homology to the dexamethasone-inducible Dexras 1. Here we show that rhes mRNA and protein in the striatum are strongly dependent on the thyroidal status. Developmentally, Rhes was regulated such that in normal rats there was an increased rhes mRNA content in the striatum after postnatal day 5 (P 5). Rhes concentration in hypothyroid rats was similar to that of normal rats at P 5, but the subsequent age-dependent increase was blunted. The administration of a single T 3 dose to hypothyroid rats normalized rhes mRNA concentration in 8 h, whereas it took 24 h, or more, to normalize the expression of rc 3, another T 3 -dependent brain gene, involved in PKC signaling. Double in situ hybridization using rhes and rc 3 riboprobes showed that the bulk of rhes signal was located in cells expressing rc 3. Given the relevance of small GTPases in signal transduction it is very likely that control of rhes, in addition to rc 3, is of relevance to explain the actions of thyroid hormone in the striatum, a region of the brain especially vulnerable in <b>neurological</b> <b>cretinism.</b> © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Requests for oVprints {{should be}} {{addressed}} to J R Arthur) Selenium deficiency causes further impairment of thyroid hormone metabolism in iodine-deficient rats and therefore could have a role in the aetiology of both myxoedematous and <b>neurological</b> <b>cretinism</b> in humans. Thyroidal type I iodothyronine deiodinase (ID-I), cytosolic glutathione peroxidase and phos-pholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase ac-tivities were increased in iodine-deficient adult rats and their oVspring at 11 days of age. Thyroidal ID-I activity was unchanged and thyroidal cytosolic glutathione peroxidase activity was decreased by more than 75 % by combined selenium and iodine deficiency in 11 -day-old rats, indicating that, while the thyroid retained an ability to produce 3, 3 *, 5 -tri-iodothyronine (T 3), the gland was probably more susceptible to peroxidative damage caused by increased hydrogen peroxide concentrations driven by increased thyrotrophin. Thyroidal atrophy, common in myxoedematous cretinism, did not occur in iodine- or selenium and iodine-deficient rat pups. Iodine deficiency increased brain type II iodothyronine deiodinase activity 1 · 5 -fold in 4 -day-old rats and 3 -fold in 11 -day-old rats, regardless of selenium status. Thus rats were able to activate compensatory mechanisms in brain that would maintain T 3 concentrations in selenium and iodine deficiencies. Surprisingly, however, selenium de-ficiency had a greater eVect than iodine deficiency on markers of brain development in rat pups. Expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA was decreased in selenium de-ficiency in 4 - and 11 -day-old pups and in combined selenium and iodine deficiency in 4 -day-old pups. Iodine deficiency caused an increase in BDNF expression in 11 -day-old pups but had no eVect on 4 -day-old pups. Myelin basic protein mRNA expression in brain was decreased by combined selenium and iodine deficiency in 11 -day-old rats...|$|E
