5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are <b>naked</b> <b>and</b> have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched with brown spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial—blind, <b>naked</b> <b>and</b> relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Growth {{performance}} and immune response of <b>naked</b> neck, frizzle <b>and</b> double segregation chickens were evaluated under moderate temperature. Four genetic groups originated {{from the same}} genetic origin (normally feathered, frizzled, <b>naked</b> neck <b>and</b> <b>naked</b> neck-frizzled) {{were used in the}} current study. Body weight and feed conversion ratio were determined from 4 - 12 weeks of age. Humoral immunity, phagocytic ability, cell-mediated immunity and relative weight of lymphoid organs were determined. The frizzled (nanaFf), <b>naked</b> neck (Nanaff) <b>and</b> <b>naked</b> neck frizzled (NanaFf) genotypes had significantly heavier body weight compared to normally feathered (nanaff) counterparts. The presence of Na gene in a single state or interacted with F gene significantly improved feed conversion ratio compared to nanaff sibs. With respect to immunocompetence measurements, it could be noticed that the Na, F and double segregation genes significantly increased total antibody titer against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) compared to nanaff genotype. Concerning cautenous basophilic hypersensitivity (CBH), it could be speculated that the <b>naked</b> neck, frizzle <b>and</b> <b>naked</b> neck frizzle birds were hyper responder to phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P) injection compared to normally feathered sibs.

5|$|Nuthatches are monogamous. The female {{produces}} {{eggs that}} are white with red or yellow markings; the clutch size varies, tending {{to be larger}} for northern species. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by both parents, depending on the species. The altricial (<b>naked</b> <b>and</b> helpless) chicks take between 21 and 27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the young, {{and in the case}} of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, helper males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.|$|E

It could be concluded that the naked neck, frizzled genes in a single state or in combination significantly increased immune response of chicken under prevailing conditions of Egypt. Therefore, introducing <b>naked</b> neck (Na) <b>and</b> frizzle (F) genes in selection programs for disease-resistance must be taken into consideration, particularly in unfavorable environments...|$|R
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} <b>naked</b> <b>and</b> beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Results May Vary track listing, Page Hamilton of Helmet and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer recorded songs with Limp Bizkit for the album; Al Jourgensen of Ministry also joined the band in the studio. Jourgensen claims that he convinced Fred Durst to strip <b>naked</b> <b>and</b> wear a cowboy hat while singing. The contributions of all three were omitted from the finished album. Bubba Sparxxx joined Durst in a Los Angeles studio, but his contributions also {{did not make the}} album. Durst wrote over 30 songs with Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto and the band's bassist, Sam Rivers. During production of Results May Vary, Durst listened to the Cure, Patsy Cline, Mazzy Star and classical music.|$|E
5|$|Incubation of {{the eggs}} lasts 11 to 13 days and is {{performed}} solely by the female. The hatchlings are <b>naked</b> <b>and</b> quills do not begin to show until the third day. Only females brood the nestlings, though both parents may bring whole insects to their young. When a young rufous-crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days, it is still incapable of flight, though it can run through the underbrush; during this time it is still fed by the parents. Juveniles tend to leave their parent's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter. Reproductive success varies strongly with annual rainfall and is highest in wet El Niño years, since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes, the main predator of the sparrow's nests.|$|E

5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, {{or in the}} hollow of a tree.

The chicks are altricial—they are blind, <b>naked</b> <b>and</b> relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later.

5|$|Pelicans have mainly light-coloured plumage, the {{exceptions}} being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences. The throat pouch of the Californian subspecies {{of the brown}} pelican turns bright red, and fades to yellow after the eggs are laid, while the throat pouch of the Peruvian pelican turns blue. The American white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females have laid eggs. The plumage of immature pelicans is darker than that of adults. Newly hatched chicks are <b>naked</b> <b>and</b> pink, darkening to grey or black after 4 to 14 days, then developing a covering of white or grey down.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched <b>naked</b> <b>and</b> blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The main sub-traditions of Jainism have {{historically}} disagreed, with Digambaras (sky-clad, naked mendicant order) stating {{that a woman}} is by her nature and her body unable to practice asceticism, such as by living <b>naked,</b> <b>and</b> therefore she cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender. She can at best, state the Digambara texts, live an ethical life so that she is reborn as {{a man in a}} future life. In this view, she is also viewed a threat to a monk's chastity. In contrast, Svetambaras (white-clad, wear clothes) have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both males and females to pursue a mendicant ascetic life with the possibility of moksha (kaivalya, spiritual liberation) regardless of gender.|$|E
