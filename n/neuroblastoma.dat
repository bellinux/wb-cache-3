The CGH data of clinically non-progressing stage 4 s tumours revealed {{a high rate of}} whole-chromosome aberrations (73. 4 %) with an overrepresentation of mainly chromosomes 2, 6, 7, 12, 13, 17, 18 and an underrepresentation of mainly chromosomes 3, 4, 11, 14. MYCN amplification or 1 p deletion was observed in only 1 / 27 or 2 / 17 clinically non-progressing stage 4 s tumours respectively, whereas all three progressive stage 4 s <b>neuroblastomas</b> showed MYCN amplification, 1 p deletion and, in 2 / 3 cases, distal 17 q gains.

40|$|The nuclear DNA content {{characterization}} {{was carried}} out by means of both DNA index and DNA histogram type assessments in a series of 21 retinoblastomas, 11 <b>neuroblastomas,</b> 1 ganglioneuroblastoma, and 4 medulloblastomas. These measurements were performed by means of the cytophotometric digital cell image analyses of Feulgen-stained nuclei. The results indicate that as far as nuclear DNA content is concerned, retinoblastomas seem to be very different from <b>neuroblastomas.</b> In fact, in terms of DNA index, retinoblastomas are significantly more aneuploid than <b>neuroblastomas.</b> The DNA histogram type shows that the high level of aneuploidy found in retinoblastomas corresponds to genotypically polymorphic tumors, and this could reflect a serious degeneration of the genomic material in retinoblastomas.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the radiological and clinical findings of congenital cystic <b>neuroblastomas</b> {{as compared with}} those of the cystic presentation of neonatal adrenal hemorrhage. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the US (n = 52), CT (n = 24), and MR (n = 4) images as well as the medical records of 28 patients harboring congenital cystic <b>neuroblastomas</b> (n = 16) and neonatal adrenal hemorrhagic pseudocysts (n = 14). The history of prenatal detection, location, size, presence of outer wall enhancement, internal septations, solid portion, calcification, turbidity, vascular flow on a Doppler examination, and evolution patterns were compared in two groups of cystic lesions, by Fischer’s exact test. Results: All (100 %) <b>neuroblastomas</b> and three (21 %) of the 14 hemorrhagic pseudocysts were detected prenatally. Both groups of cystic lesions occurred more frequently on the right side; 11 of 16 (69 %) for <b>neuroblastomas</b> and 11 of 14 (79 %) for hemorrhagic pseudocysts. The size, presence of solid portion, septum, enhancement, and turbidity did not differ significantly (p> 0. 05) between the two groups of cystic lesions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Surgery is {{the first}} line {{treatment}} for low-grade <b>neuroblastomas.</b> In stage I tumors, the presence of MYCN amplification is rarely detected and the Shimada histology is not always taken into consideration when deciding on the treatment. This study concerns {{the significance of these}} two factors in the evolution of children with low-grade <b>neuroblastomas.</b> METHODS: We analyzed the assessment and follow-up of children with low-grade <b>neuroblastomas</b> (stages I and II) with or without MYCN amplification, with either a favorable or unfavorable histology and with or without tumor cell diploidy. Favorable histology was defined as stroma-poor tumors with more than 5 % differentiating neuroblasts and a mitosis karyorrhexis index (MKI) of less than 100 / 5000 cells. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2006, out of 114 <b>neuroblastomas,</b> nine (7. 9 %) were stage I and 21 (18. 4 %) stage II. Of these 30 patients, 27 underwent surgery alone and three received chemotherapy after surgery. The combination of MYCN amplification, unfavorable histology and diploidy was noted in one patient who developed metastases within two months. MYCN amplification alone was noted in two cases who are still tumor-free after two years. Unfavorable histology alone was noted in four patients, of whom one suffered a recurrence of the tumor (previously stage I) and three are tumor-free after six years. Tumor cell diploidy alone was present in 11 patients whose evolution is satisfactory. CONCLUSION: Because MYCN amplification and unfavorable histology are rare in early stage <b>neuroblastomas,</b> these tumors may be misclassified if they are not investigated further. It seems that no single clinical or biological feature can be considered a significant factor in establishing a prognosis or determining whether additional treatment is required...|$|R

40|$|ALK (anaplastic {{lymphoma}} kinase) is a {{tyrosine kinase}} receptor, expressed {{as part of}} the chimeric NPM-ALK protein, in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCLs) exhibiting the t(2; 5) (p 23;q 35) translocation.

In normal mouse tissues, mRNA encoding the Alk receptor has been found only in neural cells, suggesting involvement of this receptor {{in the development of the}} nervous system. The purpose of the present study was to examine the presence of ALK transcripts and protein in normal human tissues and a variety of cell lines and human tumors.

The salient finding was that 13 of the 29 cell lines of neural origin and 22 of 24 <b>neuroblastomas</b> were found to express ALK transcripts and ALK protein.
