The effects of field curvature {{are replaced by}} generalized forces that are pro-portional to the parallel and perpendicular components of the particle energy. A perturbation analy-sis, covering all density regimes and including the finite gyro-radius effects, is carried out in cylindrical co-ordinates. It is shown that the final equation can always be solved by a variational method. Explicit solutions in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions are also presented for a special class of density distributions. For a monoenergetic plasma, in which all ions precess coherently, there can be stable regions at both very low and very high densities. If the ions precess incoherently, due to a spread in the energy, then a new over-stability emerges in the above stable regions.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the toroidal ion temperature gradient (ITG) instability, considered as {{the main source of}} anomalous transport in the low (L) confinement mode of tokamaks, are analysed for the conditions of the radiatively improved (RI) mode triggered by seeding of impurities. Based on experimental profiles from TEXTOR- 94 we deduce that the ITG-induced turbulence is quenched in the RI-mode in {{a large part of the}} plasma radius. Under those conditions the dissipative trapped electron (DTE) instability dominates the transport. The peaking of the electron density, one of the most remarkable features of the L-RI transition, is explained by the difference in contributions of ITG and DTE unstable modes to the diffusive and convective components of the electron flow. The shearing of the plasma toroidal velocity observed in the RI-modes with unbalanced <b>neutral</b> <b>injection</b> is successfully modelled by taking into account both the anomalous plasma viscosity due to ITG-turbulence and predictions of the revisited neoclassical theory...|$|E
