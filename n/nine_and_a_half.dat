The opening scene at the airfield was shot in mid-June at the Bourget Airport {{in the middle of the}} night with whatever extras they could find. Renoir had almost run out of money when he filmed the car crash scene, which was shot very quickly with Alain Renoir as the camera operator. Renoir never liked the scene and initially removed it.

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} winning the Kentucky Derby, American Pharoah entered the second leg of the Triple Crown, the 2015 Preakness Stakes, run over <b>nine</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> furlongs at Pimlico Race Course. Despite an {{unfavorable}} inside draw of the number one post position, he was installed as the morning line favorite ahead of Firing Line and Dortmund. No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994. Immediately before post time, the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder. The last time the Preakness had been run on a sloppy track was in 1983, and American Pharoah was the only horse {{in the field to}} have previously faced similar conditions, having won the Rebel Stakes running in rain and mud.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in the towel. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total <b>nine</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed the towel into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the towel over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.|$|E

5|$|Defensively, Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich led {{all players}} with nine tackles. Of the <b>nine</b> stops, one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> were for {{negative}} yardage. The leading Virginia Tech defender was Cody Grimm, who had eight tackles, two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{of which were}} for losses. One <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of the tackles for loss were quarterback sacks, and Grimm also forced <b>a</b> fumble <b>and</b> broke up one Boston College pass. In total, the Hokies' defense intercepted two passes and recovered two fumbles. The Eagles' defense likewise caused three turnovers, recovering two fumbles and intercepting one pass. Boston College sacked Taylor twice, while Virginia Tech's defense reached Davis five times.|$|R

He had the statistically best game of his career at ECU against the Houston Cougars with <b>nine</b> stops, two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> sacks, <b>and</b> 2.5 tackles for a loss. Additionally, he also blocked a kick. At the end of the season, Wilson earned all-Conference USA (second-team) honors as a selection by the league coaches.|$|R
25|$|Construction {{was started}} in 1915 but was halted in 1916 due to the {{continuation}} of World War I. Building was restarted in 1919, and the Wills Memorial Building was finally opened on 9 June 1925 by King George V and Queen Mary, having cost a total of £501,566 19s 10d. The building was opened with a Royal Salute of 21 chimes from 'Great George', the <b>nine</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> ton bell within the octagonal belfry of the tower, which is tolled {{on the death of}} a monarch or chancellor. To celebrate the Centenary of the University receiving its charter, 'Great George' was rung, along with bells in Bristol's other churches, just as they did in May 1909 when King Edward VII granted the University its Royal Charter to grant degrees. Oatley received a knighthood that same year in recognition of his work on the building.|$|E
25|$|Graceville Railway Station {{is located}} {{approximately}} <b>nine</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> kilometres outbound on the Brisbane-Ipswich line (completed in 1875), {{one of seven}} rail lines radiating from the Brisbane central business district to serve the passenger, coal and freight markets of south-east Queensland. The station was established in 1884 to service new residential subdivisions, and had gained its current format by 1958-1959. It services the south-west commuter suburb of Graceville and comprises two island platforms with a butterfly-roofed station building of brick and concrete, four steel and timber platform awnings and a subway system linking the leafy suburb {{on both sides of}} the tracks. It was one of a suite of station fit-outs carried out from the early 1950s and into the 1960s in anticipation of the electrification and quadruplication of the rail lines between Nundah and Corinda, and stands out as the first one completed, the most successful resolution of the design themes explored by the Railway Department's architects, and the most intact.|$|E

60|$|We are {{camped in}} this place, now, just {{within the city}} walls of Tiberias. We went into the town before nightfall and looked at its people--we cared nothing about its houses. Its people are best {{examined}} at a distance. They are particularly uncomely Jews, Arabs, and negroes. Squalor and poverty are the pride of Tiberias. The young women wear their dower strung upon a strong wire that curves downward {{from the top of}} the head to the jaw--Turkish silver coins which they have raked together or inherited. Most of these maidens were not wealthy, but some few had been very kindly dealt with by fortune. I saw heiresses there worth, in their own right--worth, well, I suppose I might venture to say, as much as <b>nine</b> dollars <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> But such cases are rare.

Some people can not stand prosperity.|$|R
5000|$|During the Kohl-Larsen {{excavation}} the stratigraphy {{and levels}} of the site were determined within its <b>nine</b> by twelve <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> meters area. Depth of the excavation varies between sources as bedrock has {{said to have been}} to be reached between <b>nine</b> <b>and</b> eleven meters. The site was divided into six beds that are now recognized as potentially problematic but still used for reference in present work and reanalysis. In later excavations, artifacts from each of the defined beds have been dated using radiocarbon dating techniques. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to confirm and fully understand the site due to heavily mixed deposits from the Kohl-Larsen excavations, few comparable sites, and lack of data on the past environmental conditions. Each bed has been C-14 dated; however, some scholars question these dates.|$|R
60|$|Varna is a seaport, {{surrounded}} by an undulating country of park-like appearance, and the troops were upon their arrival delighted with their new quarters. Here some 22,000 English and 50,000 French were encamped, together with 8,000 or 10,000 Turks. A few days after their arrival Jack obtained leave for a day on shore, and rowed out to Alladyn, <b>nine</b> miles <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> from Varna, where the light division, consisting of the 7th, 19th, 23d, 33d, 77th, and 88th regiments, was encamped. Close by was <b>a</b> fresh-water lake, <b>and</b> the undulated ground was finely wooded with clumps of forest timber, and covered with short, crisp grass. No more charming site for a camp could be conceived. Game abounded, and the officers who had brought guns with them found for a time capital sport. Everyone was in the highest spirits, and the hopes that the campaign would soon open in earnest were general. In this, however, they were destined to be disappointed, for on the 24th of June the news came that the Turks had unaided beaten off the Russians with such heavy loss in their attack upon Silistria that the latter had broken up the siege, and were retreating northward.|$|R
500|$|On {{the journey}} {{back to the}} {{southern}} hemisphere, Australia stopped for its first ever Test tour of South Africa. Macartney warmed up with 135 in a victory over Natal. The cricket writer Jack Pollard described Macartney's hitting as [...] "powerful, almost arrogant". Macartney then scored 59 and 116 in an aggressive display in the First Test in Durban, which was drawn, with the hosts hanging on with only three wickets in hand. After missing the Second Test due to fitness reasons, Macartney returned against Western Province. He took 5/40 in the first innings, his first five-wicket innings since June 1912, <b>nine</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> years earlier.|$|E
500|$|However, Aleksander Feklisov {{also claimed}} that Julius Rosenberg {{supplied}} {{him with a}} whole proximity fuze, which would corroborate at least this part of Greenglass' testimony. During the trial, Bloch claimed Greenglass wanted revenge for the machine shop business failure. Bloch attempted to discredit Greenglass' character and testimony. At Greenglass' sentencing hearing, his attorney O. John Rogge repeatedly told the court his client deserved [...] "a pat on the back" [...] for his testimony and argued that a light sentence, {{no more than five}} years, would encourage others to follow his example. Greenglass was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was released after <b>nine</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> years and reunited with his wife.|$|E

The disaster caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation. Subsequent inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today.|$|E
6000|$|The duke was {{thinking}} HE'D been {{doing pretty well}} till the king come to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much.

And he had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which {{he said he would}} put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for <b>half</b> <b>a</b> dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was, [...] "Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart"--and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it.

6000|$|By {{the time}} the [...] "scherm" [...] was {{finished}} the moon peeped up, and our dinners of giraffe steaks and roasted marrow-bones were ready. How we enjoyed those marrow-bones, though it was rather a job to crack them! I know of no greater luxury than giraffe marrow, unless it is elephant's heart, and we had that on the morrow. We ate our simple meal {{by the light of}} the moon, pausing at times to thank Good for his wonderful shot; then we began to smoke <b>and</b> yarn, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> curious picture we must have made squatting there round the fire. I, with my short grizzled hair sticking up straight, and Sir Henry with his yellow locks, which were getting rather long, were rather a contrast, especially as I am thin, and short, and dark, weighing only <b>nine</b> stone <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> Sir Henry is tall, and broad, and fair, and weighs fifteen. But perhaps the most curious-looking of the three, taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, was Captain John Good, R.N. There he sat upon a leather bag, looking just as though he had come in from a comfortable day's shooting in a civilised country, absolutely clean, tidy, and well dressed. He wore a shooting suit of brown tweed, with a hat to match, <b>and</b> neat gaiters. <b>As</b> usual, he was beautifully shaved, his eye-glass and his false teeth appeared to be in perfect order, and altogether he looked the neatest man I ever had to do with in the wilderness. He even sported a collar, of which he had a supply, made of white gutta-percha.|$|R
6000|$|... (M136) In September (1872) {{the five}} arbitrators at Geneva gave their award. They were {{unanimous}} in finding Great Britain {{liable for the}} acts of the Alabama; all save the British representative found her liable for the Florida; the Italian, the Swiss, and the American against the Englishman and the Brazilian found her liable for the Shenandoah after leaving Melbourne. They awarded in satisfaction and final settlement of all claims, including interest, a gross sum of about three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter million pounds sterling. The award, though hardly a surprise, still inflicted a lively twinge of mortification on the masterful and confident people of this island. Opinion was divided, but the decision {{was not one of}} those that cut deep or raise the public temperature to fever. The prints of the opposition insisted that the result was profoundly vexatious, it was <b>a</b> bungled settlement, <b>and</b> the arguments used in favour of it were “wild sentimental rubbish.” On the other hand, the Times regarded it with profound satisfaction, and ministerial writers with a lyric turn hailed it as a magnificent victory, though we had to pay a heavy bill. A little balm was extracted {{from the fact that the}} Americans had preferred before the tribunal a demand of <b>nine</b> millions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> thus got little more than one-third of what they had asked. So ended what has been called the greatest of all arbitrations, extinguishing the embers that could not have been left to smoulder without constant peril of <b>a</b> vast <b>and</b> fratricidal conflagration. The treaty of Washington and the Geneva arbitration stand out as the most notable victory in the nineteenth century of the noble art of preventive diplomacy, and the most signal exhibition in their history of self-command in two of the three chief democratic powers of the western world. For the moment the result did something to impair the popularity of Mr. Gladstone’s government, but his association with this high act of national policy is one of the things that give its brightest lustre to his fame.|$|R
