[...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you <b>never</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> show".

Their first appearance in The Simpsons was [...] "There's No Disgrace Like Home." [...] Itchy, voiced by Dan Castellaneta, is a blue mouse, and usually the aggressor and the victor over the hapless Scratchy in their battles. An exception is in [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] (season five, 1993). Bart and Lisa watch a cartoon called [...] "Burning Down the Mouse", as Lisa puts it, [...] "This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy".

Scratchy, voiced by Harry Shearer, is a threadbare, dim-witted black cat and the victim of relentless abuse from the sadistic mouse, Itchy. The writers often forget which character is which; a trick they use is that Scratchy contains the letters c, a and t.|$|E
