5|$|In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department signposted {{the highway}} {{system in the}} state for the first time. At that time, M-57 {{designation}} was originally used in Charlevoix County from Boyne Falls at M-13 (now US131) through Boyne City and back to then M-13. That highway's <b>number</b> <b>was</b> changed to M-75 in 1926. By the next year, the <b>number</b> <b>was</b> then assigned to a state trunkline that connected between Quinnesec and the Wisconsin state line in the Upper Peninsula. This second iteration was short-lived as it was replaced by an extension of US141 into Michigan.|$|E

The converse is not true: not all irrational <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> transcendental; e.g., the square root of 2 is irrational but not a transcendental <b>number,</b> since it <b>is</b> a solution of the polynomial equation [...] Another irrational <b>number</b> that <b>is</b> not transcendental is the golden ratio, [...] or , since it is a solution of the polynomial equation [...]|$|R

Most of them were killed or went missing in 1991 (2,729) and 1995 (2,348). The most deaths occurred in Northern Dalmatia (1,605). The JNA has officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action.

5|$|The {{day after}} Umbricht's death, the Colts decided to honor their {{teammate}} by wearing black armbands {{for the entire}} 1964 season. Umbricht's uniform number (32) was immediately retired by the team; {{it was the first}} time the club retired a uniform number, and only the ninth time in Major League history a <b>number</b> <b>was</b> retired. In the Colts' opening-day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbricht's memory. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor. The back of Umbricht's 1964 Topps baseball card was updated to mention his death shortly before printing. The retirement of Umbricht's number received some criticism, however. Former teammate Jimmy Wynn wrote in his autobiography that Walt Bond, a former Astros player who was African-American, died from leukemia while he was still active. His jersey <b>number</b> <b>was</b> not retired by the club after his death, although he appeared in more games for the Astros than Umbricht. (It should be noted, however, that Bond ended his career not with Houston but as a member of the Minnesota Twins.) Journalists criticizing the retirement of numbers sometimes use Umbricht as an example of someone whose <b>number</b> <b>was</b> retired but who is unfamiliar to baseball fans.|$|E
