5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has <b>no</b> <b>public</b> element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has <b>no</b> <b>public</b> element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E

The ruins and the later farmhouse are jointly grade II listed and the castle remains are {{designated as a}} scheduled monument.

There is <b>no</b> <b>public</b> record of her subsequent career.|$|E
5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were <b>no</b> <b>public</b> law grounds for the courts {{to be involved in}} that decision. Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held {{in the presence of the}} Archbishop of Canterbury and senior members of other Christian denominations.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the closure}} of the {{original}} London tram network in 1952, Holborn provided an interchange between trams and tubes, via the underground Holborn tramway station located a little distance south of the underground railway station. This was the only part of London with an underground tram system, and Holborn tramway station (named Great Queen Street when first opened) is still extant beneath ground, though with <b>no</b> <b>public</b> access.|$|E

However, following the commencement of the war against Japan, Nash enlisted on 2 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, the Jewish Community Centre in Palmotićeva Street in Zagreb, and Jewish graves at the Mirogoj Cemetery, were bombed {{as a part}} of Operation Labrador. The explosions caused {{property}} damage, but {{resulted in}} no casualties. There were <b>no</b> <b>public</b> claims of responsibility for the attack. Aside from the two explosions in Zagreb, agents assigned to Operation Labrador were thought to also be responsible for bombing the Zagreb–Belgrade railway near Vinkovci and a railway line between Glina and Vojnić. The railway attacks have also been ascribed to Operation Opera.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was designed to provide affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a self-contained community {{close enough to the}} rail network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line with the principles of the Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, <b>no</b> <b>public</b> houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E
