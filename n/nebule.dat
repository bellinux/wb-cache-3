40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{drug delivery}} to the lungs of nebulized and metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in an in vitro infant lung model. METHODS: An in vitro lung model was modified to study drug delivery. A 1000 mL intravenous bag filled with 500 mL deionized water {{was attached to}} a 3. 5 mm (12 cm length) endotracheal tube. An inline Marquest Whisper Jet infant circuit nebulizer system delivered 2. 5 mg/ 3 mL albuterol sulfate inhalation solution (Ventolin <b>nebules)</b> at a flow rate of 5 L/min. An Aerochamber (Monaghan) was placed at the endotracheal tube for the delivery of the MDIs. Albuterol MDI (Ventolin) 10 inhalations and beclomethasone MDI (Beclovent) 20 inhalations were delivered. A Servo 900 C (Siemens-Elma) was used at the following ventilator settings: positive inspiratory pressure 30 cm H 2 O), intermittent mandatory ventilation 40 breaths/min, positive end expiratory pressure 4 cm H 2 O, inspiratory time 0. 4 sec. Each formulation was run at least 10 times and assayed in duplicate by HPLC. An unpaired Student’s t-test was {{used to analyze the}} statistical significance of the data. RESULTS: There was a significantly greater percentage of drug delivery with MDI albuterol (1. 96 ± 0. 50) as compared with nebulized albuterol (1. 26 ± 0. 37) (p = 0. 002) or beclomethasone diproprionate (0. 51 ± 0. 24) (p = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Albuterol MDI provides a more efficient delivery of drug to the lung as compared with nebulized albuterol and MDI beclomethasone diproprionate.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of salbutamol as a fixed dose Ventolin <b>Nebule</b> (2. 5 mg) and as variable dose respirator solution (0. 1 mg/kg bodyweight). Design: Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel group comparison. Setting: The Emergency Departments of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria; Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia; and The Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales. Patients: Ninety-nine children between four and 12 years of age who presented to the Emergency Departments with mild to moderate acute asthma from May to December 1990. Interventions: Children enrolled {{in the study were}} randomly allocated to one of two groups. Group 1 received one <b>Nebule</b> (2. 5 mg salbutamol in 2. 5 mL aqueous solution) delivered by wet nebulisation. Group 2 received salbutamol (approximately 0. 1 mg/kg bodyweight) diluted with saline to 2. 5 mL, delivered by identical wet nebulisation. Main outcome measures: (i) Clinical score; (ii) pulse oximetry; and (iii) peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) where possible - measured before, and st 15 and 30 minutes after treatment with salbutamol.

40|$|AbstractThe size of aerosol {{particles}} prior to, and during, inhalation influences {{the site of}} deposition within the lung. As such, a detailed understanding of the hygroscopic growth of an aerosol during inhalation is necessary to accurately model the deposited dose. In {{the first part of}} this study, it is demonstrated that the aerosol produced by a nebulizer, depending on the airflows rates, may experience a (predictable) wide range of relative humidity prior to inhalation and undergo dramatic changes in both size and solute concentration. A series of sensitive single aerosol analysis techniques are then used to make measurements of the relative humidity dependent thermodynamic equilibrium properties of aerosol generated from four common nebulizer formulations. Measurements are also reported of the kinetics of mass transport during the evaporation or condensation of water from the aerosol. Combined, these measurements allow accurate prediction of the temporal response of the aerosol size prior to and during inhalation. Specifically, we compare aerosol composed of pure saline (150 mM sodium chloride solution in ultrapure water) with two commercially available nebulizer products containing relatively low compound doses: Breath®, consisting of a simple salbutamol sulfate solution (5 mg/ 2. 5 mL; 1. 7 mM) in saline, and Flixotide® <b>Nebules,</b> consisting of a more complex stabilized fluticasone propionate suspension (0. 25 mg/mL; 0. 5 mM in saline. A mimic of the commercial product Tobi© (60 mg/mL tobramycin and 2. 25 mg/mL NaCl, pH 5. 5 – 6. 5) is also studied, which was prepared in house. In all cases, the presence of the pharmaceutical was shown to have a profound effect on the magnitude, and in some cases the rate, of the mass flux of water to and from the aerosol as compared to saline. These findings provide physical chemical evidence supporting observations from human inhalation studies, and suggest that using the growth dynamics of a pure saline aerosol in a lung inhalation model to represent nebulizer formulations may not be representative of the actual behavior of the aerosolized drug solutions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{difficulty}} of assessing nebulizer responses in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) {{has been demonstrated}} before. This study aims to re-examine both the role of domiciliary nebulizers in COPD and also bronchodilator (BD) assessment in individuals. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial, 19 stable patients with severe COPD were given the following medication 6 -hourly for 2 -week periods: (1) nebulized salbutamol 2 · 5 mg with ipratropium 0 · 5 mg and placebo inhalers (MDI) with spacer; (2) placebo <b>nebules</b> and inhaled salbutamol 400 μ g with ipratropium 80 μ g via MDI with spacer; (3) inhaled salbutamol 400 μ g with ipratropium 80 μ g via MDI with spacer (but no placebo nebulized drugs). Both nebulized and MDI drugs produced highly significant improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), specific airways conductance, 6 -min walking distance (6 MWD) and residual volume. There {{were no significant differences between}} BD responses obtained after active nebulized and active MDI BDs. From the diary cards, 2 weeks of active nebulized BDs produced a slightly higher median peak expiratory flow (PEF) than active MDI BDs (236 and 219 l m− 1, respectively, P= 0 · 01) and slightly less extra inhaler use (0 · 8 and 1 · 1 puffs, respectively, P< 0 · 05) but no significant difference in dyspnoea or quality of life (QOL) scores. There were significant correlations between domiciliary PEF and acute BD-induced changes in FVC and 6 MWD, and also between domiciliary dyspnoea scores and acute changes in both total lung capacity and 6 MWD. In conclusion, nebulized medication conferred little clinical advantage over the regular use of inhalers with spacers in this group of patients with severe COPD. However, acute changes in total lung capacity, FVC and 6 MWD may be useful predictors of the longer-term effects of nebulized BDs in individual patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInhaled steroids, {{delivered}} by metered dose aerosol and dry powder inhalers, have proved {{effective in reducing}} the need for oral steroids in patients with oral steroid-dependant asthma. This randomized, double-blind study, compared the efficacy and tolerability of nebulized fluticasone propionate (FP Nebules™), 2 mg b. d. (FP 4 mg) and 0 · 5 mg b. d. (FP 1 mg) with placebo, on the reduction of oral steroid requirement in 301 adult patients with oral steroid-dependent asthma. Primary efficacy was assessed by the reduction in daily oral steroid dose. Secondary efficacy parameters included daily diary card peak expiratory flow (PEF), day and night-time symptoms and clinic lung function measurements. Safety was assessed by adverse event monitoring and serum cortisol levels. After 12 weeks of treatment the adjusted mean ± sem reduction in oral prednisolone was significantly greater in the FP 4 mg group (4 · 44 ± 0 · 98 mg day− 1) compared with FP 1 mg (2 · 16 ± 1 · 00 mg day− 1, P = 0 · 039) and placebo (1 · 20 ± 1 · 02 mg day− 1, P = 0 · 004). A higher percentage of patients discontinued the use of oral steroids with FP 4 mg (37 %) compared with FP 1 mg (26 %, P = 0 · 038) and placebo (18 %, P < 0 · 001). Following treatment, the adjusted mean morning PEF showed a trend in favour of FP 4 mg (280 ± 41 min− 1) compared with placebo (270 ± 51 min− 1, P = 0 · 053) and the evening PEF was significantly higher with FP 4 mg (305 ± 41 min− 1) compared with FP 1 mg (292 ± 41 min− 1, P = 0 · 010). FP 4 mg resulted in a significantly higher percentage of days when the patients were free from daytime (P = 0 · 036) and night-time (P = 0 · 021) wheeze, compared with placebo. Significantly fewer patients withdrew from the FP 4 mg group compared {{with the other two}} groups (vs. FP 1 mg, P = 0 · 003; vs. placebo, P = 0 · 032). All three treatments were well tolerated and the incidence of adverse events was similar between the groups. FP <b>Nebules</b> at a daily dose of between 1 and 4 mg are a safe and effective means of reducing the oral steroid requirement of patients with chronic oral steroid dependent asthma...|$|R

40|$|We {{observed}} unexpected high plasma {{concentrations of}} tobrarriycin (48. 5 and 28. 1 mg/L) in fingerprick blood samples after the nebulization of tobramycin solution for inhalation (tobramycin 300 mg/ 5 mL, TOBI(R)) by 2 young children aged 3 years. To investigate whether dermal contamination {{could be the}} source of error, 3 adult volunteers were present during another nebulization by a third child (age 2 years). The volunteers had exposure to tobramycin by handling the nebulizer or the <b>nebule</b> and also by inhalation from holding the child and being in close proximity while TOBI(R) was being administered. Five blood samples by fingerprick and 2 by venipuncture were collected and assayed for tobramycin concentration. On each occasion the site was swabbed with alcohol wipes to mimic standard patient sampling methods. One site was resampled after cleaning of hands with 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate and water. Tobramycin concentrations from venipuncture 1 - 2 hours after nebulization were all < 0. 2 mg/L except for 1 result of 1. 2 mg/L. The tobramycin concentrations from fingerpricks before hand washing varied between 6. 8 and 172 mg/L, and after hand washing between 0. 3 and 17. 6 mg/L. Contamination of fingers with tobramycin is likely to have caused the error in the 2 initial cases and did cause misleadingly elevated levels in the adult volunteers. We caution that therapeutic drug monitoring of nebulized tobramycin should not be done by fingerprick sampling, and care should be taken to avoid contamination of the venipuncture site...|$|E

40|$|Background: Liquid {{droplets}} can be spontaneously {{charged in}} the absence of applied electric fields by spraying. It has been shown by computational simulation that charges may influence particle deposition in the airways. The electrostatic properties of jet nebulized aerosols and their potential effects on lung deposition have hardly been studied. A modified electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI) was employed to characterize the aerosol charges generated from jet nebulized commercial products. Methods: The charge and size measurements were conducted at 50 % RH and 22 °C with a modified ELPI. Ventolin®, Bricanyl®, and Atrovent® were nebulized using PARI LC® Plus jet nebulizers coupled to a DeVilbiss Pulmo-Aide® compressor. The aerosols were sampled in 30 -sec durations. The drug deposits on the impactor stages were assayed chemically using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The charges of nebulized deionized water, isotonic saline, and the three commercial products diluted with saline were also measured to analyze the contributions of the major <b>nebule</b> ingredients on charging. No mass assays were performed on these runs. Results: All three commercial nebules generated net negative charges. The magnitude of the charges reduced over the period of nebulization. Ventolin® and Bricanyl® yielded similar charge profiles. Highly variable charges were produced from deionized water. On the other hand, nebulized saline reproducibly generated net positive charges. Diluted commercial nebules showed charge polarity inversion. The charge profiles of diluted salbutamol and terbutaline solutions resembled those of saline, while the charges from diluted ipratropium solutions fluctuated near neutrality. Conclusions: The charge profiles were shown to be influenced by the concentration and physicochemical properties of the drugs, as well as the history of nebulization. The drugs may have unique isoelectric concentrations in saline at which the nebulized droplets would carry near-zero charges. According to results from computational simulation models in the literature, the numbers of elementary charges per droplet estimated from the data were not high enough to potentially affect lung deposition. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
