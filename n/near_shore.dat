5|$|Ctenophores {{are found}} in most marine environments: from polar waters to the tropics; near coasts and in mid-ocean; from the surface waters to the ocean depths. The best-understood are the genera Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis, as these planktonic coastal forms {{are among the most}} likely to be {{collected}} <b>near</b> <b>shore.</b> No ctenophores have been found in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} systems made {{landfall}} shortly after weakening from a Category5. This weakening {{can be caused by}} dry air near land, shallower waters due to shelving, interaction with land, or cooler waters <b>near</b> <b>shore.</b> In southern Florida, the return period for a Category5 hurricane is roughly once every 50 years.|$|E
5|$|For over a century, {{reports from}} the world's oceans have been {{received}} real-time for safety reasons and to help with general weather forecasting. The reports are coded using the synoptic code, and relayed via radio or satellite to weather organizations worldwide. Buoy reports are automated, and maintained by the country that moored the buoy in that location. Larger moored buoys are used <b>near</b> <b>shore,</b> while smaller drifting buoys are used farther out at sea.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were issued}} along the coast, while Coast Guard personnel went door-to-door on Grand Isle urging residents {{to leave the}} area. From there through the coast of southwestern Florida, small craft were advised to remain <b>near</b> <b>shore</b> due to rough seas. Offshore, workers were removed from oil rigs. Many Mississippi citizens, having experienced the destruction of Hurricane Camille just five years earlier, quickly left their coastal homes.|$|E
5|$|Many brick {{structures}} {{have been}} located at Kaveripumpattinam during on-shore, <b>near</b> <b>shore</b> and off-shore explorations; these provide proof for building construction during Sangam age. The on-shore structure include an I-shaped wharf and {{a structure that}} looks like a reservoir. The wharf has a number of wooden poles planted in its structure to enable anchorage of boats and to facilitate the handling of cargo. Among other structures, there is a Buddhist vihara with parts of it decorated using moulded bricks and stucco. <b>Near</b> <b>shore</b> excavations yielded a brick structure and a few terracotta ring wells. Off-shore explorations located a fifteen course brick structure, three courses of dressed stone blocks, brick bats and pottery. At Arikamedu, there were indications of a structure built substantially of timber, possibly a wharf. Conical jars that could have been used for storing wine and oil have been found near structures that could have been shops or storage areas. Evidence of continued building activity are present at this site, with the most distinctive structures being those of a possible warehouse, dyeing tanks and lined pits.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the early}} eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by {{indigenous}} Indonesians. Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales <b>near</b> <b>shore,</b> was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in his Essay upon the Natural History of Whales (1725), states that one Atkins, ten or twelve years in the trade, {{was among the first}} to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off the New England coast.|$|E

5|$|The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area {{includes}} nine known exposed formations, all {{visible in}} Zion National Park in the U.S. state of Utah. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation {{in that part}} of North America. Part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase, the formations exposed in the Zion and Kolob area were deposited in several different environments that range from the warm shallow seas of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations, streams and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations to the large deserts of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations and dry <b>near</b> <b>shore</b> environments of the Carmel Formation.|$|E
5|$|Enaliarctos, {{a fossil}} species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24–22 mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic {{life with a}} {{flexible}} spine, and limbs modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for shearing (like terrestrial carnivorans), {{and it may have}} stayed <b>near</b> <b>shore</b> more often than its extant relatives. Enaliarctos was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. One species, Enaliarctos emlongi, exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was Pteronarctos, which lived in Oregon 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, Pteroarctos had an orbital wall that was not limited by certain facial bones (like the jugal or lacrimal bone), but was mostly shaped by the maxilla.|$|E

25|$|Redspotted {{catsharks}} have {{a negative}} economic impact on humans. They feed heavily on <b>near</b> <b>shore</b> benthic crustaceans. This is a detriment to commercial fisherman because crustaceans in this area have a large economic importance. Catsharks are also a frequent bycatch of nearshore fishing trawlers, which, while not economically significant, can cause damage to nets as well as time lost in removing the bycatch from the viable catch.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} small {{offshore}} islands and cays {{that are part}} of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands <b>near</b> <b>shore</b> are Saona, in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. To the north, at distances of , are three extensive, largely submerged banks, which geographically are a southeast continuation of the Bahamas: Navidad Bank, Silver Bank, and Mouchoir Bank. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.|$|E
25|$|While East Hampton was {{originally}} primarily agricultural, the settlers {{soon discovered that}} whales frequently beached themselves along the South shore {{of the town and}} that the whales could then be carved up for food and oil. The proper handling of this phenomenon was to be written into town laws. As the demand for whale products grew, residents became more aggressive in their harvesting techniques. No longer content to settle for harvesting beached whales, they began harvesting live whales that were coming <b>near</b> <b>shore.</b>|$|E
50|$|The slender {{rainbow sardine}} swims in schools and while pelagic it is {{generally}} found <b>near</b> <b>shores.</b> It feeds on zooplankton, mainly crustacean and smaller fish. The {{slender rainbow sardine}} spawns mainly in spring. Its eggs, and when they hatch the larvae, drift passively until they metamorphose into free-swimming fish.|$|R

25|$|The California least tern hunts {{primarily}} in shallow estuaries and lagoons, or beyond the breakers, even beyond 24 km offshore {{in areas of}} upwelling, and where smaller fishes are abundant. They hover until spotting prey, and then plunge into the water without full submersion to extract prey. In the bays and lagoons of Southern California and northern Mexico, the favored prey include anchovy, smelt, silversides, shiner surfperch and small crustaceans. The terns often feed <b>near</b> <b>shore</b> in the open ocean, especially in proximity to lagoons or bay mouths (Baird 2010).|$|E
25|$|Up to 15 {{cases of}} {{stranded}} manatees {{are reported in}} Puerto Rico each year. Some of these cases involve animals that have died <b>near</b> <b>shore,</b> either from natural causes or human related accidents. Others cases reported consist of live manatees, whether ill, injured or orphaned in need of veterinary attention. The PRMCC is deputized by both the Commonwealth and Federal governments to respond to these stranding events, and conduct an investigation on the cause of death, including a necropsy, or rescue and transport the live animal to the PRMCC's rehabilitation facility for veterinary treatment and care.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1723, Peter, whose overall health was never robust, began having {{problems}} with his urinary tract and bladder. In the summer of 1724 a team of doctors performed surgery releasing upwards of four pounds of blocked urine. Peter remained bedridden until late autumn. In {{the first week of}} October, restless and certain he was cured, Peter began a lengthy inspection tour of various projects. According to legend, in November, at Lakhta along the Finnish Gulf to inspect some ironworks, Peter saw a group of soldiers drowning <b>near</b> <b>shore</b> and, wading out into near-waist deep water, came to their rescue.|$|E
