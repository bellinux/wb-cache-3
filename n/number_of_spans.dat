Most {{research}} about the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees {{is devoted to}} determining exact formulae for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees in many kinds of special graphs.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees is an {{important}} quantity characterizing the reliability of a network. Generally, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees in a network {{can be obtained by}} directly calculating a related determinant corresponding to the network. However, for a large network, evaluating the relevant determinant is intractable. In this paper, we investigate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees in two-tree networks. We first give a new algorithm which avoids the laborious computation of the determinant for counting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees. Using the algorithm, we can obtain the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees <b>of</b> any two-tree network in linear time. The result shows that the computation complexity is O(n), which is better than that of the matrix tree theorem with O(n 2), where n is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> steps. We then characterize two-tree networks with the maximum and minimum <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees. Denote by P(t) and K(t), respectively, the two-tree networks of t+ 2 vertices with the maximum and minimum <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees. Denote by PA and EN, respectively, the two-tree network of t+ 2 vertices generated by preferential attachment and by equiprobability attachment. By algorithmic analysis and through simulations, we conjecture that NST(K(t)) ≤NST(PA) ≤NST(EN) ≤NST(P(t)) as t tends to infinity, where NST(G) is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees <b>of</b> G.

40|$|The history <b>of</b> {{counting}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees dates {{back into the}} year 1842 in which the German mathematician Gustav Kirchhoff derived a relation between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees <b>of</b> a graph G (τ(G)) and the determinant of a specific submatrix associated with G. After this result many other related results followed. For example in 1889 the British mathematician A. Cayley showed that the complete graph on n nodes has nn− 2 spanning trees. The function τ can nowadays {{be found in the}} field of physics where the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees is used as an invariant for computing the entropy of certain networks related to physical processes. One can also find τ(G) in the field of network analysis where τ(G) is used in relation with various quantities indicating the reliability of a network represented by a graph G. In addition there are various applications <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees within mathematics as well. For example, the currently fastest algorithm for embedding a 3 -connected planar graph as a 3 D polytope uses τ(G) for computing the scaling factor of the coordinate system. In this work we present the function τ and some results related to determining the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees <b>of</b> a given graph. In later chapters we will be mainly interested in the question of how large can a class of graphs of order n be if they have mutually distinct <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees. In addition we will introduce an extremal problem asking for the smallest graph G having a prescribed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spanning</b> trees...|$|R

40|$|An {{atmospheric}} {{boundary layer}} {{wind tunnel study}} was performed to determine the overall horizontal wind load on multi-span duo-pitch greenhouses. The {{results of this study}} are intended for the stability design of inflexible Gladding system greenhouses (designated as Class A in EN 13031 - 1) with roof pitch angles of 23 - 24 ' and ridge heights of 7. 5 - 8 m. Both static force and fluctuating pressure measurements were performed to determine the overall horizontal wind force. The results obtained with the static force measurements show that the overall horizontal wind force increases linearly with increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>spans.</b> The overall horizontal wind load determined with the mean pressure coefficients derived from the fluctuating pressure measurements was found to be in good agreement with the static force measurements. An investigation into the correlation of the roof pressures showed that these pressures are relatively little correlated. The overall horizontal force on the roof of multi-span buildings reduces significantly because of this lack of correlation. Accounting for the lack of correlation between the roof pressures on a 30 span model resulted in a 65 % reduction of the peak horizontal wind force on the roof. A comparison was made of the overall horizontal wind forces determined in the current study and calculated with European codes for wind load assessment on greenhouses. EN 13031 - 1 provides non-conservative outcomes for the overall horizontal wind force on the investigated duo-pitch greenhouse type with more than 30 spans.
