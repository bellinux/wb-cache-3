25|$|This {{academic}} initiative, {{named the}} Acadia Advantage, integrated {{the use of}} <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching. By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were {{taking part in the}} initiative. The initiative went beyond leasing <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaf 40). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Use of a <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> in an office setting has been implicated as a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if there were differences in performance, posture, and blink rate between workers using cathode ray tube (CRT) computer monitors vs. a <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> flat panel display (FPD). Six combinations of typical CRT workstation configurations were presented to twenty-four subjects according to a Latin Square Crossover Design. The treatments consisted of a <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> alone, a <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> used with external input devices, monitor blocks, a <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> stand, and CRT monitors. Each subject performed two tasks (data entry and editing) for 10 minutes in each configuration-task combination. The results of this study indicate that the use of the notebook alone causes an increase in neck angle and viewing angle, while decreasing viewing distance and elbow angle. Use of the <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> elevated to eye level with either monitor blocks or a <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> stand alleviated these changes in body posture without affecting the blink rate or user performance of the subjects. Use of a CRT monitor, keyboard, and mouse were still generally preferred over the use of the <b>notebook</b> <b>computer.</b> However, if a user needs or desires a <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> and intends to use it in an office setting, the results of this study suggest that if a docking station or port replicator are not available, the <b>notebook</b> <b>computer</b> FPD should be elevated to eye level and used only as a visual terminal while using an external keyboard and mouse as input devices...|$|R

25|$|The maximum areal {{storage density}} for flash memory used in solid state drives (SSDs) is 2.8Tbit/in2 in {{laboratory}} demonstrations as of 2016, and the maximum for HDDs is 1.5Tbit/in2. The areal density of flash memory is doubling every two years, similar to Moore's law (40% per year) {{and faster than}} the 10–20% per year for HDDs. As of 2016, maximum capacity was 10terabytes for an HDD, and 15terabytes for an SSD. HDDs were used in 70% of the desktop and <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> produced in 2016, and SSDs were used in 30%. The usage share of HDDs is declining and could drop below 50% in 2018–2019 according to one forecast, because SSDs are replacing smaller-capacity (less than one-terabyte) HDDs in desktop and <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> and MP3 players.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{recommendations}} coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> to a student-owned computer model.

25|$|DDR SDRAM modules for desktop computers, dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), have 184 pins (as {{opposed to}} 168 pins on SDRAM, or 240 pins on DDR2 SDRAM), {{and can be}} {{differentiated}} from SDRAM DIMMs {{by the number of}} notches (DDR SDRAM has one, SDRAM has two). DDR SDRAM for <b>notebook</b> <b>computers,</b> SO-DIMMs, have 200 pins, which is the same number of pins as DDR2 SO-DIMMs. These two specifications are notched very similarly and care must be taken during insertion if unsure of a correct match. Most DDR SDRAM operates at a voltage of 2.5V, compared to 3.3V for SDRAM. This can significantly reduce power consumption. Chips and modules with DDR-400/PC-3200 standard have a nominal voltage of 2.6V.|$|E
25|$|Wesley {{was one of}} {{the first}} Australian schools to {{integrate}} laptop computers into its curriculum and according to its network provider in 2008, it operated Australia’s largest school notebook PC program. Wesley's IT infrastructure includes over 4,000 notebook, 1,000 desktop computers and 850 network printers. In 2005 wireless internet was launched college-wide. In 2007 Wesley introduced tablet styled <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> and was the first educational institution in Australia to do so, but by 2010 were no longer being issued. In 2008, Art students were using Wacom pen-tablets for drawing use. Wesley introduced interactive whiteboards across all classrooms and some lecture theatres in 2008, allowing notes to be printed to a nearby printer or emailed to students. The College also began trialling electronic reading devices in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{proprietary}} {{nature of}} the complete SD specification affects embedded systems, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using USB-based card readers if necessary. These card readers present a standard USB mass storage interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from {{the details of the}} underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.|$|E

25|$|In-plane {{switching}} is an LCD {{technology that}} aligns the liquid crystals {{in a plane}} parallel to the glass substrates. In this method, the electrical field is applied through opposite electrodes on the same glass substrate, so that the liquid crystals can be reoriented (switched) essentially in the same plane, although fringe fields inhibit a homogeneous reorientation. This requires two transistors for each pixel instead of the single transistor needed for a standard thin-film transistor (TFT) display. Before LG Enhanced IPS was introduced in 2009, the additional transistors resulted in blocking more transmission area, thus requiring a brighter backlight and consuming more power, making this type of display less desirable for <b>notebook</b> <b>computers.</b> Currently Panasonic is using an enhanced version eIPS for their large size LCD-TV products as well as Hewlett-Packard in its WebOS based TouchPad tablet and their Chromebook 11.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{discontinued}} {{the use of}} PowerPC microprocessors in 2006. At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs {{announced this}} transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures. This was done in order to modernize the company's computers, keeping pace with Intel's low power Pentium M chips, especially for heat-sensitive laptops. The PowerPC G5 chip's heavy power consumption and heat output (the Power Mac G5 had to be liquid-cooled) also prevented its use in Mac <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> (as well as the original Mac mini), which were forced to use the older and slower PowerPC G4 chip. These shortcomings of the PowerPC chips were the main reasons behind Apple's transition to Intel processors, and the brand was revitalised by the subsequent boost in processing power available due to greater efficiency {{and the ability to}} implement multiple cores in Mac CPUs.|$|E

500|$|Robert Brunner, Apple's head of {{industrial}} design at the time, led the design team that developed the laptop, including its trackball and granite color. Brunner said he designed the PowerBook [...] "so {{it would be}} as easy to use and carry as a regular book". The dark granite grey color set it apart from other <b>notebook</b> <b>computers</b> of the time and also from Apple's other products, which traditionally were beige or platinum grey. The trackball, another new design element, was placed {{in the middle of the}} computer, allowing the PowerBook to be easily operated by both left- and right-handed users. The designers were trying to create a fashion statement with the overall design of the laptop, which they felt made it a more personal accessory, like a wallet or briefcase. Brunner said: [...] "It says something about the identity of the person who is carrying it".|$|E
