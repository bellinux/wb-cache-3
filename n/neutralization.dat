5|$|Shahrbaraz {{then moved}} his army to {{northern}} Syria, {{where he could}} easily decide to support either Khosrow or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the <b>neutralization</b> of Khosrow's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy {{of some of his}} best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Iran.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} growing {{concern that the}} calls by Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia for the <b>neutralization</b> of his own country, and his {{attempts}} to convene an international conference on the matter, would increase such sentiment in Vietnam, something that was oft-repeated in the American media. Minh publicly opposed Sihanouk's ideas and similar plans mooted by French President Charles de Gaulle, but discussion of the concepts continued to grow.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Khánh spread rumors in {{the capital}} that the French were behind a plan to install a pro-communist {{government}} that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the <b>neutralization</b> of Vietnam. Helping Khánh in a concerted smear campaign were Khiêm and Thieu. The French Foreign Office had announced that Paris would establish diplomatic relations with Peking on January 28, and Khánh used {{this as an opportunity}} to play on American anti-neutralist sentiment. De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{after the}} emperor showed Shahrbaraz intercepted letters from Khosrow {{ordering}} the Persian general's death, the latter switched to Heraclius' side. Shahrbaraz then moved his army to northern Syria, {{where he could}} easily decide to support either Khosrow or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the <b>neutralization</b> of Khosrow's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy {{of some of his}} best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Persia.|$|E
5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the <b>neutralization</b> of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that requires no individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{constituent}} groups were the Allgemeine SS (General SS) and Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The Allgemeine SS {{was responsible for}} enforcing the racial policy of Nazi Germany and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units of troops within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), ran the concentration camps and extermination camps. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the <b>neutralization</b> of any opposition, policing the German people for their commitment to Nazi ideology, and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>neutralization</b> of Ottoman {{naval forces}} in the region, Aretusa {{and the rest of}} the Italian ships then {{commenced}} a bombardment campaign against the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a blockade of the city of Al Hudaydah on 26 January. On 27 July and 12 August, Aretusa, her sister ship Caprera, and Piemonte conducted two bombardments of Al Hudaydah. During the second attack, they destroyed an Ottoman ammunition dump. With the threat of an Ottoman attack greatly reduced, the High Command thereafter began to withdraw forces from the Red Sea Squadron. By the end of August, the unit was reduced to three protected cruisers, Aretusa, Caprera and two auxiliaries. On 14 October, the Ottoman government agreed to sign a peace treaty, ending the war. Aretusas career ended shortly thereafter; the Regia Marina discarded the ship in December and she was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Insoluble ionic {{compounds}} can be {{precipitated by}} mixing two solutions, {{one with the}} cation and one with the anion in it. Because all solutions are electrically neutral, the two solutions mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound, {{it is important to}} ensure they do not also precipitate. If the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they will react with one another in what is called an acid–base reaction or a <b>neutralization</b> reaction to form water. Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as spectator ions.|$|E
5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and <b>neutralization</b> by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} a refit {{in the early}} months of the war, Provence conducted anti-raider patrols with Force Y, based in Casablanca. Bretagne was also overhauled early in the war; in March 1940 she escorted a convoy to Halifax and returned with another convoy loaded with aircraft for the French Air Force. She was then ordered to join Lorraine in Force X, to be based in Alexandria to operate in concert with the British Mediterranean Fleet. Two weeks later, Bretagne was instead ordered to steam at high speed to Bizerte, to join the Force de Raid with Provence. The ships put in at Mers-el-Kébir and remained there until after the fall of France in June 1940. To prevent the ships of the French Navy from falling {{into the hands of the}} occupying Germans, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered the <b>neutralization</b> of all French warships. Force H was to deliver an ultimatum to the ships based at Mers-el-Kébir; on 3 July, the British squadron arrived outside the harbor and demanded that the ships sail with them to Britain or they would be sunk.|$|E
5|$|During {{the three}} months of his rule, Minh, his {{civilian}} Prime Minister Nguyen Ngoc Tho, and his leading military colleagues, Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim, attempted to defeat the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) non-militarily. They felt that a battleground victory was impractical or impossible and pursued a strategy of trying to politically integrate the insurgents into the mainstream. This meant an intensification of rural non-military initiatives {{and a reduction in}} armed operations. This brought them into conflict with the United States, who had plans to start bombing North Vietnam. At the same time, in January 1964, the French government of President Charles de Gaulle proposed the <b>neutralization</b> of Vietnam and the withdrawal of American forces. Khánh and his fellow plotters exploited this to spread rumors that Minh's junta was about to make a deal with Hanoi and then gained the support of the US, most notably through the chief of military forces in Vietnam, General Paul Harkins, who supported Diệm and opposed Minh's November coup.|$|E
25|$|Since {{dissociation}} is not {{an essential}} preliminary to <b>neutralization,</b> aprotic solvents are often added to 'ionizing' solvents to depress solvolysis (which is comparable to hydrolysis) of the <b>neutralization</b> product and so sharpen the endpoint.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>neutralization</b> {{required}} careful {{adjustment and}} proved unsatisfactory when used {{over a wide}} range of frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Fixation of the C1a protein on viral {{surfaces}} {{has also}} been shown to enhance <b>neutralization</b> of viral pathogens.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of an acid with a base {{is called a}} <b>neutralization</b> reaction. The products of this reaction are a salt and water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neutralization,</b> or deacidification, which {{treats the}} oil with sodium {{hydroxide}} or sodium carbonate {{to pull out}} free fatty acids, phospholipids, pigments, and waxes.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{applications}} follows from its <b>neutralization</b> properties, including reducing the spread of white phosphorus from incendiary bullets inside an afflicted soldier's wounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{conclusion of}} the Solomon Islands campaign and the <b>neutralization</b> of Rabaul meant {{that there was an}} excess of Marine Fighter Squadrons available in the Pacific at this time.|$|E
25|$|Naphthalene {{sulfonate}} polymers {{are produced}} by treating naphthalenesulfonic acid with formaldehyde, followed by <b>neutralization</b> with sodium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide. These products are commercially sold in solution (water) or dry powder form.|$|E
25|$|Unreliable tests: There {{are other}} types of allergy testing methods that are unreliable, {{including}} applied kinesiology (allergy testing through muscle relaxation), cytotoxicity testing, urine autoinjection, skin titration (Rinkel method), and provocative and <b>neutralization</b> (subcutaneous) testing or sublingual provocation.|$|E
25|$|The PAF's strikes {{were based}} on the same {{strategy}} of pre-emptive <b>neutralization</b> of enemy air capability used by the Israeli Air Force against Egyptian and Arab air forces in Operation Focus during the Six-Day War of 1967.|$|E
25|$|In this {{traditional}} representation an acid–base <b>neutralization</b> reaction is formulated as a double-replacement reaction. For example, {{the reaction of}} hydrochloric acid, HCl, with sodium hydroxide, NaOH, solutions produces a solution of sodium chloride, NaCl, and some additional water molecules.|$|E
25|$|It {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{endogenous}} antioxidants produced by the cells, participating directly in the <b>neutralization</b> of free radicals and reactive oxygen compounds, as well as maintaining exogenous antioxidants such as vitamins C and E in their reduced (active) forms.|$|E
25|$|An acid–alkali {{reaction}} {{is a special}} case of an acid–base reaction, where the base used is also an alkali. When an acid reacts with an alkali salt (a metal hydroxide), the product is a metal salt and water. Acid–alkali reactions are also <b>neutralization</b> reactions.|$|E
25|$|The Avenger-class {{ships were}} {{designed}} to have very low acoustic and magnetic signatures to avoid detonating mines. While most modern warships have steel hulls, the Avengers have wooden hulls with an external coating of fiberglass. They are equipped with sophisticated minehunting and classification sonar as well as remotely operated mine <b>neutralization</b> and disposal systems.|$|E
25|$|The reverse {{reaction}} is possible, {{and thus the}} acid/base and conjugated base/acid are always in equilibrium. The equilibrium {{is determined by the}} acid and base dissociation constants (Ka and Kb) of the involved substances. A special case of the acid-base {{reaction is}} the <b>neutralization</b> where an acid and a base, taken at exactly same amounts, form a neutral salt.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{reactions}} {{can result}} in the formation or dissociation of molecules, that is, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of atoms within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds. Oxidation, reduction, dissociation, acid-base <b>neutralization</b> and molecular rearrangement {{are some of the}} commonly used kinds of chemical reactions.|$|E
25|$|In March 1961, the Geneva Conference of 1954 reconvened with wider {{participation}} {{to reconsider}} the <b>neutralization</b> of the Kingdom of Laos. Since the 1954 Agreement was signed, a Pathet Lao insurgency had burgeoned, threatening the national sovereignty. This would eventually result {{in an attempt to}} settle the Laotian Civil War, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos signed on 23 July 1962.|$|E
25|$|As a {{preliminary}} step, Ceaușescu promoted Drăghici to {{second in command}} while placing a former subordinate in the Interior Ministry. This promotion actually {{marked the beginning of}} the end for Drăghici's career. By talking about liberalization, Ceaușescu made predictable the <b>neutralization</b> of the two most prominent exponents of political repression and cultural dogmatism of the Gheorghiu-Dej era: Drăghici and Răutu, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Eventually the {{technique}} of <b>neutralization</b> was developed whereby the RF transformer connected to the plate (anode) would include an additional winding in the opposite phase. This winding would be connected back to the grid through a small capacitor, and when properly adjusted would cancel the Miller capacitance. This technique was employed {{and led to the}} success of the Neutrodyne radio during the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|C. difficile toxins have a {{cytopathic}} effect in cell culture, and <b>neutralization</b> of any effect observed with specific antisera is the practical {{gold standard for}} studies investigating new CDI diagnostic techniques. Toxigenic culture, in which organisms are cultured on selective media and tested for toxin production, remains the gold standard and is the most sensitive and specific test, although it is slow and labor-intensive.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{relaxation}} {{methods such as}} temperature {{jump and}} pressure jump, in which a pre-mixed system initially at equilibrium is perturbed by rapid heating or depressurization {{so that it is}} no longer at equilibrium, and the relaxation back to equilibrium is observed. For example, this method has been used to study the <b>neutralization</b> H3O+ + OH− with a half-life of 1 μs or less under ordinary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Currently (2016), most global MSG is {{produced}} by bacterial fermentation in a process similar to making vinegar or yogurt. Sodium is added later, for <b>neutralization.</b> During fermentation, Corynebacterium species, cultured with ammonia and carbohydrates from sugar beets, sugar cane, tapioca or molasses, excrete amino acids into a culture broth from which L-glutamate is isolated. The Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Company developed industrial fermentation to produce L-glutamate.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} procedure ISO 719 describes {{a test of}} the extraction of water-soluble basic compounds under neutral conditions: 2 g of glass, particle size 300–500 μm, is kept for 60 min in 50 ml de-ionized water of grade 2 at 98°C; 25 ml of the obtained solution is titrated against 0.01mol/l HCl solution. The volume of HCl required for <b>neutralization</b> is classified according to the table below.|$|E
25|$|These two glycoproteins are {{the targets}} of {{numerous}} serologic reactions and tests including <b>neutralization</b> and hemagglutination inhibition. The alphaviruses show various degrees of antigenic cross-reactivity in these reactions and this forms {{the basis for the}} seven antigenic complexes, 30 species and many subtypes and varieties. The E2 protein is the site of most neutralizing epitopes, while the E1 protein contains more conserved, cross-reactive epitopes.|$|E
25|$|Prefixed nouns {{distinguish}} two genders, {{masculine and}} feminine; two numbers, singular and plural; and two states, conventionally {{referred to by}} their French names as état libre (free state) and état d'annexion (annexed state) and glossed as EL and EA. Gender and number are all explicitly marked, but historical and synchronic sound changes have in some cases resulted in the <b>neutralization</b> {{of the difference between}} EL and EA.|$|E
