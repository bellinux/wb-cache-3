25|$|The Willey Amendment freed no slaves on West Virginia {{becoming}} a state, the first slaves {{to be freed}} would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> until 1867. There was no provision for freedom for any slave over 21 years of age. As per the census of 1860 the Willey Amendment would have left at least 40% of West Virginia's slaves unemancipated, over 6,000 slaves. Many of those under 21 would have served as much as 20 years in slavery. The phrasing of the amendment also created a window of two weeks during which the children of slaves born between June 20, 1863 and July 4, 1863, would be born into slavery.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Hamilton, Commander Broome and Commodore Dowding {{took these}} signals to {{indicate}} {{an attack by}} Tirpitz was imminent. The convoy was immediately ordered to scatter, with the escorting destroyers ordered to join the cruiser force and the merchantmen to proceed independently. The Admiralty's decision and orders would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> vehement had only British warships been concerned but the idea the first joint Anglo-American operation under British command might involve the destruction of American as well as British units may well have influenced the decisions of First Sea Lord Pound. The Allied cruiser squadron was already beyond the standing orders set by the Admiralty and if no new orders had gone out, the cruisers {{would have had to}} withdraw some time afterwards in any case. The earlier cruiser movement did not influence the tactical situation but in light of later knowledge, the decision was deemed precipitate.|$|E
25|$|The Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny {{is skeptical}} of the {{traditional}} viewpoint and questions Yuan Shao's supposed advantage over Cao Cao. De Crespigny argues that Yuan Shao's hold on his nominal territories were not as secure as Cao Cao, who had aggressively campaigned to stabilize his surroundings. Taking note that Yuan Shao took ten years to eliminate the isolated Gongsun Zan, de Crespigny suggests {{that it was not}} due to indecisiveness that Yuan Shao did not take advantage of Cao Cao's temporal weaknesses, but that Yuan Shao might not have had the men to spare for such ventures. From such a perspective, Yuan Shao, faced with the ever-growing threat of his former ally Cao Cao, concentrated his force in a direct approach to Cao Cao's headquarters in hope that such a strike would overwhelm his enemy. Though he was outwitted and defeated by Cao Cao, Yuan Shao's decisions might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> foolish as numerous traditional historians and commentators have said.|$|E

25|$|Watchmen, as {{guardians of}} {{the peace of the}} streets, were {{supposed}} to deal within the confines of their beat with drunkenness, soliciting, and petty tumults, and detaining suspicious characters. However, they were often willing to concede privileges to certain prostitutes, consequently provoking parishioners' complains about their inability to enforce the law. Indeed, even the prostitutes taken up by the watch were frequently released after a few hours in the watch house without seeing any magistrate. The circumstances changed when theft or some other kind of crimes were committed. Public opinion, and Moreton too, firmly believed that these women needed to be restrained in their liberties not only for their vices and immoralities but because they represented a real threat to common living. Unfortunately, most of the times this was easier said than done. Watchmen had the power to apprehend criminals within the boundaries of their parish, and they were liable to be reprimanded for leaving their beats. So they might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> inclined to chase a woman who crossed into another parish in order to avoid being taken.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{praised the}} melodic and rhythmic hook, but was {{disappointed}} that Madonna's voice is [...] "drowned out by Timbaland's farting four-note synth – which might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> bad if the tracks were fresher and if the whole enterprise didn't feel quite so joylessly mechanical." [...] At the 51st Grammy Awards, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] garnered Madonna, Timberlake and Timbaland a nomination in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category. Dutch musician Junkie XL also earned a nomination in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category for his remix of the song.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} musical development, while both {{children}} had advanced, Wolfgang's progress had been extraordinary, beyond all expectation. The Mozarts were now known throughout the musical establishments and royal courts of Northern Europe. As {{well as the}} encounters in palaces with kings, queens and nobility, the children could converse in several languages; the tour represented, for them, an outstanding education. However, these advantages had been gained at a price; Grimm, in Paris, noting the stress and strain on Wolfgang in particular, had feared that [...] "so premature a fruit might fall before maturing". However, Hildesheimer, while also expressing concerns, concludes that if Mozart's death {{at the age of}} 35 was caused by the exertions of his childhood, the intervening decades would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> productive, and obvious symptoms of decline would have manifested themselves.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} contemporaries noted Rommel's vanity. In the {{memorandum}} regarding [...] Rommel's betrayal, Martin Bormann remarked, [...] "He had himself photographed {{from dawn to}} dusk... He is so vain he does not wear glasses". (Rommel was near-sighted in one eye and far-sighted in the other.) Some modern authors, such as Storbeck, are more sympathetic. He states that Rommel's perceived vanity developed {{as a reaction to}} the pressure aristocratic and high-bourgeois colleagues put on him. The psychologist Norman F. Dixon remarks that although Rommel showed towards Hitler an admiration that later faded, he did not display the urge to submit himself to higher authority or powerful father figures, considering that had he been such a person, he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> outspoken or risked himself in the struggle against people like Himmler, Keitel or Jodl.|$|E
500|$|While Ray Davies {{had been}} {{instructed}} {{at the time}} to write [...] "Beatle-type" [...] material for commercial reasons, [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] was written as a more R composition. The song is centred on a guitar riff by Dave Davies, which has since been referred to as [...] "instantly identifiable." [...] American musicologist Robert Walser described [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] as [...] "the first hit song built around power chords." [...] The song has since been labeled as an early influence of the heavy metal genre, with critic Denise Sullivan of AllMusic writing, You Really Got Me' remains a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal." [...] However, Dave Davies has since rejected the idea that the song is heavy metal, saying [...] "I've never really like that term, heavy metal. I think, in all humility, it was the first heavy guitar riff rock record. Just because of the sound—if you played it on a ukulele, it might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|No {{account or}} allusion to Philip's presumed {{conversion}} to Christianity survives. The Byzantinist and Arabist Irfan Shahîd, who argues {{in favor of}} Philip's Christianity in Rome and the Arabs, assumes {{that he had been}} a Christian before becoming emperor. He argues, therefore, that {{there is no need to}} explain the absence of evidence for Philip's conversion in contemporary Christian literature. Trachonitis, equidistant from Antioch in the north and Bosra in the south, and sited on a road connecting the two, could have been Christianized from either direction. Even if he was not himself Christian, Philip would probably have been familiar with Christians in his hometown as well as Bosra and other nearby settlements. Hans Pohlsander, a classicist and historian arguing against accounts of Philip's Christianity, allows that Philip [...] "may have been curious about a religion which had its origins in an area so close to his place of birth. As an eastern provincial rather than an Italian, he may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> intense in his commitment to the traditional Roman religion that he could not keep an open mind on other religions." [...] He also accepts that Philippopolis probably contained a Christian congregation during Philip's childhood. For the scholar of religion Frank Trombley, however, the absence of evidence for the early Christianization of Philippopolis makes Shahîd's assumption that Philip was Christian from early childhood unmerited.|$|E

500|$|Carla Gugino {{revealed}} in August 2009 {{that she had}} begun taking singing lessons for her part in the film. One month later, Jamie Chung announced {{in an interview with}} E! Entertainment that recording for the soundtrack had begun. When Emily Browning auditioned for her role as Babydoll, Snyder asked her to sing because of the musical element in the film. He told her to record herself while singing, and the actress did a version of [...] "Killing Me Softly with His Song". Browning later said, [...] "I was terrified, of course. But he liked it. I have no idea why, but he thought me capable of carrying a tune on the screen." [...] The crew liked the result and offered her to sing more songs. At first it was just a cover of [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by Pixies, which ended up becoming a duet with Yoav, but the producers extended to three songs. One, a version by [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] by Eurythmics, is used to open the movie, and Bates noted that [...] " [...] first line of dialogue is actually 27 minutes into the film so it is an interesting way to introduce her character." [...] The other came up when during a discussion on her favorite music with Snyder, Browning said that The Smiths was her favorite band. Several weeks later, Snyder informed her that he had acquired the rights to The Smiths' song [...] "Asleep", and asked her if she would like to perform the lead vocals. At first, she hesitated, saying that [...] "The offer was flattering, but there was so much pressure". However, she recorded the song and according to Snyder, The Smiths' frontman Morrissey was happy with the result. Regarding Browning's performance, de Vries considered that [...] "having Emily sing—essentially commenting in song on her character’s situation in the film — provided an interesting texture, real resonance and depth, and tied the music to the visuals in a way that might otherwise <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> clearly defined", and Snyder found the actress' [...] "emotional delivery" [...] to [...] "make the songs even more poignant". To work with Browning between takes, de Vries used a portable recording rig on a room with a piano - [...] "a very distressed, out-of-tune, almost-unusable instrument (...) which turned out to have real charm in it." ...|$|E

[...] Around this time, in addition to portraiture, Whistler experimented with early color photography and with lithography, creating a series featuring London architecture and the human figure, mostly female nudes. In 1891, with help from his close friend Stéphane Mallarmé, Whistler's Mother was purchased by the French government for 4,000 francs. This was much less than what an American collector might have paid, but that would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> prestigious by Whistler's reckoning.|$|E

2500|$|In 1397, Denmark {{entered into}} a {{personal}} union with Norway and Sweden, united under Queen Margaret I. The three countries were {{to be treated as}} equals in the union.

Thus, much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm. The Protestant Reformation spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the Count's Feud civil war, Denmark converted to Lutheranism in 1536.
