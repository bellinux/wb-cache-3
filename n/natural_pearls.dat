5|$|Most {{molluscs}} with shells {{can produce}} pearls, {{but only the}} pearls of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells are lined with nacre, are valuable. The best <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. <b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> form when a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have long}} {{been a part of}} the diet of coastal and {{riparian}} human populations. Oysters were cultured in ponds by the Romans, and mariculture has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food. Modern knowledge of molluscan reproductive cycles has led to the development of hatcheries and new culture techniques. A better understanding of the potential hazards of eating raw or undercooked shellfish has led to improved storage and processing. Pearl oysters (the common name of two very different families in salt water and fresh water) are the most common source of <b>natural</b> <b>pearls.</b> The shells of bivalves are used in craftwork, and the manufacture of jewellery and buttons. Bivalves have also been used in the biocontrol of pollution.|$|E
25|$|Pearl oysters are not {{closely related}} to true oysters, being members of a {{distinct}} family, the feathered oysters (Pteriidae). Both cultured pearls and <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> can be extracted from pearl oysters, though other molluscs, such as the freshwater mussels, also yield pearls of commercial value.|$|E

50|$|When a {{cultured pearl}} with a bead nucleus is X-rayed, it reveals a {{different}} structure {{to that of}} a <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> (see diagram). A beaded cultured pearl shows a solid center with no concentric growth rings, whereas a <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> shows a series of concentric growth rings. A beadless cultured pearl (whether of freshwater or saltwater origin) may show growth rings, but also a complex central cavity, witness of the first precipitation of the young pearl sac.|$|R
50|$|The Arco Valley Pearl {{is a white}} 575 carat g <b>natural</b> blister baroque <b>pearl</b> {{with pink}} and yellow overtones. It {{measures}} 79 x 41 x 34 mm. It is the largest <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> outside a museum and the second biggest ever. Mongolian emperor Khubilai Khan reportedly gave it to Marco Polo.|$|R
25|$|Pearl {{farmers can}} culture a pearl {{by placing a}} nucleus, usually a piece of {{polished}} mussel shell, inside the oyster. In three to seven years, the oyster can produce a perfect pearl. These pearls are not as valuable as <b>natural</b> <b>pearls,</b> but look exactly the same. In fact, {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, when several researchers discovered how to produce artificial pearls, the cultured pearl market has far outgrown the natural pearl market.|$|E
5000|$|Single <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> {{are often}} sold as collectors' items, or set as centerpieces in unique jewelry. Very few matched strands of <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> exist, {{and those that}} do often sell for {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars. (In 1917, jeweler Pierre Cartier purchased the Fifth Avenue mansion that is now the New York Cartier store in exchange for a matched double strand of <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> Cartier had been collecting for years; at the time, it was valued at US$1 million.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> {{are nearly}} 100% calcium {{carbonate}} and conchiolin. It {{is thought that}} <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> form under a set of accidental conditions when a microscopic intruder or parasite enters a bivalve mollusk and settles inside the shell. The mollusk, irritated by the intruder, forms a pearl sac of external mantle tissue cells and secretes the calcium carbonate and conchiolin to cover the irritant. This secretion process is repeated many times, thus producing a pearl. <b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> come in many shapes, with perfectly round ones being comparatively rare.|$|E
40|$|Meta- {{material}} like {{behavior of}} <b>natural</b> <b>Pearl</b> are studied in this work. This work makes {{an attempt to}} analyze the Left Handed Maxwellian (LHM) properties of Pearl surface. The investigations carried out on <b>natural</b> <b>Pearl</b> specimen are optical reflectance and optical absorbance. Optical reflectance of Pearl surface with plane polarized monochromatic light {{in the form of}} verification of Fresnel equation shows distinct difference with that of conventional ordinary material. The UV-VIS analysis is also carried out for further analysis. The results obtained from the optical reflectance characteristics using polarized light indicate LHM behavior as expected for a LHM (type II or type II) meta-material. The overall analysis of the results shows the LHM character of Pearl surface...|$|R

50|$|Pearl of Puerto, also {{referred}} to as Pearl of Puerto Princesa (Perlas ng Puerto) is considered to be the largest <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> in the world.

50|$|Previously, <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> {{were found}} {{in many parts of}} the world. Present day natural {{pearling}} is confined mostly to seas off Bahrain. Australia also has one of the world's last remaining fleets of pearl diving ships. Australian pearl divers dive for south sea pearl oysters to be used in the cultured south sea pearl industry. The catch of pearl oysters is similar to the numbers of oysters taken during the natural pearl days. Hence significant numbers of <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> are still found in the Australian Indian Ocean waters from wild oysters. X-ray examination is required to positively verify <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> found today.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{setting and}} arrangement of these nine gems {{is shown in}} the illustration. A ruby (representing the Sun) is always in the center, surrounded (clockwise from the top) by a diamond, a <b>natural</b> <b>pearl,</b> red coral, hessonite, a blue sapphire, cat's eye, a yellow sapphire, and an emerald. This is the same placement as the Nava-graha Yantra.|$|R
50|$|Mikimoto was {{extremely}} successful at promoting the new Japanese cultured pearl {{to the international}} jewellery industry. He challenged and won against the French <b>natural</b> <b>pearl</b> dealers in the French Courts who attempted to prevent the Japanese from describing their new cultured pearls as “pearls”. The French Court concluded that cultured pearls were indeed pearls. Mikimoto became the most famous Japanese pearl farmer.|$|R
50|$|Pierre Cartier {{established}} the New York City branch in 1909, moving in 1917 to 653 Fifth Avenue, the Neo-Renaissance mansion of Morton Freeman Plant (son of railroad tycoon Henry B.

50|$|A well-equipped gem testing {{laboratory}} can distinguish <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> from cultured pearls by using gemological X-ray equipment {{to examine the}} center of a pearl. With X-rays it is possible to see the growth rings of the pearl, where the layers of calcium carbonate are separated by thin layers of conchiolin. The differentiation of <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> from non-beaded cultured pearls can be very difficult without the use of this X-ray technique.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{cultured pearls}} are less {{valuable}} than <b>natural</b> <b>pearls,</b> whereas imitation pearls have almost no value. One way that jewelers can {{determine whether a}} pearl is cultured or natural {{is to have a}} gemlab perform an X-ray examination of the pearl. If X-rays reveals a nucleus, the pearl is likely a bead-nucleated saltwater pearl. If no nucleus is present, but irregular and small dark inner spots indicating a cavity are visible, combined with concentric rings of organic substance, the pearl is likely a cultured freshwater. Cultured freshwater pearls can often be confused for <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> which present as homogeneous pictures which continuously darken toward the surface of the pearl. <b>Natural</b> <b>pearls</b> will often show larger cavities where organic matter has dried out and decomposed.|$|E
50|$|Al-Khor is in {{northern}} Qatar, 57 km away from Doha. Until the early 1940s, {{it was a}} harbour and a centre for the pearl industry.

50|$|The Pearl of Kuwait is a pearl {{that was}} bought in 2004 by its current owners, Bond Street, London {{jewellers}} Symbolic & Chase, and named the Pearl of Kuwait {{in recognition of}} the Persian Gulf waters in which many pearls have been found.

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the Oriental Pride is most likely the Middle East, where {{in the region of}} Basra, <b>natural</b> <b>pearls</b> were found more than 100 years ago.
