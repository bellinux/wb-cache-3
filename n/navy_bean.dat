40|$|BACKGROUND: Cooked bean powders are a {{promising}} novel protein and fiber source for dogs, which have demonstrated potential to alter microbial composition and function for chronic {{disease control and}} prevention. This study aimed to determine the impact of cooked <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> powder fed as a staple food ingredient on the fecal microbiome of healthy adult pet dogs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Fecal samples from healthy dogs prior to dietary control and after 4 wk of dietary treatment with macro- and micronutrient matched diets containing either 0 or 25 % cooked navy beans (n =  11 and n =  10, respectively) were analyzed by 454 -pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene. There were few differences between dogs fed the control and <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> diets after 4 wk of treatment. These data indicate {{that there were no}} major effects of <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> inclusion on microbial populations. However, significant differences due to dietary intervention onto both research diets were observed (i. e., microbial populations at baseline versus 4 wk of intervention with 0 or 25 % <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> diets). After 4 wk of dietary intervention on either control or <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> diet, the Phylum Firmicutes was increased and the Phyla Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria were decreased compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: No negative alterations of microbial populations occurred following cooked <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> intake in dogs, indicating that bean powders may be a viable protein and fiber source for commercial pet foods. The highly variable microbial populations observed in these healthy adult pet dogs at baseline is one potential reason for the difficulty to detect alterations in microbial populations following dietary changes. Given the potential physiological benefits of bean intake in humans and dogs, further evaluation of the impacts of cooked <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> intake on fecal microbial populations with higher power or more sensitive methods are warranted...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to establish the effects of different milling techniques on the solvent-free electrostatic separation process for <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour as well as to develop a model based on near infrared and fluorescence data to determine protein and starch content of the protein- and starch-enriched fractions using multivariate methods (i. e. partial least squares regression). Data fusion was used to combine the NIR and fluorescence spectra to try to achieve a model that had better predictability for protein and starch content. Protein content was measured using Kjeldahl digestion and starch content was measured using a dinitrosalicylic (DNS) acid array. The samples used in the NIR model are <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour fractions from the electrostatic separation and the raw <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour. There are 102 samples that are split in calibration (82 samples) and validation (20 samples) sets. The protein-enriched samples are collected from the electrostatic plate while the starch-enriched fractions are collected {{from the bottom of the}} electrostatic separator. The acquisition of reproducible infrared and fluorescence data from powder samples was successfully achieved. The pin milled <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour had an average particle size almost three times smaller than the regular milled <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour which could have contributed to the a high protein content (40. 7 %) of the protein-enriched fraction. The regular milled flour had a much higher protein extraction under optimum conditions but could only achieved a lesser protein content (32. 5 %) for the protein-enriched fraction. The regular milled <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour also seemed to have particles disaggregate in the triboelectric charging process. Multivariate methods and pre-treatment techniques were compared for the NIR spectra of the <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour fractions from electrostatic separation to measure the protein and starch content. The best method used Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) pre-treatment with PLS regressions and had R 2 values of prediction of 0. 965 and 0. 912 for protein and starch content, respectively. The N-way partial least squares (NPLS) regression was still a good model seeing as the R 2 values of prediction for starch and protein content were 0. 946 and 0. 885, respectively. Two fluorophores were observed in <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour: tryptophan and an unknown peak. It was observed that the starch model using the fluorescence dataset was highly correlated to the model’s predicted protein content (R 2 of 0. 978). The protein content model was better calibrated using the training set as well as providing a better prediction using the validation set for both NIR and fluorescence spectra. Data fusion was achieved by combining the NIR and unfolded fluorescence spectra of the <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour fractions. The individual techniques had undergone pre-treatment separately and yielded the best model for determining protein content. Starch content was best determined using only the NIR spectra...|$|E

40|$|Navy {{beans are}} legumes with highly nutritious qualities. However they are underutilised in the {{processed}} food industry {{due to the}} undesirable bloating, abdominal discomfort and excessive flatulence associated with ingestion of the raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) present in them. If a suitable technology were available to sufficiently reduce the concentration of RFOs then <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour could find application in many food production processes. The traditional method for decreasing RFO content in navy beans and other similar legumes has been through soaking in large quantities of water, thereby leaching the RFOs from the bean. However this is a slow process and results in the depletion of all water soluble solids (up to 25 % of the dry weight of the bean). The leaching process can be sped up dramatically through the decrease in particle size achieved by milling the beans into <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour prior to the addition of water. However this process makes dewatering of the flour difficult. Rates of moisture uptake and RFO leaching were characterised for <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour and dehulled <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> cotyledons demonstrating that RFO leaching is slower but of a similar magnitude as moisture uptake and that these rates are dramatically increased with decrease in particle size. The addition of α-galactosidase to the leaching water enables the rapid removal of RFOs from <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour without the need to separate the flour from the leaching water because the RFOs leached out of the flour are hydrolysed into simple sugars. Galactose {{is a product of}} the hydrolysis of RFOs and its presence at high concentrations can result in the inhibition of α-galactosidase. However at the concentrations likely to be experienced during RFO reduction in bean flour the inhibition effect is minimal. Rates of hydrolysis were studied for raffinose and stachyose hydrolysis by α-galactosidase in the concentration range expected during processing of <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour. Enzymatic processing using very small amounts of moisture addition was investigated demonstrating partial RFO removal at moisture contents as low as 28 % (wet basis). Reduction in RFO content to a level at which the flatus response is negligible can be achieved at moisture contents as low as 38 % (wet basis) which significantly minimises the drying required to produce a dry <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> ingredient or could allow direct application in an extrusion process. The application of α-galactosidase at low moisture content is a novel process for the depletion of RFOs in <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour. The mechanism for this process is explained by preliminary modelling of moisture and RFO diffusion which demonstrates how partial RFO removal is possible. From these mechanisms a series of commercially practical methods for RFO depletion of <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour were explored for several targeted product applications. This process also has potential applications for low moisture enzyme processing in a range of food and other biological systems. The simple processes developed in this work open up the commercial use of <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> flour for the food industry to develop products that take advantage of its functional and nutritional properties without the negative nutritional problems usually associated with this material...|$|E

40|$|Acreage {{allocation}} {{decisions by}} farmers {{have been identified}} as one of the causes of the decline in Michigan's <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> production. Growing navy beans in successive years or in short rotation with other crops that return little organic matter to the soil has been shown to adversely affect soil structure, depletion of organic matter, and increase disease and pest problems. Furthermore, {{a large portion of the}} instability present in the quantity of navy beans produces, and therefore in prices and revenue, is directly related to variability in acreage allocation decisions of growers. In consequence, the problem as it is seen in this paper is one of resource allocation decisions by farmers. There is a need for defining a <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> production strategy, which takes into consideration the overall crop production system. Given the importance of the <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> sector in Michigan and its continuous decline in production, this paper focuses on risk and farm planning issues associated with rotations in which this crop is grown. In addition, it investigates a point raised regarding assessing the correlation between instability of other crops in the grower's rotation with <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> instability. The general approach taken in this paper is that of a "system management perspective" where the goal is to determine system inputs given a system structure and a set of desired system outputs. The specific objectives are: (1) To analyze the degree of income variability associated with the most common field crops grown in Michigan's Saginaw Valley, and the rotations in which they are grown; (2) To investigate the relationship between stability and level of farm income for different <b>navy</b> <b>bean</b> cropping sequences; and (3) To determine the optimum continuously repeatable crop sequence mix and the optimum time for field operations for a 400 acre Saginaw Valley farm growing navy beans in rotation with sugar beets, corn, wheat, and soybeans.
