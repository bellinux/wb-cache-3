40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> is to {{preserve}} features such as edge or corners, and to reduce noise. However, it is dif-ficult to preserve them after <b>noise</b> <b>filtering,</b> because most of <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> algorithms have the characteristic of low pass filter, which results {{in the loss of}} signal components with high frequencies like edge or corners. <b>Noise</b> <b>filtering</b> methods using diffusion equation try to solve this problem, and improve it to some extent. Edge detector has been used in filtering methods with diffusion equation to determine the speed of diffusion term, so the performance of them depends on the edge detection algorithm to some extent. Previous <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> approaches of diffusion equation use a simple gradient edge detector to determine the speed of diffusion. Also, each channel of color images are filtered separately, which result in the filtered image with distortion or blurring. In this paper, we propose a new <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> method for color images using diffusion equation and edge map esti-mated with K-means clustering algorithm together. 1...|$|R
40|$|Different {{communication}} {{technologies are}} used for the transmission of information such as wireless communication, satellite communication etc. Power Line Communication (PLC) {{is one of the}} technologies using existing power cables for the transmission of information. Power cables are not designed for data transmission. So the PLC environment contains different types of noise. This paper presents a novel approach for removing periodic impulsive noise from OFDM based power line communication system. The noise is detected using periodic impulsive noise detection algorithm and the <b>noise</b> is <b>filtered</b> by using adaptive notch filter. An adaptive filter using LMS algorithm is also designed to suppress periodic impulsive noise. Then compare the Bit Error Rate (BER) of PLC system without <b>noise</b> <b>filtering,</b> with <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> using notch <b>filter</b> and with <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> using adaptive filtering based on LMS algorithm.

A classic filter used to remove impulse noise is the median filter, at the expense of signal degradation.

5000|$|DC-7 began {{beta testing}} in July 2007 {{and was later}} {{released}} in October 2007. It boasted a significantly different algorithm included into the FFT-based continuous <b>noise</b> <b>filter</b> called [...] "Artifact Suppression" [...] mode. The new algorithm reportedly reduced the aliasing and artifacting that often accompanies noise reduction with such filters. Of equal significance was {{the introduction of a}} simple Virtual Phono Preamp for accurate and simplified equalization of almost any record format. Another milestone was the development and inclusion of an [...] "EZ Enhancer" [...] filter which simplified the otherwise difficult process of sound enhancement that often follows the noise reduction process. DC-7 also introduced a simple [...] "Tune Library" [...] which allowed a user to catalogue the progression and restoration of audio files in a database style view. Somewhere along the line it was also decided to include the Spectrogram View previously only found in the DC-Forensics range with the basic audio restoration/Live software version to aid in manual impulse noise removal and other challenging operations. Together, these changes provided very successful and popular in the field of audio restoration tools and was likened to the transition [...] "from regular television to High Definition".|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} techniques for <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> of {{remotely sensed images}} based on Multi-resolution Analysis (MRA). Multiresolution techniques provide a coarse-to-fine and scale-invariant decomposition of images for image interpretation. The multiresolution image analysis methods {{have the ability to}} analyze the image in an adaptive manner, capturing local information as well as global information. Further, noise being {{one of the biggest problems}} in image analysis and interpretation for further processing, is effectively handled by multi-resolution methods. The paper aims at the analysis of <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> of image using wavelets and curvelets on high resolution multispectral images acquired by the Quickbird and medium resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite systems. To improve the performance of <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> an iterative thresholding scheme for wavelets and curvelets is proposed for restoring the image from its noisy version. Two comparative measures are used for evaluation of the performance of the methods for denoising. One of them is the signal to noise ratio and the second is the ability of the <b>noise</b> <b>filtering</b> scheme to preserve the sharpness of the edges. By both of these comparative measures, the curvelet with iterative threshold has proved to be better than the others.
