5|$|There are {{two types}} of wetting: <b>non-reactive</b> wetting and active wetting.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{is used in}} some {{high-temperature}} {{industrial processes}} where ordinarily <b>non-reactive</b> substances become reactive. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop <b>non-reactive</b> chemical compounds {{that could be used}} as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would come into contact with the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel <b>non-reactive</b> chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
5|$|Argon {{is used in}} {{the poultry}} {{industry}} to asphyxiate birds, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during gassing. Its <b>non-reactive</b> nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.|$|E
5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in <b>non-reactive</b> compounds such as naphtha.|$|E
5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, {{hydrochloric}} acid is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering oxidation-reduction reaction. It {{is one of the}} least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the <b>non-reactive</b> and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mollusk shells, various other natural history specimens {{are susceptible to}} this form of decay, including eggshells and some fossils and mineral samples that are composed of calcium carbonate. This condition is of concern for museum scientists, and also for anyone who has a private collection of specimens of these kinds. In order to avoid Bynesian decay, the use of metal, <b>non-reactive</b> polymers and acid-free materials of archival quality are preferred over common paper, wood-based materials, ordinary glues and varnishes in collection environments. Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is <b>non-reactive</b> with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
25|$|Thyroperoxidase oxidises two I− to form I2. Iodide is <b>non-{{reactive}},</b> {{and only}} the more reactive iodine {{is required for the}} next step.|$|E
25|$|One style, Focused Attention (FA) meditation, {{entails the}} {{voluntary}} focusing of {{attention on a}} chosen object. The other style, Open Monitoring (OM) meditation, involves <b>non-reactive</b> monitoring {{of the content of}} experience from moment to moment.|$|E
25|$|Anodized {{aluminium}} {{has had the}} {{naturally occurring}} layer of aluminium oxide thickened by an electrolytic process to create a surface that is hard and <b>non-reactive.</b> It is used for sauté pans, stockpots, roasters, and Dutch ovens.|$|E
25|$|Enameled {{cast iron}} cooking vessels {{are made of}} cast iron covered with a {{porcelain}} surface. This creates a piece that has the heat distribution and retention properties of cast iron combined with a <b>non-reactive,</b> low-stick surface.|$|E
25|$|Bisacrylamide (N,N-Methylenebisacrylamide) (C7H10N2O2; mW: 154.17) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used cross linking agent for polyacrylamide gels. Chemically it {{can be thought of as}} two acrylamide molecules coupled head to head at their <b>non-reactive</b> ends. Bisacrylamide can crosslink two polyacrylamide chains to one another, thereby resulting in a gel.|$|E
25|$|Pottery {{has been}} used to make {{cookware}} from before dated history. Pots and pans made with this material are durable (some could last a lifetime or more)and are inert and <b>non-reactive.</b> Heat is also conducted evenly in this material. They can be used for both cooking in a fire pit surrounded with coals and for baking in the oven.|$|E
25|$|Loading aids; most PAGE {{systems are}} loaded {{from the top}} into wells within the gel. To ensure that the sample sinks {{to the bottom of}} the gel, sample buffer is {{supplemented}} with additives that increase the density of the sample. These additives should be non-ionic and <b>non-reactive</b> towards proteins to avoid interfering with electrophoresis. Common additives are glycerol and sucrose.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{polyester}} OH- or COOH- end {{groups are}} transformed into dead or <b>non-reactive</b> end groups, e.g. formation of vinyl ester end groups through dehydration or decarboxylation of terephthalate acid, {{reaction of the}} OH- or COOH- end groups with mono-functional degradation products like mono-carbonic acids or alcohols. Results are decreased reactivity during re-polycondensation or re-SSP and broadening the molecular weight distribution.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{should be}} stored in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area and away from any flammable or combustible substances. It should {{be stored in}} a container composed of <b>non-reactive</b> materials such as stainless steel or glass (other materials including some plastics and aluminium alloys may also be suitable). Because it breaks down quickly when exposed to light, it should be stored in an opaque container, and pharmaceutical formulations typically come in brown bottles that block light.|$|E
25|$|The enamel over steel {{technique}} {{creates a}} piece that has the heat distribution of carbon steel and a <b>non-reactive,</b> low-stick surface. Such pots are much lighter than most other pots of similar size, are cheaper to make than stainless steel pots, {{and do not have}} the rust and reactivity issues of cast iron or carbon steel. Enamel over steel is ideal for large stockpots and for other large pans used mostly for water-based cooking. Because of its light weight and easy cleanup, enamel over steel is also popular for cookware used while camping.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Thomas Midgley, Jr. {{improved}} {{the process of}} synthesis and led the effort to use CFC as refrigerant to replace ammonia (NH3), chloromethane (CH3Cl), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), which are toxic but were in common use. In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low boiling point, low toxicity, and to be generally <b>non-reactive.</b> In a demonstration for the American Chemical Society, Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to blow out a candle in 1930.|$|E
25|$|PTFE {{is used as}} a {{non-stick}} coating for pans and other cookware. It is <b>non-reactive,</b> partly because of the strength of carbon–fluorine bonds, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. Also, it is frequently employed as coating on catheters; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause hospital-acquired infections.|$|E
25|$|Cladding is a {{technique}} for fabricating pans {{with a layer of}} efficient heat conducting material, such as copper or aluminum, covered on the cooking surface by a <b>non-reactive</b> material such as stainless steel, and often covered on the exterior aspect of the pan ("dual-clad") as well. Some pans feature a copper or aluminum interface layer that extends over the entire pan rather than just a heat-distributing disk on the base. Generally, the thicker the interface layer, especially in the base of the pan, the more improved the heat distribution. Claims of thermal efficiency improvements are, however, controversial, owing in particular to the limiting and heat-banking effect of stainless steel on thermal flows.|$|E
25|$|Getters act by {{chemically}} {{combining with}} residual or infiltrating gases, but {{are unable to}} counteract (<b>non-reactive)</b> inert gases. A known problem, mostly affecting valves with large envelopes such as cathode ray tubes and camera tubes such as iconoscopes, orthicons, and image orthicons, comes from helium infiltration. The effect appears as impaired or absent functioning, and as a diffuse glow along the electron stream inside the tube. This effect cannot be rectified (short of re-evacuation and resealing), and is responsible for working examples of such tubes becoming rarer and rarer. Unused ("New Old Stock") tubes can also exhibit inert gas infiltration, {{so there is no}} long-term guarantee of these tube types surviving into the future.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is best {{stored in}} an {{airtight}} container made of ceramic, glass, or <b>non-reactive</b> metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the coffee to release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of coffee to absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E
25|$|Chewing gum {{is rather}} shelf stable {{because of its}} <b>non-reactive</b> nature and low {{moisture}} content. The water activity of chewing gum ranges from 0.40-0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from 3-6%. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not {{required by law to}} be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead {{to the end of the}} product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.|$|E
25|$|DSC makes a {{reasonable}} initial safety screening tool. In this mode the sample will be {{housed in a}} <b>non-reactive</b> crucible (often gold or gold-plated steel), and which {{will be able to}} withstand pressure (typically up to 100 bar). The presence of an exothermic event can then be used to assess the stability of a substance to heat. However, due to a combination of relatively poor sensitivity, slower than normal scan rates (typically 2–3 °C/min, due to much heavier crucible) and unknown activation energy, it is necessary to deduct about 75–100 °C from the initial start of the observed exotherm to suggest a maximal temperature for the material. A much more accurate data set can be obtained from an adiabatic calorimeter, but such a test may take 2–3 days from ambient at a rate of a 3 °C increment per half-hour.|$|E
25|$|In pre-Medieval {{times it}} is {{believed}} that the batch of raw materials was heated to a temperature where it partially melted, the unmelted parts removed and washed of <b>non-reactive</b> components, and added to the next batch. Because of the strong way that the Si/Na/Ca compositions affect the melting temperature, the resulting glass was of a fairly uniform composition regardless of the recipe of raw materials used. The melting temperatures of the Si/K/Ca glasses are not so strongly affected by composition, resulting in glasses of more varied composition, so the self-limiting features of the Na system that allowed the traditional partial-batch method to produce consistent compositions, ceased to apply, and a new way of controlling consistency had to be developed. The wide variety of compositions, together with historical accounts of glassmaking, suggest that the new method involved melting a complete batch of raw materials, removing the unreactive components as scum.|$|E
500|$|The {{spore print}} is white. Individual spores are smooth, [...] to tear-shaped in profile, [...] to {{ellipsoid}} or cylindric in face or back view, with dimensions of 4.2–6.2 by 2.8–3.5µm. They are inamyloid and [...] (<b>non-reactive</b> to staining with Melzer's reagent and Methyl blue, respectively). The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are club-shaped to cylindric and 15.4–21 by 3.5–5µm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are scattered to infrequent, inconspicuous, and 17.5–31.5µm long. Their shape ranges from a contorted cylinder to roughly club-shaped to irregularly diverticulate (with short offshoots approximately {{at right angles to}} the main stem). There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue is made of interwoven hyphae that are <b>non-reactive</b> to Melzer's reagent. These hyphae are smooth and thin-walled, measuring 2.8–6.4µm in diameter. The cap tissue is made of hyphae that is interwoven below the center of the cap, radially oriented over the gills, and inamyloid. These hyphae are smooth, thin-walled, and 2.8–7µm in diameter. The cap cuticle is a thin layer of smooth thin-walled hyphae that are more or less radially oriented, bent-over, cylindric and somewhat gelatinous, measuring 2–5µm in diameter; they are occasionally diverticulate. The cuticle of the stem is made of a layer of parallel, vertically oriented smooth, thin-walled hyphae that are 2–4.2µm in diameter, pale yellowish brown in alkali mounting solution. The stem has moderately thin-walled and smooth cystidia that are resemble [...] or contorted cylinders. They are hyaline in alkali, and 3.5–7µm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E
2500|$|This {{internal}} {{compensation is}} provided to achieve unconditional {{stability of the}} amplifier in negative feedback configurations where the feedback network is <b>non-reactive</b> and the closed loop gain is unity or higher.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphorus is {{important}} for all organisms {{because it is a}} component of DNA and RNA and is involved in cell metabolism as a component of ATP and ADP. [...] Also, phosphorus is not found in large quantities in freshwater systems, limiting photosynthesis in primary producers, making it the main determinant of lentic system production. [...] The phosphorus cycle is complex, but the model outlined below describes the basic pathways. [...] Phosphorus mainly enters a pond or lake through runoff from the watershed or by atmospheric deposition. [...] Upon entering the system, a reactive form of phosphorus is usually taken up by algae and macrophytes, which release a <b>non-reactive</b> phosphorus compound as a byproduct of photosynthesis. [...] This phosphorus can drift downwards and become part of the benthic or profundal sediment, or it can be remineralized to the reactive form by microbes in the water column. [...] Similarly, <b>non-reactive</b> phosphorus in the sediment can be remineralized into the reactive form. [...] Sediments are generally richer in phosphorus than lake water, however, indicating that this nutrient may have a long residency time there before it is remineralized and re-introduced to the system.|$|E
2500|$|Lithium hydride is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula LiH. This alkali metal hydride is a colorless solid, although commercial samples are grey. Characteristic of a salt-like, or ionic, hydride, {{it has a}} high melting point and is not soluble but reactive with all organic and protic solvents; it is soluble and <b>non-reactive</b> with certain molten salts such as lithium fluoride, lithium borohydride, and [...] sodium hydride. With a molecular mass of slightly less than 8, it is the lightest ionic compound.|$|E
2500|$|Sunkist Growers {{was having}} {{problems}} with its own manufacturing process. Lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid, with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative. Sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time, and the colorimetric methods then in use, such as readings from litmus paper, did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them. [...] Chemist Glen Joseph at Sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogen-ion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically, but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes, and <b>non-reactive</b> glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile.|$|E
2500|$|In tanuki bonsai, {{a living}} tree is joined to an {{interesting}} piece of deadwood {{to create a}} composite in the driftwood style. The deadwood usually has {{the form of a}} weathered tree trunk, or at least its lower portion. To add living material to the deadwood, a groove or channel is first carved into it. The living tree (usually a young juniper, because of the species' vigor, flexibility, and ability to endure harsh shaping) is fixed within the channel using <b>non-reactive</b> nails or screws, wire wrappings, or clamps. Over time, the young tree grows into the deadwood channel, which disguises {{the fact that it is}} a separate entity. Once firmly in place, the nails, screws, or other affixing devices are removed, and the living tree is cultivated and shaped with typical bonsai techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{approach}} {{was to develop}} a polymeric matrix which involved both a reactive liquid healing agent and a catalyst. [...] While undamaged, these were kept structurally separate. The liquid agent was contained inside <b>non-reactive</b> reservoirs within the material, while the catalyst was dispersed throughout the polymer. [...] Once the material was damaged and a crack occurred, the reservoirs broke open, and capillary action caused the liquid agent to disperse into the damaged area, where it reacted with the catalyst and solidified to seal the crack. [...] They have studied both the use of a contained healing agent and a dispersed catalyst, and the use of a dispersed healing agent and a contained catalyst. [...] Using [...] dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and Grubbs' catalyst in an epoxy matrix, [...] polycyclopendiene was formed to seal cracks, recovering up to 75% of the original fracture toughness.|$|E
