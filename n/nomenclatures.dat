50|$|Botanical <b>nomenclature</b> is the formal, {{scientific}} {{naming of}} plants. It is related to, but distinct from taxonomy.

Botanical <b>nomenclature</b> is governed by the International Code of <b>Nomenclature</b> for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), which replaces the International Code of Botanical <b>Nomenclature</b> (ICBN).

25|$|The {{most widely}} used banding methods are G-banding (Giemsa-banding) and R-banding (reverse-banding). These {{techniques}} produce a characteristic pattern of contrasting dark and light transverse bands on the chromosomes. Banding {{makes it possible to}} identify homologous chromosomes and construct chromosomal <b>nomenclatures</b> for many species. Banding of homologous chromosomes allows chromosome segments and rearrangements to be identified. The banded karyotypes of 850 mammalian species were summarized in the Atlas of Mammalian Chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|After {{separation}} of red cell membranes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with periodic acid-Schiff staining (PAS) four glycophorins have been identified. These {{have been named}} glycophorin A, B, C and D in order of the quantity present in the membrane – glycophorin A being the most and glycophorin D the least common. A fifth (glycophorin E) has been identified within the human genome but cannot easily be detected on routine gel staining. In total the glycophorins constitute ~2% of the total erythrocyte membrane protein mass. Confusingly these proteins are also known under different <b>nomenclatures</b> but they are probably {{best known as the}} glycophorins.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 2002, {{there were}} in {{academic}} literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists {{with an interest in}} population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely. The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between <b>nomenclatures.</b>|$|E

[...] The Navajo Code Talkers were mainly Marines. As {{it was determined that}} phonetically spelling out all military terms letter by letter into words—while in combat—would be too time-consuming, some terms, concepts, tactics and instruments of modern warfare were given uniquely formal descriptive <b>nomenclatures</b> in Navajo (for example, the word for [...] "shark" [...] being used to refer to a destroyer, or [...] "silver oak leaf" [...] to the rank of lieutenant colonel). Several of these coinages, such as gofasters referring to running shoes or ink sticks for pens, entered Marine Corps vocabulary. They are commonly used today to refer to the appropriate objects.|$|E
2500|$|The Standard Cabin series, {{with its}} cabin comfort, {{proved to be}} popular with private pilot owners. Many were {{purchased}} by small commercial aviation firms and non-aviation businesses. With the onset of World War II, examples were impressed into the air forces of many Allied nations, including the US (USAAC and US Navy), the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. USAAC Designations assigned to standard cabin Wacos included UC-72D (for 2 VKS-7s), UC-72K (for 1 YKS-7) and UC-72M (for 2 [...] ZKS-7s). Most were used as utility aircraft, however a small number were operated by the US Civil Air Patrol, conducting anti-submarine patrols off the US coastline from March 1942 to August 1943 armed with 50- or 100-pound bombs. In 1942 21 VKS-7F were built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program for use as navigational trainers. A single impressed YKC {{referred to as the}} Little Waco, RAF serial AX697, was used by the British Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) along with a Waco Custom Cabin ZGC-7 Big Waco to support their activities behind Axis lines. After World War II, some impressed UC-72 cabins returned to civilian operations, and a very few were additionally revamped (with FAA approval) with new engine models. This further complicated model nomenclature, though the FAA generally retained original <b>nomenclatures</b> for a given re-engined airframe.|$|E

We can only now remark that, on the one hand, classifications and <b>nomenclatures</b> have aided science by continually subdividing the subject-matter of research, and giving fixity and diffusion to the truths disclosed; and that on the other hand, they have caught from it that increasing quantitativeness, and that progress from considerations touching single phenomena to considerations touching the relations among many phenomena, which we have been describing.|$|E
60|$|True and Magnetic Bearings.--The {{confusion}} between true {{and magnetic}} bearings is a continual trouble, {{even to the}} most experienced travellers. Sir Thomas Mitchell's exploring party very nearly sustained a loss by mistaking the one for the other. I recommend that the points of the compass, viz. North, N.N.E., etc., should be solely used for the traveller for his true bearings; and the degrees, as 25 degrees (or N. 25 degrees E.), for his magnetic. There would then be no reason why the two <b>nomenclatures</b> should interfere with one another, for a traveller's recollection of the lay of a country depends entirely upon true bearings--or sunrise, sunset, and the stars--and is expressed by North, N.N.E., etc.; but his surveying data which find no place in his memory, but are simply consigned to his note-book, are necessarily registered in degrees. To give every facility for carrying out this principle, a round of paper should be pasted {{in the middle of}} the traveller's pocket-compass card, just large enough to hide the ordinary rhumbs, but leaving uncovered the degrees round its rim. On this disk of paper the points of the compass (true bearings) should be marked so as to be as exact as possible for the country about to be visited.|$|E

6000|$|This of Markgrafs (GRAFS of the Marches, MARKED Places, or Boundaries) was {{a natural}} {{invention}} in that state of circumstances. It did not quite originate with Henry; but was much perfected by him, he first recognizing how essential it was. On all frontiers he had his GRAF (Count, REEVE, G'REEVE, whom some think to be only GRAU, Gray, or SENIOR, the hardiest, wisest steel-GRAY man he could discover) stationed on the MARCK, strenuously doing watch and ward there: the post of difficulty, of peril, and naturally of honor too, nothing of a sinecure by any means. Which post, like every other, always {{had a tendency to}} become hereditary, if the kindred did not fail in fit men. And hence have come the innumerable Markgraves, Marquises, and such like, of modern times: titles now become chimerical, and more or less mendacious, as most of our titles are,--like so many BURGS changed into [...] "Boroughs," [...] and even into [...] "Rotten Boroughs," [...] with Defensive BURGhers of the known sort: very mournful to discover. Once Norroy was not all pasteboard! At the heart of that huge whirlwind of his, with its dusty heraldries, and phantasmal <b>nomenclatures</b> now become mendacious, there lay, at first, always an earnest human fact.

The world, which is now divine only to the gifted, was then divine to whosoever would turn his eye upon it. He stood bare before it face to face. [...] "All was Godlike or God:"--Jean Paul still finds it so; the giant Jean Paul, who has power to escape out of hearsays: but there then were no hearsays. Canopus shining down over the desert, with its blue diamond brightness (that wild blue spirit-like brightness, far brighter than we ever witness here), would pierce {{into the heart of}} the wild Ishmaelitish man, whom it was guiding through the solitary waste there. To his wild heart, with all feelings in it, with no speech for any feeling, it might seem a little eye, that Canopus, glancing out on him from the great deep Eternity; revealing the inner Splendor to him. Cannot we understand how these men worshipped Canopus; became what we call Sabeans, worshipping the stars? Such is to me the secret of all forms of Paganism. Worship is transcendent wonder; wonder for which there is now no limit or measure; that is worship. To these primeval men, all things and everything they saw exist beside them were an emblem of the Godlike, of some God.|$|E

In the Northern parts, these immigrating Sclaves were of the kind called Vandals, or Wends: they spread themselves as far west as Hamburg and the Ocean, south also far over the Elbe in some quarters; while other kinds of Sclaves were equally busy elsewhere.
