Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported these events as linked.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, {{alternative}} rock's mainstream prominence declined due to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> {{that caused}} grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival.

Emo attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and 2000s, other alternative rock bands emerged, including The White Stripes, The Strokes and Arcade Fire.|$|E
