5|$|Arbroath Male Voice Choir was {{established}} in 1934 and {{is now one of}} only a few male voice choirs left in Scotland. At 2012 the choir has over 45 members drawn <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> Arbroath but also Angus and Dundee. The choir's musical director is Sheena Guthrie. They sing a mix of songs from classical, through Scottish, showtunes to pop. The ensemble perform two main concerts each year (one at Christmas and another in spring) and several smaller events for good causes. The choir are notable for attracting well known, often international singers to their annual spring concert as guests. In recent years these have included, Jamie McDougall, Karen Cargill, Gordon Cree, Cheryl Forbes and Colette Ruddy. March 2012 saw international diva Lesley Garrett as the choir's special guest.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth in}} human numbers is frightening. I've seen {{wildlife}} under mounting human pressure {{all over the}} world, and it's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> human economy or technology. Behind every threat is the frightening explosion in human numbers. I've never seen a problem that wouldn't be easier to solve with fewer people – or harder, and ultimately impossible, with more.|$|E
25|$|About 20–25% of {{patients}} with Graves' disease will suffer from clinically obvious Graves' ophthalmopathy, and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> the eye signs of hyperthyroidism. Only 3 to 5% will develop severe ophthalmopathy. However, when subjected to closer inspection (e.g. by magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits) many more patients have evidence of ophthalmopathy. It is estimated that for every 100,000 persons, 16 women and 3 men have Graves' ophthalmopathy every year.|$|E

25|$|Stallard's plan brought strong {{opposition}} <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> the NCU and RTTC {{but from the}} cycling establishment, particularly from the veteran administrator and writer George Herbert Stancer.

25|$|Then, after a 6 years break, {{which only}} saw the {{publication}} of L'accélérateur atomique, a Spirou spoof by Lewis Trondheim {{not included in the}} official series (but which received Dupuis' approval), the series went back to a more classical storytelling mode with seasoned cartoonists Jean-David Morvan (writing) and José-Luis Munuera (art). The latter kept close to the spirit of Franquin's graphical style, while bringing its own touch of manga-inspired modernism. Morvan and Munuera's Spirou is partly remarkable in that it uses background elements and secondary characters from the whole history of the title, and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> Franquin's period.|$|E
25|$|During the 2010 census 'The Cat Women of Gir Forest' counted {{more than}} 411 lions in the park, and 523 in 2015.

These women {{have worked hard to}} win cooperation <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> local villagers but also from maaldharis, the semi-nomadic tribal herdsmen who live in the sanctuary. While tourist numbers are increasing people do not seem to understand the phenomena taking place. The lions are almost tame in the presence of these female guards.|$|E

25|$|The {{clinical}} study Human Sexual Response {{was published by}} Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> the publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution {{that had already been}} well underway for some time.|$|E
25|$|The Bauhaus at Weimar, Germany {{was founded}} in 1919 by Walter Gropius. The {{philosophy}} underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from {{the ideas of the}} Arts and Crafts movement in England and the Deutscher Werkbund. Among the teachers were Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Josef Albers, Anni Albers, and László Moholy-Nagy. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the Nazi party gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of degenerate art, 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of avant-garde art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.|$|E
25|$|In the US, Latino/as who {{identify}} as LGBTQ face scrutiny <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> their community at home but within their community at school as well, especially within {{a high school}} or college preparation experience. While facing scrutiny by family and community to maintain gender normality in order to prosper in the US, they also must face scrutiny from their fellow peers, mentors and administration in the educational environment. One such scrutiny that they face is a lack of acceptance and recognition as a separate educational entity within sexual educational programs, provided by many high school education districts. Lesson plans that are developed for the high school learning environment put emphasis on Heteronormativity of the and Latino students. Latinas are viewed as needing to have less interest in sexual education, while Latinos were told to maintain focus and to take the education seriously. When teachers are prompted to explain more about sexual education for lesbians or gays, the teachers or educators assume the student body to be heterosexual and refuse or regard the questions as immature and outside the scope of their teaching.|$|E

[...] Themal concludes that this is the position Biden desires, and that in a campaign [...] "he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average American, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> the terrorist threat, but from the lack of health assistance, crime, and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world." ...|$|E

Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, called the album a [...] "ferocious blast of high-energy thrash metal", weakened by a thin production. Similarly, Steve Huey from AllMusic observed that the album is [...] "as raw as Megadeth gets". However, Huey noted that the riffs and compositions weren't completely developed, and called Mustaine's vocals [...] "amateurish at best". Chad Bowar from About.com said that Megadeth were still [...] "finding their way" [...] on their debut album, but remarked that the band showed great potential through angry and passionate musicianship.|$|E

Circumstellar disks like this are sometimes referred to as [...] "decretion disks", which is material being actively ejected by the star as opposed to [...] "accretion disks" [...] which involves material falling toward the star.|$|E
500|$|MacArthur's {{vision of}} what was {{required}} of an officer came <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> his recent experience of combat in France but also {{from that of the}} occupation of the Rhineland in Germany. The military government of the Rhineland had required the Army to deal with political, economic and social problems but he had found that many West Point graduates had little or no knowledge of fields outside of the military sciences. During the war, West Point had been reduced to an officer candidate school, with five classes graduated in two years. Cadet and staff morale was low and hazing [...] "at an all-time peak of viciousness". MacArthur's first change {{turned out to be the}} easiest. Congress had set the length of the course at three years. MacArthur was able to get the four-year course restored.|$|E
500|$|For Richardson, parting {{company with}} the Old Vic brought the {{advantage}} of being free, for the first time, to earn substantial pay. The company's highest salary had been £40 a week. [...] After his final Old Vic season he made two films in quick succession for Korda. The first, Anna Karenina, with Vivien Leigh, was an expensive failure, although Richardson's notices in the role of Karenin were excellent. The second, The Fallen Idol, had notable commercial and critical success, and won awards in Europe and America. It remained one of Richardson's favourites of his films. In Miller's words, [...] "Carol Reed's sensitive direction drew faultless performances <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>from</b> Ralph as Baines (the butler and mistakenly suspected murderer), but also from Michèle Morgan as his mistress, Sonia Dresdel as his cold-hearted wife, and especially from Bobby Henrey as the distraught boy, Felipe." ...|$|E
