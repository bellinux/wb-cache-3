Methods Spectacle magnification was determined for ophthalmic lenses in air and for water environments.

The direction of chromostereopsis can be reversed by moving both artificial pupils in a nasal direction or temporal direction with respect to the centers of the <b>natural</b> <b>pupils.</b> Moving the artificial pupils nasally induces blue-in-front-of-red stereopsis and moving them temporally has the opposite effect. This is because moving the pupil changes the position of the optic axis, but not the visual axis, thus changing the sign of transverse chromatic aberration. Therefore, changes in the magnitude and sign of transverse chromatic aberration brought about by changing the lateral distance between small artificial pupils are accompanied by equivalent changes in chromostereopsis ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} amount of {{straylight}} in natural pupils and dilated pupils in pseudophakic eyes 6 weeks and 1 year after cataract extraction. SETTING: Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. METHODS: This study evaluated patients with bilateral age-related cataract who had cataract surgery with implantation of an aspheric Tecnis ZA 9003 or spherical Sensar AR 40 e intraocular lens (IOL). Stray light measurements were performed with a C-Quant straylight meter 6 weeks after surgery (with natural pupils) and 1 year after surgery (with natural and dilated pupils) in a randomly chosen eye. Retroillumination photographs of dilated pupils were taken to document posterior capsule opacification. The main outcome variable for straylight measurements was the logarithmic straylight parameter, log(s). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were evaluated. There was a statistically significant decrease in straylight in a <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> between 6 weeks (mean 1. 44 log[s]) and 1 year (mean 1. 30 log[s]) postoperatively (P =. 012). The straylight parameter was greater after dilation (mean 1. 48 log[s]) than with a <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> (1. 29 log[s]) at 1 year (P =. 012). This difference was greater when more anterior capsule was visible in the pupillary area (P =. 031). CONCLUSIONS: Stray light decreased significantly {{in the first year}} after cataract surgery. Furthermore, it increased with increasing pupil size, which was associated with a capsulorhexis smaller than the pupil. This indicates the capsulorhexis should be as large as possible to prevent straylight, especially under low-luminance conditions when the pupil is large...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} normative reference ranges for higher-order wavefront error (HO-WFE), compare {{these values}} {{with those in}} common ocular pathologies, and evaluate treatments. Methods. A review of 17 major studies on HO-WFE was made, involving data {{for a total of}} 31, 605 subjects. The upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval (CI) for HO-WFE was calculated from the most comprehensive of these studies using normal healthy patients aged 20 to 80 years. There were no studies identified using the <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> size for subjects, and for this reason, the HO-WFEwas tabulated for pupil diameters of 3 to 7 mm. Effects of keratoconus, pterygium, cataract, and dry eye on HO-WFE were reviewed and treatment efficacy was considered. Results. The calculated upper limit of the 95 %CI for HO-WFE in a healthy normal 35 -year-old patient with amesopic pupil diameter of 6 mmwould be 0. 471 Km (471 nm) root-mean-square or less. Although the normal HO-WFE increases with age for a given pupil size, it is not yet completely clear how the concurrent influence of age-related pupillary miosis affects these findings. Abnormal ocular conditions such as keratoconus can induce a large HO-WFE, often in excess of 3. 0 Km, par-ticularly attributed to coma. For pterygium or cortical cataract, a combination of coma and trefoil was more commonly induced. Nuclear cataract can induce a negative spherical HO-WFE, usually in excess of 1. 0 Km. Conclusions. The upper limit of the 95 %CI for HO-WFE root-mean-square is about 0. 5 Kmwith normal physiological pupil sizes. With ocular pathologies, HO-WFE can be in excess of 1. 0 Km, although many devices and therapeutic and surgical treatments are reported to be highly effective at minimizing HO-WFE. More accurate normative reference ranges for HO-WFE will require future studies using the subjects ’ <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> size...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccommodation stimulus–response {{function}} (ASRF) and {{its relationship}} to retinal image quality were investigated using a modified wavefront sensor. Ten subjects were presented with six vergence stimuli between 0. 17 D and 5 D. For each vergence distance, ocular wavefronts and subjective visual acuity were measured. Wavefronts were analysed for a fixed 3 -mm pupil diameter and for <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> sizes. Visual Strehl ratio computed in the frequency domain (VSOTF) and retinal images were calculated for each condition tested. Subjective visual acuity was significantly improved at intermediate vergence distances (1 D and 2 D; p< 0. 01), and only decreased significantly at 5 D compared with 0. 17 D (p< 0. 05). VSOTF magnitude was associated with subjective visual acuity and VSOTF peak location correlated with accommodation error. Apparent accommodation errors due to spherical aberration were highly correlated with accommodation lead and lag for natural pupils (R 2 = 0. 80) but not for fixed 3 -mm pupils (R 2 < 0. 00). The combination of higher-order aberrations and accommodation errors improved retinal image quality compared with accommodation errors or higher order aberrations alone.

40|$|Purpose: Phenylephrine {{hydrochloride}} (PHCl), {{a commonly}} used mydriatic agent, causes {{a small but}} significant deterioration of accommodation. The relative roles of pharmacology and optics in this deterioration, however, remain unascertained. The study determined the combined impact of PHCl concentration (pharmacology) and pupil size (optics) on the static and dynamic characteristics of accommodation. Materials and Methods: A total of 16 emmetropic Indian adults viewed a high-contrast visual target that switched between 67 and 33 cm viewing distance (1. 5 D stimulus) with their right eye (left eye occluded using infrared transmitting filter) through <b>natural</b> <b>pupils</b> and through 8, 6, 4, and 1 mm diameter artificial pupils. This protocol was repeated once without PHCl and once each with 2. 5 %, 5 %, and 10 % PHCl. Consensual accommodation of the left eye was recorded using infrared photorefraction (60 Hz). Results : Relative to no PHCl, the horizontal pupil diameter of left eye was significantly larger (P 0. 4 for all). The response magnitude and peak velocity also decreased significantly with pupil diameter, at similar rates for the no PHCl and the three PHCl conditions (P < 0. 001 for all). Conclusion: The reduction in accommodative performance with all drug concentrations and with pupil diameter suggests independent roles of pharmacology and optics in determining accommodative performance with PHCl. The reduction in accommodative performance is, however, modest and may be clinically irrelevant in Indian eyes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the intraocular straylight value after cataract surgery. Methods. In this study, 76 eyes from 62 patients were subdivided into three groups. A hydrophobic acrylic, a hydrophilic acrylic, and a PMMA IOL were respectively, implanted in 24 eyes, 28 eyes, and 24 eyes.

40|$|Purpose: To explore whether {{adaptation}} {{reduces the}} interocular visual latency differences and the induced Pulfrich effect {{caused by the}} anisocoria implicit in small-aperture monovision. Methods: Anisocoric vision was simulated in two adults by wearing in the non-dominant eye for 7 successive days, while awake, an opaque soft contact lens (CL) with a small, central, circular aperture. This was repeated with aperture diameters of 1. 5 and 2. 5 mm. Each day, monocular and binocular pattern-reversal Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) were recorded. Additionally, the Pulfrich effect was measured: {{the task of the}} subject was to state whether a a 2 -deg spot appeared in front or behind the plane of a central cross when moved left-to-right or right-to-left on a display screen. The retinal illuminance of the dominant eye was varied using neutral density (ND) filters to establish the ND value which eliminated the Pulfrich effect for each lens. All experiments were performed at luminance levels of 5 and 30 cd/m 2. Results: Interocular differences in monocular VEP latency (at 30 cd/m 2) rose to about 12 – 15 ms and 20 – 25 ms when the CL aperture was 2. 5 and 1. 5 mm, respectively. The effect was more pronounced at 5 cd/m 2 (i. e. with larger <b>natural</b> <b>pupils).</b> A strong Pulfrich effect was observed under all conditions, with the effect being less striking for the 2. 5 mm aperture. No neural adaptation appeared to occur: neither the interocular differences in VEP latency nor the ND value required to null the Pulfrich effect reduced over each 7 -day period of anisocoric vision...|$|R
40|$|UNLABELLED: A {{comprehensive}} review {{of the effect of}} multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) designs on postoperative ocular straylight was performed. Studies reporting straylight values obtained with the <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> using the C-Quant device after uneventful multifocal IOL implantation were included. The IOLs were categorized based on their material characteristics; that is, hydrophobicity and presence of colored chromophores. Age adjustment was achieved using the straylight age-dependency norm for pseudophakic eyes. This norm also served as a reference for comparing mean straylight levels of the various IOLs. The literature review identified 10 studies reporting 9 multifocal IOL designs. The hydrophilic IOLs showed less straylight than the hydrophobic IOLs by 0. 08 log(s) (P =. 001). Blue violet light-filtering IOLs showed less straylight than standard IOLs by 0. 04 log(s), which was not statistically significant (P =. 32). Hydrophobicity was a factor that significantly affected straylight in multifocal IOLs.

40|$|Aim: A {{modified}} wavefront sensor {{was used}} to investigate the effect of accommodative errors on retinal image quality. Methods: Ten subjects were presented with six vergence stimuli between 0. 17 D and 5. 00 D. For each vergence distance, subjective visual acuity and ocular wavefronts were measured. Wavefronts were analysed for <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> sizes and for a fixed threemillimetre pupil diameter. Visual Strehl ratios computed in the frequency domain (VSOTF) and retinal images were calculated for each condition. Results: Subjective visual acuity was significantly improved at intermediate vergence distances (1. 00 D and 2. 00 D; p < 0. 01), and decreased significantly at 5. 00 D compared with 0. 17 D (p < 0. 05). VSOTF magnitude was associated with subjective visual acuity and VSOTF peak location correlated with accommodation error. Apparent accommodative errors due to spherical aberration were highly correlated with accommodative lead and lag for natural pupils (R 2 = 0. 80) and accounted for 93 per cent of the total accommodative error. Conclusions: The combination of higher-order aberrations and accommodative errors improved retinal image quality compared with accommodative errors or higher order aberrations alone. The one to one stimulus/response slope {{should not be considered}} as ideal in the presence of higher-order aberrations.

40|$|PURPOSE: To find a {{contrast}} sensitivity test {{that can be}} used clinically to evaluate interventions aimed at minimizing spherical aberration and determine the circumstances under which these tests should be performed. SETTING: Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. METHODS: Contrast sensitivity tests were performed using 2 experimental designs. Design 1 was with a <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> under mesopic and photopic conditions. Design 2 was with a 5. 0 mm artificial pupil after cycloplegia under photopic conditions only. Two computerized tests (vertical sine-modulated gratings [VSG] and Holladay circular sine-modulated patterns [HACSS]) and 5 chart tests (Pelli-Robson, acuity-measuring letter charts at low contrast [2. 5 % and 10 %], VectorVision, and edge contrast sensitivity) were used. Spherical aberration was assessed with a Hartmann-Shack wavefront analyzer. RESULTS: Forty-nine healthy subjects aged 20 to 35 years (n = 24) and 55 to 70 years (n = 25) participated. Design 2 showed a significant relationship between contrast sensitivity and spherical aberration with the HACSS at 3 cycles per degree (cpd) (P =. 03) and 6 cpd (P =. 01) and with the VSG at 6 cpd (P =. 01). Design 1 yielded no significant relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Using an artificial pupil, a relationship between contrast sensitivity and spherical aberration was established with the VSG and HACSS tests but not with the chart tests. No test showed a relationship using natural pupils under either lighting condition. Chart tests are unsuitable for uncovering contrast sensitivity differences related to differences in spherical aberration, as typically found in healthy phakic eyes...|$|E

Methods: A computer-controlled Badal optometer {{was used to}} measure “just-noticeable ” blur (depth of focus) and “objectionable ” blur limits to positive lens defocus with <b>natural</b> <b>pupils.</b> Blur tolerance was defined as the difference between the just-noticeable and objectionable blur limits while viewing three 20 / 50 high-contrast letters. The personality battery contained two scales (12 items) from our previous study and an additional 51 personality items hypothesized to be related to blur tolerance. In addition, several “sensory irritability ” items (e. g., loud music really annoys me; I can’t stand wearing scratchy clothes.) that may relate to blur tolerance were added to the battery. MediaLab software was used to administer the questionnaire battery. Eighty-six normally-sighted subjects (median 59 years, range 42 to 86 years; median refractive error 0 DS, range- 6. 25 to + 5. 25 DS; visual acuity < 20 / 25) completed both aspects of the study. Results: The range of individual blur tolerances (0 to 1. 4 D) was similar to the young group (p= 0. 90). The personality scales exhibited acceptable reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 72 to 0. 87). The “Low Self-Confidence ” and “Disorganization ” scales developed in the previous study were significantly correlated with blur tolerance (r = 0. 27, 0. 26) in this new population.

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between monochromatic aberrations {{of the human}} eye and myopia has been investigated extensively {{over the past decade}} or so but the results are inconclusive. Wide age range, narrow refractive error range and large individual variations are common confounding factors in previous studies. To address these shortcomings, we conducted a two-part study. The first part set out to determine whether the monochromatic aberrations in myopic eyes are different from those in the non-myopic eyes in adults. Subjects were drawn from a narrow age band to minimise the confounding effect of age. The second part of this study compared the monochromatic aberrations of the more myopic and less myopic eyes of anisometropes. Methods: Monochromatic aberrations were measured for 5 mm pupils using the Complete Ophthalmic Analysis System (COAS) Wavefront Analyzer in 116 subjects with refractive spherical equivalent between - 10. 38 D and + 1. 38 D and in 26 anisometropes. Measurements were done in a dark room with <b>natural</b> <b>pupils.</b> The refractive errors, corneal curvatures and axial lengths of the eyes were measured under natural accommodation. Results: Highly myopic eyes had significantly smaller root mean square (RMS) values of fourth order (p = 0. 015) and spherical aberrations (p = 0. 009) than non-myopic eyes. The correlation coefficient was 0. 2354 (p = 0. 011) between fourth-order aberrations and refractive spherical equivalents and 0. 2817 (p = 0. 002) between spherical aberration and refractive spherical equivalents. Less myopic eyes of the anisometropes showed significantly larger total higher-order, third-order and spherical aberrations than the more myopic eyes (p < 0. 05, p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 01, respectively). Conclusions: Our study shows that spherical aberration is associated with refractive error. More myopic eyes tended to have smaller amounts of spherical aberration, however, the 'cause or effect' question remains. Longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate the {{relationship between}} monochromatic aberrations and refractive development. School of Optometr...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} effects of ocular {{lubricants}} on higher order aberrations in normal and self-diagnosed dry eyes. Methods: Unpreserved hypromellose drops, Tears Again™ liposome spray and a combination of both were administered to the right eye of 24 normal and 24 dry eye subjects following classification according to a 5 point questionnaire. Total ocular higher order aberrations, coma, spherical aberration and Strehl ratios for higher order aberrations were measured using the Nidek OPD-Scan III (Nidek Technologies, Gamagori, Japan) at baseline, immediately after application and after 60. min. The aberration data were analyzed over a 5. mm <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> using Zernike polynomials. Each intervention was assessed on a separate day and comfort levels were recorded before and after application. Corneal staining was assessed and product preference recorded after the final measurement for each intervention. Results: Hypromellose drops caused an increase in total higher order aberrations (p= < 0. 01 in normal and dry eyes) and a reduction in Strehl ratio (normal eyes: p= < 0. 01, dry eyes p= 0. 01) immediately after instillation. There {{were no significant differences between}} normal and self-diagnosed dry eyes for response to intervention and no improvement in visual quality or reduction in higher order aberrations after 60. min. Differences in comfort levels failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion: Combining treatments does not offer any benefit over individual treatments in self-diagnosed dry eyes and no individual intervention reached statistical significance.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{observers}} {{experience a}} large decrement in visual acuity {{when a small}} artificial pupil is displaced from the center {{to the edge of}} the dilated <b>natural</b> <b>pupil.</b> This decrement in visual resolution, called the Campbell effect, has been attributed to the retina, the ocular optics, or a combination of the two. Given the uncertainty about the relative magnitudes of these two components over the range of spatial frequencies used in normal vision, we have obtained objective measurements of the retinal image quality and psychophysical measurements of visual performance, with decentered pupils. The contributions of monochromatic aberrations were determined by using double pass measurements of the modulus of the optical transfer function (MTF). For all of the observers, there was a substantial decrement in the MTF with decentering, showing that even when using a 1. 5 mm pupil and appropriate spherical/cylindrical refractive corrections, there is a considerable contribution of monochromatic aberrations to the effect. We have compared these optical MTFs with the psychophysical contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) measured under exactly the same conditions using green gratings generated on the screen of a color monitor. At the low and intermediate spatial frequencies considered (2 – 16 c/deg), we find the fall in the CSF is much greater than the fall in the monochromatic MTF, with the difference becoming greater as the spatial frequency increases. We show that this discrepancy can be mostly attributed to the effect of transverse chromatic aberration due to the bandwidth of the green stimulus used for the CSF measurements. In conclusion, the combination of the ocular transverse chromatic aberration and monochromatic aberrations accounts for the loss in visual sensitivity found with a decentered small pupil at low and intermediate spatial frequencies.

Methods: This prospective study included 120 eyes from 92 patients who were randomized to receive one of four lenses, including three aspheric lenses (Acrysof SN 60 WF, Tecnis ZA 9000, and Hoya Py 60 AD) and one spherical lens (Acrysof SN 60 AT). Contrast sensitivity, higher-order aberrations of the whole eye, and pupil diameter under photopic and mesopic conditions were measured 1 month postoperatively. Higher-order aberrations were decomposed into Zernike coefficients, calculated according to individual pupil diameter. The correlation between higher-order aberrations and contrast sensitivity was evaluated. Results: There were no significant differences in contrast sensitivity function between the four types of lenses under photopic conditions. However, the contrast sensitivity function and area under log contrast sensitivity function in the aspheric lenses were significantly better than in the spherical lens under mesopic conditions. Under mesopic conditions, spherical aberration in eyes with aspheric lenses was significantly lower than in eyes with spherical lenses (P &lt; 0. 05). Under photopic conditions, coma aberration had a significant negative correlation with contrast sensitivity at 12 cycles/degree. Under mesopic conditions, spherical aberration had a significant negative correlation with contrast sensitivity at 3, 6, and 12 cycles/degree with glare, and with contrast sensitivity at 6 and 18 cycles/degree without glare.

40|$|PURPOSE: Multifocal {{contact lenses}} {{have been growing}} in {{popularity}} as a modality to correct presbyopic eyes, although visual side effects such as disability glare have been reported. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of multifocal contact lenses on disability glare by means of ocular straylight. METHODS: A prospective randomized, comparative study was performed that included 16 subjects free of ocular pathology. Straylight was measured using a commercial straylight meter with the <b>natural</b> and dilated <b>pupil.</b> Participants were fitted with Proclear Multifocal (Distance/Near), ACUVUE Oasys for Presbyopia, and Air Optix Aqua Multifocal randomized to the left or right eye. Straylight measurements were repeated with the contact lens in situ after the pupil dilation. Results obtained with the dilated pupil without contact lens acted as a control. RESULTS: Diameter of the <b>natural</b> and dilated <b>pupil</b> was 2. 87 ± 0. 40 mm and 7. 45 ± 0. 86 mm, respectively (P <. 001). After pupil dilation, straylight increased from 0. 92 ± 0. 13 log(s) to 1. 04 ± 0. 11 log(s) (P <. 001). Of the four studied lenses, a significant difference was only found between Air Optix and the control group (P =. 006). The latter showed also slightly increased light scatter. CONCLUSIONS: A difference in measured straylight was found between the studied multifocal lenses. The observed variability and the straylight-pupil size dependency should be taken into account to avoid elevated straylight in multifocal contact lens wearers. The reason for the observed differences in straylight must be the subject of future studies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In a {{cataract}} procedure the {{crystalline lens}} {{is replaced by}} an Intraocular Lens (IOL), modifying the corneal (by the incision) and the internal aberration pattern (by the IOL). We studied ocular optical quality in patients with aspheric (Tecnis, Pharmacia) IOLs. We measured the change of corneal aberrations with cataract surgery and the aberrations of the aspheric IOLs in vivo. Methods: Corneal and total aberrations were measured on 10 eyes before and after phacoemulsification with aspheric IOL implantation. Corneal aberrations were measured using corneal elevation from corneal topography and custom software. Total aberrations were measured with a 2 nd-generation custom-made laser ray tracing (LRT). Sampling pupil diameters ranged from 4. 5 to 6 -mm, centered at the <b>natural</b> <b>pupil.</b> Decentration of the IOL was assessed from images captured by the back-illumination channel of the LRT system. Results: 1) The mean corneal spherical aberration (S. A) after surgery was 0. 12 ± 0. 15 microns, the mean internal S. A. was - 0. 18 ± 0. 19 microns, and mean post-operative total S. A. was - 0. 01 ± 0. 05 microns. Unlike spherical IOLs (with positive S. A) 1, aspheric IOLs tend to balance the corneal S. A., producing total S. A. closer to a younger eye. 2) Third-order aberrations (0. 33 ± 0. 17 microns) are higher than those reported for younger eyes. Vertical coma is highly correlated with vertical decentrations. 3) Corneal aberrations increase significantly after surgery, particularly astigmatism and trefoil. This increase must {{be associated with the}} incision and the implantation procedure. Conclusions: Aspheric IOLs are effective at compensating corneal spherical aberration. However, optical quality with aspheric IOLs is lower than in young eyes (mainly due to third order aberrations caused by IOL tilt and decentration, and increased corneal aberrations). On average, 3 rd order and higher aberrations are lower with aspheric than with spherical IOLs, but overall image quality (including astigmatism) is not significantly different between both type of lenses.

[EN] We {{measured}} the monochromatic image {{quality of the}} eye across a wide visual field (1200), with <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> (4 mm) and accommodation (3 diopters). The method {{is based on the}} acquisition and the posterior processing of double-pass aerial images of a point source imaged on the retina, which was kept at a fixed distance from the eye at all retinal eccentricities. The two-dimensional modulation transfer functions (MTF's) computed from the aerial images show that astigmatism is the dominant monochromatic aberration in both the fovea and the periphery and is also the major cause of variability among individuals. We found a slower decline in optical quality with eccentricity than had been found by previous measurements. Our foveal results are in close agreement with those of Campbell and Gubisch [J. Physiol. (London) 186, 558 - 578 (1966) ], but off-axis optical quality is much better than found previously by Jennings and Charman [Am. J. Optom. Physiol. Opt. 55, 582 - 590 (1978); Vision Res. 21, 445 - 454 (1981) ]. The optical system of the eye seems to follow a wide-angle lens design: the optical quality in the center (fovea) is not particularly good (it is far from the diffraction limit at this pupil size), but the modulation transfer function remains roughly constant for a wide visual field.

40|$|Purpose To {{explore the}} effect of small-aperture optics, {{designed}} to aid presbyopes by increasing ocular depth-of-focus, on measurements of the visual field. Methods Simple theoretical and ray-tracing models were used to predict the impact of different designs of small-aperture contact lenses or corneal inlays on the proportion of light passing through natural pupils of various diameters {{as a function of}} the direction in the visual field. The left eyes of five healthy volunteers were tested using three afocal, hand-painted opaque soft contact lenses (www. davidthomas. com). Two were opaque over a 10 mm diameter but had central clear circular apertures of 1. 5 and 3. 0 mm in diameter. The third had an annular opaque zone with inner and outer diameters of 1. 5 and 4. 0 mm, approximately simulating the geometry of the KAMRA inlay (www. acufocus. com). A fourth, clear lens was used for comparison purposes. Visual fields along the horizontal meridian were evaluated up to 50 ° eccentricity with static automated perimetry (Medmont M 700, stimulus Goldmann-size III; www. medmont. com). Results According to ray-tracing, the two lenses with the circular apertures were expected to reduce the relative transmittance of the pupil to zero at specific field angles (around 60 ° for the conditions of the experimental measurements). In contrast, the annular stop had no effect on the absolute field but relative transmittance was reduced over the central area of the field, the exact effects depending upon the <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> diameter. Experimental results broadly agreed with these theoretical expectations. With the 1. 5 and 3. 0 mm pupils, only minor losses in sensitivity (around 2 dB) in comparison with the clear-lens case occurred across the central 10 ° radius of field. Beyond this angle, sensitivity losses increased, to reach about 7 dB at the edge of the measured field (50 °). The field results with the annular stop showed at most only a slight loss in sensitivity (≤ 3 dB) across the measured field. Conclusion The present theoretical and experimental results support earlier clinical findings that KAMRA-type annular stops, unlike circular artificial pupils, have only minor effects on measurements of the visual field...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{how different}} amounts of induced spherical aberration (SA) affect the light distortion (LD) phenomena, tests were performed using an experimental device {{to measure the}} distortion (haloes, glare, and so on) of a point source. To simulate the effect of SA, eight different phase plates between þ 0. 300 and − 0. 300 μm of SA for a 5 -mm aperture were used in a random and double-masked experimental design. Measurements were performed {{at a distance of}} 2 m in a darkened room in 10 eyes of five subjects {{with a mean age of}} 26. 4 6. 1 years and a mean refractive error of − 0. 50 0. 70 D. Data were obtained with <b>natural</b> <b>pupil</b> and after pupil dilatation. The measurements with this experimental system showed a significant increase in all distortion parameters with cycloplegia for the phase plates with the higher positive SA (þ 0. 300 and þ 0. 150 μm). The disturbance index increased from 14. 86 6. 12 % to 57. 98 36. 20 % (p < 0. 05) with the þ 0. 300 μm plate. The same effect was observed through at a much lower rate when the eye could accommodate. Plates inducing negative SA did not change the LD compared to the control condition without induction of SA or even decreased the effect of distortion. Pupillary dilation and cyclopegia led to a significant increase in the size of the LD when increasing values of SA were induced. Accommodation and pupillary constriction are capable of compensating the degradation of the optical quality induced.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{effects of}} measurement conditions on wave aberration estimates for uncorrected, axially myopic model eyes. Wave aberrations were initially referenced {{to either the}} anterior corneal pole or the <b>natural</b> entrance <b>pupil</b> of symmetrical eye models, with rays traced into the eye from infinity (into the eye) to simulate normal vision, into the eye from infinity and then {{back out of the}} eye from the retinal intercepts (into/out of the eye), or out of the eye from the retinal fovea (out of the eye). The into-the-eye and out-of-the-eye ray traces gave increases in spherical aberration as myopia increased, but the into/out-of-the-eye ray trace showed little variation in spherical aberration. Reference plane choice also affected spherical aberration. Corresponding residual aberrations were calculated after the models had been optically corrected, either by placing the object or image plane at the paraxial far point or by modifying corneas to simulate laser ablation corrections. Correcting aberrations by ablation was more complete if the original aberrations were referenced to the cornea rather than to the entrance pupil. For eyes corrected by spectacle lenses, failure to allow for effects of pupil magnification on apparent entrance pupil diameter produced larger changes in measured aberrations. The general findings regarding choice of reference plane and direction of measurement were found to be equally applicable to eyes that lacked rotational symmetry...|$|R
50|$|Carnovali {{was born}} in Montegrino Valtravaglia (Varese). In 1815, {{at the age of}} just 11, he was {{admitted}} to the Carrara Academy in Bergamo under the guidance of the director Giuseppe Diotti, who immediately recognised his young <b>pupil’s</b> <b>natural</b> talent. The artist soon began to break away from the strict Neoclassicism of his academic training and return to the figurative tradition of the 16th and 17th century, which he interpreted with great expressive freedom, especially in portrait painting. His debut at the exhibition of the Carrara Academy and his first major public commission for a work on a religious subject came in 1826. After the first short trips for study purposes, made on foot {{in the second half of}} the 1820s, he travelled as far as Rome in 1831 and stopped in Parma on the way back.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the influence of retinal illuminance on monocular or binocular visual reaction time (VRT). Methods. On two normal subjects, uniform circular stimuli were presented with respect to a reference stimulus at the fovea under suprathreshold conditions, and the detection of positive and negative luminance variations was recorded. Binocular and monocular reaction times were measured (by the index finger pressing on a mouse key) for viewing with both <b>natural</b> and artificial <b>pupils.</b> Results. Binocular reaction times were shorter than monocular reaction times; nevertheless, this binocular-summation effect was less marked in trials with the artificial pupil. Analyses of binocular-summation ratios for contrast changes for both pupil types indicated maximum and minimum binocular-saturation values depending on contrast variations in both positive and negative luminance changes. Conclusions. Binocular summation can be influenced by pupil size under suprathreshold conditions. Results are discussed in terms of retinal illuminance and cortical pupil response mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|NoAspheric {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) are {{designed}} to correct spherical aberration in pseudophakic eyes. We predict the benefit from correcting spherical aberration based on simulations and aberrometry of pseudophakic eyes implanted with spherical IOLs. METHODS Ray tracing was performed through a model eye with an equi-biconvex spherical IOL and with a spherical aberration-correcting aspheric IOL. The IOLs were increasingly tilted and/or displaced, and the resulting transverse aberrations of 169 rays were transformed into Zernike coefficients for different pupil sizes. The benefit from correcting spherical aberration at individual mesopic pupils was investigated by canceling in the sets of Zernike coefficients for 41 eyes implanted with a spherical IOL. RESULTS Both the model eye and the real eye data predict that age-related miosis reduces spherical aberration in the eye implanted with a spherical IOL to approximately 1 / 3 of the spherical aberration at a 6 -mm pupil. A reduction of similar magnitude occurs when spherical aberration-induced non-paraxial defocus is corrected by a spectacle lens. For <b>natural</b> mesopic <b>pupils,</b> canceling the Zernike coefficient improved the objective image quality at a rate similar to changing defocus by 0. 05 diopters. Average centration and tilt levels diminish the lead of aspheric IOLs over spherical IOLs, depending on the direction of decentration. CONCLUSIONS The benefit from correcting spherical aberration in a pseudophakic eye is limited for {{some or all of}} the following reasons: wearing glasses, age-related miosis, tilt and decentration of IOL, small contribution of spherical aberration to all aberrations, and intersubject variabilit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this {{research}} we investigate the conceptions of 11 year old pupils about {{the flow of}} a river from its sources to the sea. 2 D and 3 D small scale maps were used from 287 pupils from 15 different schools situated in urban and rural environments from mountainous, plain and coastal areas of Greece. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate whether 3 D maps contribute to a better understanding of a fluvial system on the physical landscape, to identify stereotypical imagery about the direction of the river flow, and to identify the type of map that will help children visualize and better understand features of the <b>natural</b> environment. <b>Pupils</b> completed an individual questionnaire with closed and open ended questions and designed rivers on 2 D and 3 D maps. The results were analyzed and categorized into model types according to the direction, the representation of the mouth of the river, the consistency of the river flow with the physical landscape, the types of lines used to draw the river's flow. A number of misconceptions are discussed. While the correct drawings on 2 D maps surpass those on 3 D maps, there is higher percentage of pupils drawing straight line river flow on 2 D than on 3 D maps suggesting that they cannot interpret the physical landscape through the map. Over two thirds of the pupils chose the 3 D maps as more helpful to complete the task...|$|R
