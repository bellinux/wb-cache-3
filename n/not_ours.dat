Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are <b>not</b> <b>ours.</b> Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E

Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're <b>not</b> <b>ours,</b> but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the subject}} of suicide, Hauerwas {{challenges}} the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does {{not agree with the}} notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term [...] "rational suicide" [...] {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose. Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are <b>not</b> <b>ours,</b> and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, while there may be times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that should be enough to sustain our commitment to living.|$|E
2500|$|Although PETA takes a gradualist {{approach}} to improving animal welfare, Newkirk {{remains committed to}} ending animal use and the idea that, as PETA's slogan says, [...] "animals are <b>not</b> <b>ours</b> to eat, wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment". Some animal rights abolitionists, most notably Gary Francione, have criticized PETA, calling it and other groups [...] "the new welfarists". Some members of the animal advocacy movement have responded that Francione's position is unnecessarily divisive. Newkirk has also been criticized for her support of actions {{carried out in the}} name of the Animal Liberation Front. Newkirk's position is that the animal rights movement is a revolutionary one and that [...] "hinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out". PETA itself, however, [...] "maintains a creed of nonviolence and does not advocate actions in which anyone, human or nonhuman, is injured". Newkirk and PETA have also been criticized for euthanizing many of the animals taken into PETA's shelters, and PETA has responded to this line of criticism. PETA has been on the news in the southern part of India for Banning of Jallikattu sport which is a cultural symbol of Tamils for thousands of years. The state is witnessing one of the biggest leaderless agitation using social media as a tool to organize these massive protests.|$|E
