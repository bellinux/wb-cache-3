40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{characteristics of}} an oil sands tailings water (OSTW) mixture of <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> were determined using a batch partitioning method for two soils from the Alberta oil sands region. The soils were mineral peat mixtures produced during salvage operations, with Soil 1 having a higher organic carbon fraction (foc) than Soil 2. <b>Naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> are a significant toxic byproduct of bitumen extraction, and are acutely toxic to aquatic organisms. The sorption of <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> as affected by a high ionic strength solution was examined using a synthetic groundwater (SGW) mixture. The adsorption isotherms {{were found to be}} linear in all cases. All tests were conducted at 4 oC, and at a pH of 8. 0 ± 0. 4, reflective of the conditions in a tailings settling facility near Fort McMurray, AB. The adsorption characteristics of the <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> in the SGW solution were compared to that of the mixture in Milli-Q water for the two soils. In the presence of SGW, the adsorption coefficient (Kd) for the mixture of <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> on Soil 1 was an order of magnitude higher than that observed with the same soil and the Milli-Q water mixture, increasing from 1. 9 ± 0. 2 mL/g to 17. 8 ± 1. 5 mL/g. The adsorption coefficient for the mixture of <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> on Soil 2 was also observably higher in the SGW mixture, increasing from 1. 3 ± 0. 15 mL/g to 3. 7 ± 0. 2 mL/g. In order to determine whether preferential sorption is exhibited by a particular species within the mixture, the relative fractional abundance of the individual <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> was plotted as a 3 -dimensional histogram for carbon numbers 5 to 37. It was found that for all Z families (where Z {{is a measure of the}} number of carbon ring structures), <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> within the middle range of carbon numbers showed preferential sorption. A two sample t-test confirmed that the <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> in the carbon number groupings 15 to 24 and 25 to 37 sorbed significantly in the SGW mixture when compared to those in the carbon number grouping of 5 to 14. It was concluded that select constituents of oil sands <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> mixtures sorb strongly to soil under conditions of elevated salinity and therefore adsorption could be an important attenuating mechanism in groundwater transport. Furthermore, preferential sorption of the individual <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> is important with respect to toxicity since lower molecular weight <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> are believed to have a more pronounced toxic effect. Overall, the measured adsorption coefficients indicate that there can be significant sorption of OSTW derived <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> to soils...|$|R

40|$|<b>Naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> are {{a diverse}} group of {{saturated}} mono- and polycyclic carboxylic acids that may account for as much as 10 - 12 weight % of crude oil. During production at several newer oil fields, there have been discoveries of oil that have very high acid and calcium content. This indicates that there are some <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> bound to calcium as calcium naphthenates present in the oil, and that these are oil-soluble. Oil-soluble calcium naphthenates can cause problems during refinery, as the calcium present can lead to fouling and catalytic deactivation. The coke and fuel quality will also be affected. The removal of calcium in the refinery can be an expensive and comprehensive process, which results in the suppliers getting a lower price on their crude oil. In this master thesis, <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> from non-soluble calcium naphthenates have been isolated by using an ion exchanger method and a Solid Phase Extraction-method. The work also consisted of neutral and acidic washing of the samples, measurements of water-content, Ca-content and total acid numbers.

40|$|The iron-loaded organic {{phase of}} {{naphthenic}} acid-isooctyl alcohol-kerosene was prepared, {{and the process}} kinetics of hydrothermal stripping of iron from the phase was studied. Several factors affecting hydrothermal stripping, such as the polymer of <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acid,</b> initial concentrations of iron and <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acid,</b> temperature and agitation time, were investigated, and based on experimental results and theoretical analysis, two kinetic models were established. The stripping rate equation suggests that the hydrothermal stripping process activation energy is 96. 4 kJ·mol- 1 and the stripping is controlled by hydrolysis of naphthenic complex of iron. The values calculated by the stripping fraction equation comparatively accord with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|<b>Naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> (NAs) are soluble {{in water}} and are {{concentrated}} in oil sand process water (OSPW) {{as a result of}} caustic oil sands extraction processes. Significant environmental and regulatory attention has been focused on the <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids.</b> A laboratory scale photocatalysis system was developed using UV 254 florescent lamps. Experiments were conducted to determine the NA degradation efficiency of this system in presence of TiO 2 catalyst. Degradation kinetics for total NAs as well as individual z-families was calculated. The developed treatment system was able to degrade OSPW NAs with half life values ranging between 1. 55 and 4. 80 h. This system also completely reduced the acute toxicity associated with NAs (up to 5 min. IC 50 v/v > 90 %) based on Microtox assays...|$|R

40|$|Large {{volumes of}} oil sand process water are {{generated}} {{as part of}} the Clarke caustic hot water process used for extraction of bitumen from shallow oil sand reserves. These process waters contain <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> in high concentrations (40 - 120 mg/L) which are persistent in the environment for decades. The toxic nature of <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> has been found to endanger aquatic biota and terrestrial habitat. Reclamation of these oil sand process waters has also come to the forefront due to the increasing future demand for water consumption in the oil sand industry and the need for sustainable use of water. Bioremediation as a cost effective technology for treatment of these process affected waters is gaining impetus. In earlier works in our group, the biodegradation of single <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> in the circulating packed bed bioreactor was studied in the batch and continuous modes. In this work, a circulating packed bed bioreactor has been used to study the batch and continuous co-biodegradation of different combinations of the four model <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> (one linear, and three cyclic compounds of different molecular structures) namely octanoic acid, trans 4 -methylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid (4 MCHCA) and a mixture of cis and trans isomer of 4 -methylcyclohexaneacetic acid (4 MCHAA). The circulating packed bed bioreactor effectively biodegraded all the candidate NAs with rates as high as 401. 1 mg/L-h for octanoic acid, 208. 8 mg/L-h for trans- 4 MCHCA, 4. 5 mg/L-h and 10. 2 mg/L-h for cis- 4 MCHAA and trans- 4 MCHAA, respectively. The maximum removal rates of the cyclic <b>naphthenic</b> <b>acids</b> were found to be much lower than that of octanoic acid irrespective of the presence of the other compound in the mixture. The data in this study also suggests that removal rate of NAs in the mixture was influenced by geometric isomerism of the compounds where biodegradation of cis isomer was much slower than that of its trans counterpart. Moreover, increase in the carbon number (presence of additional methyl group) resulted in lower removal rate. Another important finding of this work was that co-biodegradation of octanoic acid with trans- 4 MCHCA and 4 MCHAA has no impact on trans- 4 MCHCA but co-biodegradation enhanced the removal rate of cis- 4 MCHAA which is the most recalcitrant of the three compounds used in this study by 23 %...|$|R
