5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E
25|$|The Paresev {{completed}} nearly 350 flights {{during a}} research program that ran from 1962 until 1964. Using the fully flexible parawing or the tube-stiffened paraglider of the Paresev 1A, 1B, 1C as an alternate to spacecraft recovery was deemed too unreliable upon unfolding so round parachutes for water landings were used instead. The Paresev and other flexible-wing {{projects such as}} the Ryan XV-8 stopped being funded by NASA on 1965. Although Rogallo wrote about, modeled, and spoke about recreational applications including hang gliding, NASA was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of applying Rogallo's family of airfoils to personal aircraft such as kites, hang gliders, and powered light aircraft.|$|E
25|$|First, {{rather than}} {{succumbing to the}} {{foreseeable}} consequences of his criminality, de Hory became something of a folk hero in the anti-establishment atmosphere that pervaded the late 1960s, an age of rebellion and social unrest. Secondly, his ensuing notoriety, he thought, would finally afford him the lifelong recognition he sought, {{to be seen as}} a fine artist in his own right. He was wrong. De Hory often referred to himself as “famously infamous,” and he enjoyed his time in the spotlight as a bad-boy media darling, though, that attention never translated into a demand for artwork in his own avant-garde style. It was a bitter but real irony for him for the rest of his life. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, rather than learning from the mistakes made by art dealers, and collectors, de Hory’s target audience, the commerce of art remains little changed from the halcyon days of his midcentury fakery. The degree of complicity de Hory enjoyed with art dealers is open to speculation, though, even today, art sellers face no fallout from unlawful dealings unless it can be proven that they are ‘knowingly’ complicit in fraudulent transactions (see Knoedler Gallery scandal). Plausible deniability is a commonly used defense to deflect accountability. Furthermore, auction houses distance themselves in issues of provenance or authorship as they are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of ascribing authenticity. (See the standard wordage explaining terms and conditions of sale for Christie’s or Sotheby’s, for example.) These loopholes that allowed many of de Hory’s fakes to fast track to public institutions and private collections are the same pathways that facilitate present-day forgers and fakers.|$|E

When Gold attempts to walk away, Regina presses him for an answer, causing Gold to say [...] "please", forcing Regina to obey.

[...] The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of the second grade, when he started at a Cheyenne, Wyoming elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year. Parker said, [...] "It was brutal ... Everybody already had their little groups and the year was almost over, so I wasn't going to fit into any of them, and I just wanted to destroy and kill, which was the inspiration for this show." ...|$|E
500|$|Glastonbury {{is notable}} for myths and legends {{concerning}} Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Many long-standing and cherished legends were disproved in a four-year study by archaeologists at the University of Reading, who, amongst other findings, {{discovered that the}} connection with King Arthur and his Queen, Guinivere, was created deliberately by the monks in 1184 [...] to meet a financial crisis caused by a devastating fire. Other myths dispelled include the visit by Jesus, {{the building of the}} oldest church in England, and the flowering of the walking stick. The study made new archaeological finds; its leader found Glastonbury to be a remarkable archaeological site. The new results were reported on the Glastonbury Abbey Web site, and [...] were to be incorporated into the Abbey's guidebook; however, the leader of the study, who became a trustee of Glastonbury, said [...] "We are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of destroying people’s beliefs ...

2500|$|In January 1999, Glenn Sobel Management {{registered}} the website www.beveragesandmore.com, but Sobel was sued {{a year later}} by Beverages & More! for trademark infringement under ICANN jurisdiction. Beverages & More, Inc. aimed to show that their registered trademark [...] "Beverages & More!" [...] was being violated. Their testimony noted that the ampersand and the exclamation point in their trademark were not allowed in domain names, and that the www.beveragesandmore.com domain was the closest analog available to them. In court, Glenn Sobel did not deny {{that he was in}} the business of selling domain names, and that his company had never been known as [...] "beveragesandmore". Sobel was admittedly <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> of selling beverages. In March 2000, the domain was ordered to be immediately transferred from Sobel to Beverages & More! with no fine or penalty—a decision reached by Richard D. Faulkner, an ICANN judge in Dallas, Texas. The decision set a precedent that has since been quoted by complainants in cybersquatting cases to show that a domain name matching a trademark, one held by other than the trademark holder, [...] "is evidence of bad faith registration and use".|$|E
2500|$|Peter Hitchens {{argued that}} Pullman pursues an anti-Christian agenda, citing an {{interview}} in which Pullman is quoted as saying: [...] "I'm trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief."

I find the books upholding certain values that I think are important, such as life is immensely valuable and this world is an extraordinarily beautiful place. We should {{do what we can to}} increase the amount of wisdom in the world." [...] Hitchens also views the His Dark Materials series as a direct rebuttal of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia; Pullman has criticised the Narnia books as religious propaganda. Hitchens' brother Christopher Hitchens, author of God Is Not Great, praised His Dark Materials as a fresh alternative to Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling, describing the author as one [...] "whose books have begun to dissolve the frontier between adult and juvenile fiction". However, he was more critical of The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, accusing Pullman of being a [...] "Protestant atheist" [...] for supporting the teachings of Christ but being critical of organised religion.|$|E

As explained by head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb in 2015, Marvel Studios had [...] "first dibs" [...] on the character once the rights had reverted. Drew Goddard pitched a new Daredevil film to Marvel, but Marvel was not looking to create an R-rated film, and Goddard did not want a [...] "watered down version" [...] of the character, as he also explained in 2015: [...] "I went into Marvel and talked to them about making it as a movie {{a couple of years}} ago, long after the Affleck movie. But what we all sort of realised is that, this movie doesn't want to cost $200 million. The thing about Matt Murdock is, he's not saving the world. He's just keeping his corner clean.
