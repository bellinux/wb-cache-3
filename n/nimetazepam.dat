25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are one of}} {{the largest}} classes of abused drugs; they are classed as {{schedule}} IV controlled drugs because of their recognized medical uses. Across the world the most frequently diverted and abused benzodiazepines include temazepam, diazepam, <b>nimetazepam,</b> nitrazepam, triazolam, flunitrazepam, midazolam, and in the United States alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam.|$|E
25|$|The major drugs {{of choice}} are {{injectable}} heroin, morphine, smokeable opium, crystal methamphetamine, <b>nimetazepam,</b> temazepam, and MDMA. Preferences between opium and heroin/morphine, {{and methods of}} administration, differ from region to region within China. The use of heroin and opium has increased among the younger population, as income has grown and the youth have more free time. China considers crystal methamphetamine abuse second to heroin/morphine as a major drug problem. The use of MDMA has only recently become popular in China's growing urban areas.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam {{has been}} {{associated}} with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, <b>nimetazepam,</b> flunitrazepam, and clonazepam are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by CYP3A4 which can result in cytotoxicity. This activation can lead to the generation of free radicals and oxidation of thiol, as well as covalent binding with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a nontoxic drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions.|$|E
500|$|In East Asia and Southeast Asia, {{temazepam}} and <b>nimetazepam</b> {{are often}} heavily controlled and restricted. In certain countries, triazolam, flunitrazepam, flutoprazepam and midazolam are also restricted or controlled to certain degrees. [...] In Hong Kong, all benzodiazepines are regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Previously only brotizolam, flunitrazepam and triazolam were classed as dangerous drugs.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nimetazepam</b> has a {{particular}} reputation in the Malay Peninsula for recreational use, at RM 25 per tab, and is particularly popular among persons addicted to amphetamines or opioids.Stimulant addicts do not have healthy coping mechanisms {{due to the nature}} of addiction, causing insomnia, depression and exhaustion. In addition, <b>Nimetazepam</b> has an anti-depressant and muscle relaxant effect. <b>Nimetazepam</b> also has withdrawal suppresion effect and lower drug seeking versus nitrazepam in rhesus monkey (Macaca Mulatta). which might help stimulant addicts to overcome withdrawal symptoms.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nimetazepam</b> (marketed under {{brand name}} Erimin and Lavol) is an intermediate-acting {{hypnotic}} drug {{which is a}} benzodiazepine derivative. It was first synthesized by a team at Hoffmann-La Roche in 1962. It possesses hypnotic, anxiolytic, sedative, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. <b>Nimetazepam</b> is also an anticonvulsant. It is sold in 5 mg tablets known as Erimin and Lavol. It is generally prescribed for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia in patients who have difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep. The sole global manufacturer of <b>Nimetazepam</b> (Sumitomo Japan) has ceased manufacturing Erimin since early November 2015. Patients being prescribed Erimin are being switched to Lavol and other hypnotics, e.g. estazolam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, etc.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nimetazepam</b> is {{currently}} a Schedule IV drug under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.|$|E
50|$|Surveys in many {{countries}} show that temazepam, MDMA, <b>nimetazepam,</b> and methamphetamine rank among the top illegal drugs most frequently abused.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nimetazepam</b> has a {{reputation}} for being particularly subject to abuse (known as 'Happy 5', sold as an ecstasy replacement without a hangover). Although is still a significant drug of abuse in some Asian countries such as Japan and Malaysia, <b>Nimetazepam</b> is subject to legal restrictions in Malaysia, and due to its scarcity, many tablets sold on the black market are in fact counterfeits containing other benzodiazepines such as diazepam or nitrazepam instead.|$|E
50|$|Flunitrazepam is classed as a nitro-benzodiazepine. It is the {{fluorinated}} N-methyl {{derivative of}} nitrazepam. Other nitro-benzodiazepines include nitrazepam (the parent compound), <b>nimetazepam</b> (methylamino derivative) and clonazepam (2สน-chlorinated derivative).|$|E
50|$|Nitrazepam, temazepam, and {{especially}} <b>nimetazepam</b> are powerful anticonvulsant agents, however their use is rare {{due to an}} increased incidence of side effects and strong sedative and motor-impairing properties.|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, <b>Nimetazepam</b> is {{regulated}} under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. <b>Nimetazepam</b> {{can only be}} used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 (HKD) fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.|$|E
5000|$|In Victoria Australia, <b>nimetazepam</b> is {{regulated}} under Schedule 11 of [...] "Drugs, Poisons and Controlled substances act 1981". It is deemed to {{fall under the}} category of [...] "7-NITRO-1,4-BENZODIAZEPINES not included elsewhere in this Part"[...]|$|E

50|$|In a rat study <b>Nimetazepam</b> showed greater {{damage to}} the fetus, as did {{nitrazepam}} when compared against other benzodiazepines, all at a dosage of 100 mg/kg. Diazepam however showed relatively weak fetal toxicities. The same fetotoxicity of nitrazepam could not be observed in mice and is likely due to the particular metabolism of the drug in the rat.|$|E
50|$|In East Asia and Southeast Asia, {{temazepam}} and <b>nimetazepam</b> {{are often}} heavily controlled and restricted.

50|$|Abuse of brotizolam, {{although}} not widespread, {{was a problem}} in Hong Kong {{back in the late}} 1980s and 1990s. To control benzodiazepine abuse in Hong Kong, the Government's Pharmacy and Poisons Board reclassified benzodiazepines as Dangerous Drugs in October 1990. Apart from formal prescriptions, detailed records were then required for the supply and dispensing of these drugs. These regulations were applied initially only to brotizolam, triazolam and flunitrazepam as they were the major benzodiazepines of abuse. The impact of these regulatory changes on benzodiazepine use has been studied by analyzing the sales patterns of seven benzodiazepines between 1990-1993. In 1991, the sales of flunitrazepam and triazolam fell, but the sales of five unrestricted benzodiazepines increased. Particular problems arose with the trafficking and abuse of <b>nimetazepam</b> and the abuse of temazepam within that same year in 1991. The regulations that were originally only applied to brotizolam, triazolam and flunitrazepam were now being extended to include all benzodiazepines by January 1992. A regulation requiring the use of proper prescriptions and detailed records for the supply and dispensing of benzodiazepines, appears to have curbed, at least partially, their abuse in Hong Kong. There is still some problems with temazepam, <b>nimetazepam,</b> triazolam, and brotizolam but it is not major.|$|E

50|$|Taken orally, <b>Nimetazepam</b> {{has very}} good {{bioavailability}} with nearly 100% being absorbed from the gut. It {{is among the}} most rapidly absorbed and quickest acting oral benzodiazepines, and hypnotic effects are typically felt within 15-30 minutes after oral ingestion. The blood level decline of the parent drug was biphasic with the short half-life ranging from 0.5-0.7 hours and the terminal half-life from 8 to 26.5 hours (mean 17.25 hours). It is the N-methylated analogue of nitrazepam (Mogadon, Alodorm), to which it is partially metabolized. nitrazepam has a long elimination half-life, so effects of repeated dosage tend to be cumulative.|$|E
50|$|Menitrazepam {{is a drug}} {{which is}} a {{benzodiazepine}} derivative. It is similar in structure to tetrazepam and <b>nimetazepam,</b> with the 7-chloro group of tetrazepam replaced by nitro. It is a hypnotic agent used {{in the treatment of}} insomnia, and therefore has strong sedative, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and anxiolytic actions like those of other hypnotic benzodiazepines. Menitrazepam is a good oral hypnotic agent, however, delay in the time for peak plasma levels to reach their maximum brings into question the benefit of menitrazepam for the treatment of insomnia when compared to other hypnotics. Typically, the sleep inducing properties of hypnotics occur within 0.5 hours. In some cases, as with temazepam and nitrazepam, strong hypnotic effects can be felt 15 to 20 minutes after oral ingestion.|$|E
40|$|Profiling {{study of}} fourty - six illicit Erimin 5 tablet samples {{were carried out}} {{according}} to their physicals and chemical characteristics. Out of 46 illicit Erimin tablet samples, 45 tablet samples were peach-orange like in colour and only one tablet sample was green coloured tablet. For physical characteristic studies, logo and color were observed whereas, others characteristics such average weight of tablet, thickness and diameter of the illicit Erimin 5 tablet samples were measured and photograph was taken. The distribution profile of average weight of tablet, diameter and thickness of the tablet samples were developed. For chemical characteristics, these illicit Erimin 5 tablet samples were characterized according to their active ingredients, adulterants, diluents and dyes. Active ingredients and adulterants were analyzed by GCMS and diluents were used ATR-FTIR. Dyes of tablets were determined by TLC using two different systems. <b>Nimetazepam</b> content (percentage) {{and the weight of}} <b>nimetazepam</b> per tablet were determined using HPLC and their distribution profiles were developed. <b>Nimetazepam,</b> Diazepam and Nitrazepam together with caffeine (adulterant) were detected as active ingredient with Lactose, Mannitol and Calcium phosphate as diluent.

40|$|Direct {{immersion}} (DI) -solid phase micro extraction (SPME) {{has been}} applied to 13 benzodiazepines spiked to human urine. Urine was mixed with distilled water and sodium chloride in a vial, and an SPME fiber was directly immersed in the sample solution during its stirring for 30 min at room temperature. Immediately after the fiber was pulled out of the vial, the fiber needle was injected into the port of a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector. Medazepam, fludiazepam, diazepam, midazolam, flunitrazepam, prazepam, <b>nimetazepam</b> and flurazepam could be extracted under the present DI-SPME conditions, and their recoveries were 1. 55 - 17. 0 %. Their calibration curves showed linearity up to 1000 ng/ml urine. The detection limit of <b>nimetazepam</b> was 150 ng/ml; those for medazepam, fludiazepam, diazepam, midazolam, flunitrazepam, prazepam and flurazepam were 10 - 20 ng/ml. rights:ๆฅๆฌๆณไธญๆฏๅญฆไผrights:ๆฌๆใใผใฟใฏๆฅๆฌๆณไธญๆฏๅญฆไผใฎ่จฑ่ซพใฎใใจๆฒ่ผใใฆใใพใ...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 is the {{predominant}} isoform in liver, and it metabolizes more than 50 % {{of the clinical}} drugs commonly used. However, CYP 3 A 4 is also responsible for metabolic activation of drugs, leading to liver injury. Benzodiazepines are widely used as hypnotics and sedatives for anxiety, {{but some of them}} induce liver injury in humans. To clarify whether benzodiazepines are metabol-ically activated, 14 benzodiazepines were investigated for their cytotoxic effects on HepG 2 cells treated with recombinant CYP 3 A 4. By exposure to 100 M flunitrazepam, <b>nimetazepam,</b> or nitrazepam, the cell viability in the presence of CYP 3 A 4 decreased more than 25 % compared with that of the control. In contrast, in the case of other benzodiazepines, the changes in the cell viability between CYP 3 A 4 and control Supersomes were less than 10 %.
