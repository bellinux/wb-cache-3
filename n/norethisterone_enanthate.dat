25|$|Norethisterone (NET), {{also known}} as norethindrone, is a {{medication}} that is used in combination with estrogen or alone in hormonal contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and {{in the treatment of}} gynecological disorders. It is a synthetic progestogen (or a progestin) of the 19-nortestosterone group and has similar effects to those of natural progesterone, including suppression of gonadotropins, ovulation inhibition, and endometrial transformation. In addition to its progestogenic activity, NET also has weak androgenic and estrogenic effects at high dosages. In addition to NET itself, several prodrugs of NET, such as norethisterone acetate (NETA), <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NETE), and others, have been marketed and have similar effects and uses.|$|E

50|$|Testosterone, as esters such as {{testosterone}} undecanoate or testosterone buciclate, {{has been studied}} and promoted as a male contraceptive analogous to estrogen-based contraceptives in women. Otherwise considered an adverse effect of testosterone, reduced spermatogenesis can be further suppressed {{with the addition of}} a progestin such as <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> or levonorgestrel butanoate, improving the contraceptive effect.|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone, {{together}} with ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), {{is also the}} parent compound of {{a large group of}} progestins, the norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivatives. This family is subdivided into two groups: the estranes and the gonanes. The estranes include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethisterone acetate, <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and noretynodrel, while the gonanes include norgestrel, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, dienogest (actually a 17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone derivative), and norelgestromin.|$|E
50|$|The medical uses of {{estradiol}} valerate {{are the same}} as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Examples of indications for the drug include hormone replacement therapy and hormonal contraception. In regards to the latter, {{estradiol valerate}} is available in combination with a progestogen as an combined estradiol-containing oral contraceptive (with dienogest) and as a combined injectable contraceptive (with hydroxyprogesterone caproate or <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate).</b>|$|E
50|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) entered {{clinical}} use and became widely marketed, largely superseding the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone esters. A variety of analogues of medroxyprogesterone acetate, such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, were subsequently developed and introduced as well. Progestogen esters {{of other groups}} of progestins have also been introduced, including the 19-norprogesterone derivatives gestonorone caproate, segesterone acetate (nestorone), nomegestrol acetate, and norgestomet (11β-methyl-17α-acetoxy-19-norprogesterone), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives etynodiol diacetate, norethisterone acetate, <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> and quingestanol acetate.|$|E
50|$|A few progestins have weak estrogenic activity. These {{include the}} 19-nortestosterone {{derivatives}} norethisterone, noretynodrel, and tibolone, {{as well as}} the norethisterone prodrugs norethisterone acetate, <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> lynestrenol, and etynodiol diacetate. High dosages of norethisterone and noretynodrel have been associated with estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with alleviation of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, non-estrogenic progestins were not found to be associated with such effects.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Although esters of steroidal androgens and estrogens are {{generally}} inactive themselves {{and act as}} prodrugs, the same is not true for many progestogen esters. For instance, esters of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cyproterone acetate, are highly active themselves (and in fact far more active than their unesterified forms) and are not prodrugs, forming little or none of their parent compounds (in the cases of the examples given, hydroxyprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone, and cyproterone, respectively). On the other hand, esters of 19-nortestosterone derivatives such as etynodiol diacetate, norethisterone acetate, <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> and quingestanol acetate are all prodrugs.|$|E

40|$|Objective and design:Some {{studies suggest}} that {{specific}} hormonal contraceptive methods [particularly depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) ] may increase women's HIV acquisition risk. We updated a systematic review to incorporate recent epidemiological data. Methods:We searched for articles published between 15 January 2014 and 15 January 2016 and hand-searched reference lists. We identified longitudinal studies comparing users of a specific hormonal contraceptive method against either nonusers of hormonal contraception or users of another specific hormonal contraceptive method. We added newly identified studies {{to those in the}} previous review, assessed study quality, created forest plots to display results, and conducted a meta-analysis for data on DMPA versus non-use of hormonal contraception. Results:We identified 10 new reports of which five were considered 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆dcunlikely to inform the primary question 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122. We focus on the other five reports, along with nine from the previous review, which were considered 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆dcinformative but with important limitations 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122. The preponderance of data for oral contraceptive pills, injectable <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> and levonorgestrel implants do not suggest an association with HIV acquisition, though data for implants are limited. The new, higher quality studies on DMPA (or nondisaggregated injectables), which had mixed results in terms of statistical significance, had hazard ratios between 1. 2 and 1. 7, consistent with our meta-analytic estimate for all higher quality studies of hazard ratio 1. 4. Conclusion:Although confounding in these observational data cannot be excluded, new information increases concerns about DMPA and HIV acquisition risk in women. If the association is causal, the magnitude of effect is likely hazard ratio 1. 5 or less. Data for other hormonal contraceptive methods, including <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> are largely reassuring. 27500670 PMC 510609...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Postnatal depression, with a {{prevalence}} {{of at least}} 10 %, {{is probably the most}} common complication of the puerperium. A deficiency or imbalance of sex hormones has repeatedly been suggested as a cause. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to evaluate the role of oestrogens and progestogens in the prevention and treatment of postnatal depression. SEARCH STRATEGY: The register of clinical trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. SELECTION CRITERIA: All trials were considered in which pregnant or postpartum women (up to 18 months) were randomised to receive postpartum oestrogen or progestogen or placebo for the treatment or prevention of postnatal depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two published randomised placebo controlled trials were identified for inclusion in the analyses for this review. One study was excluded. MAIN RESULTS: Depot <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> given within 48 hours of delivery and lasting 8 - 12 weeks was associated with significantly higher postpartum depression scores than placebo. Oestrogen therapy in severely depressed women was associated with a greater improvement in depression scores than placebo. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is no place for synthetic progestogens in the prevention of treatment of postnatal depression. Long-acting <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> is associated with an increased risk of postnatal depression. It and other long-acting progestogen contraceptives should be used with caution in the postnatal period, especially in women with a history of depression. The role of progesterone in the prevention and treatment of postnatal depression has yet to be evaluated in a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Oestrogen therapy may be of modest value at a late stage of severe postnatal depression. Its role in the prevention of recurrent postnatal depression has not been evaluated. Further research on its value is unlikely for ethical reasons. Revie...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Observational {{studies of}} a {{putative}} association between hormonal contraception (HC) and HIV acquisition have produced conflicting results.

40|$|Purpose: This {{prospective}} {{observational study}} evaluated the bleeding patterns of adolescents receiving a monthly injectable contraceptive containing <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> 50 mg plus estradiol valerate 5 mg. Materials and Methods: the study enrolled 73 volunteers aged between 14 and 19 years; of these patients, 38 (52 %) recorded their menstrual cycles during 1 year. Results: After 1 year {{of using the}} contraceptive, most of the 38 women (71. 1 %) had adequate menstrual patterns (two to four bleeding episodes; none lasting 10 days or longer; {{with a range of}} bleeding-free intervals not exceeding 17 days), 23. 7 % reported prolonged bleeding episodes, 2. 6 % had irregular bleeding and 2. 6 % had amenorrhea. Only 1 of the 38 teenagers is known to have discontinued the method due to bleeding. Among these 38 adolescents, dissatisfaction with bleeding patterns was not a frequent reason given for discontinuation of the monthly injectable contraceptive. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The endocervical mucosae of {{the female}} reproductive tract (FRT) not only serve as a physical barrier against microbial infection, but they also express {{a wide variety of}} immune mediators. The endocervical epithelial cells express a distinct profile of immune-regulators, which is higher than vaginal and ectocervical epithelial cells. Constant cytokine production would ensure rapid responses to infections and maintenance of the sterility of the upper genital tract. However, overproduction of cytokines could inhibit normal reproductive processes and stimulate excess growth and cell proliferation. The synthetic progestins medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and norethisterone (NET) and its derivatives (<b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NET-EN); norethisterone acetate (NET-A)) are synthetic steroidal hormones designed to elicit progestational effects {{similar to those of the}} endogenous hormone progesterone (P 4). They are extensively used as contraceptives and in hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Numerous studies, however, have reported that synthetic progestins affect immune function, increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and also change the morphology of the cervicovaginal mucosa.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of progesterone and of various synthetic progestins on hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and on pituitary and plasma LH and prolactin (Prl) concentrations in ovariectomized rats. Groups of 6 rats were treated for 2 weeks with a pharmacological dose of progesterone, desogestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate or <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NET). The same treatment was also repeated in association with estradiol benzoate (EB). Groups of ovariectomized rats were also treated with EB only or vehicle. Ovariectomized rats showed hypothalamic concentrations of GnRH significantly higher than control rats. Progesterone and NET significantly increased GnRH concentrations and reversed the EB-induced changes. Rats treated with progesterone and NET also showed reduced pituitary LH concentration, with high plasma LH levels. All progestins blocked the increase of pituitary LH induced by EB, but were inactive in influencing the inhibitory effect of EB on plasma LH levels. The administration of progesterone and progestins did not induce significant changes of pituitary or plasma Prl, but reversed the EB-induced increase. These results showed that progesterone and progestins have a marked effect on hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion and that they modulate estrogen-induced effects...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to find the most {{favorable}} injection interval of <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NETE) plus testosterone undecanoate (TU) in terms of gonadotropin, sperm suppression, and prostatic effects. Fifty normal men were randomly assigned to receive NETE 200 mg plus TU 1000 mg every 8 wk (n = 10), every 12 wk (n = 10), every 6 wk for 12 wk and then every 12 wk (n = 10), and every 6 wk for 12 wk and thereafter TU 1000 mg plus placebo every 12 wk (n = 10), and placebo plus placebo every 6 wk for 12 wk and then every 12 wk (n = 10) for 48 wk. Semen analyses, blood drawings, physical examinations, and prostate ultrasounds were performed throughout the study. Of the men in the 8 -wk injection group, 90 % (nine of 10) achieved azoospermia, compared with 37. 5 % (three of eight) in the 12 -wk injection group (P = 0. 019). TU plus placebo injected every 12 wk did not maintain sperm suppression. Prostate volumes did not change significantly in either group. In conclusion, these data suggest that the combined administration of NETE and TU at 8 -wk intervals represents an effective hormonal contraceptive regimen. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Prostate {{size and}} {{function}} are regulated by testosterone. However, the progesterone receptor is ex- pressed in the primate prostate. Progestins affect the pros- tate by endocrine suppression, {{but can also}} act directly. Ex- amining the role of progestins, we studied the effects of norethisterone (NET) on testosterone undecanoate (TU) -in- duced prostate growth in castrated macaques. Materials and Methods: Two groups (n = 6 for each group) received TU every 9 weeks. Using a crossover setting, group I received <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NETE) 3 times at 3 -week intervals, while group II received placebo. After 9 weeks, placebo was administered to group I, and group II received NETE. Results: In group II, the prostate grew under TU and placebo over the first period. In group I, coadministered with NETE, the in- crease was lower. After the crossover, prostates of animals previously treated with NETE did not increase to normal val- ues under placebo. Prostates of animals treated with TU and placebo {{in the first period}} shrank following NETE administra- tion after the crossover. The long half-life of NET can explainthe lack of a TU effect on animals coadministered with NETE after the crossover. Conclusions: Pre- and coadministration of NET reduces testosterone-induced prostate growth with possible implications for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia and hormonal male contraception...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundUse of {{contraception}} lowers a woman's risk of experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. In {{the case of}} method failure, however, progestin-only contraceptives {{may be more likely}} to result in ectopic pregnancies than some other methods such as combined hormonal and barrier contraceptives. ObjectiveTo describe ectopic pregnancy risk associated with use of implants and progestin-only injectable contraceptives through a systematic review of published studies. Data SourcesWe searched electronic databases for articles in any language published through May 2015 describing studies of progestin-only injectables and implants. We also searched bibliographies and review articles for additional studies. Study Selection and ExtractionStudies that reported any pregnancies were included in the review. Independent data extraction was performed by two authors based on predefined data fields, and where possible, we calculated the proportion of pregnancies that were ectopic and the ectopic pregnancy incidence rate per 1000 woman–years. ResultsFifty-three studies of implants and 28 studies of injectables were identified; 79 % reported pregnancy location. The proportion of ectopic pregnancy ranged from 0 to 100 % with an incidence of 0 – 2. 9 per 1000 woman–years in studies of marketed levonorgestrel implants. Studies of etonogestrel implants and the injectables, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate and <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> reported few ectopic pregnancies. ConclusionProgestin-only contraceptive implants and injectables protect against ectopic pregnancy by being highly effective in preventing pregnancy overall; however, the absolute risk of ectopic pregnancy varies by type of progestin. Risk of ectopic pregnancy should not be a deterrent for use or provision of these methods...|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NETE) is {{evaluated}} in trials of hormonal male contraception. It {{has been speculated}} that progestins may exert their contraceptive effects not only by suppressing gonadotropins but also by direct effects on male organs. NETE was given to monkeys in which endogenous gonadotropin secretion was suppressed by a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist, and replaced by human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If NETE has a direct effect on spermatogenesis and/or epididymal function, some changes in testicular histology, sperm motility and/or morphology should occur soon after exposure to NETE. Methods: Fifteen adult intact male monkeys were grouped and treated for a 38 -day period. Group I received GnRH antagonist, FSH, hCG and NETE while group II received a regime identical to group I without NETE and group III received only NETE and vehicle. Ejaculates, body weight, testicular biopsies and volume, and hormones were evaluated. Results: There was a similar pattern of serum FSH and testosterone in groups I and II. Testicular volume {{and the proportion of}} tubuli exhibiting spermatids was significantly decreased in group III. There {{were no significant differences between}} group I and group II in any parameters measured. The forward progression of sperm was not affected by NETE treatment. The consistently low percentages of grade c sperm indicated no sign of hyperactivation. No changes in the gross morphology of the acrosome were detected. Conclusions: Short-term NETE treatment has neither a direct effect on the testis nor on the epididymis in this nonhuman primate model and its contraceptive effects appear to be exerted exclusively through gonadotropin suppression...|$|E
40|$|Marmosets {{are used}} as {{preclinical}} model in reproductive research. In contrast to other primates, they display short gestation times rendering this species valid for exploration of effects on fertility. However, their peculiar endocrine regulation differs from a those of macaques and humans. We subjected male marmosets to previously clinically tested hormonal regimens that are known to effectively suppress spermatogenesis. Beside a control group, seven groups (each n= 6) were investigated for different periods of up to 42 months: regimen I, (four groups) received testosterone undecanoate (TU) and <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NETE); regimen II, (two groups) received TU and NETE followed by NETE only; and regimen III, (one group) received NETE only. Testicular volume, cell ploidy and histology, endocrine changes and fertility were monitored weekly. TU and NETE and initial TU and NETE treatment followed by NETE failed to suppress spermatogenesis and fertility. Testicular volumes dropped, although spermatogenesis was only mildly affected; however, testicular cellular composition remained stable. Serum testosterone dropped when NETE was given alone but the animals remained fertile. Compared with controls, no significant changes were observed in sperm motility and fertility. Administration of TU and NETE affected testicular function only mildly, indicating that the regulatory role of chorionic gonadotrophin and testosterone on spermatogenesis is obviously limited and testicular function is maintained, although the endocrine axis {{is affected by the}} treatment. In conclusion, marmosets showed a different response to regimens of male contraception from macaques or men and have to be considered as a problematic model for preclinical trials of male hormonal contraception...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhether use {{of various}} types of {{hormonal}} contraception (HC) affect risk of HIV acquisition is a critical question for women's health. For this systematic review, we identified 22 studies published by January 15, 2014 which met inclusion criteria; we classified thirteen studies as having severe methodological limitations, and nine studies as “informative but with important limitations”. Overall, data do not support an association between use of oral contraceptives and increased risk of HIV acquisition. Uncertainty persists regarding whether an association exists between depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use and risk of HIV acquisition. Most studies suggested no significantly increased HIV risk with <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NET-EN) use, but when assessed in the same study, point estimates for NET-EN tended to be larger than for DMPA, though 95 % confidence intervals overlapped substantially. No data have suggested significantly increased risk of HIV acquisition with use of implants, though data were limited. No data {{are available on the}} relationship between use of contraceptive patches, rings, or hormonal intrauterine devices and risk of HIV acquisition. Women choosing progestin-only injectable contraceptives such as DMPA or NET-EN should be informed of the current uncertainty regarding whether use of these methods increases risk of HIV acquisition, and like all women at risk of HIV, should be empowered to access and use condoms and other HIV preventative measures. Programs, practitioners, and women urgently need guidance on how to maximize health with respect to avoiding both unintended pregnancy and HIV given inconclusive or limited data for certain HC methods...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} hormonal contraception including combined oral contraceptives (COCs), and the injectable progestins depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (Net-En) on the risk of HIV acquisition among women in South Africa. Design/methods: We analyzed data from 5567 women aged 16 - 49 years participating in the Carraguard Phase 3 Efficacy Trial. Participants were interviewed about contraceptive use and sexual behaviors and underwent pelvic examinations and HIV testing quarterly. We used marginal structural Cox regression models to estimate the effect of hormonal contraception exposure on HIV acquisition risk among women overall and among young women (16 - 24 years) in particular. Results: Two hundred and seventy participants became HIV-infected (3. 7 per 100 woman-years); HIV incidence was 2. 8, 4. 6, 3. 5 and 3. 4 per 100 woman-years in the COC, DMPA, Net-En and nonhormonal contraceptive groups, respectively (P = 0. 09). The adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) were 0. 84 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 51 - 1. 39], 1. 28 (95 % CI 0. 92 - 1. 78) and 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 64 - 1. 32) among COC, DMPA and Net-En users, respectively, compared with the nonhormonal group controlling for covariates. Age modified the effect of hormonal contraception on HIV acquisition risk; among young women, the AHRs were 1. 02 (95 % CI 0. 46 - 2. 28) for COCs, 1. 68 (95 % CI 0. 96 - 2. 94) for DMPA and 1. 36 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 2. 35) for Net-En users. Conclusions: In this study conducted among South African women, hormonal contraception did not significantly {{increase the risk of}} HIV acquisition. However, the effect estimate does not rule out a moderate increase in HIV risk associated with DMPA use found in some other recent studies.

40|$|PhD, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the WitwatersrandMany {{studies have}} shown a {{negative}} effect of depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) hormonal contraception on bone mineral density (BMD) in women. There is limited information {{on the effect of}} <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NET-EN) on BMD and the effect of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) on BMD is inconclusive, however emerging evidence is showing that low-dose COCs maybe detrimental to BMD in young women. The aim of this research was to evaluate, in a 5 -year follow-up study, the possible effect of DMPA, NET-EN and COCs on BMD among young (15 - 19 years) and older (40 - 49 years) South African women. Method: This prospective study was conducted at the Commercial City Family Planning clinic in Durban, South Africa between 2000 and 2007. In the adolescent group women with no history of hormonal contraception who were initiating use of DMPA (n= 115), NET-EN (n= 115) or COCs (n= 116) and 144 nonuser controls were recruited. In the older group, one hundred and twenty seven users of DMPA, 102 NET-EN users and 106 COC users of at least one year were compared to 161 nonuser controls. BMD was measured at the distal radius and midshaft of the ulna using dual x-ray absorptiometry. In the crosssectional component of the study conducted {{at the end of the}} longitudinal phase, BMD was measured at the hip, spine and femoral neck in a sub-group of 96 of the younger women.

We investigated the differential effects, molecular mechanism of action and steroid receptor involvement in gene expression by MPA as compared to NET and progesterone (P 4) in the End 1 /E 6 E 7 cell line model for the endocervical epithelium, a key point of entry for pathogens in the female genital mucosa. MPA, unlike NET-acetate (NET-A) and P 4, increases mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory GILZ and IκBα genes. Similarly, MPA unlike NET-A, decreases mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory IL- 6, IL- 8 and RANTES genes, and IL- 6 and IL- 8 protein levels. The predominant steroid receptor expressed in the End 1 /E 6 E 7 and primary endocervical epithelial cells is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and GR knockdown experiments show that the anti-inflammatory effects of MPA are mediated by the GR. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation results suggest that MPA, unlike NET-A and P 4, represses pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in cervical epithelial cells via a mechanism involving recruitment of the GR to cytokine gene promoters, like the GR agonist dexamethasone. This is at least in part consistent with direct effects on transcription, without a requirement for new protein synthesis. Dose response analysis shows that MPA has a potency of ∼ 24 nM for transactivation of the anti-inflammatory GILZ gene and ∼ 4 - 20 nM for repression of the pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting that these effects are likely to be relevant at injectable contraceptive doses of MPA. These findings suggest that {{in the context of the}} genital mucosa, these GR-mediated glucocorticoid-like effects of MPA in cervical epithelial cells are likely to play a critical role in discriminating between the effects on inflammation caused by different progestins and P 4 and hence susceptibility to genital infections, given the predominant expression of the GR in primary endocervical epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Inflammatory {{processes}} {{are related to}} atherosclerosis. Identification of inflammation triggers may furnish new therapeutic pathways. In women, progestins can have a marked inflammatory capacity. OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: We investigated the effects of progesterone in men within the setting of two independent trials. First, the relation of endogenous progesterone levels to inflammation markers was assessed in 67 healthy nonsmoking Caucasian men (age, 20 - 50 yr) on a cross-sectional basis. Second, in a longitudinal controlled trial (52 wk) involving 28 healthy men receiving i. m. medication, we determined the effects of an exogenous progestin (<b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> 200 mg) in combination with a long-acting testosterone preparation (testosterone undecanoate 1000 mg) administered to avoid androgen deficiency caused by pituitary-hypothalamic feedback. Controls received testosterone plus placebo. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, progesterone levels were positively related to concentrations of IL- 6 (r = 0. 41; P < 0. 001), C-reactive protein (r = 0. 37; P = 0. 007), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (r = 0. 28; P = 0. 02), E-selectin (r = 0. 45; P < 0. 001), leptin (r = 0. 42; P < 0. 001), neutrophils (r = 0. 62; P < 0. 001), and serum protein fractions alpha- 1 (r = 0. 44; P < 0. 001) and alpha- 2 (r = 0. 36; P = 0. 002). During the pharmacological trial, the testosterone/progestin group exhibited a marked increase of IL- 6 concentrations (P < 0. 001), whereas these decreased in the testosterone/placebo group (P = 0. 03). Antiinflammatory IL- 10 levels decreased in the group receiving testosterone/progestin (P = 0. 01) but did not change in the testosterone/placebo group. CONCLUSION: Progesterone concentrations correspond to an inflammatory profile in healthy men, and external progestins elicit a similar effect. Men receiving regimens for hormonal male contraception involving progestins should be monitored for inflammatory effects. Speculatively, testosterone treatment decreasing endogenous progesterone production may facilitate beneficial effects on inflammation profiles even in eugonadal men...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between progestin-only injectable contraception {{and risk of}} HIV- 1 acquisition is controversial. Most clinical data suggests that the injectable contraceptive medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), unlike <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NET-EN), increases susceptibility to infections such as HIV- 1. The {{first part of this}} thesis investigated the differential effects, molecular mechanisms of action and steroid receptor involvement in gene expression by MPA as compared to NET and progesterone (P 4) in the End 1 /E 6 E 7 and HeLa cell line models for the endocervical epithelium, a key point of entry for pathogens in the lower female genital tract (FGT). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that MPA, unlike NET-acetate (NET-A) and P 4, increases mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory GILZ and IÎºBÎ± genes. Similarly, MPA unlike NET-A, decreases mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory IL- 6, IL- 8 and RANTES genes, and IL- 6 and IL- 8 protein levels. The predominant steroid receptor expressed in the cervical cell lines and primary endocervical epithelial cells is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and GR siRNA experiments show that the anti-inflammatory effects of MPA are mediated by the GR. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation results suggest that MPA, unlike NET-A and P 4, represses pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression in cervical epithelial cells via a mechanism involving recruitment of the GR to cytokine gene promoters, like the GR agonist dexamethasone (DEX). This is at least in part consistent with direct effects on transcription, without a requirement for new protein vi synthesis. This is the first study to show direct proof for a GR-mediated mechanism of action in anti-inflammatory effects of MPA. Dose response analysis shows that MPA has a potency of ~ 24 nM for transactivation of the anti-inflammatory GILZ gene and ~ 4 - 20 nM for repression of the pro-inflammatory genes, suggesting that these effects are likely to be relevant at injectable contraceptive doses of MPA. These findings suggest that MPA effects on genital mucosal immune function and susceptibility to infections are likely to be very different to those of NET and P 4, when mediated by the GR The second part of this thesis investigated the effects of the virion associated HIV- 1 protein, Vpr, on GR-regulated inflammatory genes {{in the presence of the}} ligands...|$|E
40|$|Observational {{studies of}} a {{putative}} association between hormonal contraception (HC) and HIV acquisition have produced conflicting results. We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies from sub-Saharan Africa {{to compare the}} incidence of HIV infection in women using combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or the injectable progestins depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NET-EN) with women not using HC. Eligible studies measured HC exposure and incident HIV infection prospectively using standardized measures, enrolled women aged 15 - 49 y, recorded ≥ 15 incident HIV infections, and measured prespecified covariates. Our primary analysis estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) using two-stage random effects meta-analysis, controlling for region, marital status, age, number of sex partners, and condom use. We included 18 studies, including 37, 124 women (43, 613 woman-years) and 1, 830 incident HIV infections. Relative to no HC use, the aHR for HIV acquisition was 1. 50 (95 % CI 1. 24 - 1. 83) for DMPA use, 1. 24 (95 % CI 0. 84 - 1. 82) for NET-EN use, and 1. 03 (95 % CI 0. 88 - 1. 20) for COC use. Between-study heterogeneity was mild (I(2) < 50 %). DMPA use was associated with increased HIV acquisition compared with COC use (aHR 1. 43, 95 % CI 1. 23 - 1. 67) and NET-EN use (aHR 1. 32, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 1. 61). Effect estimates were attenuated for studies at lower risk of methodological bias (compared with no HC use, aHR for DMPA use 1. 22, 95 % CI 0. 99 - 1. 50; for NET-EN use 0. 67, 95 % CI 0. 47 - 0. 96; and for COC use 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 73 - 1. 41) compared to those at higher risk of bias (p(interaction) = 0. 003). Neither age nor herpes simplex virus type 2 infection status modified the HC-HIV relationship. This IPD meta-analysis {{found no evidence that}} COC or NET-EN use increases women's risk of HIV but adds to the evidence that DMPA may increase HIV risk, underscoring the need for additional safe and effective contraceptive options for women at high HIV risk. A randomized controlled trial would provide more definitive evidence about the effects of hormonal contraception, particularly DMPA, on HIV risk...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{synthetic}} progestogens, {{medroxyprogesterone acetate}} (MPA) and <b>norethisterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (NET-EN),are {{widely used in}} developing countries as injectable contraceptives, where disease burden is high. Levonorgestrel (LNG) is a common progestogen used in oral contraceptives and intrauterine devices. Some studies suggest that MPA, unlike NET, increases HIV- 1 acquisition in women, while few studies have reported {{on the effects of}} LNG on HIV- 1 acquisition. Whether MPA, NET and LNG differentially affect HIV- 1 infection and the expression of key genes relevant to HIV- 1 acquisition via differential molecular mechanisms is key to understanding choice of progestogen contraceptive in young women at high risk forHIV- 1 acquisition. The central hypothesis {{of this study is that}} the differential effects on host gene expression and HIV- 1 replication by the different progestogens is due to their differential selectivity to towards different steroid receptors, in particular the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In order to investigate this hypothesis, the regulation of selected genes was investigated in cervical tissue explants from premenopausal, HIV- 1 negative, and contraception negative women and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from women, by real time quantitative PCR, western blotting and Luminex assays, in response to physiologically relevant doses of progestogens. Infection assays were performed in the absence and presence of HIV- 1 using HIV- 1 BAL-RENILLA or HIVpNL 4. 3 infectious molecular clones (IMCs). The GR antagonist RU 486 or GR siRNA knockdown was used to determine the role of the GR in modulating ligand-specific effects. PBMCs and primary cervical explants were chosen as useful models to assess the direct effects of these progestogens in both the systemic and in the local mucosal immune environments. In PBMCs, MPA like dexamethasone (DEX, a GR specific agonist), showed anti-inflammatory effects, decreasing pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL) 6, IL 8 and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted(RANTES) levels and increasing anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid interacting leucine zipper (GILZ) gene expression levels, while NET, progesterone (P 4) and LNG did not, after 48 hours. In primary ectocervical tissue explants, DEX, cortisol, MPA and P 4 significantly repressed IL 6 while only DEX, cortisol and MPA significantly repressed IL 8 and increased GILZ gene expression levels after 48 hours. Steroid receptor expression was characterised in both PBMCs and ectocervical explants. GR was the only detectable steroid receptor protein expressed in PBMCs, while ectocervical explants expressed all the steroid receptors. The progesterone and estrogen receptor levels were higher in ectocervical explants from donors that were in the follicular phase compared to ectocervical explants from donors in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In PBMCs, results suggested that differential gene expression by MPA versus NET and P 4 is mediated via the GR after 48 hours. Furthermore, it was observed that MPA and DEX, unlike NET, LNG and P 4 increases HIV- 1 replication in viable PBMCs, in the majority of donors. The increase in HIV- 1 replication in the MPA treated PBMC samples correlated significantly with an increased in IL 6 mRNA levels...|$|E
