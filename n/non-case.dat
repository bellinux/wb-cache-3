40|$|<b>Non-cases</b> are suspect Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) cases testing {{negative}} by EVD RT-PCR after {{admission to}} an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). Admitting <b>non-cases</b> to an ETC prompts concerns on case- and workload in the ETC, risk for nosocomial EVD infection, and delays in diagnosis and disease-specific treatment. We retrospectively analysed characteristics, outcomes and determinants of death of EVD cases and <b>non-cases</b> {{admitted to the}} Conakry ETC in Guinea between 03 / 2014 and 09 / 2015. Of the 2362 admitted suspects who underwent full confirmatory PCR testing, 1540 (65. 2 %) were non-cases; among them 727 needed repeated confirmatory PCR testing resulting in 2. 5 days (average) in the ETC isolation ward. Twenty-one patients tested positive on the repeat test, most {{in a period of}} flawed sampling for the initial test and none after introduction of PCR confirmation with geneXpert. No readmissions following nosocomial EVD infection were recorded. No combination of symptoms yielded acceptable sensitivity and specificity to allow differentiating confirmed from <b>non-cases.</b> Symptoms as ocular bleeding/redness have high specificity, but limited usefulness as not common. Admission delay and age distribution were not different for both groups. In total, 98 (20. 6 %) of 475 deaths in the ETC were <b>non-cases.</b> Most died within 24 hours after admission. Living in Conakry (aOR 1. 78 (1. 08 - 2. 96)) was the strongest risk factor for death. Weeks with higher admission load had lower case fatality among <b>non-cases,</b> probably because more acute (and treatable) illnesses of contacts of known cases were admitted. These findings show high numbers of potentially critically ill <b>non-cases</b> need to be considered when setting up triage and referral of EVD suspect cases. Symptoms and risk factors alone do not allow differentiating the <b>non-cases.</b> Integration of highly-sensitive EVD diagnostic methods with short turnaround time in the triage of peripheral hospitals and dropping the systematic 2 nd PCR for symptomatic early presenters could limit delays in access to adapted care of cases and seriously ill <b>non-cases.</b> Whether feasible without compromising outbreak control, and under which conditions, should be further assessed...|$|R

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study of 234 active construction workers with medical claims for CTS and 249 workers without CTS claims; <b>non-cases</b> were matched on age, trade, and insurance eligibility. We conducted telephone interviews with cases and <b>non-cases</b> and collected administrative data on work hours. ResultsCompared to <b>non-cases,</b> CTS cases {{were more likely to}} report recurrent hand symptoms, decreased work productivity/quality, decreased performance of physical work demands, and greater functional limitations. Surgical cases showed larger improvements on multiple outcomes than non-surgical cases. Minimal differences in paid work hours were seen between cases and <b>non-cases</b> in the years preceding and following CTS claims. ConclusionsPersistent symptoms and functional impairments were present several years after CTS diagnosis. Long-term functional limitations shown by this and other studies indicate the need for improved prevention and treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess whether}} there is an {{association}} between statin use and the occurrence of polymyalgia rheumatic (PMR) in the spontaneous reporting database of the World Health Organisation (WHO). METHODS: We conducted a case/non-case study based on individual case safety reports (ICSR) in the WHO global ICSR database (VigiBase). Case reports containing the adverse event term polymyalgia rheumatica (WHOART or MedDRA Preferred Term) were defined as cases. <b>Non-cases</b> were all case reports containing other adverse event terms. Each case was matched to five <b>non-cases</b> by age, gender, and time of reporting. Case reports regarding a statin as suspected or concomitant drug were identified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: We identified 327 reports of PMR as cases and 1635 reports of other ADRs as <b>non-cases.</b> Among cases, statins were more frequently reported as suspected agent (29. 4 %) compared to <b>non-cases</b> (2. 9 %). After adjustment for several covariates, statins were significantly associated with reports of PMR (ROR 14. 21; 95 % CI 9. 89 - 20. 85). CONCLUSION: The results of this study lends support to previous anecdotal case reports in the literature suggesting that the use of a statin may be associated with the occurrence of PMR.

40|$|SummaryThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relative burden of rhinitis and asthma on health-related quality of life (HRQL) as a function of gender and age in the general population. A cross-sectional, general population survey was conducted, comprising 5918 men and women aged 16 – 64 years. The SF- 36 Health Survey was administered by mail, along with questions regarding nasal complaints after 15 years of age and physician-diagnosed asthma. Overall, rhinitis and asthma were each associated with impaired HRQL compared with <b>non-cases</b> and the burden of these illnesses in combination was incremental. In the age group 16 – 49 years, men and women with rhinitis alone had significantly worse health profiles on most scales than <b>non-cases,</b> while asthmatics, with or without rhinitis, showed further decrements on only a few scales. In the age group 50 – 64 years, men with rhinitis did not differ from <b>non-cases</b> and no differences were found between asthmatics and rhinitis victims on any scale. In contrast, women aged 50 – 64 years with rhinitis had significantly worse scores than <b>non-cases</b> on bodily pain and general well-being scales (GH, VT), and asthmatics scored much lower on all scales than those with rhinitis alone. The negative association of rhinitis and asthma with HRQL differs by age and sex in the general population. Women aged 50 – 64 years with one or both ailments are particularly affected. Such gender and age differences should be taken into consideration in the care and treatment of patients with rhinitis and asthma...|$|R
40|$|Background: Two {{case reports}} of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and one case-report of PMR and temporalis {{arteritis}} (AT) {{suggest that the}} use of statins may have triggered the development of these inflammatory rheumatic diseases. PMR is closely linked to the disease arteritis temporalis which makes it difficult for physicians to distinguish these two diseases. Data on the association between the use of statins and PMR and/or AT are scarce. Objectives: To assess the association between statin use and the occurrence of PMR/AT. Methods: A case/non-case study based on individual case safety reports (ICSR) listed in the World Health Organisation (WHO) global ICSR database (Vigibase) was conducted. According to WHO adverse reaction terminology, cases were defined as reports of PMR. Each case was matched with five <b>non-cases</b> by age, gender and time of reporting. <b>Non-cases</b> were all other ADR-reports. Use of statins was classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification code system (C 10 AA, C 10 BA, C 10 BX). Potential confounders in the analysis, i. e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, anti-epileptics, proton pump inhibitors and cardiovascular drugs were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the reporting odds ratios (RORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). In addition, three case-reports from the VigiBase were studied in detail. Results: We identified 327 reports of PMR/AT as cases and 1635 reports of other ADRs as <b>non-cases.</b> Among cases statins were more frequently reported as suspected agent (29. 4 %) compared to <b>non-cases</b> (2. 9 %). After adjustment for several covariates, statins were statistically significantly associated with reports of PMR/AT (ROR 14. 21; 95 % CI 9. 89 - 20. 85).

40|$|In many medical applications, {{combining}} {{information from}} multiple biomarkers could yield a better diagnosis than any single one on its own.

40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the meaning, and explain the utility, of the case study method, a methodoften practiced but little understood. A “case study, ” I argue, is best defined as an {{intensive}} studyof a single unit with an aim to generalize across a larger set of units. Case studies rely on {{the same sort of}} covariational evidence utilized in <b>non-case</b> study research. Thus, the case study method is correctly understood as a particular way of defining cases, not a way of analyzing cases or a way of modeling causal relations. I show that this understanding of the subject illuminates some of the persistent ambiguities of case studywork, ambiguities that are, to some extent, intrinsic to the enterprise. The travails of the case study within the discipline of political science are also rooted in an insufficient appreciation of themethodological tradeoffs that thismethod calls forth. This paper presents the familiar contrast between case study and <b>non-case</b> study work as a series of characteristic strengths and weaknesses—affinities— rather than as antagonistic approaches to the empirical world. In the end, the perceived hostility between case study and <b>non-case</b> study research is largely unjustified and, perhaps, deserves to be regarded as a misconception. Indeed, the strongest conclusion to arise from this methodological examination concerns the complementarity of single-unit and cross-unit research designs. The case study occupies a vexed position in thediscipline of political science. On the one hand,methodologists generally view the case study method with extreme circumspection (Achen and Snidal 1989;King,Keohane, andVerba 1994;Lieberson [1991] 1992, 1994; Njolstad 1990). A work that focuses its attention on a single example of a broader phe-nomenon is apt to be described as a “mere ” case study. At the same time, the discipline continues to pro-duce a vast number of case studies, many of which haveentered thepantheonof classicworks (Allen 1965...|$|E
40|$|Leucine-rich alpha- 2 -glycoprotein (LRG 1) {{was found}} to be {{differentially}} expressed in sera from patients with Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC). The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the performance of LRG 1 for detection of EOC, including early stage EOC, and to evaluate if LRG 1 can complement CA 125 in order to improve EOC detection using two independent blinded sample sets. Serum LRG 1 and CA 125 were measured by immunoassays. All assays were performed blinded to clinical data. Using the two independent sample sets (156 participants for sample set 1, and 233 for sample set 2), LRG 1 was differentially expressed in EOC cases as compared to healthy, surgical, and benign controls, and its performance was not affected by the conditions of blood collection. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for LRG 1 in differentiating EOC cases from <b>non-cases</b> were 0. 797 and 0. 786 for sample set 1 and 2. For differentiating EOC cases from healthy controls, the AUC values for LRG 1 were 0. 792 and 0. 794. At a fixed specificity of 95 %, LRG 1 detects 52 %, and 53. 5 % of EOC cases from healthy controls for sample set 1 and 2. When combining LRG 1 and CA 125, the AUC value increased to 0. 927, which was improved compared to CA 125 (AUC= 0. 916) (p= 0. 008) alone in distinguishing EOC cases from <b>non-cases.</b> More importantly, LRG 1 also showed potential performance in differentiating early stage EOC from <b>non-cases</b> with an AUC of 0. 715 for sample set 1, and 0. 690 for sample set 2. The combination of LRG 1 and CA 125 resulted in an AUC of 0. 838, which outperforms CA 125 (AUC= 0. 785) (p= 0. 018) in detecting early stage EOC cases from <b>non-cases</b> using the larger sample set.

40|$|Purpose: Use of the Distress Thermometer (DT) as a {{screening}} tool is increasing across the cancer trajectory. This {{study examined the}} accuracy and optimal cut-off score of the DT compared to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for detecting possible cases of psychological morbidity among adults in early survivorship. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional survey of 1, 323 adult cancer survivors recruited from two state-based cancer registries in Australia. Participants completed the DT and the HADS at 6 months post-diagnosis. Results: Compared to the HADS subscale threshold ≥ 8, the DT performed well in discriminating between cases and <b>non-cases</b> of anxiety, depression and comorbid anxiety–depression with an area under the curve of 0. 85, 0. 84 and 0. 87, respectively. A DT cut-off score of ≥ 2 was best for clinical use (sensitivity, 87 – 95 %; specificity, 60 – 68 %), ≥ 4 was best for research use (sensitivity, 67 – 82 %; specificity, 81 – 88 %) and ≥ 3 was the best balance between sensitivity (77 – 88 %) and specificity (72 – 79 %) for detecting cases of anxiety, depression and comorbid anxiety–depression. The DT demonstrated {{a high level of}} precision in identifying <b>non-cases</b> of psychological morbidity at all possible thresholds (negative predictive value, 77 – 99 %). Conclusions: The recommended DT cut-off score of ≥ 4 was not supported for universal use among recent cancer survivors. The optimal DT threshold depends upon whether the tool is being used in the clinical or research setting.

40|$|Background & Aims—Hyperinsulinemia is a {{putative}} {{colorectal cancer}} (CRC) risk factor. Insulin resistance (IR) commonly precedes hyperinsulinemia {{and can be}} quantitatively measured using the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. To date, few studies have directly examined serum insulin {{as an indicator of}} CRC risk and none have reported associations based on HOMA-IR. Methods—We performed a case-cohort study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study (n= 29, 133). Baseline exposure and fasting serum biomarker data were available for 134 incident CRC case and 399 <b>non-case</b> subjects. HOMA-IR was derived as fasting insulin x fasting glucose/ 22. 5. Hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (HR; 95 % CIs) were estimated using age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results—Median (IQR) values for serum insulin, glucose and HOMA-IR were 4. 1 (2. 9 – 7. 2) mIU/ L, 101 (94 – 108) mg/dL, and 0. 99 (0. 69 – 1. 98) for case subjects and 4. 1 (2. 7 – 6. 1) mIU/L, 99 (93 – 107) mg/dL, and 1. 02 (0. 69 – 1. 53) for <b>non-case</b> subjects, respectively. Based on comparison of th...|$|E
40|$|Prior {{authors have}} {{concluded}} that case-specific determinants, such {{as the number of}} professionals involved in a given case or the lead attorney's hourly rate, are the principal determinants of variance in professional fees and expenses in US corporate restructurings. The implication has been that less proximate variables, such as the availability of credit, the cost of capital or coincident economic conditions, are not relevant to predictive models. While we do not question the relevance of case-specific factors we question the practicality of models that rely exclusively on such factors in order to predict future fees and expenses. Our hypothesis is that both case-specific and less proximate variables are relevant to the determination of professional costs in bankruptcy, since we believe that variables belonging to each of these categories can act as frictions to the refinancing process or otherwise inform the court's determination as to the efficacy of refinancing, thereby impacting the complexity and duration of the restructuring process. Our results are less than conclusive, since our data is limited. However, the data that we have gives us {{reason to believe that the}} addition of <b>non-case</b> predictors may improve the accuracy of case-specific models; in some instances, these non-case-specific predictors even displace case specific predictors (via a screen for statistical significance). Our analysis indicates that this improvement is more pronounced when the data is sorted for Section 364 financing. Our goal is to complement the on-going analysis of professional fees and expenses so that it might better account for the potential impact of <b>non-case</b> factors and thereby yield a more accurate and practical predictive model. by John P.

40|$|Balanced {{assessment}} {{of mental health}} involves assessing wellbeing and strengths as well as psychopathology. The character strengths of curiosity, gratitude, hope, optimism and forgiveness, are assessed in 214 new undergraduates and their relationships to mental health, subjective wellbeing and self-esteem explored. Scoring the mental health scale for psychiatric caseness, case and <b>non-case</b> students {{did not differ in}} character strengths, positive affect or life satisfaction, supporting a dual-factor model. Hope pathways and gratitude predicted mental health. Gratitude, hope agency and exploratory curiosity predicted positive affect. Gratitude and hope agency predicted life satisfaction. Hope agency, hope pathways, exploratory curiosity and gratitude predicted self-esteem, with absorption curiosity a negative predictor. The benefits of assessing strengths are discussed and interventions designed to develop them. Keywords: character strengths; mental health; subjective wellbeing; dual-factor mental health model; self-estee...|$|E
40|$|Background The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) was {{the first}} {{evaluation}} instrument developed for screening for the {{signs and symptoms of}} Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and is currently still the most used worldwide. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the ability of the LSAS-self-report version (LSAS-SR) to discriminate different Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) clinical groups. Method The sample was composed of Brazilians university students, allocated into three different groups, i. e., cases (C= 118), <b>non-cases</b> (NC= 95) and subclinical cases (SC= 39). To achieve the aim, calculations of the ROC Curve and ANOVA were performed. Results The results found were excellent regardless of the technique used, highlighting the discrimi-natory capacity of the LSAS-SR. The score equal to or greater than 32 is suggested as a cutoff score for the Brazilian population, since this presented balance between the stan-dards evaluated and the ability to differentiate both clinical and subclinical SAD cases from <b>non-cases.</b> Conclusion Despite the specific sample used in this study being composed only of university students, the use of the LSAS-SR can be indicated, in the Brazilian setting, for SAD screening in both clinical and research contexts...|$|R
30|$|We also {{conducted}} a dose–response analysis {{using the method}} proposed by Greenland and Longnecker (1992). This method required that the distribution of cases and person-years or <b>non-cases</b> and risk estimates within the variance are known {{for at least three}} quantitative exposure categories. We explored a potential non-linear dose–response relationship between tooth loss and risk of oesophageal cancer using the generalised least squares for trend estimation and restricted cubic spline with four knots at 5, 35, 65 and 95  % of the distribution.|$|R
40|$|Ovarian cancer {{patients}} may experience psychological disorders {{due to the}} aggressive nature of the illness and treatment. We investigated the presence of psychological disorders longitudinally in women with a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer and the factors that predicted development and maintenance of these disorders. Patients were assessed in a prospective longitudinal study {{at the beginning of}} chemotherapy treatment, mid-treatment, end of treatment and 3 months follow-up for depression, anxiety, perceived social support, neuroticism and cognitive strategies to control unwanted thoughts. A total of 121 patients were recruited and 85 patients were assessed at all four time points. Three different longitudinal profiles of anxiety and depression caseness were found: <b>non-cases</b> (never cases), occasional cases (cases on at least one but not all four occasions) and stable cases (cases on all four occasions). Most of the women were occasional cases of anxiety (52 %, 44), whereas for depression, the majority of women were <b>non-cases</b> (55 %, 47). A subset of patients were stable cases of anxiety (22 %, 19). Neuroticism and marital status were significant independent predictors of anxiety caseness profile. Neuroticism and use of anti-depressants were independent predictors of depression caseness profile. Social support was not related to psychological morbidity...|$|R
