40|$|The key {{focus of}} this {{longitudinal}} study in the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the role of social support (i. e. perceived availability of emotional support, lack of received problem-focused emotional support, and negative interactions) and positive and negative self-esteem in depressive symptoms in 475 recently diagnosed cancer patients and 255 individuals without cancer from the general population. Patients and the comparison group were interviewed and filled in a questionnaire at two points in time: 3 months (T 1) and 15 months (T 2) after diagnosis. The results indicated that social support and self-esteem <b>were</b> weakly <b>to</b> moderately related to each other. Negative self-esteem was more strongly related to all three types of social support, compared to positive self-esteem. Regression analyses showed that social support and self-esteem <b>were</b> independently related <b>to</b> depressive symptoms (concurrently), such that lower levels of social support and self-esteem were strongly associated {{with higher levels of}} depressive symptoms. This finding suggests that these two resources supplement each other additively. A longitudinal analysis showed that social support and self-esteem also predicted future levels of depressive symptoms, although the explained variance was much lower than in a cross-sectional analysis. Comparisons between cancer patients and the comparison group generally revealed {{no significant differences between the}} two groups in the associations of social support and self-esteem with depressive symptoms. The only exception was a lack of problem-focused emotional support. At three months after diagnosis, a lack of this type of support, characterised by reassuring, comforting, problem-solving, and advice, was more strongly related to depressive symptoms in patients than in the comparison group.

40|$|Prevalence of {{gastrointestinal}} parasites was {{studied in}} 106 heifers imported to Poland from the Netherlands.

The study showed the mean prevalence of Eimeria protozoans in the heifers imported from the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>to</b> Poland <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 17. 92 %; the mean prevalences of Cryptosporidium sp. (11. 32 %), gastrointestinal nematodes (55. 66 %) and Fasciola hepatica (32. 08 %), respectively. The following 6 coccidia species were isolated from faecal samples: E. bovis, E. aubernensis, E. ellipsoidalis, E. subspherica, E. zürni, and E. brasiliensis. The prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in the cattle imported from the <b>Netherlands</b> <b>to</b> Poland <b>was</b> very high, therefore it <b>is</b> purposeful <b>to</b> mandatorily examine the imported cattle for the presence of those parasites...|$|R
