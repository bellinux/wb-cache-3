Gothenburg, 2015 In July 2014, proposition 2013 / 14 : 127 was accepted and the Plan and Construction Law was adjusted to accept “Attefallshus”, a 25 m 2 complementary building that can be built without a building permit and outside plan regulations, named after the then Civil and Housing Minister of Sweden, Stefan Attefall. While architects discussed whether the change of law was right or not, the actors on the housing market took action. The very same day as the law was approved, there was Attefallshus available on the market. One of the big concerns among architects has been the risk of a low architectural standard for th...|$|R

50|$|Detainees wearing {{civilian}} clothing (more common {{later in}} the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent X on the back. This made for an ersatz prisoner uniform. For permanence, such Xs were made with white oil paint, with sewn-on cloth strips, or were cut (with underlying jacket-liner fabric providing the contrasting color). Detainees would be compelled to sew their <b>number</b> and (<b>if</b> <b>applicable)</b> a triangle emblem onto the fronts of such X-ed clothing.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1980s many North American Class I railroads began adding radio {{transmitters}} {{and mechanical}} voices to their defect detectors; as trains passed detectors, the mechanical or pre-recorded voice would sound {{out on the}} railroad's main road radio channel that a train has passed and note any defects that were found. Most often, after a train has passed such an equipped detector, the mechanical voice will report the railroad name, milepost or location, track <b>number</b> (<b>if</b> <b>applicable),</b> <b>number</b> of axles on the train that passed and the phrase [...] "no defects" [...] to indicate that no problems were detected on the train. Sometimes the location's ambient temperature and train speed are also noted by the mechanical voice. When a problem is detected, the mechanical voice will often start with a long, high pitch alarm tone followed by {{a description of the}} problem and the axle position within the train where the problem occurred. Crews can use their touch-tone hand radios to get the detector to repeat error messages. Defect detectors that are equipped with such a mechanical voice are often called talking detectors by railfans.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of our VBORT algorithm to observation of multiple dynamic targets with robot teams. VBORT is a distributed algorithm that directs the motions of a robot team to maximize effectiveness in observation tasks. The algorithm chooses the most appropriate move for each robot by determining the move with the greatest value. Value is related to reduction in target estimate uncertainty over all simultaneous robot observations. This approach {{can be applied to}} any <b>number</b> of tasks <b>if</b> <b>applicable</b> value functions are provided. Multiple objectives may be simultaneously considered through addition of other value functions. In previous work, VBORT has been applied to mapping static targets and shown to provide results close to a one-step optimal [8]. Here VBORT is applied to observing dynamic objects. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the approach. In the dynamic case, robots are able to follow targets and provide more effective complementary observations than without VBORT. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} of an RFC squadron varied depending on its designated role, although {{the commanding officer}} was usually a major (in a largely non-operational role), with the squadron 'flights' (annotated A, B, C etc.) the basic tactical and operational unit, each commanded by a captain. A 'recording officer' (of captain/lieutenant rank) would act as intelligence officer and adjutant, commanding two or three NCOs and ten other ranks in the administration section of the squadron. Each flight contained on average between six and ten pilots (and a corresponding <b>number</b> of observers, <b>if</b> <b>applicable)</b> with a senior sergeant and thirty-six other ranks (as fitters, riggers, metalsmiths, armourers, etc.). The average squadron also had on complement an equipment officer, armaments officer (each with five other ranks) and a transport officer, in charge of twenty-two other ranks.The squadron transport establishment typically included 1 car, 5 light tenders, 7 heavy tenders, 2 repair lorries, 8 motorcycles and 8 trailers.|$|R
