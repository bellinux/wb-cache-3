500|$|The {{title of}} A Flash Flood of Colour was {{intended}} to describe the album's music, and Reynolds noted its colourful blend of musical genres. He said that the band wanted a title with a [...] "big sound" [...] which was positive and forward-thinking, and it derives from the lyrics of [...] "Warm Smiles Do <b>Not</b> <b>Make</b> <b>You</b> Welcome Here".|$|E
500|$|... "Warm Smiles Do <b>Not</b> <b>Make</b> <b>You</b> Welcome Here" [...] {{incorporates}} stadium rock into Enter Shikari's typical style. Reynolds described [...] "Hello Tyrannosaurus, Meet Tyrannicide" [...] as {{a critique}} of certain democracies which are [...] "polite dictatorships", specifically referring {{to those in the}} Arab Spring movement. The album closes with [...] "Constellations", a [...] "rallying call {{about the future of the}} human race". With a [...] "swirling" [...] string quartet resembling [...] "System..."'s, the anthemic song has a post-rock sound.|$|E

Conflicting currents met, and wrestled; and one dark arch led to channels, seaward tending.|$|R
60|$|But, O thou blind Pharisee! since {{thou art}} so {{confident}} that thy state is good, and thy righteousness {{is that that}} will stand when it shall be tried with fire (1 Cor. iii. 13), let me now reason with thee of righteousness.

Mariah Carey's music video for her song [...] "Touch My Body" [...] features a nerd strumming on a Guitar Hero controller. [...] The music video for San Diego rock band Switchfoot's song [...] "Awakening" [...] featured two men going home and competing separately on Guitar Hero, using stop-motion cardboard cutouts to simulate the video game interface. The music video for Eminem's [...] "We Made You" [...] includes portions of the song where Eminem is singing in front of a Guitar Hero-like note highway. The video for Brad Paisley's video for [...] "Start a Band", featuring Keith Urban, {{includes a}} Guitar Hero-like [...] "Guitar Showdown" [...] video game as part of the video's story.|$|E

2500|$|Forcing the regent, Maria Cristina, {{into exile}} for her {{conspiracy}} with the moderates, Espartero himself became regent {{with the intention}} of remaining so until the future Queen Isabella II became of age. Espartero's popularity enabled him to defeat moderate military rebellions across Spain during 1841. Yet his ruthless execution of dozens of the conspirators, including many popular fellow war heroes like Diego de Leon, as well as his hasty and ungrateful dissolution of the radical [...] that had ended the rebellions, decreased the popularity of his regency. (Maria Cristina told him, [...] "I made you a duke, but I could <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> a gentleman.") ...|$|E

2500|$|As the {{dedication}} included those {{who served in}} the Finnish Army, the Wehrmacht and particularly the Waffen SS, a number of organisations condemned it; most notably the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued an official protest stating that the monument glorifies [...] "those who were willing to sacrifice their lives to help achieve the victory of Nazi Germany". Ilmar Haaviste, head of the Association of Estonian [...] Veterans, who fought on the German side, says he does not regret taking the German uniform, because there was a [...] "naïve" [...] hope that somehow an independent Estonia could be salvaged. He thinks wearing a German uniform does <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> a fascist and that both regimes, Nazi and Soviet were equally evil - {{there was no difference between}} the two except that Stalin was more cunning. Tiit Madisson, the governor of the Lihula parish, said at the opening ceremony that Estonians' serving in German army chose the lesser evil. The monument caused concern among some Jewish officials and organisations, including the Chief Rabbi of Estonia and Russia’s Jewish Communities Federation.|$|E

60|$|Yes; a simple, godly, industrious life, {{doing the}} duty which lies nearest you, {{avoiding}} sin {{as you would}} an adder, because it is sure sooner or later to sting you, if you touch it, is the straight road, and the only road, to happiness, either in this life, or in the life to come. Pleasure and amusement, drinking and jollity, will <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> happy. Money will <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> happy. Cleverness, and cunning, {{and knowledge of the}} world will <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>you</b> happy. Scholarship and learning will not. But plain, simple righteousness, simply doing right, will.|$|E
