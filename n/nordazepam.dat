25|$|Diazepam was {{detected}} in 26% {{of cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs in Sweden, and its active metabolite <b>nordazepam</b> {{was detected}} in 28% of cases. Other benzodiazepines and zolpidem and zopiclone also were found in high numbers. Many drivers had blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines and zolpidem and zopiclone. In Northern Ireland in cases where drugs were detected in samples from impaired drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, benzodiazepines were found in 87% of cases. Diazepam was the most commonly detected benzodiazepine.|$|E
25|$|Early {{long-term}} higher-dose {{therapy with}} AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. All {{of these conditions}} were generally found to be reversible upon reduction of AZT dosages. They {{have been attributed to}} several possible causes, including transient depletion of mitochondrial DNA, sensitivity of the γ-DNA polymerase in some cell mitochondria, the depletion of thymidine triphosphate, oxidative stress, reduction of intracellular L-carnitine or apoptosis of the muscle cells. Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using erythropoetin to stimulate red blood cell production. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as indomethacin, <b>nordazepam,</b> acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and trimethoprim decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication. Today, side-effects are much less common with the use of lower doses of AZT.|$|E
2500|$|Oxazepam is {{an active}} {{metabolite}} formed during the breakdown of diazepam, <b>nordazepam,</b> and certain similar drugs. It may be safer than many other benzodiazepines in patients with impaired liver function {{because it does not}} require hepatic oxidation, but rather, it is simply metabolized by glucuronidation, so oxazepam is less likely to accumulate and cause adverse reactions in the elderly or people with liver disease. Oxazepam is similar to lorazepam in this respect.|$|E
2500|$|Diazepam {{undergoes}} {{oxidative metabolism}} by demethylation (CYP 2C9, 2C19, 2B6, 3A4, and 3A5), hydroxylation (CYP 3A4 and 2C19) and glucuronidation {{in the liver}} {{as part of the}} cytochrome P450 enzyme system. It has several pharmacologically active metabolites. The main active metabolite of diazepam is desmethyldiazepam (also known as <b>nordazepam</b> or nordiazepam). Its other active metabolites include the minor active metabolites temazepam and oxazepam. These metabolites are conjugated with glucuronide, and are excreted primarily in the urine. Because of these active metabolites, the serum values of diazepam alone are not useful in predicting the effects of the drug. Diazepam has a biphasic half-life of about one to three days, and two to seven days for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. [...] Most of the drug is metabolised; very little diazepam is excreted unchanged. [...] The elimination half-life of diazepam and also the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action, as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can be too}} {{difficult}} to withdraw from short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of {{the intensity of the}} rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, <b>nordazepam,</b> and prazepam. [...] Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nordazepam</b> {{is among}} the longest lasting (longest half-life) benzodiazepines, and its {{occurrence}} as a metabolite is responsible for most cumulative side-effects of its myriad of pro-drugs when they are used repeatedly at moderate-high doses; the <b>nordazepam</b> metabolite oxazepam is also active (and is a more potent, full BZD-site agonist), which contributes to <b>nordazepam</b> cumulative side-effects but occur too minutely {{to contribute to the}} cumulative side-effects of <b>nordazepam</b> pro-drugs (except when they are abused chronically in extremely supra-therapeutic doses).|$|E

50|$|<b>Nordazepam</b> is {{a partial}} agonist at the GABAA receptor, {{which makes it}} less potent than other benzodiazepines, {{particularly}} in its amnesic and muscle-relaxing effects. Its elimination half life is between 36 and 200 hours, with wide variation among individuals; factors such as age and gender are known to impact it. The variation of reported half-lifes are attributed to differences in <b>nordazepam</b> metabolism and that of its metabolites as <b>nordazepam</b> is hydroxylated to active metabolites such as oxazepam, before finally being glucuronidated and excreted in the urine. This {{can be attributed to}} extremely variable hepatic and renal metabolic functions among individuals depending upon a number of factors (including age, ethnicity, disease, and current or previous use/abuse of other drugs/medicines).|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} of <b>nordazepam</b> include somnolence, which {{is more common in}} elderly {{patients}} and/or people on high-dose regimens. Hypotonia, which is much less common, is also associated with high doses and/or old age.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nordazepam</b> (INN; marketed under {{brand names}} Nordaz, Stilny, Madar, Vegesan, and Calmday; {{also known as}} nordiazepam, desoxydemoxepam, and desmethyldiazepam) is a 1,4-{{benzodiazepine}} derivative. Like other benzodiazepine derivatives, it has amnesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. However, it is used primarily {{in the treatment of}} anxiety disorders. It is an active metabolite of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, prazepam, pinazepam, and medazepam.|$|E

50|$|Pinazepam {{differs from}} other benzodiazepines {{in that it}} has a {{propargyl}} group at the N-1 position of the benzodiazepine structure. It is less toxic than diazepam and in animal studies it appears to produce anxiolytic and anti-agitation properties with limited hypnotic and motor coordination impairing properties. Pinazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The main active metabolites of pinazepam are depropargylpinazepam (N-desmethyldiazepam, <b>nordazepam)</b> and oxazepam. In humans pinazepam acts as a pure anxiolytic agent in that it does not possess to any significant degree the other pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepines. Its lack of intellectual, motor and hypnotic impairing effects makes it more appropriate than other benzodiazepines for day time use. The elimination half-life is longer in the elderly.|$|E

50|$|Fosazepam {{has similar}} effects on sleep as other benzodiazepines. In a {{clinical}} trial {{it was reported that}} fosazepam to lead to increased sleep duration with less broken sleep but sleep quality was worsened with suppressed deep sleep and increased light sleep. Adverse effects included feelings of impaired morning vitality and upon discontinuing the drug benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of anxiety, impaired concentration and impaired morning vitality were experienced. Another clinical trial also found worsening of sleep while on benzodiazepines as well as during withdrawal with suppression of deep sleep stages including REM sleep, with increased light sleep upon withdrawal. The main metabolites of fosazepam are 3-hydroxyfosazepam and the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam which has a very long elimination half-life of about 3 days. Tolerance to the hypnotic effects of fosazepam starts to develop after about 7 days of use. Due to the very long elimination half-life of the active metabolite of fosazepam it is not recommended for use as a hypnotic. The main pharmacological effects of fosazepam may be due to its metabolite nordiazepam (desmethyldiazepam), rather than the parent drug. The long-acting active metabolite <b>nordazepam</b> can cause extended sedative effects at high doses or with prolonged use, and may produce residual sedation upon awakening.|$|E
40|$|Pregnant {{women are}} exposed to benzodiazepines for {{therapeutic}} purposes during gestation. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines. Time of exposure during course of pregnancy is a significant aspect of fetal exposure to drugs. Benzodiazepine concentration assay in hair of mothers and newborns exposed prenatally to these drugs was performed in the studies. Development, validation and evaluation of benzodiazepine determination method in mothers and their newborns enables assessment of health risks for the child and implementation of adequate therapeutic procedures. We used A LC-ESI-MS/MS method that allowed determination of diazepam (the main benzodiazepine used by pregnant women was diazepam) and its metabolites (<b>nordazepam,</b> oxazepam) in hair of mothers and newborns. LOQ 10 pg/mg of hair was used in the study. Results: concentration of <b>nordazepam</b> was higher than parent drug (diazepam) and higher in newborns’ hair when compared to mothers’. The mean concentrations of diazepam in mothers’ hair were 31. 6 ± 36. 0 and 34. 1 ± 42. 4 pg/mg in the second and third trimester of pregnancy respectively. The mean concentration of diazepam in newborns’ hair was higher and reached levels of 53. 3 ± 36. 5 pg/mg. The mean concentration of <b>nordazepam</b> in the mothers’ hair corresponding to the second and third trimester was 52. 9 ± 48. 1 and 89. 9 ± 122. 8 pg/mg, respectively. <b>Nordazepam</b> in the newborns’ hair was detected at the mean level of 108. 1 ± 144. 2 pg/mg. It was concluded that diazepam and <b>nordazepam</b> are permanently incorporated into the hair structure. Presence of diazepam and its metabolites in newborn’s hair confirms that these benzodiazepines permeate placental barrier. Segmental analysis of mothers’ hair enabled the assessment of drug administration time. Diazepam and its metabolites determined in hair of newborns may serve as biomarkers of prenatal exposure to these drugs. The performed LC-MS/MS analysis was accurate enough to determine even low concentrations of benzodiazepines, at the level of few pg/mg of hair. Levels of diazepam detected in hair of newborns were higher than levels determined in mothers. This may confirm the fact, that fetus’s ability to metabolize diazepam is scarce. <b>Nordazepam</b> was found in higher concentrations in hair of newborns than in hair of mothers, which may suggest that it is cumulated in child’s organism. Other metabolites of diazepam - oxazepam and temazepam - were detected in very few cases, in low concentrations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA gas chromatography-tandem mass {{spectrometry}} {{method for detection}} of diazepam, <b>nordazepam</b> and oxazepam is presented. The method associates electron capture ionization and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). No derivatization is performed; oxazepam undergoes thermal degradation during chromatographic injection and is thus quantified via its decomposition product. The negative molecular ions are so stable {{that they do not}} dissociate when collision is performed under "classical" conditions (i. e. with argon as collision gas). With xenon as collision gas, the energy transfer is sufficient to provide two product ions for diazepam and <b>nordazepam</b> and one product ion for the decomposition product of oxazepam. The sample preparation part involves liquid/liquid extraction with TOXI-TUBES A extraction tubes; it provides recovery yields between 68 and 95 %, depending of the benzodiazepine considered, with coefficients of variation below 6 % for 10 samples. The applicability of the method was demonstrated on urine extracts. From 1 mL of urine, the method provides quantitation limits of 0. 15 ng/mL for diazepam, 1. 0 ng/mL for <b>nordazepam</b> and 1. 5 ng/mL for oxazepam.

40|$|The {{effects of}} chronic {{moderate}} (15 %) ethanol consumption and ageing on rat hepatic cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase activities were examined using diazepam, <b>nordazepam,</b> d-benzphetamine, erythromycin, ethylmorphine and nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) as substrates. In addition, {{the effects of}} moderate ethanol alone on the oxidation of metoprolol, morphine and temazepam were examined. Cytochrome P 450 specific content increased significantly only in the 6 -week ethanol-treated rats, and no changes in percentage liver to body weights were apparent {{in any of the}} ethanol-treated animals compared with pair-fed controls. Only cytochrome P 450 IIIA enzyme activities displayed age-related decreases, these being identified in the pair-fed animals. C 3 -hydroxylation of diazepam and <b>nordazepam</b> (36 % of controls) and N-demethylation of erythromycin and ethylmorphine (58 % and 64 % of controls) were decreased in 6 -week ethanol-treated animals, these effects being less pronounced in the 12, 24 and 48 -week ethanol-treated groups. The decrease seen for diazepam and d-benzphetamine N-demethylation caused by ethanol consumption was approximately 80 % of control groups {{for the duration of the}} treatment. NDMA and morphine N-demethylations were increased to 120 % of control activities and metoprolol alpha-hydroxylase was increased to 140 % of control activities at 6 weeks, whilst metoprolol O-demethylase activity remained unaltered.

The number of mono-intoxications with oxazepam and <b>nordazepam</b> included in the toxicodynetic study was 257 and 74 cases, respectively. The T 0 was known in all cases (100  %). The Emax in both oxazepam and nordiazepam was sleepiness or obtundation occurring in 108 and 36 cases of oxazepam and nordiazepam, respectively. Noteworthy, coma was never used to qualify alteration in consciousness of the poisoned patients. The median delay in onset was 1  h in both poisonings. Interestingly in both poisonings, there was no reported delay in onset of the Emax which was reported on a “on–off” mode. The median TI resulting in the Emax effect was 3.3 - and 19.6 -fold, the maximum recommended daily dose in oxazepam and nordiazepam poisonings, respectively. Follow-up of the poisoned patients was performed in only 19 and 13  % of the oxazepam and nordiazepam poisonings, respectively, precluding any definitive conclusion about the duration of symptoms.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA gas chromatography-ion trap tandem mass {{spectrometry}} method for simultaneous detection of 22 benzodiazepines is presented. Four operating modes were first optimized: the {{electron impact ionization}} and chemical ionization modes were compared on both underivatized and trimethylsilylated drugs. Results were compared in terms of sensitivity in MS-MS experiments. The trimethylsilylation of benzodiazepines including a protic functional group allows decreasing their detection threshold {{by a factor of}} 10 - 100. In terms of sensitivity, the comparison between both ionization modes shows that the most efficient one depends on the benzodiazepine considered. The use of an ion trap analyzer allows switching from an ionization mode to another one during the chromatographic process. It also provides a great selectivity owing to the MS-MS and multiple reaction monitoring acquisition modes. The detection thresholds are in the range 10 - 500 pg/microl for all the studied benzodiazepines but the three "triazolo" ones: estazolam, alprazolam and triazolam, have a detection threshold of 1 ng/microl. The applicability of the method on whole blood and urine extracts was demonstrated on an example implying five benzodiazepines among the most frequently encountered in forensic toxicology: <b>nordazepam,</b> oxazepam, bromazepam, flunitrazepam and prazepam...|$|E

40|$|A {{restricted}} access material (RAM), alkyl-diol-silica (ADS), {{was used to}} prepare a highly bio-compatible solid-phase microextraction (SPME) capillary for the automated and direct in-tube extraction of several benzodiazepines from human serum. The bifunctionality of the ADS extraction phase prevented fouling of the capillary by protein adsorption while simultaneously trapping the analytes in the hydrophobic porous interior. This the first report of a {{restricted access}} material utilized as an extraction phase for in-tube SPME. The approach simplified the required apparatus in comparison to existing RAM column switching procedures, and more importantly eliminated the excessive use of extraction solvents. The biocompatibility of the ADS material also overcame the existing problems with in-tube SPME that requires an ultrafiltration or other deproteinization step prior to handling biological samples, therefore further minimizing the sample preparation requirements. The calculated oxazepam, temazepam, <b>nordazepam</b> and diazepam detection limits were 26, 29, 22 and 24 ng/ml in serum, respectively. The method was linear over the range of 50 - 50 @? 000 ng/ml with an average linear coefficient (R 2) value of 0. 9998. The injection repeatability and intra-assay precision of the method were evaluated with five injections of a 10 -@mg/ml serum sample (spiked with all compounds), resulting in an average RSD< 7 %. The ADS extraction column was robust, providing many direct injections of biological fluids for the extraction and subsequent determination of benzodiazepines...|$|E
