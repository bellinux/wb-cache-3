500|$|The black PTC {{employees}} {{enlisted the}} help of the NAACP and started lobbying the federal authorities, particularly the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC), to intervene. The Fair Employment Practices Commission, created by an executive order of the President in 1941, was charged with ensuring non-discrimination employment practices by government contractors. Initially it was a fairly weak agency, but its authority was significantly strengthened in 1943 by a new executive order that required all government contracts to have a <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>clause.</b> As the war progressed, the manpower shortages were getting more severe. In January 1943 the PTC requested 100 white motormen from the United States Employment Service (USES), which {{was a part of the}} [...] War Manpower Commission (WMC). The WMC, aware that PTC had a pool of black employees seeking upgrading, asked the PTC to allow hiring of black employees for the vacant motormen positions. The PTC refused, again citing the [...] "customs clause" [...] of its union contract. After a complaint from the NAACP, the matter landed at the FEPC, headed at the time by Malcolm Ross.|$|E
500|$|Phi Tau {{was founded}} at Dartmouth College in 1905 as the Tau Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa. While the {{national}} fraternity {{proved to be}} an early leader among its peers in the area of non-discrimination, mid-1950s Tau Chapter leaders led the demand for such post-war era changes. The pace of change was contentious: Phi Sigma Kappa had previously had occasional foreign student members at many chapters. Unlike other fraternities, it had also welcomed Catholics and Jews {{at a time when most}} fraternity members were Protestant. But it did not yet welcome Blacks. In a reactionary response to a short-lived policy that limited pledging of Black students between 1952–56, and in a move that allowed it to avoid unpaid debts to the national, Tau broke with Phi Sigma Kappa and reformed itself as Phi Tau on March 7, 1956, naming the national fraternity as racist. [...] Yet ironically, the Dartmouth chapter won the debate over the issue: the same discriminatory policy that caused Tau to withdraw was itself rescinded by the national fraternity at its Summer Convention just two months later, leaving Phi Sigma Kappa chapters free to pledge Black members. There has been no reconciliation, even though both groups remain progressive. Today, Phi Tau prides itself on its progressiveness; when the house constitution was rewritten in 1956, references to gender were deliberately excluded, making the house officially coeducational even before Dartmouth College accepted women as students. [...] Phi Tau is the only coeducational Greek organization at Dartmouth that has always had female members since first admitting them, and was the first Greek house at Dartmouth to add sexual orientation to its <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>clause.</b> [...] Members of Phi Tau refer to one another as [...] "brothers" [...] regardless of gender. The fraternity is known for its quarterly [...] "Milque and Cookies" [...] party, featuring thousands of homemade cookies and milkshakes.

40|$|The {{principle}} of equality and non-discrimination is firmly recognized in the Inter-American Human Rights System (IAS) and has been invoked repeatedly by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. However, there is an application and interpretation somewhat confusing of the clauses enshrining this principle. The lack of clarity brings difficulties to assess the scope and meaning {{of each of the}} <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>clauses,</b> which in turn makes problematic the litigation of victims and States before the Court. This article aims to shed some light on this complex picture, suggesting a classification of <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>clauses</b> in three groups: autonomous, subordinate and incorporated.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the jurisprudence of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Panels and Appellate Body (AB) and investment tribunals on <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>clauses</b> {{contained in the}} WTO agreements and investment agreements respectively. The thesis puts forward an alternative conceptual perspective through which the interpretation of non-discrimination provisions in international economic law could be analysed. It is argued that nondiscrimination obligations (as every legal rule {{to a greater or}} lesser extent) are inherently indeterminate. This is a fortiori the case in regard to non-discrimination provisions due to their link to the concept of equality. The concept of equality is open-ended and value-laden: its content depends on the prioritisation of different values. Thus, equality in the economic sphere can accommodate different conceptions which reflect different ideological approaches in relation to regulation, economic development and the proper role of the State in the economy. International courts and tribunals enjoy broad discretion in selecting which conception of equality to adopt when interpreting <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>clauses.</b> This indeterminacy is a positive characteristic of international economic regimes. Both the WTO and the investment arbitration regime are equipped with institutional characteristics which enable the contestation of different ideological approaches and promote pluralism. In the WTO context, this role is fulfilled by the institutional structure of the organization which facilitates the dialogue between the WTO members and the WTO Dispute Settlement System. In the realm of international investment arbitration, the mechanism of party-appointed arbitrators, despite its shortcomings which can be addressed, ensures value pluralism. </p...|$|R

This case was about a performance of the opera La Bohème by Puccini by a state-owned theatre in Wiesbaden in the German state of Hesse in the seasons 1993/94 and 1994/95. Under the German laws of the time, the rule of the shorter term applied to foreign works and the opera was thus in the public domain in Germany since the end of 1980, when its 56-year Italian copyright term had run out. (Puccini had died on November 29, 1924.) Domestic works at the same time enjoyed a copyright term of 70 years after the authors death in Germany. A publisher of musical works claimed to hold the rights to Puccini's works in Germany, and took the state of Hesse to court, based on the <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>clause,</b> which he claimed prescribed a copyright term of 70 years in Germany also for foreign works.

2500|$|The Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) was {{a federal}} {{executive}} order requiring companies with government contracts not to discriminate {{on the basis}} of race or religion. It assisted African Americans in obtaining jobs in industry. Under pressure from A. Philip Randolph's growing March on Washington Movement, on June 25, 1941, President Roosevelt created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) by signing Executive Order 8802. It said [...] "there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin". In 1943 Roosevelt greatly strengthened FEPC with a new executive order, #9346. It required that all government contracts have a <b>non-discrimination</b> <b>clause.</b> FEPC was the most significant breakthrough ever for Blacks and women on the job front. During the war the federal government operated airfields, shipyards, supply centers, ammunition plants, and other facilities that employed millions. FEPC rules applied and guaranteed equality of employment rights. These facilities shut down when the war ended. In the private sector the FEPC was generally successful in enforcing non-discrimination in the North, it did not attempt to challenge segregation in the South, and in the border region its intervention led to hate strikes by angry white workers.|$|E

Nonetheless, the Dutch and French governments have taken steps to break this link between solidarity and territorially bounded consumption of welfare, by providing lifelong income security for older migrants who return to countries of origin on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. This article asks what motivated policymakers to initially develop these novel policy tools for transnational ageing which contradict the territorial logic of the welfare state. Based on interviews with key stakeholders and available official documents, we find that in both France and the Netherlands, policymakers’ initial motivations can be characterised as rather benign, if not beneficent: to facilitate return for those who are willing but unable to afford it. However, two types of obstacle have impeded the delivery of such policies. <b>Non-discrimination</b> <b>clauses</b> and free movement rights in EU law may make it difficult to implement policies for specific categories of older migrants. Electoral realpolitik may also lead policymakers to shelve policies which benefit older migrants, in a European context where public opinion on immigration is less and less favourable.

Property rights have frequently been regarded as preventing the realisation of human rights for all, through for example slavery and the exploitation of others. Unequal distribution of wealth often follows line of sex, race and minorities, therefore property rights may appear to be part of the problem, rather than as an interest that merits protection.

Efforts have been undertaken in recent years to translate the clause in a multilateral framework, as it represents a suitable solution to the chaos in international trade relation after World War II. This thesis contains four chapters. The method adopted in it is a historical, analytical and critical approach. Chapter One deals with the most-favoured-nation clause before WTO. It shows the long history of the clause in international trade relations. Also it defines the notion of most-favoured-nation clause achieving equality is the main function of the inclusion of the MFN in the GATT. The chapter goes further and explains that there are many fields for applying the clause but it has origin in trade agreements. The chapter also deals with types of MFN clauses, and some experience of implementation of the clause. Chapter Two deals with the most-favoured-nation clause in WTO agreements. It defines the WTO and its regime. The main MFN provisions in WTO trade agreements are Article I of GATT which governs trade in goods, Article II of GATS which governs trade in services, and Article 4 of TRIPS which governs IPR. xvi Chapter Three explains the exceptions to the MFN clause in WTO agreement.
