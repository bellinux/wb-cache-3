Trading-restricted, <b>business</b> <b>days</b> refer to days where trading hours are shorter but business activity (including settlement) is normal; trading, non-business days refer to days where trading takes place almost normally but the settlement of securities is delayed. Seven days {{are included in the}} analysis: the Bank Holiday in NSW (non-business), Labour Day in NSW (non-business), Easter Thursday (early close), Labour Day in Victoria (non-business), Melbourne Cup Day in Melbourne (non-business), the last <b>business</b> <b>day</b> before Christmas (early close) and the last <b>business</b> <b>day</b> of the calendar year (early close). Three indexes provide different daily return measures: the All Ordinaries (market), 1958 - 2007, the Small Ordinaries (small-cap), 1994 - 2007; and the ASX 100 (large-cap), 1992 - 2007.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{changes in}} share price momentum {{by comparing the}} share price momentum {{before and after the}} ex-dividend date. The study was conducted using price data from shares comprising the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Shareholder Weighted Top 40 Index on 30 June 2015. Share price momentum changes were considered over 10 <b>business</b> <b>days,</b> 21 <b>business</b> <b>days</b> and 90 <b>business</b> <b>days</b> before and after the ex-dividend date. The results of the study are as follows: The share price momentum tends to be positive before and after the ex-dividend date. On average, the share price momentum is positive more frequently before the ex-dividend date than afterwards. Comparing before and after ex-dividend date share price momentum, there was no statistically significant difference over 10 and 21 <b>business</b> <b>days.</b> When comparing before and after ex-dividend date share price momentum over 90 <b>business</b> <b>days,</b> a statistically significant difference exists.

50|$|In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission {{stipulates}} the T+3 rule, {{that stock}} trades settle {{three days after}} purchase. The ex-dividend date is normally two <b>business</b> <b>days</b> (3 minus 1) before the record date. After September 5, 2017 the settlement period will be one day shorter. For the purpose of calculating an ex-dividend date, <b>business</b> <b>days</b> are days on which both the major stock exchanges and the banks in New York State are open. Thus Columbus Day and Veterans Day are trading <b>days,</b> but not <b>business</b> <b>days</b> for calculating an ex-dividend date, since they are legal holidays and banks are not open.|$|R
