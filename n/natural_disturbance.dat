40|$|Risk of <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> is a {{frequently}} discussed {{topic in}} the context of mountain spruce forests and global climate change. Recently, large-scale <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> such as bark beetle outbreaks and windfalls have appeared relatively more frequently in Central-European mountain spruce (Picea abies L.) forests, which led to the enforcement of salvage logging even in some protected areas. Our study was performed as part of a long-term observation of recovery of spruce forests aff ected by bark beetle and windfall with and without interventions in two Central-European national parks, Šumava National Park in the Czech Republic and Tatra National Park in Slovakia. Th e results proved the ability of spruce forests to recover unassisted even from stand-replacing <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Th eir biological legacies, which include standing and lying dead wood, are important for natural regeneration of tree species, and provide critical habitats for particular forest species. In comparison to <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances,</b> the artifi cial disturbances resulting from salvage logging destroyed a substantial part of the natural regeneration, which led to the need for artifi cial reforestation. Th us, the non-intervention strategy appears to be the best option for restoration of disturbed forests in the zone of mountain spruce forests. Based on our results, we propose that <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> be considered as a basis for forest regeneration and restoration of their natural structure...|$|R

25|$|Although artisanal logging {{provides}} some {{income for the}} community in the short-run, it ultimately does not improve local living conditions. In the end, the communities receive payments which are not large {{enough to cover the}} loss of their natural resources. Since there is no monitoring mechanism, the loggers report lower harvested amounts than they actually do in order to pay less tax to the local government. Some loggers cut one tree within the woods and leave the rest intact to mimic <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance.</b> To improve the situation, the DRC government needs better monitoring and better forest code to manage the logging activities.|$|E
2500|$|Life {{expectancy}} of forests varies throughout the world, influenced by tree species, site conditions and <b>natural</b> <b>disturbance</b> patterns. [...] In some forests carbon may be stored for centuries, while in other forests carbon is released with frequent stand replacing fires. Forests that are harvested prior to stand replacing events {{allow for the}} retention [...] of carbon in manufactured forest products such as lumber. [...] However, {{only a portion of}} the carbon removed from logged forests ends up as durable goods and buildings. [...] The remainder ends up as sawmill by-products such as pulp, paper and pallets, which often end with incineration (resulting in carbon release into the atmosphere) {{at the end of their}} lifecycle. For instance, of the 1,692 MegaTonnes of carbon harvested from forests in Oregon and Washington (U.S) from 1900 to 1992, only 23% is in long-term storage in forest products.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{important}} to recognize that old-growth forests are not static and may not be a permanent fixture on the landscape. The forests and trees within and around them change continuously. This would be true even if human influence could be eliminated. All forests, including old-growth, succumb to <b>natural,</b> destructive <b>disturbances</b> and regenerate over time. A functional old-growth ecosystem includes the loss of old trees due to <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> and the death of old trees. An old-growth system is not static, nor is it always dominated by old trees. Natural processes dictate the age composition at any time. The important factor in this process is that the trees have the opportunity to reach old age if <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> do not intercede.|$|R

40|$|Ayodhya Lanka is a {{river island}} {{situated}} in Vasista Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, India. The island, {{due to its}} strategic location in the channel bed, is endowed with rich alluvial soil and provides a rich ground for fishing operations attracting both farming and fishing communities who made their permanent abode on it since times immemorial. Owing to certain special physiographical and ecological features the island possesses five ethno-ecozones (micro-environments) that are effectively managed and exploited by the islanders under the fluctuating environmental conditions. As such, the island is exposed to three important recurring <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> such as perennial floods, erratic rainfall and frost of which the first one has very serious consequences. Depending upon the level of inundation the flood situation is distinguished as normal and severe. It is these severe floods that are having a telling effect upon the life and economic endeavors of the islanders. The islanders respond to these <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> through a battery of cultural responses in order to effectively adapt to natural circumstances. This study is intended {{to show how the}} different <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> trigger a set of cultural responses, {{the manner in which they}} are interrelated, and ultimately how they allow for a suitable adaptation to the island environment.

40|$|Understanding how {{communities}} {{respond to}} <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{is fundamental to}} assess the mechanisms of ecosystem resistance and resilience. However, ecosystem responses to <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> are rarely monitored both through space and time, while the factors promoting ecosystem stability act at various temporal and spatial scales. Hence, assessing both the spatial and temporal variations in species composition is important to comprehen-sively explore the effects of <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Here, we suggest a framework to better scrutinize the mechanisms underlying community responses to disturbances through both time and space. Our analytical approach is based on beta diversity decomposition into two components, replacement and biomass difference. We illustrate this approach using a 9 -year monitoring of coral reef fish communities off Moorea Island (French Polynesia), which encompassed two severe natural disturbances: a crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak and a hurricane. These disturbances triggered a fast logistic decline in coral cover, which suffered a 90 % decrease on all reefs.

40|$|Riparian landscapes are dynamic ecosystems. Under natural {{conditions}} {{there is a}} high disturbance of the floodplain vegetation by the dynamic of flooding and the change between erosion and accumulation of bedloads. Today in most river ecosystems <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> are altered or replaced by human disturbances due to civil engineering measures. Flood controlling and reduction of bedloads cause fundamental changes in structure and species combination of the floodplain vegetation. The effects are obvious in most rivers of the industrial countries: there is a decrease or extinction of typical plants and biocoenoses. In this presentation the effects of <b>natural</b> and human <b>disturbances</b> on the floodplain vegetation is shown by example of the vegetation on gravelbars of braided rivers. By comparing natural and impacted rivers courses we can demonstrate how disturbances are important for:- the structure and dynamic of vegetation- the survival of plant populations- the diffusion of plants Under {{natural conditions}} the variety of disturbances supports the variation of species and plant communities (high biodiversity) in river ecosystems. As result of human disturbances the high biodiversity in river ecosystems is reduced and plants especially adapted to <b>natural</b> <b>disturbances</b> are faced with extinction.
