Application of the {{prediction}} models for railway <b>noise</b> <b>indicators</b> calculation, {{which was already}} developed by other countries, represents a major challenge in Serbia. Prediction model "Schall 03 " was developed in line with technical and technological characteristics of the rolling stock and infrastructure of German Railways. Prior to its application at the national level, due to different technical-technological characteristics of railway stock and railway infrastructure {{it is necessary to}} perform its validation and, depending on the needs, the calibration in accordance with local conditions. This will assure accuracy and precision of the calculations of <b>noise</b> <b>indicators,</b> as well as confidence in the results obtained by prediction model "Schall 03 ". This paper presents the analysis of the possibilities to apply German prediction model "Schall 03 " on the Serbian railway network, more precisely railway section from Belgrade to Romanian border.

Nighttime noise levels and window orientations have not been considered in most previous studies. Investigate the association between road traffic noise exposure and blood pressure among children, and investigate the impact of bedroom window direction on this association. We measured blood pressure in 605 children aged 10 years from two Munich cohorts. Demographic and health information was collected by parent completed questionnaires. Road traffic noise levels were assessed by day-evening-night <b>noise</b> <b>indicator</b> "Lden" and night <b>noise</b> <b>indicator</b> "Lnight". Minimum and maximum levels within a 50 m buffer around child′s home address were derived. Generalized additive models were applied to explore effect of noise levels on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP). The orientation of child′s bedroom window was considered in sensitivity analyses. DBP {{was significantly associated with}} the minimum level of noise during 24 h (Lden_min) and nightime (Lnight_min). Specifically, DBP increased by 0. 67 and 0. 89 mmHg for every 5 A-weighted decibels increase in Lden_min and Lnight_min. After adjusting for Lden_min (Lnight_min), DBP of children whose bedroom window faced the street was 1. 37 (1. 28) mmHg higher than those whose bedroom window did not, these children showed statistically significant increased SBP for Lden_min (3. 05 mmHg) and Lnight_min (3. 27 mmHg) compared to children whose bedroom window did not face the street.

40|$|In this paper, the {{following}} four <b>indicators</b> describing <b>noise</b> annoyance in a community are considered: {{the percentage of people}} being highly annoyed (pHA), annoyed (pA), (at least) little annoyed (p LA), and the mean of the expected individual annoyance scores (m EA) in the population concerned. These indicators are calculated for a study population on the basis of maps of the noise measure DENL, using DENL-annoyance relationships. An approach is described for comparing the effect of noise reduction, using the above mentioned <b>noise</b> annoyance <b>indicators.</b> For the municipality of Leiden, the Netherlands, the results from applying this approach indicate that the calculated efficacy of a given noise abatement policy depends to some extent on the <b>noise</b> annoyance <b>indicator</b> that is used. A lower limit of 55 dB for the noise calculations has been suggested by the EU Directive on environmental noise. This leads to a large underestimation of the <b>noise</b> annoyance <b>indicators</b> and may affect priority setting regarding noise abatement. Beside the four noise annoyance measures, two other <b>noise</b> quality <b>indicators</b> are considered: the percentage of people being highly sleep disturbed (p HS) and (AREA 50) - the percentage area where DENL exceeds 50 dB.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundExposure to {{transportation}} noise showed negative health effects {{in children and}} adults. Studies in children mainly focussed on aircraft noise at school. ObjectivesWe aimed to investigate road traffic noise exposure at home and children's behavioural problems and sleeping problems. Methods 872 10 -year-old children from Munich from two German population-based, birth-cohort studies with data on modelled façade noise levels at home and behavioural problems were included. Noise was assessed by the day–evening–night <b>noise</b> <b>indicator</b> Lden and the night <b>noise</b> <b>indicator</b> Lnight. Behavioural problems were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A subgroup (N= 287) had information on sleeping problems. Continuation ratio models (logistic regression models) adjusted for various covariates were applied to investigate the association between interquartile range increases in noise and SDQ scales (sleeping problems). ResultsNoise measured by Lden at the most exposed façade of the building was related to more hyperactivity/inattention (continuation odds ratio (cOR) = 1. 28 (95 %-confidence interval(CI) : 1. 03 – 1. 58). Noise at the least exposed façade increased the relative odds for having borderline or abnormal values on the emotional symptoms scale, especially the relative odds to have abnormal values for a subject with at least borderline values (Lden:cOR= 2. 19 (95 % CI: 1. 32 – 3. 64). Results for Lnight were similar. Nocturnal noise at the least exposed façade was associated with any sleeping problems (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 79 (95 % CI= 1. 10 – 2. 92)). ConclusionsRoad traffic noise exposure at home {{may be related to}} increased hyperactivity and more emotional symptoms in children.

40|$|Conflicts between {{airports}} and inhabitants around aircraft noise have increased across the world. In several cases, {{they have become}} critical {{for the expansion of}} the airport business and thus possibly for the regional and/or national economy. These conflicts have also urged public authorities {{to pay more attention to}} aircraft noise through regular assessments imposed to the airports. In the EU for instance, large airports have to produce annual noise reports that notably include noise contours and the number of inhabitants who live within them. Surprisingly, scholars have paid little attention to <b>noise</b> <b>indicators</b> imposed by public authorities. However, by-law assessment of noise is by nature the result of political decisions at the crossroad of diverging interests expressed by various lobbies. As a result, <b>noise</b> <b>indicators</b> are not necessarily neutral and may be conservative to save the airport/airline business. Considering Brussels Airport, Belgium, as a case study, this is investigated through a comparative cartography of official <b>noise</b> <b>indicators</b> (especially LDEN with 55 dB as a lower threshold) versus citizen protests (complaints to the ombudsman; petitioners; complainants against the Federal State). Diverging geographies suggest that LDEN with 55 dB as a lower threshold is conservative. This calls for a critical assessment of how it was adopted by the EU. This will be conducted going through the EU’s records, notably to assess first drafts of the regulation and how lobbies reacted at the time. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a measure of {{anisotropy}} as a quality parameter to estimate the amount of noise in noisy images. The anisotropy of an image can be determined through a directional measure, using an appropriate statistical distribution of the information contained in the image. This new measure is achieved through a stack filtering paradigm. First, we define a local directional entropy, based on the distribution of 0 's and 1 's in the neigborhood of every pixel location of each stack level. Then the entropy variation of this directional entropy is used to define an anisotropic measure. The empirical results have shown that this measure can be regarded as an excellent image <b>noise</b> <b>indicator,</b> which is particularly relevant for quality assessment of denoising algorithms.

Methods: 24 -hour ambulatory BP measurements at 15 -minutes intervals were carried out on 149 persons living near 4 major European airports. Noise indicators included total and source-specific equivalent indoor noise, total number of noise events, annoyance scores for aircraft and road-traffic night-time noise. Long-term noise exposure was also determined. Multivariate linear regression analysis was applied. Results: The pooled estimates show that the only <b>noise</b> <b>indicator</b> associated consistently with a decrease in BP dipping is road traffic noise.

40|$|Abstract. Until 1996, {{the noise}} policy in Europe had {{concentrated}} on the regulations of noise emission from noise sources as road traffic, aircraft and equipment used outdoors. Although noise limits have become increasingly stringent over the years, no corresponding significant reduction in noise emission has been observed. In response to this, the European noise policy has been revised to focus on noise reception. Thus, the Green Paper from 1996 defines as the basic aim of future noise policy that "no person should be exposed to noise levels which endanger health and quality of life". The structure of a new future noise policy has {{to be based on}} the Directive on the Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise, 2002 / 43 /EC. The Directive defines the three key elements: assessment of environmental noise through strategic noise mapping, implementation of action plans to reduce noise where necessary and information for the public about noise levels and its effects. The Directive defines the common noise indicators and methods for strategic noise mapping as well as the deadline for the Directive implementation. The Directive implementation at national and local level means enacting the new acts or amending existing acts. In this paper, the proposal of steps that can be taken for harmonization of national acts with the basic principles and elements of the Directive is presented and discussed.

40|$|Valuation {{of traffic}} noise {{abatement}} based on hedonic pricing {{models of the}} property market has traditionally measured the noise as the equivalent, or another average, level. What is not captured in such a <b>noise</b> <b>indicator</b> is the maximum noise level of a vehicle passage. In this study, we incorporate the maximum noise level in the hedonic model letting the property price depend on both the equivalent noise level and the maximum noise level. Hedonic models for both rail and road noise are estimated. Data consists of characteristics of sold properties, property-specific noise calculation, and geographical variables. We use the hedonic approach to estimate the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for maximum noise abatement where we model the effect as the maximum noise level subtracted with the equivalent noise level. Furthermore, we control for the equivalent noise level in the estimations. The estimated results show that including the maximum noise level in the model has influence on the property prices, but only for rail and not for road. This means that for road we cannot reject the hypothesis that WTP for noise abatement {{is based on the}} equivalent noise level only. For rail, on the other hand, we estimate the marginal WTP for the maximum noise level and {{it turns out to be}} substantial. Also, the marginal WTP for the equivalent noise levels seems to be unaffected by the inclusion of the maximum noise level in the model. More research of this novel topic is requested though...|$|E
