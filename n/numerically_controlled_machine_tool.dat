40|$|Abstract. In the {{processing}} of manufacturing, the rising of temperature caused by friction heat, cutting heat, ambient temperature and other factors will lead to thermal deformation of the driving components of machine tool, so that the correct position between the tool and work piece will be changed. And at the same time, machine tool will lose its intrinsic accuracy and reduce its reliability. Especially in the precision cutting processing, machining errors caused by the thermal deformation of driving system will not be ignored, almost accounting for 40 %~ 70 % of the total errors. This paper is aided by a key project called ‘High-end CNC machine tools and basic manufacturing equipment’. By using CAE software ANSYS, the temperature field of axial driving system is gain through analyzing the steady-state thermal of machine tool. The experiment is used to capture physical picture of temperature field. At last, compared with {{the result of the}} experiment, we can know better the reliability of the analysis results. The results can be useful references for different axial driving system design in <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{makes it}} {{possible}} to predict the output motion of a parallel mechanism and proposes a method for generating a tool path of a machine tool consisting of the parallel mechanism. As a <b>numerically</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> generally processes a work by interpolating an ideal shape with linear lines, a deviation between a path of tool and the ideal shape can be estimated easily. However, an input-output relation of the parallel mechanism is nonlinear, and accordingly an output pose of the parallel mechanism can be hardly determined by the direct kinematics. A prediction of the deviation of the parallel mechanism machine tool is therefore extremely difficult, so that a generation of its tool path that ensures a given allowance is not easy. Thus the present study proposes a simple method to predict the tool path of the parallel mechanism by approximating its motion with a spiral path. By using a prediction result, the study determines an efficiently optimal cutter location data to realize the tool path that ensures a required deviation...|$|E

Kinematic accuracy analysis of the Five-axis machine tool in previous study ignores the randomness of each input error component, so the conclusions are imprecise. Using the homogeneous transformation, inverse kinematics of VMC 650 Five-axis machine tool is calculated. Based on Multi-body System Theory, error model of the machine tool is presented. Considering the randomness of every input error components, applying the Monte Carlo method, math model of kinematic reliability of the mechanism is deduced. The calculation method of kinematics reliability are put forward applying point evaluation and track evaluation. Kinematic reliability analysis provides some theoretical reference for improving the machining accuracy and operation life of machine tool.

Removal of the operator from the direct control of the metal cutting process has created problems in terms of maintaining accuracy. The objective of this thesis is to study thermal {{effects on the}} accuracy of numerically controlled machine tools. ^ The initial part of the thesis is concerned with the analysis of a hypothetical machine. The thermal characteristics of this machine are studied. Numerical methods for evaluating the errors exhibited by the slides of the machine are proposed and the possibility of predicting thermally induced errors by the use of regresssion equations is investigated. A method for computing the workspace error is also presented. ^ Machine tools are generally made of box type structures. Based on analysis of box type structures, theoretical evidence for the prediction of machine tool errors is presented. The problem of heat flow in a box made of thin plates is studied and analytic solutions are derived. ^ The final part is concerned with the actual measurement of errors on a modern CNC machining center. Thermal influences on the errors is the main objective of the experimental work. Based on experimental evidence, it is shown that thermal effects on the accuracy of machine tools can be predicted by the use of simple regression equations. Finally, numerical methods are used to predict thermal influences on the errors of machine tools. These methods make use of measured values of temperatures for prediction of errors. ^ Based on the evidence presented in this thesis, it is shown conclusively that thermal influences on the errors of machine tools are predictable. Techniques for determining thermal effects on machine tools at a design stage are also presented. ...|$|E
