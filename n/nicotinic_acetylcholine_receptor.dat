5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray and its relatives {{are used as}} model organisms for biomedical research, because their electric organs contain an abundance of important nervous system proteins such as <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> and acetylcholinesterase. In the 1970s and 1980s, acetylcholine receptors from this species and the marbled {{electric ray}} (T.marmorata) became the first neurotransmitter receptors to be isolated and sequenced, in what {{is considered to be}} a landmark success in the field of neurobiology. This led to a number of further advances, one of the most significant being the elucidation of the pathophysiology underlying the disease myasthenia gravis. A small commercial fishery in southern California supplies Pacific electric rays for research purposes; as of 2005 this fishery may have employed as few as two fishers. Otherwise, this ray has no economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries, and on hook-and-line by sport anglers. These activities appear to have little impact on its population, leading it to be listed under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Fishing for this ray is not managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council.|$|E
25|$|Metabolites of {{ketamine}} including dehydronorketamine, hydroxynorketamine, and norketamine {{have been}} found to act as negative allosteric modulators of the α7 <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> in the KXa7R1 cell line (HEK293 cells transfected with rat <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> genes) with subanesthetic and nanomolar potencies (e.g., IC50 = 55nM for dehydronorketamine), whereas ketamine itself was inactive at the same concentrations (< 1nbsp&µM). These findings suggest that metabolites may contribute importantly to the pharmacodynamics of ketamine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are members}} of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, that {{includes}} also gamma-amino-butiric-acid(A), glycine, and 5 -hydroxytryptamine(3) <b>receptors.</b> Functional <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> result from the association of five subunits each contributing to the pore lining. The major neuronal <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> are heterologous pentamers of alpha 4 beta 2 subunits (brain), or alpha 3 beta 4 subunits (autonomic ganglia). Another class of neuronal receptors that are found both in the central and peripheral nervous system is the homomeric alpha 7 receptor. The muscle receptor subtypes comprise of alphabetadeltagamma (embryonal) or alphabetadeltaepsilon (adult) subunits. Although <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> are not directly involved in the hypnotic component of anesthesia, it is possible that modulation of central nicotinic transmission by volatile agents contributes to analgesia. The main effect of anesthetic agents on <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> is inhibitory. Volatile anesthetics and ketamine are the most potent inhibitors both at alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 3 beta 4 receptors with clinically relevant IC(50) values. Neuronal <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> are more sensitive to anesthetics than their muscle counterparts, {{with the exception of the}} alpha 7 receptor. Several intravenous anesthetics such as barbiturates, etomidate, and propofol exert also an inhibitory effect on the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors,</b> but only at concentrations higher than those necessary for anesthesia. Usual clinical concentrations of curare cause competitive inhibition of muscle <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> while higher concentrations may induce open channel blockade. Neuronal nAChRs like alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 3 beta 4 are inhibited by atracurium, a curare derivative, but at low concentrations the alpha 4 beta 2 receptor is activated. Inhibition of sympathetic transmission by clinically relevant concentrations of some anesthetic agents is probably one of the factors involved in arterial hypotension during anesthesia...|$|R

25|$|An {{example of}} cation–π {{interactions}} in molecular recognition {{is seen in}} the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> (nAChR) which binds its endogenous ligand, acetylcholine (a positively charged molecule), via a cation–π interaction to the quaternary ammonium. The nAChR neuroreceptor is a well-studied ligand-gated ion channel that opens upon acetylcholine binding. Acetylcholine receptors are therapeutic targets for a large host of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression and autism. Studies by Dougherty and coworkers confirmed that cation-π interactions are important for binding and activating nAChR by making specific structural variations to a key tryptophan residue and correlating activity results with cation-π binding ability.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of receptors with known structures, transmembrane alpha helices constitute most of the transmembrane component. In certain receptors, such as the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor,</b> the transmembrane domain forms a protein pore through the membrane, or around the ion channel. Upon activation of an extracellular domain by binding of the appropriate ligand, the pore becomes accessible to ions, which then diffuse. In other receptors, the transmembrane domains undergo a conformational change upon binding, which effects intracellular conditions. In some receptors, such {{as members of the}} 7TM superfamily, the transmembrane domain includes a ligand binding pocket. Bacteriorhodopsin is an example, the detailed structure of which has been determined by crystallography.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol binds to and {{affects the}} gating {{of a number}} of ion {{channels}} such as the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor,</b> GABAA receptor, and the inward-rectifier potassium ion channel. Cholesterol also activates the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), and may be the endogenous ligand for the receptor. The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be {{explained by the fact that}} cholesterol is ubiquitous in the body. Inhibition of ERRα signaling by reduction of cholesterol production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of statins and bisphosphonates on bone, muscle, and macrophages. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the ERRα should be de-orphanized and classified as a receptor for cholesterol.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCyclic imine {{neurotoxins}} {{constitute an}} emergent family of neurotoxins of dinoflagellate origin that are potent antagonists of <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors.</b> We developed a target-directed functional method {{based on the}} mechanism of action of competitive agonists/antagonists of <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> {{for the detection of}} marine cyclic imine neurotoxins. The key step for method development was the immobilization of Torpedo electrocyte membranes rich in <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> on the surface of microplate wells and the use of biotinylated-α-bungarotoxin as tracer. Cyclic imine neurotoxins competitively inhibit biotinylated-α-bungarotoxin binding to Torpedo-nicotinic <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. The microplate-receptor binding assay allowed rapid detection of nanomolar concentrations of cyclic imine neurotoxins directly in shellfish samples. Although highly sensitive and specific for the detection of neurotoxins targeting <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> as a class, the receptor binding assay cannot identify a given analyte. To address the low selectivity of the microplate-receptor binding assay, the cyclic imine neurotoxins tightly bound to the coated Torpedo nicotinic receptor were eluted with methanol, and the chemical nature of the eluted ligands was identified by mass spectrometry. The immobilization of Torpedo electrocyte membranes on the surface of microplate wells proved to be a high-throughput format for the survey of neurotoxins targeting <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptors</b> directly in shellfish matrixes with high sensitivity and reproducibility...|$|R
25|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} {{typically}} affect the mesolimbic system, or more specifically, the reward pathway {{of the nervous}} system. Amongst the common drugs of abuse, nicotine {{is one of the}} strongest agonists at the nicotinic cholinergic synapse. Nicotine, competing with acetylcholine (ACh), acts through the nonsynaptic, preterminal, <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor</b> (nAChRs) to initiate a membrane potential change and propagate an intracellular Ca2+ signal, thus encouraging the release of neurotransmitters. The specific and characteristic role of calcium current mediated nAChR activity has a different voltage-dependence than other Ca2+ permeable ion channels, as well as different temporal and spatial distribution and as a result, the nonsynaptic nAChR activity enhances the induction of synaptic potentiation, promoting the learning of substance dependence.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{effects from}} anatoxin-a {{progress}} very rapidly because it acts {{directly on the}} nerve cells (neurons). The progressive symptoms of anatoxin-a exposure are loss of coordination, twitching, convulsions and rapid death by respiratory paralysis. The nerve tissues which communicate with muscles contain a receptor called the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>receptor.</b> Stimulation of these receptors causes a muscular contraction. The anatoxin-a molecule is shaped so it fits this receptor, {{and in this way}} it mimics the natural neurotransmitter normally used by the receptor, acetylcholine. Once it has triggered a contraction, anatoxin-a does not allow the neurons to return to their resting state, because it is not degraded by cholinesterase which normally performs this function. As a result, the muscle cells contract permanently, the communication between the brain and the muscles is disrupted and breathing stops.|$|E

Changeux is known by the non-scientific public for his ideas regarding the connection between mind and physical brain.

Whether the pig may be considered immune is still uncertain, though early studies show endogenous resistance in pigs tested against neurotoxins. Though it has been thought that the pig's subcutaneous layer of fat protects it against snake venom, most venoms pass easily through vascular fat layers, making this unlikely to contribute to its ability to resist venoms. The garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) has recently been added to the list of animals refractory to viper venom. [...] Some populations of California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi) are at least partially immune to rattlesnake venom as adults.|$|E
