25|$|From the mid 80s {{until the}} early 90s, mullets were popular in {{suburban}} and rural areas among working-class men. This contrasted with a conservative look preferred by business professionals, with neatly groomed short hair for men and sleek, straight hair for women. Some men also wore bangs in styles such as regular frontal or side swept bangs but they were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> women or girls bangs. Hairsprays such as AquaNet were also used in excess by fans of glam metal bands such as Poison.|$|E
25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the rivalries {{between the}} Giants and Cowboys, that with {{division}} rivals Washington Redskins is still fierce. It started in 1934 when the Washington Redskins were first {{known as the}} Boston Redskin; the Redskin defeated the Eagles 6–0, and lead the all-time series 81–78–5. The Redskins have owned the rivalry since 2010, most recently extending their winning streak against the Eagles to 5 consecutive games with a 27–22 victory at the Linc on December 11, 2016. The last time the Redskins won 5 or more consecutive games against the Eagles was 1981–84, during which they won 6 consecutive games.|$|E
500|$|Following Russell's death, {{the only}} people who made serious efforts to {{continue}} those strains were two men, one in Chislehurst with the surname of East, and another in Cornwall named Archer.

60|$|The Wizard {{was nearly}} as {{sensitive}} as he was wicked, and was sorry he had <b>not</b> grown <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> other people; so the laughter that always greeted him made him angry.|$|R
500|$|Once {{the face}} was revealed, it was met with wide {{criticism}} from fans, particularly for being a stock photo (of Miss England model Hammasa Kohistani). GameZone's Matt Liebl felt that the issue was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> fans had made it out to be. Some fans proceeded {{to make their own}} faces, such as a piece by deviantArt artist [...] "K4ll0" [...] that Kotaku's Luke Plunkett compared favorably to the actual face.|$|E
2500|$|When foresting {{companies}} {{cut down}} trees, more are planted in their place. Most paper comes from pulp forests grown specifically for paper production. Many environmentalists point out, however, that [...] "farmed" [...] forests are inferior to virgin forests in several ways. Farmed forests {{are not able}} to fix the soil as quickly as virgin forests, causing widespread soil erosion and often requiring large amounts of fertilizer to maintain while containing little tree and wild-life biodiversity compared to virgin forests. Also, the new trees planted are <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the trees that were cut down, and the argument that there will be [...] "more trees" [...] is not compelling to forestry advocates when they are counting saplings.|$|E

60|$|Towards Christmas-time quite little {{trees were}} cut down, some <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the young fir-tree, {{or just the}} same age, and now it had no peace or rest for longing to be away. These little trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept all their branches; they were put in carts and drawn out of the wood by horses.|$|E

50|$|Nufringen was {{mentioned}} documentarily {{first time in}} the year 1182. In the 13th and 14th century the Pfalzgrafen von Tübingen have had impact on Nufringen until it was sold to Württemberg in 1382. The population was cut drastically because of the Thirty Years' War and the Black Death and did <b>not</b> become <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> before those events happened until the 18th century.|$|R
60|$|While {{she stood}} looking eagerly at the strange and {{beautiful}} sights, she noticed coming toward her {{a group of}} the queerest people she had ever seen. They were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the grown folk {{she had always been}} used to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many years older.|$|E
60|$|Sambo, who {{flung open}} the door and {{announced}} Mr. Joseph, followed grinning, in the Collector's rear, and bearing two handsome nosegays of flowers, which the monster had actually had the gallantry to purchase in Covent Garden Market that morning--they were <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the haystacks which ladies carry about with them now-a-days, in cones of filigree paper; but the young women were delighted with the gift, as Joseph presented one to each, with an exceedingly solemn bow.|$|E

There's your {{photograph}} now, it's <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> you, but {{it shows}} you; and so a chart, or a map, or a globe, is just a picture of the shapes of the coast-line of the land and the sea, and the rivers in them, and mountains, and the like. Look here!" [...] And she made Lucy stand on a chair and look at a map of her own town that was hanging against the wall, showing her all the chief buildings, the churches, streets, the town hall, and at last helping her find her own Papa's house.|$|E
5000|$|Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla was {{released}} in Japan on March 21, 1974 where it was distributed by Toho. The film made slightly more money than Godzilla Vs. Megalon, but was still <b>not</b> making <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> a box office profit as the other films in the Godzilla series had in the early 1960s. The film was followed up with a direct sequel in 1975 titled Terror of Mechagodzilla.|$|R
60|$|Walter had met snakes before, {{harmless}} reptiles <b>not</b> half <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> {{the present}} one. But {{he did not}} know but that this reptile might be poisonous, and gaining the top of the rocks he blazed away with the pistol, not once, but several times. The last shot hit the snake in the tail, and away it darted, out of sight and into the river.|$|R
50|$|Needing a sure-fire hit, Hall then persuaded Bert Bailey to reprise {{his role}} as Dad Rudd in Grandad Rudd (1935), based on a play co-written by Bailey. It was popular, {{although}} <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> a hit <b>as</b> On Our Selection.|$|R
60|$|It {{was getting}} dark, but Kit remarked {{that the man}} was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the camel drivers and his skin was lighter. His mouth and jaw were covered and his blue clothes were clean. For a moment or two he studied the group and his calm glance rather annoyed Kit. All the Berbers he had met were marked by an imperturbable calm. Then the fellow said {{something}} to a camel driver, who signed the party to go with him and took them to a hut. The front was broken and the roof had fallen, but the building gave some shelter from the keen wind. By and by another man brought them a bowl of stuff like porridge, some dried meat Kit thought was goat's flesh, and dates.|$|E
6000|$|It was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the White House, yet {{it could}} not be called small. I had seen, to that. The long facade was imposing, dignified, with a touch of conventionality and {{solidity}} in keeping with my standing in the city. It was Georgian, of plum-coloured brick with marble trimmings and marble wedges over the ample windows, some years later I saw the house by Ferguson, of New York, from which Archie had cribbed it. At one end, off the dining-room, was a semicircular conservatory. There was a small portico, with marble pillars, and in the ample, swift sloping roof many dormers; servants' rooms, Archie explained. The look of anxiety on Maude's face deepened as he went over the floor plans, the reception-room; dining room to seat thirty, the servants' hall; and upstairs Maude's room, boudoir and bath and dress closet, my [...] "apartments" [...] adjoining {{on one side and the}} children's on the other, and the guest-rooms with baths....|$|E
6000|$|Thereupon Jean {{set forth}} down the valley, and tramped out and across and around, {{as much to}} scare away {{whatever}} had been after the stock as {{to look for the}} wounded calf. More than once he heard cattle moving away ahead of him, but he could not see them. Jean let Shepp go, hoping the dog would strike a trail. But Shepp neither gave tongue nor came back. Dawn began to break, and in the growing light Jean searched around until at last he stumbled over a dead calf, lying in a little bare wash where water ran in wet seasons. Big wolf tracks showed in the soft earth. [...] "Lofers," [...] said Jean, as he knelt and just covered one track with his spread hand. [...] "We had wolves in Oregon, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> these.... Wonder where that half-wolf dog, Shepp, went. Wonder if he can be trusted where wolves are concerned. I'll bet not, if there's a she-wolf runnin' around." ...|$|E

50|$|When I Was a Boy is a 1993 album by Jane Siberry. Internationally, it is {{her most}} famous album. In Siberry's native Canada, however, the album was commercially {{successful}} but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> a hit <b>as</b> her 1985 album The Speckless Sky.|$|R
50|$|Dragon Island - renamed as Dragon {{island in}} 1990 {{the area was}} {{originally}} called riverview island which was built in 1980, Despite <b>not</b> being <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> County Fair or Alpine, Dragon Island ranks 2nd in popularity. Dragon Island has a much different atmosphere than County Fair or Alpine. While County Fair and Alpine have a more fun atmosphere, playing upbeat, popular music that most guests {{will be able to}} recognize, Dragon Island has a more mellow atmosphere, playing slow music without vocals.|$|R
60|$|We were {{a melancholy}} set, the ladies {{appearing}} to be afflicted in this way worse than the gentlemen, on account of their enforced abstinence from tobacco. What can twelve ladies do scattered about a drawing-room, so called, intended for the accommodation of two hundred? The drawing-room at the Ocean Hotel, Newport, is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> Westminster Hall, but would, I should think, make a very good House of Commons for the British nation. Fancy the feelings of a lady when she walks into such a room, intending to spend her evening there, and finds six or seven other ladies located on various sofas at terrible distances, all strangers to her. She has come to Newport probably to enjoy herself; and as, {{in accordance with the}} customs of the place, she has dined at two, she has nothing before her for the evening but the society of that huge, furnished cavern. Her husband, if she have one, or her father, or her lover, has probably entered the room with her. But a man has never the courage to endure such a position long. He sidles out with some muttered excuse, and seeks solace with a cigar. The lady, after half an hour of contemplation, creeps silently near some companion in the desert, and suggests in a whisper that Newport {{does not seem to be}} very full at present.|$|E

50|$|St. Michael's is a {{good example}} of a basilica, a large, {{rectilinear}} space with a longitudinal axis. The church runs along an east-west axis, with an extruded portion running north-south, but <b>not</b> nearly <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the main roof axis. The main axis is represented by the sloped roofs meeting together at the exact middle of the church. All axes are either parallel or perpendicular to each other, so the exterior of church has a very linear and symmetrical feel.|$|R
50|$|In the Edo period, {{the area}} that became Urawa flourished as a posting station of the Nakasendō, a highway {{connecting}} Edo (modern-day Tokyo) and Kyoto.
