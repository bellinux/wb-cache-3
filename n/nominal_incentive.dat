40|$|Rice is {{the staple}} food for {{nearly two-thirds of}} the world’s population. Food {{components}} and environmental load of rice depends on the rice form that is resulted by different processing conditions. Brown rice (BR), germinated brown rice (GBR) and partially-milled rice (PMR) contains more health beneficial food components compared to the well milled rice (WMR). Although the arsenic concentration in cooked rice depends on the cooking methods, parboiled rice (PBR) seems to be relatively prone to arsenic contamination compared to that of untreated rice, if contaminated water is used for parboiling and cooking. A change in consumption patterns from PBR to untreated rice (non-parboiled), and WMR to PMR or BR may conserve about 43 – 54 million tons of rice and reduce the risk from arsenic contamination in the arsenic prone area. This study also reveals that a change in rice consumption patterns not only supply more food components but also reduces environmental loads. A switch in production and consumption patterns would improve food security where food grains are scarce, and provide more health beneficial food components, may prevent some diseases and ease the burden on the Earth. However, motivation and awareness of the environment and health, and even a <b>nominal</b> <b>incentive</b> may require for a method switching which may help in building a sustainable society...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To discuss {{changes in}} the law that allow {{community}} pharmacy loyalty programs to include and offer incentives to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Summary: The retailer rewards exception of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and its change {{to the definition of}} remuneration in the civil monetary penalties of the Anti-Kickback Statute now allow incentives to be earned on federal benefit tied prescription out-of-pocket costs. The criteria required to design a compliant loyalty program are discussed. Conclusion: Community pharmacies can now include Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in compliant cus-tomer loyalty programs, where allowed by state law. There is a need for research directly on the influence of loyalty programs and <b>nominal</b> <b>incentives</b> on adherence...|$|R
50|$|Search for {{innovative}} solutions to vexed problems was another characteristic of Girish. This search {{led to a}} unique and novel concept for improving efficiency of commonly used domestic appliances. Though Girish and several other researchers had pointed out that energy efficiency of commonly used domestic appliances is very poor and using most efficient appliances instead of these inefficient appliances will lead to savings of thousands of MWs, a workable large scale solution to achieve this transformation was elusive. Girish, along with colleagues at Prayas, developed a concept called 'Super-Efficient Equipment Program - SEEP' under which <b>nominal</b> <b>incentives</b> are provided to appliance manufacturers to bring super-efficient equipment into the market. He successfully convinced Government of India and Planning Commission officials {{of the benefits of}} implementing such a program. Under this program, which will be launched in 2014 as part of the 12th Five Year Plan, it is expected that over five million 'super-efficient' fans, which consume half the electricity of normal fans, will be sold in the market. This approach is also being adopted at the global level {{under the auspices of the}} Clean Energy Ministerial.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of nominal debt on the optimal {{sequential}} choice of monetary and debt policy. When the stock of debt is <b>nominal,</b> the <b>incentive</b> to generate unanticipated inflation increases the cost of the outstanding debt even if no unanticipated inflation episodes occur in equilibrium. Without full commitment, the optimal sequential policy is to deplete the outstanding stock of debt progressively until these extra costs disappear. Nominal debt is therefore a burden on monetary policy, not only because it must be serviced, but also because it creates a time inconsistency problem that distorts interest rates. The introduction of alternative forms of taxation may lessen this burden, if there is enough commitment to fiscal policy. Debts, Public; Financial crises; Fiscal policy; Monetary policy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Since 1985, {{community}} outreach efforts to combat {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} (AIDS) among injecting drug users (IDUs) in the United States have overwhelmingly depended on a provider-client model that relies on staffs of professional outreach workers. We report on a comparison of this traditional outreach model with an innovative social network model, termed "a peer-driven intervention" (PDI). The latter provides IDUs with guidance and structured incentives that permit them to play a much {{more active role in}} the outreach process, thereby harnessing peer pressure on behalf of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention efforts. METHODS: We compare the performance of a traditional outreach intervention (TOI) and a PDI that were implemented in medium-sized towns in eastern and central Connecticut. Comparisons are based on the number and representativeness of IDUs recruited at each site, the effectiveness of HIV prevention education, compliance rates with AIDS risk reduction recommendations, and relative cost. The analyses are based on 522 initial interviews and 190 six-month follow-up interviews conducted during {{the first two years of}} each intervention's operation. RESULTS: Both interventions produced significant reductions in HIV risk behaviors, as measured using self-reports. The PDI outperformed the traditional intervention with respect to the number of IDUs recruited, the ethnic and geographic representativeness of the recruits, and the effectiveness of HIV prevention education. In addition, the costs of recruiting IDUs into the intervention and educating them about HIV in the community was only one-thirtieth as much in the PDI as in the traditional intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that given guidance and <b>nominal</b> <b>incentives,</b> IDUs can play a more extensive role in {{community outreach}} efforts than the traditional model allows. The findings also suggest that both interventions reduce HIV-associated risk behaviors, but the PDI reaches a larger and more diverse set of IDUs, and does so at much less expense...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of nominal debt on the optimal {{sequential}} choice of mone-tary policy. When the stock of debt is <b>nominal,</b> the <b>incentive</b> to generate unantici-pated inflation increases the cost of the outstanding debt even if no unanticipated inflation episodes occur in equilibrium. Without full commitment, the optimal sequential policy is to deplete the outstanding stock of debt progressively until these extra costs disappear. Nominal debt is therefore a burden on monetary policy, not only because it must be serviced, but also because it creates a time inconsistency problem that distorts interest rates. The introduction of alternative forms of taxation may lessen this burden, if there is enough commitment to fiscal policy. Full commitment for the fiscal authority can override any commitment problem of the monetary authority...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} roles played by indexed debt and nominal debt when {{monetary}} policy is designed sequentially. In our model, with indexed debt the optimal monetary policy is time consistent, resulting in constant {{interest rates and}} debt levels. In contrast, with <b>nominal</b> debt, the <b>incentive</b> to reduce the stock of debt, through unanticipated inflation, creates the standard time-inconsistency problem. This leads us to study the optimal sequential choice of monetary policy {{in the absence of}} a commitment technology. In the rational expectations equilibrium the incentive to generate unanticipated inflation increases the cost of the outstanding debt even if there are no unanticipated inflation episodes. The optimal policy is to progressively deplete the outstanding stock of debt until the (extra) liability costs vanish. We conclude that nominal debt is indeed a burden on monetary policy, not only because the debt must be serviced, but also because it distorts interest rates. ...|$|R
