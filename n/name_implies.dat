5|$|The family Sylviidae is a {{group of}} small insectivorous {{passerine}} birds. They mainly occur as breeding species, as the common <b>name</b> <b>implies,</b> in Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, Africa. Most are of generally undistinguished appearance, but many have distinctive songs.|$|E
50|$|They {{were popular}} in Victorian times, and thought {{convenient}} for kissing and intimate but demure conversation, as the <b>names</b> <b>imply.</b>|$|R

5|$|Tyrant flycatchers are Passerine birds which occur {{throughout}} North and South America. They superficially {{resemble the}} Old World flycatchers, but are more robust and have stronger bills.

5|$|As its <b>name</b> <b>implies,</b> the {{mistle thrush}} is {{important}} in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees. The highly nutritious fruits are favoured by the thrush, which digests the flesh leaving the sticky seeds to be excreted, possibly in a suitable location for germination.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its <b>name</b> <b>implies,</b> has a more uniform colour. At close range {{it can be seen that}} the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.|$|E

5|$|The Corn Exchange, {{situated}} at the junction of Bank Street and Elwick Road, opened on 3 December 1861. As the <b>name</b> <b>implies,</b> it was originally used for trade, but during the early 20th century its role expanded to cover dinners, dances and trade shows. The building was extended to improve capacity in the 1930s. It was demolished in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an in-game clock and day-night system {{that affects the}} townsfolk {{and some of the}} creatures in the field (namely, the Minku - creatures from whom Musashi can obtain berries to increase his overall health stat), as well as forcing the player to pay attention to Musashi's fatigue rating that goes up over time with lack of sleep, which as the <b>name</b> <b>implies</b> will have a deteriorating effect on his combative ability.|$|E
5|$|Tyrant flycatchers are Passerine birds which occur {{throughout}} North and South America. They superficially {{resemble the}} Old World flycatchers, but are more robust and have stronger bills.

5|$|Like its predecessors, Super Smash Bros. Brawl {{includes}} various {{modes of}} play {{from the previous}} game designed for a single player. Classic mode, as the <b>name</b> <b>implies,</b> is a classical approach to the game, in which players fight individual characters in a selected order. Each match features an arena or opponent from a particular series, such as The Legend of Zelda or Pokémon. Several matches have a unique battle condition, such as a metal opponent, large opponent or a two-on-two team battle. Similar to Classic mode are All Star mode and Boss Battles, where the player has only one life to defeat all of the playable characters and bosses, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the common house martin is open country with low vegetation, such as pasture, meadows and farmland, and preferably near water, although it {{is also found in}} mountains up to at least 2,200metres (7,200ft) altitude. As its <b>name</b> <b>implies,</b> it readily nests on man-made buildings, and will breed even in city centres if the air is clean enough. The other two species favour mountainous country (and sea cliffs in the case of Asian house martin); they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative. The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats.|$|E
5|$|Whereas some cruise missiles, such as {{the block}} IV Tomahawk, {{have the ability to}} loiter and have some sensory and remote control features, their primary mission is {{typically}} strike and not target acquisition. Cruise missiles, as their <b>name</b> <b>implies,</b> are optimized for long-range flight at constant speed both in terms of propulsion systems and wings or lifting body design. They are often unable to loiter at slow fuel-efficient speeds which significantly reduces potential loiter time even when the missile has some loiter capabilities.|$|E
5|$|As its <b>name</b> <b>implies,</b> Parasaurolophus was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest. However, it was soon reassessed {{as a member of}} the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids—Saurolophus is an hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus, a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest yet) from the Amur region of northeastern China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. P. cyrtocristatus, with its short, rounder crest, may be the most basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species, or it may represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen.|$|E
