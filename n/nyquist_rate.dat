2500|$|When a {{bandpass}} {{signal is}} sampled slower than its <b>Nyquist</b> <b>rate,</b> the samples are indistinguishable from samples of a low-frequency alias of the high-frequency signal. [...] That is often done purposefully {{in such a}} way that the lowest-frequency alias satisfies the Nyquist criterion, because the bandpass signal is still uniquely represented and recoverable.

2500|$|When the DFT is {{used for}} signal {{spectral}} analysis, the [...] sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal , where t represents time. [...] The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying Fourier transform of x(t) into a discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called aliasing. [...] Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see <b>Nyquist</b> <b>rate)</b> {{is the key to}} minimizing that distortion. [...] Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called leakage, which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT. [...] Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect. [...] When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a spectrogram. [...] If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the variance of the spectrum (also called a periodogram in this context); two examples of such techniques are the Welch method and the Bartlett method; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called spectral estimation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Compressive sensing {{enables the}} {{reconstruction}} of high-resolution signals from under-sampled data. While com-pressive methods simplify data acquisition, they require the solution of difficult recovery problems {{to make use of}} the resulting measurements. This article presents a new sensing framework that combines the advantages of both conventional and compressive sensing. Using the proposed STOne transform, measurements can be reconstructed instantly at <b>Nyquist</b> <b>rates</b> at any power-of-two resolution. The same data can then be “enhanced ” to higher resolutions using compressive methods that leverage sparsity to “beat ” the Nyquist limit. The availability of a fast direct reconstruction enables compressive measurements to be processed on small embedded devices. We demonstrate this by constructing a real-time compressive video camera.

50|$|The Nyquist {{frequency}} {{should not}} be confused with the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>rate,</b> which is the minimum sampling rate that satisfies the Nyquist sampling criterion for a given signal or family of signals. The <b>Nyquist</b> <b>rate</b> is twice the maximum component frequency of the function being sampled. For example, the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>rate</b> for the sinusoid at 0.6 fs is 1.2 fs, which means that at the fs rate, it is being undersampled. Thus, <b>Nyquist</b> <b>rate</b> is a property of a continuous-time signal, whereas Nyquist frequency is a property of a discrete-time system.|$|E

This method uses oversampling combined with computationally simple digital filtering to enhance the average {{resolution of}} an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, while maintaining an absolute resolution which is at least that of the unmodified system. The average resolution enhancement is approximately 1 / 2 log₂(N) - 1 / 4 bits, where N is the oversampling ratio.

In this work, analytic expressions of the Cramer-Rao Bound are proposed for an arbitrary number of filtered pulses.
