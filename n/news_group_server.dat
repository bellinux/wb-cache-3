40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>news</b> <b>group</b> {{modeling}} and forecasting methods using quantitative data generated by our large-scale {{natural language processing}} (NLP) text analysis system. A <b>news</b> <b>group</b> {{is a set of}} news entities, like top U. S. cities, governors, senators, golfers, or movie actors. Our fame distribution analysis of <b>news</b> <b>groups</b> shows that log-normal and power-law distributions generally could describe <b>news</b> <b>groups</b> in many aspects. We use several real <b>news</b> <b>groups</b> including cities, politicians, and CS professors, to evaluate our <b>news</b> <b>group</b> models in terms of time series data distribution analysis, group-fame probability analysis, and fame-changing analysis over long time. We also build a practical news generation model using a HMM (Hidden Markov Model) based approach. Most importantly, our analysis shows the future entity fame distribution has a power-law tail. That is, {{only a small number of}} news entities in a group could become famous in the future. Based on these analysis we are able to answer some interesting forecasting problems - for example, what is the future average fame (or maximum fame) of a specific <b>news</b> <b>group?</b> And what is the probability that some news entity become very famous within a certain future time range? We also give concrete examples to illustrate our forecasting approaches. Comment: 10 page...|$|R

50|$|Interoperability {{tends to}} be {{regarded}} as an issue for experts and its implications for daily living are sometimes underrated. The European Union Microsoft competition case shows how interoperability concerns important questions of power relationships. In 2004, the European Commission found that Microsoft had abused its market power by deliberately restricting interoperability between Windows work <b>group</b> <b>servers</b> and non-Microsoft work <b>group</b> <b>servers.</b> By doing so, Microsoft was able to protect its dominant market position for work <b>group</b> <b>server</b> operating systems, the heart of corporate IT networks. Microsoft was ordered to disclose complete and accurate interface documentation, which will enable rival vendors to compete on an equal footing (“the interoperability remedy”). As of June 2005 the Commission is market testing a new proposal by Microsoft to do this, having rejected previous proposals as insufficient.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{empirical}} {{study of the}} networks created by users within internet <b>news</b> <b>groups</b> and forums and show that they organ- ise themselves into scale-free trees. The structure of these trees depends on the topic under discussion; specialist topics have trees with a short shallow structure whereas more universal topics are discussed widely and have a deeper tree structure. For <b>news</b> <b>groups</b> {{we find that the}} distribu- tion of the time intervals between when a message is posted and when it receives a response exhibits a composite power-law behaviour. From our statistics we can see if the <b>news</b> <b>group</b> or forum is free or is overseen by a moderator. The correlation function of activity, the number of messages posted in a given time, shows long range correlations connected with the users’ daily routines. The distribution of distances between each message and its root is exponential for most <b>news</b> <b>groups</b> and power-law for the fo- rums. For both formats we find that the relation between the supremacy (the total number of nodes that are under the node i, including node i) and the degree is linear s(k) k, in contrast to the analytical relation for Barab´asi-Albert network...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} an empirical analysis demand for "work-group" (or low-end) servers. Servers are at thecentre of many US and EU anti-trust debates, including the Hewlett-Packard/Compaq merger and investigationsinto {{the activities of}} Microsoft. One question in these policy decisions is whether a high share of work serversindicates anything about shortrun market power. To investigate price elasticities we use model-level panel dataon transaction prices, sales and characteristics of practically every server in the world. We contrast estimatesfrom the traditional "macro" approaches that aggregate across brands and modern "micro" approaches that usebrand-level information (including both "distance metric" and logit based approaches). We find that the macroapproaches lead to overestimates of consumer price sensitivity. Our preferred micro-based estimates of themarket level elasticity of demand for work <b>group</b> <b>servers</b> are around 0. 3 to 0. 6 (compared to 1 to 1. 3 in themacro estimates). Even at the higher range of the estimates, however, we find that demand elasticities aresufficiently low to imply a distinct "anti-trust" market for work <b>group</b> <b>servers</b> and their operating systems. It isunsurprising that firms with large shares of work <b>group</b> <b>servers</b> have come under some antitrust scrutiny. demand elasticities, network servers, computers, anti-trust...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss some of the most {{important}} economic issues raised in European Commission vs. Microsoft (2004) concerning the market for work <b>group</b> <b>servers.</b> In our view, the most important economic issues relate to (a) foreclosure incentives and (b) innovation effects of the proposed remedy. We discuss the economic basis for the Commission’s claims that Microsoft had incentives to exclude rivals in the work <b>group</b> <b>server</b> market through degrading the interoperability of their server operating systems with Windows. We also examine the impact of compulsory disclosure of information on interoperability and argue that the effects on innovation are not unambiguously negative as Microsoft claim. We conclude with some general implications of the case for anti-trust enforcement in high innovation sectors. ...|$|R

40|$|Multiparty {{videoconferencing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important applications in the broadband network era. Unfortunately, it is difficult to perform high quality multiparty videoconferencing with computers over the Internet due to its huge demand on system resources and its stringent requirement on timely delivery of media streams. In order to maximize throughput and minimize delay and delay jitters, videoconferencing applications need to adapt to resource fluctuations, heterogeneous characteristics and capabilities of the conference computers, and the dynamically changing participants of the conference. In this thesis, we propose a resource allocation scheme that distributes workload dynamically according to the resource availability at the conference machines. In this scheme, the conferences are managed by the <b>group</b> <b>server.</b> The <b>group</b> <b>server</b> regularly receives, records and analyses the quality of service reports from the conference computers. It calculates resource allocation according to resource availability, relative priorities among the media streams, and minimum acceptable quality of media streams. Resource allocation instructions are then sent to the conference computers. Each computer then adjusts the media streams using media-specific media scaling algorithms according to the QoS directions from the <b>group</b> <b>server.</b> A Scalable Multiparty Videoconferencing application (SMVS) is implemented as an evaluation prototype on Solaris workstations connected by an ATM network. The empirical results show that our prototype is adaptive to resource fluctuations, and scalable to participating host machines with different capabilities that may dynamic join and leave the conference...|$|R
