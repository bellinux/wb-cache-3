40|$|This two-part paper {{argues that}} metaphor in both English and Arabic is defined and {{classified}} in {{almost the same}} way with some slight, but far from insignificant, differences. Those differences along with the linguistic nature of implied metaphor {{can be attributed to the}} failure in translating that type of metaphor from Arabic into English as shown particularly in Jones’, Johnson’s, and Arberry’s translations of Al Muallaqat.   The fourteen examples of implied metaphor, chosen from “Muallaqa of Imru Al-Qais,” are translated by employing two main strategies based on the linguistic component of implied metaphor – <b>none</b> <b>of</b> which (<b>this</b> <b>study</b> argues) succeeds in translating implied metaphor into implied metaphor. In criticizing some, if not all, prominent models suggested by eminent figures, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> argues that theorists since the 1980 s have not been involved in proposing new procedures that settle down such a problem in lieu of being preoccupied with iterating almost what Newmark (1988) suggests. Accordingly, this paper suggests a new cross-linguistic classification of metaphor – a classification that might better belittle the discrepancies of other classifications. More importantly, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> proposes a new model for translating implied metaphor into implied metaphor.

40|$|Childhood maltreatment is {{associated}} with adverse affective and cognitive consequences including impaired emotion processing, inhibition and attention. However, the majority of {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) studies in childhood maltreatment have examined emotion processing, while very few studies have tested the neurofunctional substrates of cognitive functions and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> attention. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> investigated the association between severe childhood abuse and fMRI brain activation during a parametric sustained attention task with a progressively increasing load of sustained attention in 21 medication-naïve, drug-free young people with a history of childhood abuse controlling for psychiatric comorbidities by including 19 psychiatric controls matched for psychiatric diagnoses, and 27 healthy controls. Behaviorally, the participants exposed to childhood abuse showed increased omission errors in the task which correlated positively trend-wise with the duration of their abuse. Neurofunctionally, the participants with a history of childhood abuse, but not the psychiatric controls, displayed significantly reduced activation relative to the healthy controls during the most challenging attention condition only in typical attention regions including left inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula and temporal areas. We therefore show {{for the first time that}} severe childhood abuse {{is associated}} with neurofunctional abnormalities in key ventral frontal-temporal sustained attention regions. The findings represent a first step towards the delineation of abuse-related neurofunctional abnormalities in sustained attention, which may help in the development of effective treatments for victims of childhood abuse...|$|R
40|$|While {{teachers}} play {{an important}} role in education and supporting learning, many learners in under-resourced settings are not privileged to have access to teachers. Some of these underprivileged learners deal with the issue by engaging in self-determined and self-directed learning. Their efforts sometimes pay off with access to formal higher education and financial resources they would not access otherwise. This paper reports and discusses data from interviews with two secondary education graduates who hunted and learned on their own notes from the field of Math–Physique (Mathematics and Physics), took national exams as non-formal learners and won government sponsorship and student loans that are highly competitive in Rwanda. The informants subsequently completed their undergraduate education in Physics and Applied Mathematics, respectively. One of them was completing his master’s degree course in Applied Mathematics at the time of the interview. The data revealed decision-making, dedication and perseverance as key attributes of these learners. The informants adopted different strategies vis-à-vis challenges they encountered when they were learning on their own, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them surrendered. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> may benefit underprivileged learners as well as educators and institutions that are interested in opening up higher education in under-resourced settings.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{attempts}} {{to understand the}} shift that occurred in Saudi-British relations by the year 1953. The tracing of such a shift is dealt with by investigating {{the development of these}} relations from 1939 and through to 1953. The research is drawn upon a documentary diplomatic history method reinforced by an analytical approach. Within the framework of analysis, the Realism approach to international politics is selected. Certain assumptions that most of - classical and modern - Realists agreed upon are in use, specifically the state-centric assumption, the rationality assumption, the unitary assumption, the anarchic assumption, and the security assumption. As is clear from existing secondary sources, Saudi Arabia and Britain enjoyed a kind of special relationship in the early 1940 s, but by the last year of King Ibn Saud's reign (1953) these two states' relations had deteriorated into severe conflict. Though some existing sources have attempted to shed some light on that development, their findings are indeed modest. In fact, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> literature has <b>studied</b> the topic from a purely Saudi-British perspective, nor has any of it explored and analysed the matter with the depth that it deserves. By focusing on Saudi-British relations the chapters <b>of</b> <b>this</b> thesis are endeavouring to answer profoundly a variety of questions that affected the main course of these relations. By questioning the impact of certain issues on Saudi-Anglo relations - such that of Saudi-US relations, the security concept, the Saudi-Hashemite problem, and the frontier conflict - the thesis will address its main theme...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} drawings of a fourteenth-century Italian priest, Opicinus de Canistris, who {{is emerging as}} a critical figure for medieval art history. His drawings contradict numerous assumptions of how scientific curiosity, space, allegory, gender and humor operated in medieval visual culture. Opicinus combined maps with human bodies to create complex allegories of the natural and spiritual world. These drawings defy traditional art-historical classification; they relate closely to contemporary maps and sea-charts, religious pictorial imagery, medical drawings, and cosmological diagrams, but belong to <b>none</b> <b>of</b> these categories. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> examines his drawings in relation to medieval epistemology, science, cartography, allegory, and gender, as well as modern theoretical approaches to mapping and the diagrammatic mode. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> also explores Opicinus's process of experimentation and making. To gain {{a greater understanding of}} what Opicinus was trying to convey through the creation of embodied maps, the maps, themselves, are explored first - their empirical basis, conditions of use, geometric techniques, and visual qualities - seeking what it was in them that so fascinated Opicinus. The next chapter explores vision and allegory in the drawings, probing the interactions between cartographic form and theological content that created his meanings. The third chapter questions the relationship between Opicinus's body-world drawings and contemporary conceptions and pictures of cosmic relationships and their relation to the body, and the final section examines how Opicinus used gender binaries and graphic sexuality as structural devices and metaphors...|$|R
40|$|In April 1997 Kainos Community in HMP The Verne, Dorset, England {{became the}} first faith-based prison unit to be {{established}} in the Western world. The foundations and ethos of Kainos are based on Christian concepts of ‘loving your neighbour’ and forgiveness. The community operates as a hybrid therapeutic community (TC) and cognitive behavioural programme (CBP). It is open to and inclusive of prisoners of all faiths and <b>none.</b> The aim <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is to explore the Kainos community ethnographically, guided by the principles of grounded theory and thematic analysis, in order to investigate whether or not Kainos ameliorates some of the de-humanising aspects of prison, and if so, how it rehumanises the prison space. Theoretically, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> highlights the dehumanisation of imprisonment, and illuminates the role that a holistic, Christian-based approach can play {{in terms of making}} the prison environment ‘more human’. My findings reveal that on Kainos there are physical, liminal and spiritual spatial mechanisms, in which a family of sub-themes interact to enable flourishing to occur. Kainos has created a physical space in which spaces of architecture and design; sensory experience; movement; and home interact to enable flourishing, whereby prisoners feel ‘more homely’, ‘free’, safe, and calm. Kainos has created a liminal space in which spaces of atmosphere; identity; home; and creativity interact to enable flourishing, empowering prisoners in their self-expression; as a cathartic tool; and as a means of regaining or creating a new identity. Kainos has created a spiritual space in which spaces of Christian activism, love, and forgiveness enable self-worth, healing, transformation, and meaningful change. The implication is that Kainos has created spaces of flourishing, safety and peace within an otherwise dehumanising carceral space, and this {{plays an important role in}} the process of transformational change imperative in the desistance process. If society must have prisons, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> concludes that Kainos provides a model for how they should be...|$|R

40|$|<b>None.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{to explore}} the {{integration}} of the iPad as a learning and teaching technology into the Foundations Program at the two Higher Colleges of Technology in Fujairah: Fujairah Men’s College (FMC) and Fujairah Women’s College (FWC) in the United Arab Emirates. The new technology was introduced to enable the Program’s teachers and students to support their teaching and learning of English as a foreign language. Specifically, the study investigates how these teachers and students used the iPad’s technical affordances to create pedagogical affordances designed to construct and promote English language teaching and learning. It also examines the challenges they faced in doing so, the types of tasks and activities for which the new technology was used. Finally, it sheds light on the limitations of the iPad as perceived by these users as well as other relevant issues arising from the launch of the technology in the two colleges. The data for the research were drawn from class observations, interviews and surveys. Six Foundations Program classes were observed, five teachers were interviewed, five more teachers were asked one written research question, and ten students were asked another written research question. In addition, two surveys – one for the teachers and one for the students – were conducted to obtain further data. The study finds that the Foundations Program’s teachers and students used the iPad’s technical affordances effectively to construct activities that largely enhanced their teaching and learning by making it more interesting, and engaging. In doing so, they faced challenges that they tried to resolve and which had some impact on their teaching and learning. In addition, the study has identified a number of issues relating {{to the use of the}} iPad in the Program as well as what these iPad users perceived as limitations of the new technology. Finally, the study stresses the importance of conducting a pilot scheme prior to any proposed rollout of a new educational technology and suggests longitudinal studies with larger and more representative samples to assess and measure any contributions or lack thereof the iPad makes to the teaching and learning of English as a foreign language. I believe that the study contributes to the area of TESOL and mobile learning by its focus on the rich experience of two higher education colleges using the iPad as a teaching and learning technology in classes of Arab learners and by highlighting the challenges the teachers and students at these two colleges faced in their attempt to integrate the new technology in their context as well as what they perceived as the technology’s pedagogical and technical limitations. Another important contribution of the study is the exploration of other issues arising from the use of the iPad in the Fujairah colleges’ teaching and learning environment. It is also important to note that study findings could provide insights into {{the integration of the}} iPad into the foundations programs of the other fifteen colleges in the Higher Colleges of Technology system given the similarities these colleges share with the two Fujairah colleges. Neither would it be an exaggeration to suggest that these findings could also provide an insight into the experience of using the iPad in similar learning environments in other UAE educational institutions.
