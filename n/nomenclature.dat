5|$|The {{dominant}} {{classification system}} {{is called the}} Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial <b>nomenclature.</b> How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the International Code of <b>Nomenclature</b> for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), the International Code of Zoological <b>Nomenclature</b> (ICZN), and the International Code of <b>Nomenclature</b> of Bacteria (ICNB). The classification of viruses, viroids, prions, and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and {{is known as the}} International Code of Viral Classification and <b>Nomenclature</b> (ICVCN). However, several other viral classification systems do exist.|$|E

5|$|IUPAC {{committee}} {{has a long}} history of officially naming organic and inorganic compounds. IUPAC <b>nomenclature</b> is developed so that any compound can be named under one set of standardized rules to avoid duplicate names. The first publication, which is information from the International Congress of Applied Chemistry, on IUPAC <b>nomenclature</b> of organic compounds, can be found from the early 20th century in A Guide to IUPAC <b>Nomenclature</b> of Organic Compounds (1900).|$|E
5|$|IUPAC was {{established}} in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry {{for the advancement of}} chemistry. Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on <b>Nomenclature</b> and Symbols (IUPAC <b>nomenclature)</b> is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include standardizing <b>nomenclature,</b> finding ways to bring chemistry to the world, and publishing works.|$|E

Symbols are preferably kept consistent with other members of a gene family and with homologs in other species, particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism.|$|E
40|$|The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is {{intended}} to support uniform access of machine-readable biomedical information resources. The foundation of the UMLS is a Metathesaurus, which will link terms in different biomedical <b>nomenclatures.</b> Because the resources and <b>nomenclatures</b> continue to evolve, the Metathesaurus must evolve with them. Thus, an important criterion {{for the design of}} the Metathesaurus is the graceful accommodation of change. A model of such accommodation is presented. A key design decision was the representation of the Metathesaurus, and prospective updates, as a database of “facts. ” Particular emphasis is placed on database operations that use the results of inter-nomenclature lexical matching to collapse entries from different <b>nomenclatures</b> into Metathesaurus entries.

5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial <b>nomenclature.</b> The <b>nomenclature</b> of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of <b>Nomenclature</b> for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically in 1729, by the Italian Pier Antonio Micheli in his Nova plantarum genera iuxta Tournefortii methodum disposita, {{who gave it}} its current scientific name. The species was once referred to by American authors as Clathrus cancellatus L., as they used a system of <b>nomenclature</b> based on the former American Code of Botanical <b>Nomenclature,</b> in which {{the starting point for}} naming species was Linnaeus's 1753 Species Plantarum. The International Code for Botanical <b>Nomenclature</b> now uses the same starting date, but names of Gasteromycetes used by Christian Hendrik Persoon in his Synopsis Methodica Fungorum (1801) are sanctioned and automatically replace earlier names. Since Persoon used the specific epithet ruber, the correct name for the species is Clathrus ruber. Several historical names of the fungus are now synonyms: Clathrus flavescens, named by Persoon in 1801; Clathrus cancellatus by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and published by Elias Fries in 1823; Clathrus nicaeensis, published by Jean-Baptiste Barla in 1879; and Clathrus ruber var. flavescens, published by Livio Quadraccia and Dario Lunghini in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, neither Volvaria nor Volvariopsis {{would be}} used as the correct name for this group. The generic name Volvariella, {{proposed}} by the Argentinean mycologist Carlos Luis Spegazzini in 1899, would be adopted for this group in 1953 after a proposal to conserve Kummer’s Volvaria against De Candolle’s Volvaria was rejected by the <b>Nomenclature</b> Committee for Fungi established under the principles of the International Code of <b>Nomenclature</b> for algae, fungi, and plants. The combination Volvariella earlei would be made by Robert L. Shaffer, who authored the first comprehensive monographic revision of Volvariella in North America in 1957.|$|E
5|$|A new species, Podoserpula miranda, was {{proposed}} in 2009 {{by a group}} of New Caledonian mycologists for a species of that South Pacific archipelago. The name was provisional (not validly published), however, as the description was in French (the code of <b>nomenclature</b> mandates Latin) and lacked a required designation of a type specimen. It was validly published in 2013.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} London, Stearn {{produced}} a steady output of publications {{during his years}} at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library (1933–1952). These covered {{a wide range of}} topics from bibliography to plant <b>nomenclature,</b> taxonomy and garden plants, with a particular emphasis on Vinca, Epimedium and Lilium. Within two years of joining the Library in 1933, he had produced his first major monograph, Lilies (1935), in collaboration with Drysdale Woodcock and John Coutts. This text, in an expanded and revised edition, as Woodcock and Stearn's Lilies of the World (1950) became a standard work on the Liliaceae sensu lato. While at the Library he also continued his collaboration with his Cambridge colleagues, publishing catalogues of the Herbarium collections, including the Catalogue of the Collections of the Herbarium of the University Botany School, Cambridge (1935). The second task imposed on him at this time involved the RHS role in maintaining revision of the Code of Botanical <b>Nomenclature</b> (see Botanical taxonomy).|$|E
