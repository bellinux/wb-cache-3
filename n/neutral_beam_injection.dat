Some of the intermediate hydrogen gas is accelerated towards the plasma by collisions with the charged beam while remaining neutral: this neutral beam is thus unaffected by the magnetic field and so shines through it into the plasma. Once inside the plasma the neutral beam transmits energy to the plasma by collisions {{as a result of}} which it becomes ionized and thus contained by the magnetic field thereby both heating and refuelling the reactor in one operation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the present status of plasma heating in {{toroidal}} systems (mainly tokamaks and helical systems) for astrophysical plasma scientists. The main method of plasma heating in toroidal systems or tori is to utilize fast ions (NBI heating and alpha heating). The maximum ion temperature of 38 keV has been achieved at the plasma center by <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> <b>injections</b> (NBls) in the JT- 60 U tokamak. Ripple-trapped losses of fast ions produced by NBIs have been measured also in the JT- 60 U. The first tokamak discharges in deuterium-tritium fuelled mixtures have been carried out, successfully in the JET tokamak. These experimental results are compared with the theoretical predictions based on t,he Coulomb collisions. Another powerful method is the ICRF heating (Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency). However, this article will be focussed mainly on the NBI and alpha heatings. Related to plasma heating the current drive will be mentioned briefly placing an emphasis on the bootstrap current. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{profile and}} magnitude are predicted in theory for the neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV) torque induced by plasma {{response to the}} resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) in a tokamak with an edge pedestal. For a low-β equilibrium, the NTV torque {{is dominated by the}} toroidal component with the same dominant toroidal mode number of RMP. The NTV torque profile is found to be localized, whose peak location is determined by profiles of both the equilibrium temperature (pressure) and the plasma response. In general, the peak of NTV torque profile is found to track the pedestal position. The magnitude of NTV torque strongly depends on the β value of pedestal, which suggests a more significant role of NTV torque in higher plasma β regimes. For a fixed plasma β, decreasing density hence increasing temperature can also enhance the amplitude of NTV torque due to the reduced collisionality in the 1 /ν regime. Based on those findings, we identify the tokamak operation regimes where the significance of NTV torque in edge pedestal induced by RMP can approach those from other momentum sources such as the <b>neutral</b> <b>beam</b> <b>injections.</b> Comment: 26 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{parametric}} equilibrium distribution function F_eq {{to be applied}} to the gyrokinetic studies of the Finite Orbit Width behavior of guiding centers representing several species encountered in axisymmetric tokamak plasma, as fusion products, thermal bulk and energetic particles from Ion Cyclotron Radiation Heating and Negative <b>Neutral</b> <b>Beam</b> <b>Injections.</b> After the analysis of the basic results of orbit theory obtained with a particularly convenient orbit coordinates set, it is shown how the proposed F_eq satisfies the two conditions that make it an equilibrium distribution function: (i) it must depend only on the constants of motion and adiabatic invariants, and (ii) the guiding centers must remain confined for suitably long time. Furthermore, the F_eq can be modeled, with a proper choice of its parameters, to reproduce the most common distribution functions. A local Maxwellian distribution function is obtained for the thermal plasma in the Zero Orbit Width approximation. For the fusion α particles, F_eq can also reproduce the Slowing Down (SD) distribution function. More generally, for supra-thermal particles, when external heatings are present, such as (N) NBI and ICRH, the proposed model distribution function shows similarities with the anisotropic SD and the biMaxwellian distribution functions. F_eq can be used to fit experimental profiles and it could provide a useful tool for experimental and numerical data analysis. Moreover, it could help to develop analytical computations for facilitating data interpretation in the light of theoretical models. This distribution function can be easily implemented in gyrokinetic codes, where {{it can be used to}} simulate plasma also in the presence of external heating sources.

The difference in Cexp between the two configurations is enhanced to > 10 % as the plasma beta increases.
