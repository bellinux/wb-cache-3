25|$|The lunula ("small moon") is {{the visible}} {{part of the}} matrix, the whitish {{crescent-shaped}} base of the visible <b>nail.</b> <b>The</b> lunula can best {{be seen in the}} thumb and may not be visible in the little finger.|$|E
25|$|The nail wall (vallum unguis) is the {{cutaneous}} fold overlapping {{the sides}} and proximal end of the <b>nail.</b> <b>The</b> lateral margin (margo lateralis) lies beneath the nail wall {{on the sides of}} the nail, and the nail groove or fold (sulcus matricis unguis) are the cutaneous slits into which the lateral margins are embedded.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the curved}} {{shape of the}} <b>nail,</b> <b>the</b> {{tensioning}} device rests on the higher middle of the nail by applying upward pressure {{to the sides of}} the nail. In studies of diabetics, who need to avoid surgery when possible, nail bracing was found to be effective at providing immediate, as well as long-term, relief.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>nails</b> are {{markedly}} thickened {{with yellow}} to yellow-green discoloration of <b>the</b> <b>nails.</b> They grow slowly, {{at a rate}} of 0.25 mm/week or less. <b>The</b> <b>nails</b> may have ridges and increased side-to-side curvature, reduction of the white crescent and detachment of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> from <b>the</b> <b>nailbed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> changes may change over time.|$|R
25|$|Starting at {{the bottom}} of the <b>nail,</b> <b>the</b> ring shanks on the lower half of the nail are {{enhanced}} with angular barbs, which add maximum resistance to the nail being pulled out. The middle of the nail has no extra features, which leaves the section most likely to be damaged during an earthquake thicker and least prone to damage. The area directly below the head of the nail features a spiral-style shank used to enhance the nail's strength in holding boards together. This enhancement keeps boards that are nailed together from moving around under nature's forces and overall weakening the joints. The final feature of this nail is the nail head, which is 25% larger than the average, allowing it to be more resistant to being pulled completely through attached pieces of wood.|$|E
25|$|N. lamarckia {{is grown}} as an ornamental, and for low-grade timber and paper. The timber {{is used for}} plywood, light construction, pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and {{furniture}} components. Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and compressive strength. The wood has a density of 290–560kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or taste. It is easy to work, with hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to <b>nail.</b> <b>The</b> timber air dries rapidly {{with little or no}} degrade. Kadamba wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.|$|E
25|$|One study {{compared}} {{patients with}} ingrown toenails to healthy controls {{and found no}} difference in the shape of toenails between those of patients and of the control group. The study suggested that treatment should not be based on the correction of a non-existent nail deformity. Ingrown toenails are caused by weight-bearing (activities such as walking, running, etc.) in patients that have too much soft skin tissue on the sides of their nail. Weight bearing causes this excessive amount of skin to bulge up along the sides of the <b>nail.</b> <b>The</b> pressure on the skin around the nail results in the tissue being damaged, resulting in swelling, redness and infection. Many treatments are directed at the nail itself and often include partial or full removal of the healthy nail. However, failure to treat the cutaneous condition can result in a return of the ingrowth and a deformity or mutilation of the nail.|$|E

If one damages <b>the</b> lunula, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> will be permanently deformed.

25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or <b>nail</b> <b>the</b> window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like the}} {{cornified}} layer of epidermis and of any mammalian <b>nail,</b> <b>the</b> hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living {{layer of the}} skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis, and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by mitotic activity in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.|$|E

50|$|The hyponychium is {{the area}} of epithelium, {{particularly}} the thickened portion, underlying the free edge of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate on <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> Its proximal border is immediately distal to distal limit of <b>nail</b> bed—a.k.a. <b>the</b> onychodermal band (the line along the interface of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed and <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate). Its distal border the free edge of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate—or where that edge would project downwards onto the epidermis.|$|R
30|$|In {{all other}} cases, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed may be raised and {{evaluated}} under magnification {{in order to}} carefully examine the characteristic of the lesion. If only the sterile matrix is damaged, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> should be left attached proximally in <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold. When <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> germinal matrix is also involved, <b>the</b> entire <b>nail</b> should be detached by making two incisions on the lateral side of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> should be left attached distally when dislocation of the proximal part of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> occurs.|$|R
30|$|Optical means {{magnification}} and a 6 - 0 or 7 - 0 nonchromic absorbable monofilament {{are necessary}} for nail-bed sutures. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> is raised by using scissors or a delicate spatula starting under the free edge of <b>the</b> <b>nail.</b> It is carefully detached from <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed and, if necessary, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> is removed from <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold by rotational movements [5]. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> will be preserved and replaced like a biological dressing. This has different functions: to shape to the nail-bed fragments, to avoid adhesion between the roof and <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed, to support a possible associated fracture, like a splint, to decrease postoperative pain, and to improve tactile sensation during the healing period. Before replacing <b>the</b> <b>nail,</b> a few holes {{should be made to}} allow blood drainage. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> should be firmly fixed {{at the end of the}} operation. Good insertion of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> base into <b>the</b> sack bottom of <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold is very important to prevent a dead space that may cause adherence between <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> matrix and eponychium and subsequent ungual dystrophy. To hold <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> into <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> fold, an X suture is preferable, avoiding passage through <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed with a U suture [6, 7]. While the new fingernail is growing, <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> used as a splint will be pushed off and substituted in 1 – 3  months. It is desirable not to remove <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> or <b>the</b> substitute so as to prevent <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> bed drying our. Steri-Strips may help keep <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> in situ during fingernail regrowth.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>nail</b> {{plate is}} <b>the</b> {{permanent}} product of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> matrix. Its normal appearance and growth {{depend on the}} integrity of several components: the surrounding tissues or perionychium and the bony phalanx that are contributing to <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> apparatus or <b>nail</b> unit. <b>The</b> <b>nail</b> is inserted proximally in an invagination practically parallel to the upper surface of the skin and laterally in <b>the</b> lateral <b>nail</b> grooves. This pocket-like invagination has a roof, <b>the</b> proximal <b>nail</b> fold and a floor, the matrix from which <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> is derived. <b>The</b> germinal matrix forms the bulk of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> plate. <b>The</b> proximal element forms the superficial third of <b>the</b> <b>nail</b> whereas <b>the</b> distal element provides its inferior two-thirds.
