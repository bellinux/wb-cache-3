However, even though annual kelp production is higher, the productivity of individual plants is lower due to lower biomass accumulation of fucoid algae. Studies conducted by Pilson, Asare, and Harlin between 1983 and 1985 illustrated that algal species such as Laminaria saccharina living in Rhode Island Sound waters have maximum <b>nitrogen</b> <b>accumulation</b> in their tissues, which directly correlates with maximum ambient inorganic nitrogen levels in tissues of other algal species as well.

There were significant differences among the investigated cultivars regarding the all studied traits. Coefficient of variation ranged from 6. 81 % for 1000 grain mass to 12. 91 % for total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>accumulation.</b> Cluster analysis showed the studied genotypes divided into two clusters, where larger one was further divided into several smaller clusters. Good definition of clusters is a sign that these traits’ pattern is a distinctive property of a genotype. Multiple regression analysis showed that the all four studied traits, as well as intercept value, had significant effect on grain yield. The greatest effect was expressed by number of grain per spike, where standardized regression coefficient (β) was 0. 535. Adjusted R 2 value (0. 984) showed that 98. 4 % of the observed variation in grain yield was explained by the studied four traits.

40|$|The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) {{oil spill}} in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) {{in the spring of}} 2010 {{introduced}} 4. 4 million of barrels of oil to the ecosystem. Some biodegradation of the oil occurs when microorganisms, particularly bacteria, metabolize the oil as a carbon source. During this process, the microbes also require nutrients for energy. An introduction of oil at this magnitude has the ability to induce large blooms of microbes, which in turn can affect nutrient concentrations. Microbial petroleum degradation decreases nutrient concentrations, whereas the microbial assimilation and decay of organic matter increase nutrient concentrations. This study assessed whether any changes in nitrate, ammonium, and/or phosphate concentrations from historical levels could be attributed to the oil spill as a result of biodegradation, and how those changes can impact the GoM ecosystem. Nutrient samples were collected at discrete depths throughout the water column, in a cross-shelf transect inland from the spill site outside the DeSoto Canyon, in August 2010, February 2011, and May 2011 (four months to one year after the spill). In August 2010, a subsurface oil plume was found at depths of 1000 m to 1200 m. At the same depth of ~ 1000 m, a significant decrease in nitrate was observed, indicating the biodegradation of oil by heterotrophic bacteria of the aphotic zone, compared to earlier data during August 2000, when no known oils were present. Overall temporal increases in ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were observed both in near-surface waters and at an intermediate depth of ~ 400 m next to the walls of the DeSoto Canyon, suggesting an incremental die-off of both plankton and benthic organisms during accelerated recycling of nutrients. Continued decreases of phosphate were observed into February 2011, supporting ongoing biodegradation then as well. By May 2011, however, there were more increases in near-surface ammonium concentrations, compared to April 2000, with the implication that continued interseasonal recycled <b>nitrogen</b> <b>accumulations</b> may have been due to a decadal ecological regime shift, after a combination of top-down overfishing, petroleum perturbations, and/or increases of toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs) ...|$|R

Commensurate with delayed senescence, fungicide programmes, particularly when including strobilurins, improved grain yield through improvements in both crop biomass and harvest index, although the relationship with green area duration of the flag leaf (GFLAD) depended on year and in some cases, cultivar. In all years fungicide treatments significantly increased the amount of nitrogen in the above-ground biomass, the amount of nitrogen in the grain and the nitrogen harvest index. All these effects could be linearly related to the fungicide effect on GFLAD. These relationships occasionally interacted with cultivar but {{there was no evidence that}} fungicide mode of action affected the relationship between GFLAD and yield of nitrogen in the grain. Fungicide treatments significantly reduced the amount of soil mineral N at harvest and when severe disease had been controlled, the net remobilization of N from the vegetation to the grain after anthesis. Fungicide maintained the filling of grain with both dry matter and <b>nitrogen.</b> The proportionate <b>accumulation</b> of <b>nitrogen</b> in the grain was later than that of dry matter and this difference was greater when fungicide had been applied. Effects of fungicide on grain protein concentration and its relationship with GFLAD were inconsistent over year and cultivar.

Dilution of grain protein concentration following fungicide use, when it did occur, was small compared with what would be predicted by adoption of other yield increasing techniques such as the selection of high yielding cultivars (based on currently available cultivars) or by growing wheat in favourable climates...|$|R

This initial gain and loss behavior correlated at the 2 percent level of significance with the subsequent grain yield (r= 0. 774, 8 df), and was still discernable in soil test results of late April, where total mineral nitrogen depletion since before treatment correlated positively at the 10 percent level of significance with the nitrogen loss found 3 weeks after treatment. For a small sample of nine plots, a late July sampling revealed that depletions of mineral nitrogen since April were much more predictive of grain yields than were the actual April-N levels (r 2 = 0. 787 versus r 2 = 0. 460). This result confirms the large role played by differential moisture stress regimes in the field, since depletions during the drying season of late spring and early summer depend on the availability of moisture. Initial fertilizer behavior, determining fertilizer losses before the onset of crop usage, and a favorable later moisture regime were seen as the two largest determinants of yield under the conditions of this experiment. Since the latter factor is largely beyond further control, the former is the only factor open to manipulation. Generally, after planting treatments were lower in initial losses of mineral nitrogen, and also generally provided somewhat higher surface mineral nitrogen levels in early spring, which was found to be weakly correlated with yield. Surface accumulations in early spring can only be beneficial if sufficient spring moisture is available for downward transport into the root zone, however, and a drier spring than prevailed during this experiment could forseeably reverse this relationship by keeping such surface <b>nitrogen</b> <b>accumulations</b> from becoming available to the plant in spring...|$|R
40|$|The {{fluorescent}} redox probe hydroethidine was accumulated and metabolised {{about five}} times faster in aerobic than in hypoxic mammalian cells. Patterns of fluorescence in Chinese hamster V 79 spheroids also indicated that internal hypoxic cells were less able to metabolise the drug; toxicity was observed in cells only when cell fluorescence exceeded about 500 times background. In medium equilibrated with air or <b>nitrogen,</b> cell <b>accumulation</b> of the stain was rapid, and began to plateau after 30 min; loss of ethidium was initially rapid, with a slower component after 30 min, and transfer of the metabolite ethidium between stained and unstained cells was observed after 2 h co-incubation. Sorting cells from irradiated spheroids {{on the basis of}} ethidium fluorescence provided good separation of aerobic radiosensitive and hypoxic radioresistant cells, although separation using the perfusion probe, Hoechst 33342, was superior. Similar experiments with the murine SCCVII squamous cell carcinoma suggested that hydroethidine might be a useful indirect stain for locating hypoxic cells in experimental tumours when used in combination with a perfusion probe such as Hoechst 33342...|$|R
40|$|Stability of {{dolphinfish}} (Coryphaena hippurus) and sardines (Sardina pilchardus) {{of different}} fat content (lean and fatty sardines) during frozen storage and its suitability for cold-smoking throughout storage were evaluated {{in order to}} overcome seasonal and excess catches of these species. Dolphinfish showed a relative stability regarding protein functionality (protein solubility, apparent viscosity, water and lipid holding capacity), lipid oxidation and total volatile basic <b>nitrogen</b> (TVBN) <b>accumulation,</b> which led to high acceptability ratings of the resulting smoked product throughout frozen storage (340 days). However, both lean and fatty sardines showed a marked loss of protein functionality, which coincided with the accumulation of oxidation products and TVBN. Freezing of raw muscle may become a valuable preservation method for the smoking industry to overcome the short caught period of dolphinfish in the Balearic Islands and {{to make use of}} excess catches of both, lean and fatty sardine. High quality smoked products may be obtained from the frozen muscle during approximately twelve, four and two months of frozen storage for Dolphinfish, lean and fatty sardine, respectively.
