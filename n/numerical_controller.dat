30|$|The {{mechatronics}} revolution, in particular, {{has transformed}} the machine tool industry. Two inventions crucial to the machine tool industry -- an improved servo motor and a compact, simple to use, and cheap to make <b>numerical</b> <b>controller</b> -- {{are the result of}} Japanese innovativeness. Until these inventions were made, a huge market segment of mid-sized and small industrial customers was neglected because the NC was too costly and too large for them. The origin of NC machine tools with unprecedented levels of precision and reliability, meanwhile, goes back to the late 1940 s to U.S. institutions such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They invented the <b>numerical</b> <b>controller</b> for the milling machine in 1952. The device, however, had 2000 vacuum tubes, and its size {{was the size of a}} small room. While it controlled a machine tool automatically, it was huge and expensive, putting it out of reach of all but the largest industries, such as aircraft manufacturers. The <b>numerical</b> <b>controller</b> developed by MIT in the 1950 s needed a large computer capable of sophisticated calculations.|$|E

40|$|Control {{systems are}} small {{components}} {{that control the}} behavior of larger systems. In the last years, sophisticated controllers {{have been widely used}} in the hardware/software embedded systems contained in a growing number of everyday products and appliances. Therefore, the problem of the automatic synthesis of controllers is extremely important. To this aim, several techniques have been applied, like cell-to-cell mapping, dynamic programming and, more recently, model checking. The controllers generated using these techniques are typically <b>numerical</b> <b>controllers</b> that, however, often have a huge size and not enough robustness.

40|$|Numerical control (NC) {{systems are}} opening wide fields of {{application}} for ED machining. An operation along a 3 -D course makes possible {{to produce a}} very complex geometry with a simple tool electrode and ED machining turns into a shaping technique. A standard NC system {{can not be used}} for control operations in ED machines because of substantial differences resulting from the nature of the process. Therefore special requirements of ED process towards a numerical control have been acquired in order to develop a specified numerical control for EDM. Disad-vantageous in the use of non-standard <b>numerical</b> <b>controllers</b> like those used in EDM are limita-tions in the information exchange with other automation systems. Vendor specific interfaces and a lack of transparency in the implementation often originate these problem. The objective of the OSACA standard is to define a reference architecture for <b>numerical</b> <b>controllers,</b> in order to achieve an extendible system without vendor restrictions. The developed numerical control for EDM applications is designed to follow the architecture defined by OSACA closely to provide the benefits of this standard for ED-machining.

40|$|A {{significant}} limitation {{to machine}} tool productivity in high-speed operations {{is due to}} inertial vibrations. During strong accelerations, inertial forces generate oscillations that are translated into surface geometrical errors on the machined parts.

40|$|Abstract — This study {{addresses}} {{the formulation of}} optimal <b>numerical</b> <b>controllers</b> for stochastically-excited vibratory en-ergy harvesters in which a single-directional power electronic converter is used to regulate power-flow. Single-directional converters have implementation advantages for small-scale applications, but restrict the domain of feasible controllers. Optimizing the average power generated in such systems {{can be accomplished by}} formulating the constrained control problem in terms of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi theory. However, solving the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) is challenging because it is a nonlinear partial differential equation. As such, we investigate the capability of the pseudospectral (PS) method to solve the HJE with mixed state-control constraints. The per-formance of the PS controller is computed for a single-degree-of-freedom resonant oscillator with electromagnetic coupling. We compare the PS performance to the performance of the optimal static admittance controller as well as the optimal unconstrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian controller.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{the use of}} {{controllers}} has become very common, thus much work {{is being done to}} create automatic controller synthesis tools. When dealing with critical systems, most of the times such controllers are required to be optimal and robust, i. e., they must achieve their goal with minimal resource consumption and be able to handle also unexpected situations. All these requirements, which are intrinsically difficult to satisfy, become even more challenging when dealing with hybrid systems, which represent a wide range of real world systems. In this paper we propose a model checking based tool, namely CGMurphi, which assists in the generation of optimal and robust <b>numerical</b> <b>controllers</b> for systems having complex dynamics, possibly hybrid systems.
