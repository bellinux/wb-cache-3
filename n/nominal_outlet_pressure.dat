40|$|The Robotic Lunar Lander (RLL) {{development}} project office at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center is currently studying several lunar surface science mission concepts. The {{focus is on}} spacecraft carrying multiple science instruments and power systems that will allow extended operations on the lunar surface or other air-less bodies in the solar system. Initial trade studies of launch vehicle options indicate the spacecraft will be significantly mass and volume constrained. Because of the investment by the DOD in low mass, highly volume efficient components, NASA has investigated the potential integration {{of some of these}} technologies in space science applications. A 10, 000 psig helium pressure regulator test activity has been conducted as part of the overall risk reduction testing for the RLL spacecraft. The regulator was subjected to typical NASA acceptance testing to assess the regulator response to the expected RLL mission requirements. The test results show the regulator can supply helium at a stable outlet pressure of 740 psig within a +/- 5 % tolerance band and maintain a lock-up pressure less than the + 5 % above <b>nominal</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> for all tests conducted. Numerous leak tests demonstrated leakage less than 10 - 3 standard cubic centimeters per second (SCCS) for the internal seat leakage at lock-up and less than 10 - 5 SCCS for external leakage through the regulator body. The successful test has shown the potential for 10, 000 psig helium systems in NASA spacecraft and has reduced risk associated with hardware availability and hardware ability to meet RLL mission requirements...|$|E

50|$|The {{outlet side}} is {{fitted with a}} {{pressure}} gauge. As gas is drawn from the <b>outlet</b> side, the <b>pressure</b> inside the regulator body falls. The diaphragm is pushed back by the spring and the valve opens, letting more gas in from the supply until equilibrium is reached between the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> and the spring. The <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> therefore depends on the spring force, which can be adjusted {{by means of an}} adjustment handle or knob.|$|R
50|$|The <b>outlet</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> and {{the inlet}} pressure hold the diaphragm/poppet assembly in the closed position against {{the force of}} the large spring. If the supply pressure falls, {{it is as if the}} large spring compression is increased allowing more gas and higher pressure to build in the outlet chamber until an equilibrium pressure is reached. Thus, if the supply <b>pressure</b> falls, the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> will increase, provided the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> remains below the falling supply pressure. This is the cause of end-of-tank dump where the supply is provided by a pressurized gas tank. With a single stage regulator, when the supply tank gets low, the lower inlet <b>pressure</b> causes the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> to climb. If the spring compression is not adjusted to compensate, the poppet can remain open and allow the tank to rapidly dump its remaining contents. In other words, the lower the supply pressure, the lower the pressure differential the regulator can achieve for a given spring setting.|$|R

40|$|Summary. [...] The present work {{continued}} {{that reported}} in Ref. 1 and extended {{some of the}} results there described to lower entry Much numbers (1. 3 to 1. 9). It was found, as in Ref. 1, that with a parallel entry duct followed by a straight divergent diffuser of 10 deg total angle the flow inside the parallel tube was supersonic provided the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> of the diffuser {{was less than a}} certain critical value (about 0. 93 of the upstream pitot pressure). In this case the mass flow of air through the tube was equal to that calculated, assuming that all the air incident on the internal section of the tube entry passed through it. For pressures higher than the critical value the flow became subsonic at the duct entry, a shock-wave was formed at the entrance lip and the rate of airflow through the tube decreased. Similar results were obtained for a uniformly divergent tube of 7 deg total angle; in this case, however, an <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> equal to 0. 97 of the upstream pitot pressure was attained before the shock-wave left the lip. For <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures</b> less than the critical the flow was supersonic for a distance inside the duct entry depending on the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure,</b> the flow becoming subsonic further along the duct. The assumption of unidimensional flow in the duct led to results which showed considerable disagreement with the observed pressure distribution more especially in the subsonic flow region. This could be explained by assuming that the flow in this region separated from the duct wall. The results of tests on models of two forms of annular entry (the Q 1 and t?; 24 / 43 entries respectively) showed that two types of flow rdgime were possible depending on the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure.</b> For low <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures</b> a shock-wave wa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Pressure-exchange ejector {{is a novel}} device {{which can}} {{transfer}} energy between fluids by pressure waves, so the pressure of each port is very important. A prototype was designed and the experiment system was set up. The performance of pressure-exchange ejector at different overall <b>pressure</b> ratio and <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> was investigated. Results showed that the entrainment ratio of pressure-exchange ejector reduced with larger pM, while the overall isotropic efficiency tended to go up with increasing <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> pM and then falled down. Higher efficiency could be obtained when the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> {{was close to the}} average pressure of the channel after a cycle. Besides, the efficiency of pressure-exchange ejector decreased as the overall pressure ratio increasing. The maximum efficiency was about 60 % when pH/pL= 1. 5, while for pH/pL= 2. 0, the maximum efficiency reduced by 15 %. However this value was also much higher than that of the steady flow ejector. The excellent performance makes pressure-exchange ejector a promising device for natural gas exploitation...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the problem}} of a {{parallel}} connected power and absorption cooling cogeneration system was analyzed and then an improved configuration based on this system was proposed. This system can make cascade utilization of the turbine exhaust heat. By varying turbine <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure,</b> different turbine exhaust vapor temperatures can be obtained, resulting in different amounts of heat that can be recovered in the refrigeration subsystem. Simulation results show that when the turbine <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> in the improved system is 3 bar, 119. 6 kW of heat can be recovered in the refrigeration subsystem, and the total equivalent power output of the improved system is 17. 6 % {{higher than that of}} the original system.

40|$|In a {{propulsion}} system, the propellant {{flow and}} mixture ratio {{could be controlled}} either by variable area flow control valves or by passive flow control elements such as cavitating venturies. Cavitating venturies maintain constant propellant flowrate for fixed inlet conditions (pressure and temperature) and wide range of <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures,</b> thereby maintain constant, engine thrust and mixture ratio. The flowrate through the venturi reaches a constant value and becomes independent of <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> when the pressure at throat becomes equal to vapor pressure.

40|$|The typical column sets {{employed}} in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) {{suffer from the}} impossibility to fully exploit the efficiency of both dimensions simultaneously. Adding a restrictor {{at the end of}} the second dimension is a possible approach to adjust the linear velocity profile. Under these high <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions the second dimension becomes much slower while the effect on the primary column is limited. The gap in terms of optimum inlet pressures is thus reduced. A program written in Microsoft Excel (R) was used to calculate the efficiencies of the two dimensions in GC x GC at different <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures.</b> A GC x GC set-up with a restrictor {{at the end of the}} second dimension column was successfully installed. Experiments proved that this is a possible way to have a better exploitation of the columns. The chromatograms obtained for a number of applications confirm that the separations achieved at elevated <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> are more efficient than those obtained with the same column set under atmospheric outlet conditions. The price to pay is that the separations become considerably slower. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved...|$|R

Vacuum-outlet {{operation of}} a column with a gas chromatographic detector necessitates that the detector also be under vacuum. Simple modifications were made to a gas chromatograph-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) for vacuum-inlet and vacuum-outlet operation. The vacuum-inlet system was operated in the splitless mode to allow for efficient sample loading prior to operation at reduced pressures. The goal of FID operation at 100 torr or less was achieved by using oxygen in place of air and optimizing the gas flows under vacuum to maintain a stable flame at pressures as low as 46 torr. An <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> of 85 torr with optimized gas flows allowed for routine operation of the FID without solvent flame-out. It was discovered that the sensitivity is enhanced compared to atmospheric operation over a range of <b>outlet</b> <b>pressures</b> from approximately 200 to 400 torr; however, operation of the FID at the lowest possible pressures decreases the analytical sensitivity due to both the <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and the absence of}} helium makeup gas...|$|R

40|$|Lymphangions, the {{segments}} of lymphatic vessels between valves, exhibit structural characteristics {{in common with}} both ventricles and arteries. Although once viewed as passive conduits like arteries, it has become well established that lymphangions can actively pump lymph against an axial pressure gradient from low-pressure tissues to the great veins of the neck. A recently reported mathematical model, based on fundamental principles, predicted that lymphangions can transition from pump to conduit behavior when <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below inlet pressure. In this case, the axial pressure gradient becomes {{the major source of}} energy for the propulsion of lymph, despite the presence of cyclical contraction. In fact, flow is augmented when cyclical contractions are abolished. We therefore used an in vitro preparation to confirm these findings and to test the hypothesis that lymphangion contraction inhibits flow when <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below inlet pressure. Bovine postnodal mesenteric lymphatic vessels harvested from an abattoir were subjected to an inlet pressure of 5. 0 cmH 2 O and an <b>outlet</b> <b>pressure</b> that decreased from 6. 5 to 3. 5 cmH 2 O under control conditions, stimulated with U- 46619 (a thromboxane analog) and relaxed with calcium-free solution.

In this case, the slopes of the flow versus axial pressure gradient increased with calcium-free conditions (61 %, n = 8, P = 0. 016) and decreased with U- 46619 stimulation (21 %, n = 5, P = 0. 033).
