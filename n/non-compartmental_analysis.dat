40|$|BACKGROUND: Malaria in {{pregnancy}} {{increases the risk}} of maternal anemia, abortion and low birth weight. Approximately 85. 3 million pregnancies occur annually in areas with Plasmodium falciparum transmission. Pregnancy has been reported to alter the pharmacokinetic properties of many anti-malarial drugs. Reduced drug exposure {{increases the risk of}} treatment failure. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the population pharmacokinetic properties of artemether and its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin in pregnant women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Uganda. METHODS: Twenty-one women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy received the fixed oral combination of 80 mg artemether and 480 mg lumefantrine twice daily for three days. Artemether and dihydroartemisinin plasma concentrations after the last dose administration were quantified using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectroscopy. A simultaneous drug-metabolite population pharmacokinetic model for artemether and dihydroartemisinin was developed taking into account different disposition, absorption, error and covariate models. A separate modeling approach and a <b>non-compartmental</b> <b>analysis</b> (NCA) were also performed to enable a comparison with literature values and different modeling strategies. RESULTS: The treatment was well tolerated and there were no cases of recurrent malaria. A flexible absorption model with sequential zero-order and transit-compartment absorption followed by a simultaneous one-compartment disposition model for both artemether and dihydroartemisinin provided the best fit to the data. Artemether and dihydroartemisinin exposure was lower than that reported in non-pregnant populations. An approximately four-fold higher apparent volume of distribution for dihydroartemisinin was obtained by <b>non-compartmental</b> <b>analysis</b> and separate modeling compared to that from simultaneous modeling of the drug and metabolite. This highlights a potential pitfall when analyzing drug/metabolite data with traditional approaches. CONCLUSION: The population pharmacokinetic properties of artemether and dihydroartemisinin, in pregnant women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Uganda, were described satisfactorily by a simultaneous drug-metabolite model without covariates. Concentrations of artemether and its metabolite dihydroartemisinin were relatively low {{in pregnancy}} compared to literature data.

As intravenous drug use is a common risk factor for HIV, this study evaluated the effect of DTG on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of methadone. MethodsThis was an open-label, 2 -period study in adult, opioid-dependent, HIV-seronegative subjects. Subjects received their current individual methadone doses once daily for 3 days (Period 1) followed by DTG 50 mg twice daily (BID) for 5 days while continuing their stable methadone therapy (Period 2). Serial PK samples for R- and S-methadone were collected after each Period. Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures and safety assessments were obtained throughout the study. <b>Non-compartmental</b> PK <b>analysis</b> was performed, and geometric least-squares mean ratios and 90 % confidence intervals were generated. ResultsPlasma exposures of total, R-, and S-methadone were not affected by co-administration of DTG. Mean ratios for AUC were 0. 98, 0. 95, and 1. 01 for total, R-, and S-methadone, respectively, alone compared with in combination with DTG. No statistically significant differences were noted between the 2 treatment periods in methadone PD measures. The combination of DTG and methadone was well tolerated.

A significant dose-independent down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 12 p 70, IL- 8, IL- 6, IL- 10 and TNF was observed 24 h after oral administration. The results of <b>non-compartmental</b> pharmacokinetic <b>analysis</b> revealed that a Cmax of (0. 6570. 41 ng/ml) was reached at 32 min with the 0. 07 mg lozenges, (1. 0070. 21 ng/ml) at 25 min with the 0. 21 mg lozenges and (8. 8875. 89 ng/ml) at 19 with the 0. 9 mg lozenges.

Its anti-parasitic activity resides primarily in the (R) -enantiomer. Hitherto neither the molecular target nor the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship have been fully elucidated. Here we investigated the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of PZQ in the Schistosoma mansoni mouse model to determine the key factors that drive its efficacy. Dose-response studies with racemic PZQ with or without addition of an irreversible pan-cytochrome P 450 (CYP) inhibitor, 1 -aminobenzotriazole (ABT), were performed. In addition, efficacy of PZQ {{in the presence of the}} CYP inducer, dexamethasone (DEX), was determined. Plasma samples were obtained by tail vein bleeding at 4 time points. The (R) -PZQ levels were determined using a LC-MS/MS method. <b>Non-compartmental</b> pharmacokinetic <b>analysis</b> was performed using PKsolver. In addition, experiments using an enhanced in vitro assay were conducted. We found that the use of ABT increased (R) -PZQ plasma exposures in the systemic circulation by ~ 10 to 20 fold but the latter were not predictive of efficacy. The use of DEX decreased plasma exposures of (R) -PZQ in the systemic circulation by ~ 10 fold without reducing efficacy. We extrapolated the (R) -PZQ concentrations in mouse portal vein / mesenteric veins from the systemic exposures and found that a free exposure of (R) -PZQ of ~ 20 μM*h in the portal vein was needed to obtain a worm burden reduction > 60 %. It is suggested that the high (R) -PZQ concentrations available before the hepatic first pass metabolism drive the efficacy against S. mansoni adult worms residing in the mesenteric veins. It is then possible that the current dosing regimen of 40 mg/kg in preventive chemotherapy programs may provide suboptimal concentrations in low-weight patients such as children, due to smaller total amounts of drug administered, and may consequently result in lower cure rates...|$|R

The comorbidity with HIV {{and the rise}} of multidrug-resistant TB strains impede successful therapy through drug-drug interactions and the lack of efficient second-line treatments. The aim of this thesis was to support the improvement of anti-TB therapy through development of pharmacometric models, specifically focusing on the novel drug bedaquiline, pharmacokinetic interactions and methods for pooled population analyses. A population pharmacokinetic model of bedaquiline and its metabolite M 2, linked to semi-mechanistic models of body weight and albumin concentrations, was developed and used for exposure-response analysis. Treatment response was quantified by measurements of mycobacterial load and early bedaquiline exposure was found to significantly impact the half-life of bacterial clearance. The analysis represents the first successful characterization of a concentration-effect relationship for bedaquiline. Single-dose Phase I studies investigating potential interactions between bedaquiline and efavirenz, nevirapine, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, rifampicin and rifapentine were analyzed with a model-based approach. Substantial effects were detected in several cases and dose-adjustments mitigating the impact were suggested after simulations. The interaction effects of nevirapine and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir were also confirmed in patients with multidrug-resistant TB on long-term treatment combining the antiretrovirals and bedaquiline. Furthermore, the outcomes from model-based analysis were compared to results from conventional <b>non-compartmental</b> <b>analysis</b> in a simulation study. <b>Non-compartmental</b> <b>analysis</b> was found to consistently underpredict the interaction effect when most of the concentration-time profile was not observed, as commonly is the case for compounds with very long terminal half-life such as bedaquiline. To facilitate pooled analyses of individual patient data from multiple sources a structured development procedure was outlined and a fast diagnostic tool for extensions of the stochastic model components was developed. Pooled analyses of nevirapine and rifabutin pharmacokinetics were performed; the latter generating comprehensive dosing recommendations for combined administration of rifabutin and antiretroviral protease inhibitors. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates the usefulness of pharmacometric techniques to improve treatment of TB and especially contributes evidence to inform optimized dosing regimens of new and old anti-TB drugs in various clinical contexts...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the various}} forms of TB, tuberculous {{meningitis}} (TBM) is the most severe, with about 30 % mortality and 50 % of survivors left with neurological sequelae. Children suffer more frequently from TBM than adults and outcomes are often poor due to difficulties in making the diagnosis and uncertainty regarding the best anti-tuberculosis drug regimen. The aim of this prospective study was to describe the pharmacokinetics of pyrazinamide, isoniazid and rifampicin in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of children with tuberculous meningitis treated with the standard TBM regimen. We performed a prospective observational study of 100 consecutively treated children (≤ 15 years of age) with tuberculous meningitis in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Children were treated according to the 2006 WHO recommended pediatric treatment regimen consisting of isoniazid (5 mg/kg), rifampicin (10 mg/kg) and ethambutol (15 mg/kg) for 8 months, with the addition of pyrazinamide (25 mg/kg) for the first 3 months and streptomycin (15 mg/kg) for the first 2 months. Pyrazinamide, isoniazid and rifampicin concentrations were measured in plasma at day 14 and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at 1 month by HPLC-UV. A naïve-pooled <b>non-compartmental</b> data <b>analysis</b> was used to describe the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs in the two-age groups of children[*]≤[*] 4 years or[*]>[*] 4 years of age. Results: Younger children, when compared to older children, presented a higher body weight-normalized clearance and volume of distribution, and lower median total plasma exposures for the three studied drugs with − 14 %, − 22 % and − 16 % for Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid and Rifampicin, respectively. In CSF, individual concentrations of isoniazid and pyrazinamide were comparable to that in plasma in both age groups; but rifampicin concentrations were lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration of susceptible bacteria in all but two children. Conclusions: There is an age-dependent variation in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics of rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide. The safety and efficacy of higher doses of rifampicin should be investigated for the treatment of childhood tuberculous meningitis. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM) and oral (PO) FM PK in mature swine. Appropriate pain management for lameness in swine is a critical control point for veterinarians and producers, but science-based guidance on optimal housing, management and treatment of lameness is deficient. Six mature swine (121 – 168 kg) were administered an IV, IM, or PO dose of flunixin meglumine at a target dose of 2. 2 mg/kg in a cross-over design with a 10 day washout period between treatments. Plasma samples collected up to 48 hours post-administration were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) followed by <b>non-compartmental</b> pharmacokinetic <b>analysis.</b> No adverse effects were observed with flunixin meglumine administration for all routes. Flunixin meglumine was administered at an actual mean dose of 2. 21 mg/kg (range: 2. 05 - 2. 48 mg/kg) IV, IM and PO. A mean peak plasma concentration (CMAX) for IM and PO administration was 3748 ng/ml (range: 2749 – 6004 ng/ml) and 946 ng/ml (range: 554 – 1593 ng/ml), respectively. TMAX was recorded at 1. 00 hour (range: 0. 50 - 2. 00 hours) and 0. 61 hours (range: 0. 17 - 2. 00 hours) after PO and IM administration. Half-life (T ½ λz) for IV, IM and PO administration was 6. 29 hours (range: 4. 84 - 8. 34 hours), 7. 49 hours (range: 5. 55 - 12. 98 hours) and 7. 08 hours (range: 5. 29 - 9. 15 hours) respectively. In comparison, bioavailability (F) for PO administration was 22 % (range: 11 - 44 %) compared to IM F at 76 % (range: 54 - 92 %). The results of the present study suggest that FM oral administration is not the most effective administration route for mature swine when compared to IV and IM. Lower F and Cmax of PO-FM in comparison to IM-FM suggest that PO-FM is less likely to be an effective therapeutic administration route...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria in {{pregnancy}} {{increases the risk}} of maternal anemia, abortion and low birth weight. Approximately 85. 3 million pregnancies occur annually in areas with Plasmodium falciparum transmission. Pregnancy has been reported to alter the pharmacokinetic properties of many anti-malarial drugs. Reduced drug exposure {{increases the risk of}} treatment failure. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the population pharmacokinetic properties of artemether and its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin in pregnant women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Uganda. Methods Twenty-one women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy received the fixed oral combination of 80 mg artemether and 480 mg lumefantrine twice daily for three days. Artemether and dihydroartemisinin plasma concentrations after the last dose administration were quantified using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass-spectroscopy. A simultaneous drug-metabolite population pharmacokinetic model for artemether and dihydroartemisinin was developed taking into account different disposition, absorption, error and covariate models. A separate modeling approach and a <b>non-compartmental</b> <b>analysis</b> (NCA) were also performed to enable a comparison with literature values and different modeling strategies. Results The treatment was well tolerated and there were no cases of recurrent malaria. A flexible absorption model with sequential zero-order and transit-compartment absorption followed by a simultaneous one-compartment disposition model for both artemether and dihydroartemisinin provided the best fit to the data. Artemether and dihydroartemisinin exposure was lower than that reported in non-pregnant populations. An approximately four-fold higher apparent volume of distribution for dihydroartemisinin was obtained by <b>non-compartmental</b> <b>analysis</b> and separate modeling compared to that from simultaneous modeling of the drug and metabolite. This highlights a potential pitfall when analyzing drug/metabolite data with traditional approaches. Conclusion The population pharmacokinetic properties of artemether and dihydroartemisinin, in pregnant women with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Uganda, were described satisfactorily by a simultaneous drug-metabolite model without covariates. Concentrations of artemether and its metabolite dihydroartemisinin were relatively low {{in pregnancy}} compared to literature data. However, this should be interpreted with caution considered the limited literature available. Further studies in larger series are urgently needed for this vulnerable group. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{suitability}} of beagle dog as an animal model {{for the evaluation of}} formulations in bioavailability and bioequivalence studies. Methods: A generic cetirizine 10 mg tablet formulation was compared with another reference formulation using beagle dog as animal model. A crossover oral comparative bioavailability study was conducted on cetirizine tablet 10 mg in healthy, male dogs under fasting conditions. The formulations were administered orally with the aid of water. Serial blood samples were collected from pre-dose to 48. 0 h post-dose and plasma concentrations of cetirizine were determined using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analytical method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using <b>non-compartmental</b> <b>analysis</b> while bioavailability was assessed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model for humans and dogs. Results: Cetirizine plasma concentrations in dog were comparatively higher, in relation to human plasma concentrations, due to the smaller blood volume in former. There was a delay in time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) in dog. Cetirizine formulations were found to be bioequivalent in either of the species (dog and human).

40|$|Abstract Background In many malaria-endemic countries, {{increasing}} resistance {{may soon}} compromise {{the efficacy of}} sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for intermittent preventative treatment (IPT) of malaria in pregnancy. Artemisinin-based IPT regimens represent a promising potential alternative to SP. Pharmacokinetic and safety data supporting the use of artemisinin derivatives in pregnancy are urgently needed. Methods Subjects included pregnant women with asymptomatic falciparum parasitaemia between 22 - 26 weeks (n = 13) or 32 - 36 weeks gestation (n = 13), the same women at three months postpartum, and 25 non-pregnant parasitaemic controls. All subjects received 200 mg orally administered AS. Plasma total and free levels of AS and its active metabolite DHA were determined using a validated LC-MS method. <b>Non-compartmental</b> pharmacokinetic <b>analysis</b> was performed using standard methods. Results All pregnant women delivered live babies. The median birth weight was 3025 grams [range 2130, 3620]; 2 of 26 babies had birth weights less than 2500 grams. Rates of parasite clearance by 12 hours post-dose were high and comparable among the groups. Rapid elimination of AS was observed in all three groups. The 90 % CI for the pregnancy:postpartum ratio of geometric means for total and free AUC fell within the pre-specified 0. 66 - 1. 50 therapeutic equivalence interval. However, more pronounced pharmacokinetic differences were observed between the pregnancy and control subjects, with the 90 % CI for the pregnancy:control ratio of geometric means for both total 0. 68 (90 % CI 0. 57 - 0. 81) and free AUC 0. 78 (90 % CI 0. 63 - 0. 95) not fully contained within the 0. 66 - 1. 50 interval. All subjects cleared parasites rapidly, {{and there was no}} difference in the percentage of women who were parasitaemic 12 hours after dosing. Conclusions A single dose of orally administered AS was found to be both effective and without adverse effects in this study of second and third trimester pregnant women in the DRC. Although DHA AUC during pregnancy and postpartum were similar, the AUC for the pregnant group was less than the non-pregnant controls. The findings of this study suggest that additional studies on the pharmacokinetics of AS in pregnant women are needed. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 0053838...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background South American {{camelids}} in the United States have rapidly {{developed into}} an important agricultural industry {{in need of}} veterinary services. Pain management is challenging in camelids {{because there are no}} drugs currently approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for use in these species. Dosage regimens used for many therapeutic drugs have been extrapolated from other ruminants; however, the pharmacokinetics, in camelids, may differ from those of other species. Studies investigating the pharmacokinetics of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in camelids are deficient in the published literature. Six adult llamas (121 - 168 [*]kg) were administered either a 1 [*]mg/kg dose of oral or a 0. 5 [*]mg/kg dose of IV meloxicam in a randomized cross-over design with an 11 [*]day washout period between treatments. Plasma samples collected up to 96 hours post-administration were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS) followed by <b>non-compartmental</b> pharmacokinetic <b>analysis.</b> Results A mean peak plasma concentration (C MAX) of 1. 314 [*]μg/mL (Range: 0. 826 – 1. 776 [*]μg/mL) was recorded at 21. 4 hours (Range: 12. 0 – 24. 0 hours) with a half-life (T ½ λ z) of 22. 7 hours (Range: 18. 0 – 30. 8 hours) after oral meloxicam administration. In comparison, a half-life (T ½ λ z) of 17. 4 hours (Range: 16. 2 – 20. 7 hours) was demonstrated with IV meloxicam administration. The oral bioavailability (F) of meloxicam (dose normalized) was 76 % (Range: 48 – 92 %). No adverse effects associated with either treatment modality were observed in the llamas. Conclusions The mean bioavailability (F) of oral meloxicam was 76 % indicating a high degree of gastrointestinal absorption. Plasma meloxicam concentrations > 0. 2 [*]μg/mL were maintained for up to 72 [*]h after oral administration; > 0. 2 [*]μg/mL is considered to be the concentration of meloxicam required for analgesic effects in other species such as the horse. These data suggest that a single dosage of oral meloxicam at 1 [*]mg/kg could potentially maintain therapeutic concentrations in plasma for up to 3 [*]days in adult llamas. </p...|$|R
40|$|In silico {{approaches}} to predict absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of new drug candidates are gaining a relevant importance in drug discovery programmes. When considering particularly the pharmacokinetics {{during the development}} of oral antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), {{one of the most}} prominent goals is designing compounds with good bioavailability and brain penetration. Thus, it is expected that in silico models able to predict these features may be applied during the early stages of AEDs discovery. The present investigation was mainly carried out in order to generate in vivo pharmacokinetic data that can be utilized for development and validation of in silico models. For this purpose, a single dose of each compound (1. 4 mmol/kg) was orally administered to male CD- 1 mice. After quantifying the parent compound and main metabolites in plasma and brain up to 12 h post-dosing, a <b>non-compartmental</b> pharmacokinetic <b>analysis</b> was performed and the corresponding brain/plasma ratios were calculated. Moreover the plasma protein binding was estimated in vitro applying the ultrafiltration procedure. The present in vivo pharmacokinetic characterization of the test compounds and corresponding metabolites demonstrated that the metabolism extensively compromised the in vivo activity of CBZ derivatives and their toxicity. Furthermore, it was clearly evidenced that the time to reach maximum peak concentration, bioavailability (given by the area under the curve) and metabolic stability (given by the AUC 0 – 12 h ratio of the parent compound and total systemic drug) influenced the in vivo pharmacological activities and must be considered as primary parameters to be investigated. All the test compounds presented brain/plasma ratios lower than 1. 0, suggesting that the blood–brain barrier restricts drug entry into the brain. In agreement with in vitro studies already performed within our research group, CBZ, CBZ- 10, 11 -epoxide and oxcarbazepine exhibited the highest brain/plasma ratios (> 0. 50), followed by eslicarbazepine, R-licarbazepine, trans-diol and BIA 2 - 024 (ratios within 0. 05 – 0. 50). BIA 2 - 265 was not found in the biophase, probably due to its high plasma-protein bound fraction (> 90 %) herein revealed for the first time. The comparative in vivo pharmacokinetic data obtained in the present work might be usefully applied in the context of discovery of new antiepileptic drugs that are derivatives of CBZ...|$|R
