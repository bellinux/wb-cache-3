40|$|Abstract—Conjugately characteristic-impedance {{transmission}} lines (CCITLs) implemented by lossless periodic transmission-line struc-tures have found various applications in microwave technology, and the T-chart {{was developed to}} perform the analysis and design of CC-ITLs effectively. Originally, the normalization factor used in defin-ing <b>normalized</b> <b>impedances</b> of the T-chart is the geometric mean of characteristic impedances of CCITLs, which is not only one possible choice. By using other normalization factors based on characteristic impedances, different graphical representations can be obtained; i. e., T-charts for CCITLs with passive characteristic impedances are not unique, and {{it depends on the}} associated normalization factor. In this study, three more possible normalization factors related to char-acteristic impedances of CCITLs are investigated. It is found that all T-charts for each normalization factor are strongly dependent on the argument of characteristic impedances of CCITLs in a complicated fashion. The original T-chart based on the geometric mean of char-acteristic impedances is found to be the most convenient graphical representation for solving CCITL problems...|$|R

40|$|An {{eddy current}} method {{allowing}} {{the determination of}} parameters of a thin nonmagnetic conductive coating on a ferromagnetic conductive substrate is reported. At a single operating frequency, two independent quantities can be determined: a permeability-to-conductivity ratio of the substrate and a thickness-conductivity product of the coating. Thus, thickness or conductivity of the coating can be determined independent of variations of the substrate magnetic and electrical parameters. A simple theoretical formula for the <b>normalized</b> electrical <b>impedance</b> of the test coil is obtained using asymptotic expansions of Bessel functions. The method {{was applied to the}} evaluation of electrogalvanized wires in the frequency range 100 kHz- 1 MHz. A set of low carbon steel wires with diameter around 2. 2 mm, coated with zinc layers having thicknesses in the range 2. 7 - 64. 6 mu m, was investigated using two long coils. Experimental data of the electrical impedance were compared to those predicted. Agreement between theory and experiment is excellent for coatings thicker than 12 mu m. Despite discrepancies between theory and experiment for very thin layers arising from various imperfections of the coating and interfaces, the method was applied successfully in the thickness range below 12 mu m. To do this, two parameters: an apparent conductivity of the coating and a thickness offset, were introduced. The mathematical inversion of the experimental data with the two-variable Newton-Raphson method and the asymptotic formula is extremely fast. The technique developed has an extremely low sensitivity to variations of the ferromagnetic substrate conductivity and magnetic permeability. A magnetizing field of 0 - 23 000 A/m, producing large variations in the substrate magnetic permeability, does not significantly influence results of the coating thickness determination. The agreement between measured thickness and that obtained by a chemical method is excellent, typically within 0. 5 mu m.

40|$|The hybrid Finite Element Method(FEM) /Method of Moments(MoM) {{technique}} has become popular {{over the last}} few years due to its flexibility to handle arbitrarily shaped objects with complex materials. One of the disadvantages of this technique, however, is the computational cost involved in obtaining solutions over a frequency range as computations are repeated for each frequency. In this paper, the application of Model Based Parameter Estimation (MBPE) method[1] with the hybrid FEM/MoM technique is presented for fast computation of frequency response of cavity-backed apertures[2, 3]. In MBPE, the electric field is expanded in a rational function of two polynomials. The coefficients of the rational function are obtained using the frequency-derivatives of the integro-differential equation formed by the hybrid FEM/MoM technique. Using the rational function approximation, the electric field is calculated at different frequencies from which the frequency response is obtained. In figure 1, the frequency response for the RCS of a rectangular cavity in an infinite ground plane is presented. Numerical data obtained from MBPE calculations agree well with the values computed at each frequency over the frequency range. The MBPE method required 380 secs of CPU time to calculate the frequency response, whereas the calculations performed at 13 individual frequency points required 2, 400 secs of CPU time. In figure 2, the <b>normalized</b> input <b>impedance</b> of a cavity-backed circular microstrip patch antenna is presented. For this case, MBPE required 913 secs of CPU time to calculate the frequency response, whereas the calculations at 15 frequency points required around 6, 375 secs of CPU time. MBPE is clearly found to be superior in terms of CPU time to obtain the frequency response of cavity-backed apertures. More numerical examples and a discussion on limitations of the MBPE method will be presented at the meeting. References: [1] G. J. Burke, E. K. Miller, S. Chakrabarthi and K.
