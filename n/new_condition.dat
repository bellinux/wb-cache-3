In a number of communities, such as the Chontals in Tabasco, masks are {{generally}} kept in the local church when not in use. At {{the other end of}} the spectrum, the masking, wearing and destruction of a mask is part of Holy Week rituals among the Cora, Yaqui and Mayo. The Cora destroy their paper mache masks by immersing them in a local river while the Yaqui and Mayo burn them. In both cases, it is an act of purification.|$|E
