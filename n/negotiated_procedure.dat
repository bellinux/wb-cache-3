In 2000, the European Commission published an [...] "interpretative communication on concessions under Community law", and in 2004 it published a [...] "Green Paper on public-private partnerships and Community law on public contracts and concessions", which takes stock of existing practices from the perspective of European law and is intended to launch a debate on whether a specific legal framework should be drawn up at the European level.The competitive dialogue was created with the aim of making the award of public-private partnerships easier, since before its creation, a Contracting Authority faced the choice of the restricted procedure, which is often too inflexible for such contracts, or the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure,</b> which is intended to be an exceptional procedure with specific legal justifications. Its use so far in the EU, has, however, been uneven. Up to June 2009, more than 80% of the award procedures using competitive dialogue have been launched in two EU Member States i.e. France and the United Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|The core of diploma thesis lies in {{analysis}} of public procurement procedure of which defining features {{in all the}} world public procurement systems are elimination of competition and constraints to the transparency, which opens up the scope especially for disguised breaches of law, discrimination of suppliers and corruption - <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without notice. Existence of <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without notice is not overseen in the Czech legal environment. Frequency of its use currently amounts to significant 20 per cent of all awarded contracts. This procurement procedure has been traditionally justified in all procurement systems by specific circumstances, which from its nature either eliminate competition, or there is another public interest, which outweigh free competition. Thus balancing of such interests tends to be the major problem when assessing permission to use this non-transparent procedure. <b>Negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without notice has already occurred in the Czech law in the first legal act, which governed public procurement.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a theoretical model {{based primarily on}} transaction costs, for comparing the various tendering mechanisms used for transportation Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. In particular, the model contrasts negotiated procedures with the open procedure, {{as defined by the}} current European Union legislation on public tendering. The model includes both ex ante transaction costs (borne during the tendering stage) and ex post transaction costs (such as enforcement costs, re-negotiation costs, and costs arising from litigation between partners), explaining the trade-off between them. Generally speaking, it is assumed that the open procedure implies lower transaction costs ex ante, while the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> reduces the probability of the appearance of new contingencies not foreseen in the contract, hence diminishing the expected value of transaction costs ex post. Therefore, the balance between ex ante and ex post transaction costs is the main criterion for deciding whether the open or <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> would be optimal. Notwithstanding, empirical evidence currently exists only on ex ante transaction costs in transportation infrastructure projects. This evidence has shown a relevant difference between the two procedures as far as ex ante costs are concerned, favouring the open procedure. The model developed in this paper also demonstrates that a larger degree of complexity in a contract does not unequivocally favour the use of a <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure.</b> Only in those cases dealing with very innovative projects, where important dimensions {{of the quality of the}} asset or service are not verifiable, may we observe an advantage in favour of the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure.</b> The bottom line is that we find it difficult to justify the employment of negotiated procedures in most transportation PPP contracts, especially in the field of roads. Nevertheless, the field remains open for future empirical work and research on the levels of transaction costs borne ex post in PPP contracts, as well as on the probabilities of such costs appearing under any of the procurement procedures...|$|E

40|$|The <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without {{publication}} of a contract notice is a special procedure for awarding public procurement contracts which departs from the obligation imposed on contracting authorities of respecting the freedoms of the internal market and rules of competition. The procedure may be applied in exceptional situations of extreme urgency resulting from an event {{which could not be}} foreseen. The current judicature of the Court of Justice of the EU provides interpretations of the legal basis for application of the procedure in specific cases. However, it does not address the issue of whether it is possible to regard improper performance of contractual obligations as unpredictable. It does not provide broader considerations concerning the form of regulations on the procedure of awarding public interest contracts either. These issues were subject to analysis in one of the resolutions of the National Appeal Chamber (KIO) – the Polish authority issuing decisions in matters related to public procurement contracts. In resolution KIO/KD 58 / 10 of 6 August 2010, KIO assessed the correctness of the application of the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> for changing the contractor of the Municipal Stadium in Wrocław {{in the run-up to the}} 2012 European Football Championships. KIO found that the significant delay in construction of the facility was unpredictably exceptional, and significantly threatened the timeliness of commissioning the facility, which resulted in termination of the agreement by the contracting authority. The resolution also included an assessment allowing for the position that such a situation was exceptional due to the scale of the threat to the public interest, including the commercial interest of the contracting authority, stemming from a lack of immediate performance of the contract if it resulted in disproportionate consequences for a specific community. The issue of acceptance of such an interpretation by EU institutions remains unresolved...|$|E

40|$|The European public {{procurement}} regulation {{has been described}} as a restrictive force on PPP projects, especially in countries which employ a strict interpretation of the directives. One major limitation brought forward has been the restrictions on negotiations during the procurement procedure. In the literature it has been suggested that the negotiation would improve PPP performance because it allows for a clarification of the contract and enables alignment of the parties’ goals. Two propositions are used to examine if the regulations are a hindrance to PPP performance by comparing the current doctrine and European case law on {{public procurement}} to those two propositions. The perspectives are the regulation of the different procedures available in the directives: competitive dialogue, the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure,</b> and the open and restricted procedures and the possibility of early involvement before the formal procedure has begun. The conclusion is that, while the directives limit the procuring authorities’ abilities to exchange information and negotiate provisions, the information which need to be transferred, and negotiations which needs to be conducted, can in most cases be carried out within the current procurement framework. Thus, the public procurement legislation does not present any substantial limitations on PPP performance...|$|E

First, there is leeway for the complementary models of settlements, the first oriented mainly to increasing the likelihood of detection, and the second oriented to saving social costs of litigation. Second, the concern with the preservation of the demand for leniency agreements led the competition authority to restrict the use of settlements, which are effectively designed for the defendants that are likely guilty and give higher value to finality. The recent experience illustrates that the current settlement policy has not caused any adverse effect on leniency agreements, while reducing litigation costs and granting finality in some cases...|$|E

A distinction is made in the negotiating process between the proposal of technical factors by interested parties, their quantification for each party, best accomplished by an impartial review panel, and the relative weightings finally given to each technical factor, decided by negotiation. Negotiations could efficiently focus on these weightings within a spreadsheet matrix of numerical values by interested party and factor. From a hypothetical example, it seems that prior negotiation on which factors to include may be unnecessary with multiple participants: any factor not achieving general consensus will have a low weighting, and a relatively minor influence on the final allocations. ...|$|R

In practice, public procurement policy has deeply evolved since the 1980 ’s and public authorities at the European {{and national levels}} now strongly {{support the use of}} auctions.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} select {{priority}} hotspots for environment and health research in Flanders (Belgium), an open procedure was organized. Environment and health hotspots are strong polluting point sources with possible health effects for residents {{living in the}} vicinity of the hot spot. The selection procedure was part of the work of the Flemish Centre of Expertise for Environment and Health, which investigates the relation between environmental pollution and human health. The project is funded and steered by the Flemish government. Methods The involvement of other actors than merely experts is inspired by the 'analytical-deliberative' approach of the National Research Council in the United States and the extended peer community approach. These approaches stress the importance of involving different expert- and social perspectives in order to increase the knowledge base on complex issues. In the procedure used in the project a combination of expert and stakeholder input was essential. The final decision was supported by a multi-criteria analysis of expert assessment and stakeholder advice. Results The endeavour was challenging from the start because of the complicated ambition of including a diversity of actors, potential hotspots, concerns and assessment criteria, but nevertheless the procedure proved its value in both structuring and informing the decision-making process. Moreover the process gained the support of most actors participating in the process, even though the final selection could not satisfy all preferences. Conclusions Opening the research agenda exemplifies the value of inter- and transdisciplinary cooperation as well as the need for a well-structured and <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> that combines relevant factors and actors with pragmatism. The value of such a process also needs to prove itself in practice after the procedure has been completed: the tension between an ambition of openness on the one hand and a more closed attitude amongst experts on the other will continue to play a role even after closure. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show the possible ways of implementing WAN networks over ATM networks. The first part is a presentation of the various standardised network data protocols for the transfer of data on public data networks and their relation to ATM. We quickly come to the realisation that the predominant protocol is currently the TCP/IP, which is also used on the known computer network, the Internet. This is followed by an analysis of overhead information, which is added by the ATM Adaptation Layer. Of special interest in data transfer are AAL 3 / 4 and AAL 5 protocols. ATM has at the moment defined adaptive classes of services: CBR, VBR, ABR and UBR. For data transfer, class ABR will be used mainly. As we have already mentioned, the TCP/IP is at present predominant. In the third chapter, we analyse the transfer of TCP/IP packets over a pilot ATM network. Particularly painful is the realisation that the loss of a single cell during transmission (usually due to a breach of the <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure)</b> requires that we retransmit the whole packet. In spite of all its weaknesses, the TCP/IP will remain the most widespread protocol, though some correction will be necessary. Most of the findings also hold true for other protocols, like Frame Relay. The next chapter is on researching methods of allocating virtual paths in the ATM network. As long as ATM networks will be used merely for connecting LAN networks and as long as the ATM network is small in size, no problems are to be expected. The topic will gain in importance on the appearance of other larger commercial providers of ATM networks who will also provide other services, for example, speech transmission, video transmission, etc [...] Our virtual path allocation proposal is a compromise between the use of virtu [...] ...|$|E

The paper {{attempts}} {{to present the}} characteristics of the legal framework governing the public procurement of legal services in Croatia, with a particular view to the processes at the disposal of public and sector contracting authorities. The first part of the paper analyses the provisions of the new Public Procurement Act (Official Gazette 120 / 16), which apply to the public procurement of legal services in Croatia, and compares these with the legal framework effective until the end of 2016. Because both laws have been harmonised with EU directives, the paper also sets forth the most significant modifications to the public procurement of legal services at EU level. In addition, the paper investigates where the Directorate for the Public Procurement System, the Constitutional Court of Croatia, and the Croatian Bar Association stand with regard to the public procurement of legal services. The previous act governing the public procurement of legal services included the option of the so-called ‘particular procedure’. The new law does not include this option; however, it retains the option of <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedure</b> without prior publication of the contract notice. An analysis of the provisions of the two acts demonstrates that there is no difference between the two types of procedure, which indicates that public and sector contracting entities still have at their disposal the option of conducting a highly non-transparent public procurement process when it comes to legal services. The explanation provided is that these services are specific, and as such are less suited to regular public procurement processes. The second part of the paper presents the statistical analysis results regarding the public procurement of legal services in the period 2012 – 2016. The aim is to determine process transparency and concentration level in this period; i. e., the level of competition on the market for the public procurement of legal services. In 95 % of the cases, the contracting authorities decided to conduct the least transparent process. In the three years under observation a low level of competition was observed, while in two years an oligopoly was observed on the market for the public procurement of legal services...|$|E

Imposing a fine (or issuing an order, or imposing a periodic penalty payment) through a fully adversarial procedure can be characterised as formal, based on a vertical relationship between companies and competition authorities, deterrence-based, punitive, reactive and case-specific. Alternative enforcement – by contrast – entails a deviation from command-and-control style enforcement by using enforcement instruments and it can be characterised as informal, horizontal, compliance-based, restorative, preventative or efficient, or a combination of {{one or more of the}} above. This research analyses and compares the use of certain alternative enforcement instruments (<b>negotiated</b> <b>procedures,</b> markets work, individual guidance and compliance programmes) by the Dutch Autoriteit Consument en Markt, the UK Competition and Markets Authority and the French Autorité de la Concurrence. These instruments are evaluated in the light of procedural safeguards as well as requirements for instrumentality. In this evaluation, the relationship with the European level is touched upon as well. In doing this research, the author performed an extensive case analysis, as well as research internships within the first two authorities...|$|R
40|$|The work, renouncing to {{a precise}} {{definition}} of art, acknowledges {{that there are}} art objects and cultural objects, which, in this way, are relevant also in legal terms, and try to advance some reflections on the relevance of art {{in relation to the}} European discipline of public contracts and, in particular, what can be deduced from Directive 2014 / 24 / EU, which can well be understood as a sort of cultural sign that can provide insights into how art is perceived in Europe, even in political terms, in this historical phase. The paper therefore examines the use of <b>negotiated</b> <b>procedures</b> without prior publication of a contract notice, for the «creation or acquisition of a unique work of art or artistic performance», and to do so faces the problem of the object of the procurement by “contracting authorities” which deals with things or performances (works, supplies or services) relating to artistic products, by examining the needs which a public administration may have in relation to obtaining the availability of a work of art, and the different modes of this type of acquisition. Finally, the study examines the theme of «art exhibitions», trying to prove that they are autonomous objects, which are represented in the European directive under the diction «artistic performance». </p...|$|R
40|$|As {{the title}} mentions, {{this study will}} deal {{with the impact of}} {{e-commerce}} in the shipping industry. Information Technology is rapidly developing, where the Intemet and ecommerce are incorporating in every kind of businesses. One of the latest development and revolution in the shipping industry is the introduction of a new way of conducting business, e-commerce. During the end of 1999 and begirming of 2000, the industry experienced an expansion of dotcom companies, where people believed that e-commerce would revolutionise the contracting and <b>negotiating</b> <b>procedures.</b> The aim of the dissertation is to identify the impact of these dotcom companies in the maritime industry, and more specifically, to concentrate in the shipbokering sector. The reason is because several point of views were expressed, where it increased the feeling that shipbrokers would not constitute part any more in the contractual procedure between the principals, the shipowner and the charterer. Therefore, the author will mention, describe and analyse the impact of e-commerce, i. e. will try to observe if finally the integration will be a success like in other industries, or will be a failure. Moreover, he will clarify and foresee the future role of the 'middleman'. In other words, to predict, by observing this dotcom revolution, if brokers are threaten by this new development by being replaced by an online shipping website, or i f finally their services will be untouchable. i...|$|R
