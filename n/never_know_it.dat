500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E
2500|$|Hannah Montana 3 {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Heather Phares of AllMusic, {{spoke of the}} album negatively, even more than Hannah Montana 2 and [...] On the review, Phares complains that the albums have not grown since the commence of the franchise by stating: [...] "Miley Cyrus was 13 {{years old when she}} started performing as Hannah Montana, but by the time Hannah Montana 3 was released, she was nearly 17. That's a pretty big span of time in a teenager's life, but you'd <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> from listening to these songs." [...] Another point which was brought by the reviewer was that the alteration from [...] "fizzy pop" [...] to [...] "searching ballads" [...] was too sudden. She described [...] "Ice Cream Freeze (Let's Chill)" [...] as [...] "extremely similar" [...] to Cyrus's own [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] which wasn't received well by critics and others were too [...] "equally cookie-cutter". To AllMusic the nadir of the album is [...] "Just a Girl". She mentioned [...] "the only thing worse than a big star singing about how fame has damaged her is a big child star singing about how fame has damaged her." [...] Overall she said: [...] "Hannah Montana 3 seems to give fans exactly what they want, but the calculation behind this music overwhelms the fun that used to be in it." [...] Warren Truit of About.com, looked at the album also from [...] "a preteen's point of view" [...] and taking into account that the songs are not supposed to represent her real life. Truit compared [...] "It's All Right Here" [...] and [...] "He Could Be the One" [...] to Shania Twain. He said the songs were a mix of Gwen Stefani, Joan Jett and Avril Lavigne with [...] "fizzy Radio Disney pop rock". They also felt [...] "Ice Cream Freeze" [...] was just as [...] "goofy" [...] as [...] "Hoedown Throwdown". As a summary he commented: [...] "When it comes down to it, the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack is harmless, poppy fun for preteen music fans. The tunes on the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack may be a little cookie-cutter, but at least the songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods, unlike the Jonas Brothers' recent genre-jumping mishmash disaster Lines, Vines and Trying Times. Hannah Montana devotees will absolutely love the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack, and parents can actually tolerate most of the songs on the album." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly, was also on a lighter and more positive perspective on the album. He said: ...|$|E
