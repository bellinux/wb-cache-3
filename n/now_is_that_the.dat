500|$|Overmars {{was subject}} to {{transfer}} speculation in early 2002 because of his limited role in the first team, but he revealed {{he was happy to}} stay at Barcelona: [...] "My priority <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team wins. Personal issues are not important. I'm here for whatever you need me." [...] In the Champions League, he started in the semi-final first leg against Real Madrid; the team lost 2–0 and were defeated 3–1 on aggregate. In May 2002, Rexach was dismissed and replaced by Louis van Gaal, who was managing the club for a second time. Overmars was wary of the appointment beforehand, saying, [...] "Van Gaal is a good manager, but I do not know if his return would be good for Barcelona." [...] He underwent surgery on his right knee {{at the end of the}} season and was out of action for six months.|$|E

60|$|The {{teacher of}} Christianity has then to make {{known to the}} child, first the song of John Barleycorn, with the fields and seasons as witness to its eternal truth. Then, as the child's mind matures, it can learn, as {{historical}} and psychological phenomena, {{the tradition of the}} scapegoat, the Redeemer, the Atonement, the Resurrection, the Second Coming, and how, in a world saturated with this tradition, Jesus has been largely accepted as the long expected and often prophesied Redeemer, the Messiah, the Christ. It is open to the child also to accept him. If the child is built like Gladstone, he will accept Jesus as his Savior, and Peter and John the Baptist as the Savior's revealer and forerunner respectively. If he is built like Huxley, he will take the secular view, in spite of all that a pious family can do to prevent him. The important thing <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Gladstones and Huxleys should no longer waste their time irrelevantly and ridiculously wrangling about the Gadarene swine, and that they should make up their minds as to the soundness of the secular doctrines of Jesus; for it is about these that they may come to blows in our own time.|$|E
60|$|Indeed my {{innermost}} feeling, <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Return is a left-handed production. Looking {{through that}} story lately I had the material impression of sitting under {{a large and}} expensive umbrella in the loud drumming of a furious rain-shower. It was very distracting. In the general uproar one could hear every individual drop strike on the stout and distended silk. Mentally, the reading rendered me dumb {{for the remainder of}} the day, not exactly with astonishment but with a sort of dismal wonder. I don't want to talk disrespectfully of any pages of mine. Psychologically there were no doubt good reasons for my attempt; and it was worth while, if only to see of what excesses I was capable in that sort of virtuosity. In this connection I should like to confess my surprise on finding that notwithstanding all its apparatus of analysis the story consists for the most part of physical impressions; impressions of sound and sight, railway station, streets, a trotting horse, reflections in mirrors and so on, rendered as if for their own sake and combined with a sublimated description of a desirable middle class town-residence which somehow manages to produce a sinister effect. For the rest any kind word about The Return (and there have been such words said at different times) awakens in me the liveliest gratitude, for I know how much the writing of that fantasy has cost me in sheer toil, in temper and in disillusion.|$|E
6000|$|First as to her {{pastoral}} work, her warfare against sin, {{she would}} [...] {{put forth a}} strength, not indeed equal to it, but at least so much [...] less unequal than it <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> good fight would everywhere [...] be maintained, {{and she would not}} be as she now is, either hated or [...] unknown among the myriads who form the right arm of England’s [...] industry and skill.

Some unity in belief [...] is necessary to justify association in a Christian communion. Will [...] that unity in belief be promoted or impaired by the free action of [...] mind within her, subjected to order?

60|$|Another answer, and {{one very}} popular <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mussulmans were strong, because they {{believed}} what they said; and the Greeks weak, {{because they did not}} believe what they said. From this notion I shall appeal to another doctrine of the very same men who put it forth, and ask them, Can any man be strong by believing a lie? Have you not told us, nobly enough, that every lie is by its nature rotten, doomed to death, certain to prove its own impotence, and be shattered to atoms the moment you try to use it, to bring it into rude actual contact with fact, and Nature, and the eternal laws? Faith to be strong must be faith in something which is not one's self; faith in something eternal, something objective, something true, which would exist just as much though we and all the world disbelieved it. The strength of belief comes from that which is believed in; if you separate it from that, it becomes a mere self-opinion, a sensation of positiveness; and what sort of strength that will give, history will tell us in the tragedies of the Jews who opposed Titus, of the rabble who followed Walter the Penniless to the Crusades, of the Munster Anabaptists, and many another sad page of human folly. It may give the fury of idiots; not the deliberate might of valiant men. Let us pass this by, then; believing that faith can only give strength where it is faith in something true and right: and go on to another answer almost as popular as the last.|$|E
6000|$|The next {{point for}} your Lordships' {{consideration}} {{is the evidence}} which he produces to prove the falsity of a paper written by himself. Why, he himself is the sole evidence. And how does he prove it? Why, says he, [...] "The reason of my writing that letter was this: she had sent a person with me as an escort, and this person was desirous of receiving some proof {{that he had done}} his duty; and therefore I wrote a complaisant letter. I meant nothing by it. It was written merely to satisfy the mind of the man." [...] <b>Now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way in which formal and solemn letters, written upon great occasions to great people, are to be explained away? If he had said nothing but [...] "Your servant, such a one, has done his duty," [...] this explanation might pass. But you see it has another complexion. It speaks of his owing his life to her. But if you admit that it is possible (for possibilities have an unknown extent) that he wrote such a letter at such a time and for such a purpose, and that the letter he wrote was false, and that the falsity of the letter is proved by his own testimony given in an affidavit which we have also reason to believe is false, your Lordships must at the same time admit that {{it is one of the}} most complex pieces of fraud and falsehood that, I believe, ever existed in the world. But it is worse than all this. There is another letter, written some days after, which I will read to you, and which he has not pretended to say was written only to testify that a messenger had executed his commission properly.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Now,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kind {{of thing}} you want to come to everywhere? Because, if it be, and you tell me so distinctly, I think I can make several {{suggestions}} to-night, and could make more if you give me time, which would materially advance your object. The extent of our operations at present is more or less limited by the extent of coal and ironstone, but we have not yet learned to make proper use of our clay. Over the greater part of England, south of the manufacturing districts, there are magnificent beds of various kinds of useful clay; and I believe {{that it would not be}} difficult to point out modes of employing it which might enable us to turn nearly the whole of the south of England into a brickfield, as we have already turned nearly the whole of the north into a coal-pit. I say [...] "nearly" [...] the whole, because, as you are doubtless aware, there are considerable districts in the south composed of chalk renowned up to the present time for their downs and mutton. But, I think, by examining carefully into the conceivable uses of chalk, we might discover a quite feasible probability of turning all the chalk districts into a limekiln, as we turn the clay districts into a brickfield. There would then remain nothing but the mountain districts to be dealt with; but, as we have not yet ascertained all the uses of clay and chalk, still less have we ascertained those of stone; and I think, by draining the useless inlets of the Cumberland, Welsh, and Scotch lakes, and turning them, with their rivers, into navigable reservoirs and canals, there would be no difficulty in working the whole of our mountain districts as a gigantic quarry of slate and granite, from which all the rest of the world might be supplied with roofing and building stone.|$|E
