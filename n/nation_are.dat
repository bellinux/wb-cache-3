5|$|Various {{elements}} {{frame the}} opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred.

The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance and theatre representative of its culture.

The opening ceremony of the Delhi Games reportedly cost $70million, {{with much of the}} cost incurred in the artistic segment.|$|E

There is no race of people on earth that has more antipathy for the Negro race than the Indian race, and yet these people, numbering many of the best citizens of this State and <b>nation,</b> <b>are</b> to be humbled and their prejudices and passions are to be increased by having this outrage imposed upon them... If your organization would interest itself to the extent of seeing that such outrages as this are not perpetrated against our people, there would be fewer lynchings in the South than at this time...|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} World War I on the {{evolution}} of Canada’s identity is debated by historians. While there is a consensus that {{on the eve of the}} war, most English speaking Canadians had a hybrid imperial-national identity, the war's effects on Canada’s emergence as a <b>nation</b> <b>are</b> complex. The Canadian media often refers to the First World War and, in particular, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, as marking “the birth of a nation.” Some historians consider the First World War to be Canada’s “war of independence.” They argue that the war decreased the extent to which Canadians identified with the British Empire and intensified their sense of being Canadians first and British subjects second.|$|E

25|$|India {{has been}} using {{imported}} enriched uranium and are under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, but it has developed {{various aspects of the}} nuclear fuel cycle to support its reactors. Development of select technologies has been strongly affected by limited imports. Use of heavy water reactors has been particularly attractive for the nation because it allows Uranium to be burnt with little to no enrichment capabilities. India has also done a great amount of work {{in the development of a}} Thorium centred fuel cycle. While Uranium deposits in the <b>nation</b> <b>are</b> extremely limited, there are much greater reserves of Thorium and it could provide hundreds of times the energy with the same mass of fuel. The fact that Thorium can theoretically be utilised in heavy water reactors has tied the development of the two. A prototype reactor that would burn Uranium-Plutonium fuel while irradiating a Thorium blanket is under construction at the Madras/Kalpakkam Atomic Power Station.|$|E
25|$|Although {{periphery}} {{nations are}} exploited by core countries, {{there is a}} purpose to the unequal exchanges of goods. For instance, the core countries {{have an incentive to}} gain a profit and this enables the world market to further grow. At times, there is a change in the balance of trade between the periphery and core countries. This occurs when the prices of exports from periphery countries decrease at a faster rate than the exports from core nations. In this case, the governments of the periphery <b>nation</b> <b>are</b> affected in several ways. For instance, there is an increase in unemployment as well as a decrease in state income. This type of interaction is unique because the core country involved is somewhat weaker than normal. An example of this occurring is the growth of the industrial capabilities of Italy and Russia {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. This has also occurred in other periphery nations such as Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The semi-democratic {{confederation}} or Kedatuan was integrated to the Spanish Empire through pacts and treaties (c. 1569) by Miguel López de Legazpi and {{his grandson}} Juan de Salcedo. During {{the time of}} their hispanization, the principalities of the Confederation were already developed settlements with distinct social structure, culture, customs, and religion. Among the archaeological proofs of the existence of this Hiligaynon <b>nation</b> <b>are</b> the artifacts found in pre-Hispanic tombs from many parts of the island, which are now in display at Iloilo Museum. There are also recent discoveries of burial artifacts of eight-foot inhabitants of Isla de Gigantes, including extra-large Lungon (wooden coffins) and pre-Hispanic potteries. Another testimony of the antiquity of this civilization is the longest and oldest epic in the region, the Hinilawod, which must have been commonly known to the Visayans of Panay before the conquest, since its main protagonists, like Labaw Donggon, were noted in the accounts of the Islanders' beliefs by early Spanish colonizers. One of these Westerners' accounts says that the tales regarding adventures of this ancient hero of Panay were being retold during wedding celebrations in form of songs.|$|E
