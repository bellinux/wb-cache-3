40|$|With {{respect to}} {{nitrides}} being considered as potential fast reactor fuels, research is {{conducted on the}} out-of-pile thermophysical properties, sintering and fabrication processes, gas migration mechanisms, self-diffusion and point defect behaviour of actinide nitrides, their surrogate materials, and the inert matrix material ZrN. The experimental research, {{carried out in the}} framework of qualifying fuel for the European Lead Cooled Training Reactor (ELECTRA), shows that sintered ZrN and (Dy,Zr) N pellet densities are influenced by the oxygen concentration in the material. The effect is confirmed in sintered (Pu,Zr) N pellets. Oxygen concentration also plays a role in the thermophysical properties of inert matrix <b>nitride</b> <b>fuels,</b> but does not {{have an impact on the}} electrical properties of these materials. With the fuel fabrication methods applied here, clean nitride powders can be synthesized. However, the subsequent fabrication phases, including milling and solid solution formation, increases the impurity levels significantly. Research of equal importance is performed on materials free of fabrication-induced impurities, whose properties are studied by employing first-principles methods. ZrN, UN and (U,Zr) N are studied, whereas the results from ZrN are expected to be applicable for actinide nitrides as a first approximation. The migration of noble gases in ZrN, on the atomic scale, confirms the experimentally observed tendency for noble gases with higher atomic number to be retained in the fuel matrix, while the majority of He is released to the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin.</b> Materials modelling implies that self-diffusion of nitrogen and metal atoms in inert matrix <b>nitride</b> <b>fuels</b> is accelerated under irradiation, since noble gas retention reduces migration barriers which govern self-diffusion. Unlike Kr and Xe, He has the capacity to be released into the fuel matrix, after having been trapped in a vacancy. The results are expected to aid in providing an explanation to the macroscopic diffusion phenomena in <b>nitride</b> <b>fuels,</b> as the diffusion behaviour of noble gases is sparsely studied. In addition, a study on the miscibility of ZrN and UN in a narrow composition range suggests solubility, based on the negative mixing energies. The results obtained from research on inert matrix <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> underline several beneficial properties which are desirable in a fast reactor fuel.

Using the higher density <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> hardens the neutron energy spectrum and results in higher breeding ratios. The state-of-the-art high conversion light water reactor, the Resource-renewable Boiling Water Reactor (RBWR), served as the template core upon which comparative studies between <b>nitride</b> and oxide <b>fuels</b> were performed. A 1 / 3 core reactor physics model was developed for the RBWR using the stochastic transport code MCNP. The code was coupled with a lumped channel thermal-hydraulics 5 -channel model for steady-state analyses. The depletion code MCODE, which links MCNP with ORIGEN, was used for all burnup calculations. Select physics parameters were calculated and {{with the exception of}} the void coefficients, agreed with reported data. The void coefficients of the coupled core were calculated to be slightly positive using two different methods (10 % power increase and 5 % flow reduction). The standard RBWR assembly designs, which use tight lattice hexagonal fuel rod arrays, with oxide fuel were then replaced with various <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> assembly designs to determine the potential increase in breeding ratio, the potential to breed with pressurized water, and the potential to improve the critical power ratio with a wider pin pitch. Without changing the assembly geometry or discharge burnup, using <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> resulted in a breeding ratio of 1. 14. Using single-phase liquid water, the <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> RBWR assembly resulted in a conversion ratio of 1. 00. Another <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> assembly design with boiling water maintained a 1. 04 breeding ratio while increasing the pitch-to-diameter ratio from 1. 13 to 1. 20. This modification increased the hot assembly critical power ratio from 1. 22 to 1. 36, as calculated using the Liu- 2007 correlation. A high-porosity <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> is recommended for high burnup conditions, to accommodate the <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel’s</b> higher swelling and less favorable mechanical properties compared to the oxide fuel. The high porosity allows additional volume for pressure-induced densification, alleviating swelling and subsequent cladding strain. To predict the performance of high-porosity <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel,</b> fission gas and fuel behavior mechanistic models were developed for high burnup and low-temperature conditions. These models were validated with reported irradiation data and implemented, along with fuel material properties, into the steady-state fuel behavior code FRAPCON-EP. Under simulated RBWR conditions, a fuel density no more than 85 % of theoretical density is recommended to maintain satisfactory fuel performance.

40|$|Abstract During {{operation}} of a fourth generation reactor system it is necessarily not desirable to utilize an oxide fuel matrix as in light water reactor systems. One type of chemical compounds that has been suggested is <b>nitride</b> based nuclear <b>fuel.</b> <b>Nitride</b> <b>fuels</b> possess several characteristics that make them interesting for reactor operation such as high melting point, high thermal conductivity and better chemical compatibility compared to oxides with liquid metal coolants such as sodium or lead. <b>Nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> can be produced either as pure actinide <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> such as UN or as fuel where the fissile material is diluted in an inert matrix such as (Zr, Pu) N. A problem with <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> is the production process. Nitrides are not stable in air and production must thus be performed under inert atmosphere to reduce oxygen uptake in the material. Also residual oxygen and carbon content from production and processing {{is an issue that}} needs to be addressed. Spontaneous oxidation in air together with radiological safety concern regarding handling fine powders of actinide nitrides such as PuN for example provides an incitement for evaluating potential dust free processes for <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> production. Work has been performed on production of ZrN as an inert fuel matrix by the internal sol gel process and subsequent carbothermal reduction. Elemental carbon suspension sols have been produced and gelled into microspheres. Heat treatments of the produced microspheres in N 2 + 5 % H 2 gas mixture was performed during nitridation. Elemental investigation of the produced microspheres suggested an approximate composition of Zr(N 0. 7 0. 8 C 0. 2 0. 3).

It was then demonstrated {{that there is}} no solid limit for the Am introduction into oxide, metallic and <b>nitride</b> <b>fuels</b> that were loaded into sodium fast reactors. Instead, higher Am contents could be permitted if specific levels of power penalty were accepted. Transient analysis of a new Accelerator Driven System design with higher neutron source efficiency than the reference EFIT- 400 design, was also performed. Based on simulation results, the suggested ADS design was proved to survive the full set of transients, preserving 130 K margin to cladding rupture during the most limiting transient. After comparing Am transmutation performances in SFRs and the suggested ADS, it can be concluded that: 1. <b>Nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> could provide the highest Am transmutation efficiency, when loaded into SFRs; 2. One SFR loaded with <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> is sufficient to transmute Am inventory produced by more than 15 commercial LWRs within the same time period, which is three times higher than the supporting ratio reported for the suggested ADS; 3. The total fraction of ADS power in the power park is half of cases for critical reactors. QC 2012020...|$|R

A total of nine <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> was irradiated at average cladding temperatures ranging from 931 to 1015 C. The UN experiments, capsules UN- 4 and - 5, operated for 10, 480 and 10, 037 hr, respectively, {{at an average}} linear heat generation rate of 10 kW/ft. The UO 2 experiment, capsule UN- 6, operated for 8333 hr at an average linear heat generation rate of approximately 5 kW/ft. Following irradiation, the nine <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> were removed from their capsules, externally examined, {{and sent to the}} NASA Plum Brook Facility for more detailed postirradiation examination. During visual examination, it was discovered that the cladding of the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> containing dense UN in each of capsules UN- 4 and - 5 had failed, exposing the UN fuel to the NaK in which the pins were submerged and permitting the release of fission gas from the failed pins. A rough analysis of the fission gas seen in samples of the gas in the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> region indicated fission gas release-to-birth rates from these <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> in the range of. 00001...|$|R
40|$|The {{accidental}} {{reduction of}} the mass flow rate through a channel of a RBMK type nuclear reactor is expected to determine, besides other effects, {{the failure of the}} pressure tube. Due to the steam exiting with high velocity from the crack on the pressure tube, strong static pressure gradients interest the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> closest to the opening. As a result, a “suction effect” takes place which might be strong enough to break the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins</b> and to cause them to be entrained out of the pressure tube. After introducing some hypotheses about the parameters governing the steam flow throughout the tube and the geometry crack, a CFD model was developed aimed at estimating, to a first approximation, the hydrodynamic loads acting on the <b>fuel</b> <b>pins,</b> and assessing the influence of several geometric and physical parameters on the loads. In addition, a simplified structural model for the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> was used in order to estimate a range of loads which are expected to cause the failure of the pin, and a comparison was made against the hydrodynamic loads obtained through the CFD model. The result is that if the crack is large enough the loads are sufficient to cause the <b>fuel</b> <b>pin</b> collapse...|$|R
