25|$|Not {{only did}} it face its sister Mark Goodson-packaged game Classic Concentration on NBC, but the new <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> See It faced a vastly changed {{television}} market {{from the days of}} the original. Syndicated talk shows such as Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael had become popular and made games like <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> See It seem tame and quaint by comparison. Further, daytime viewership had declined greatly overall since 1975, thanks to a surge in cable and pay channels giving the viewer more choices than just the three major networks. With a greater possibility for local advertising revenue from the talk shows, numerous stations passed on the game despite the solid performance of its lead-in, Family Feud.|$|E
