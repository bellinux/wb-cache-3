5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the <b>northern</b> <b>border</b> between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of the Woods and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified {{the border between the}} United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's <b>northern</b> <b>border).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Romans erected Hadrian's Wall {{to control}} tribes {{on both sides}} of the wall so the Limes Britannicus became the <b>northern</b> <b>border</b> of the Roman Empire; {{although}} the army held the Antonine Wall in the Central Lowlands for two short periods – the last during the reign of Emperor Septimius Severus from 208 until 210.|$|E

Overlooking the pass at Sellasia were two hills, Evas and Olympus. Cleomenes positioned his brother, Eucleidas, with the allied troops and the Perioeci on Evas; he stationed himself on Olympus with 6,000 Spartan hoplites and 5,000 mercenaries.|$|E
5|$|The Red Turban Rebellion saw the {{application}} of early, arrow-firing cannon to both siege and naval warfare in the Southern area of conflict. Following the ascendancy of the Ming Dynasty, cannon were restricted at first to operations pacifying the southern border, including a resounding victory over a band of war-elephants in the 1380s. Cannon {{made their way to}} the <b>northern</b> <b>border</b> by 1414, where their noise had great effect on the Oirats, in addition to reportedly killing several hundred Mongols.|$|E

5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's <b>northern</b> <b>border</b> at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the Cameroonian Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E

5|$|Chilembwe {{also sought}} {{support for his}} {{uprising}} from the German forces in German East Africa, on Nyasaland's far <b>northern</b> <b>border,</b> hoping that a German offensive from the north combined with a native insurrection in the south might force the British out of Nyasaland permanently. On 24 January, he {{sent a letter to}} the German Governor by courier through Portuguese East Africa. The courier was intercepted and the letter was never received. During the latter stages of the East African Campaign, after the German invasion of Portuguese East Africa, the German colonial army actually helped to suppress anti-Portuguese rebellions, among the Makombe and Barue peoples, worrying that African uprisings would destabilise the colonial order.|$|E

Places and institutions are named for him, and (like many early colonists) he has several notable descendants.|$|E
5|$|Texas is in {{the south}} {{central part of the}} United States of America. Three of its borders are defined by rivers. The Rio Grande forms a natural border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south. The Red River forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north. The Sabine River forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east. The Texas Panhandle has an eastern border with Oklahoma at 100° W, a <b>northern</b> <b>border</b> with Oklahoma at 36°30' N and a western border with New Mexico at 103° W. El Paso lies on the state's western tip at 32° N and the Rio Grande.|$|E

5|$|The castles {{guarding}} the <b>northern</b> <b>border</b> were in such bad condition that the Knights easily captured those at Złotoryja, Dobrzyń and Bobrowniki, {{the capital of}} Dobrzyń Land, while German burghers invited them into Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg). Władysław {{arrived on the scene}} in late September, retook Bydgoszcz within a week, and came to terms with the Order on 8 October. During the winter, the two armies prepared for a major confrontation. Władysław installed a strategic supply depot at Płock in Masovia and had a pontoon bridge constructed and transported north down the Vistula.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{costly for}} Philip and the Macedonians, losing them a fleet {{that had taken}} three years to build as well as {{triggering}} the defection of their Greek allies, the Achean League and the Aetolian League, to the Romans. In the war's immediate aftermath the Dardani, a barbarian tribe, swarmed across the <b>northern</b> <b>border</b> of Macedon, but Philip was able to repel this attack. In 197, however, Philip was defeated in the Battle of Cynoscephalae by the Romans {{and was forced to}} surrender. This defeat cost Philip most of his territory outside Macedon and he had to pay a war indemnity of 1,000 talents of silver to the Romans.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the sixteen}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had their borders defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the <b>northern</b> <b>border</b> of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.|$|E
