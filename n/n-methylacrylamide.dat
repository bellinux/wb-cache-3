40|$|N-Hydroxymethylacrylamide, <b>N-methylacrylamide,</b> and N,N-diethylacrylamide produce {{peripheral}} neuropathy in rats. Seven other compounds related to acrylamide {{do not produce}} neuropathy. Rats given {{one of the three}} neurotoxic compounds are more susceptible to acrylamide. A regime for testing acrylamide analogues for neuro-toxicity is suggested. DDT, phenobarbitone, or high dietary concentrations of vitamin A or E have no effect on the development of acrylamide neuropathy in rats. Acrylamide produces neuropathy in hens but not in frogs or goldfish...|$|E

Nine compounds (Table), close chemical relations of acrylamide, were given to adult rats both in their diet and as repeated daily doses by mouth. Dose rates were such that with acrylamide acute poisoning and neuropathy would have resulted. Seven of the compounds were without effect. <b>N-methylacrylamide</b> and N-hydroxymethylacrylamide produced some neurotoxic effects in large doses. The presence of acrylamide as an impurity in the compound tested was not excluded...|$|E
