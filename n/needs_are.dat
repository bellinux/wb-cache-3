5|$|Australian Cattle Dogs {{have been}} {{successful}} in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship <b>needs</b> <b>are</b> met.|$|E
50|$|Nicolaisen {{described}} four distinct {{types of}} information seeking behavior: visceral, conscious, formalized and compromised.

The formalized <b>need</b> <b>is</b> the statement of the need and the compromised <b>need</b> <b>is</b> the query when related to the information system.|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{characters}} {{described as}} having special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> most frequently chosen last, indicating that special <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> an ineffective euphemism. Characters {{described as having}} special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> chosen last even more frequently than characters described as having a disability or a certain disability, suggesting that the euphemism special needs conveys more negativity than the non-euphemized term disability or the names of specific disabilities (e.g., blind). If special <b>needs</b> <b>was</b> an effective euphemism, then we would have observed that characters described as having special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> chosen last less often than characters described as having a disability or a certain disability. But, as predicted, we observed just the opposite.|$|R
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these <b>needs</b> <b>are</b> never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

The country fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in Gallipoli, Crete, El Alamein and Cassino.

5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{minerals}} in 2001. For manganese {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so <b>needs</b> <b>are</b> described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for manganese for women and men ages 19 and up are 1.8 and 2.3 mg/day, respectively. AI for pregnancy is 2.0 mg/day. AI for lactation is 2.6 μg/day. For children ages 1–18 years the AI increases with age from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/day for males, to 1.6 mg/day for females. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at 11 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) Manganese deficiency is rare.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human <b>needs</b> <b>are</b> food, energy, materials and water.|$|E
5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water <b>needs</b> <b>are</b> taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

5000|$|Dependency <b>need</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} psychological concept, encompassing {{the fields of}} psychological, evolutionary, and ethological theory. <b>Need,</b> in general, <b>is</b> a concept greatly studied in varying psychological fields, by psychologists with varying specialties. <b>Need</b> <b>is</b> particularly important {{to the area of}} personality psychology. The concept of <b>need</b> can <b>be</b> defined as a [...] "state of tension within a person", and as the <b>need</b> <b>is</b> satisfied, the state of tension is reduced. (Larsen & Buss, 2008) It is thought that all individuals have needs, and that needs organize perceptions, guiding individuals to see what they want (or need) to see (Larsen & Buss). A physical or psychological <b>need</b> <b>is</b> capable of organizing action by compelling an individual to do what is necessary in order to fulfill such a need. (Larsen & Buss, 2008) After action has been taken to fulfill the need, the need subsides until it is again desired and recurs.|$|R
