Two monofloral honey types, dark-coloured chestnut and light-coloured <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> were added to cow’s and goat’s milk before fermentation. Different mathematical and statistical models were used to describe the kinetics of fermentation in all analysed samples. The basic hypothesis of this study was that addition of honey could influence fermentation kinetics in both types of milk.

40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activity of horse chestnut <b>honey</b> and <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> at different concentrations against clinical isolates of the β- hemolytic streptococci group A (BHS-A). Honey’s active compounds have multiple therapeutic effects and it is used as traditional medicine for treatment and prevention of various illnesses. Materials and methods: The antimicrobial effects of two honeys were tested on forty-four strains of BHS-A, isolated from the throat by a modified disk diffusion method. A bacterial suspension of BHSA strains was plated onto Müller-Hinton agar with 5 % defibrinated horse blood. Using a sterile 8 mm diameter cork borer, wells were cut in the agar and into each was introduced 100 µL of the different concentrations of the honey solution (25 %v/v, 50 %v/v, 75 % v/v and 100 %v/v). A disk of penicillin was added as the positive control. The plates were incubated aerobically for 18 - 24 hours at 36 (± 1) °C and zones of inhibition were measured. Results: The average diameter of the inhibition zones of <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> (100 %v/v) was 12. 48 mm ± 1. 73 mm, for <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> (75 %v/v) it was 11. 06 mm± 1. 24 mm and for horse chestnut honey (100 %v/v) it was 11. 08 mm ± 1. 02 mm. The positive control showed the average diameter of 30. 45 mm ± 3. 21 mm. Statistical significance (p < 0. 05) was observed comparing the zone diameters of the <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> (100 %) and antibiotic penicillin, and between the horse chestnut honey (100 %) and antibiotic penicillin.

40|$|Honey is a {{good source}} of several {{important}} chemical compounds and antioxidants and is harvested throughout the year. However, no study has determined how their contents change over the years. The aim of the present research was to investigate the changes in the phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidant properties, as well as other physicochemical properties, of Malaysian <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> collected during different months during a two year period. The DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods were used to determine the total antioxidant activity of the honey samples. Generally, honey samples collected in the beginning and the middle of the year tended to have higher sugar content, which may be attributed to its high acidic nature and low moisture content. There was a gradual increase in the phenolic content of the <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> samples collected between September 2010 and December 2010. The honey sample collected {{at the beginning of the}} year (January) showed the highest color intensity and was dark amber in color. It also contained the highest concentration of phenolic compounds (341. 67 ± 2. 94 mggallic acid/kg), the highest flavonoid content (113. 06 ± 6. 18 mgcatechin/kg) andthe highest percentage of DPPH inhibition and the highest FRAP value, confirming its high antioxidant potential. There was a positive correlation between DPPH and total phenolic content, suggesting that phenolic compounds are the strongest contributing factor to the radical scavenging activity of Malaysian <b>acacia</b> <b>honeys.</b> Overall, our results indicated that there were significant seasonal variations in the antioxidant potentials of honey over the two year period and the time of honey collection affects its physicochemical properties.

40|$|The {{changes in}} total phenol and {{flavonoid}} content, {{as well as}} antioxidant activity was monitored in <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> supplemented with prunes in 20, 30 and 40 % mass concentrations. The total phenolic content increased by 2. 5 times (from 16. 18 to 41. 64 mg GAE/ 100 g) with increasing concentration of prunes in honey, while the increase in flavonoid content was even higher, approximately 11. 5 -fold (from 2. 65 to 30. 86 mg RE/ 100 g). The addition of prunes also improved the antioxidant activity of <b>acacia</b> <b>honey.</b> The honey samples with highest content of prunes, 40 %, exhibited the best antioxidant activity measured by hydroxyl radical sacvenging assay (EC 50 •OH= 4. 56 mg/ml), 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay (EC 50 DPPH= 16. 48 mg/ml), and reducing power (EC 50 RP= 81. 17 mg/ml).

40|$|Total {{flavonoid}} {{and total}} phenolic content were studied in <b>acacia</b> and multifloral <b>honey</b> for 12 months in 6 -month intervals. DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods {{were used to}} determine total antioxidant activity in honey samples during the same period of time. Samples were stored in transparent glass containers at room temperature, on shelves exposed to natural light during daytime and in the dark during nighttime. Two types of honey from four different regions in Varaždin county, Croatia, were investigated: monofloral – acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and multifloral. Of the total of 40 samples, there were 20 of each type of honey (5 from each region). The goal of this study is primarily to demonstrate the changes in the antioxidant activity of the two investigated types of honey during one year of storage, and not to make comparisons between them. According to the obtained data, the rate of decrease in the content of total flavonoids and phenolics was determined and changes in the antioxidant activity in honey samples were measured. After one year of storage, total phenolic content decreased by 91. 8 % in <b>acacia</b> <b>honey,</b> and by 88. 6 % in multifloral honey. Total flavonoid content also decreased in both types of honey, by 45. 6 % in <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> and by 43. 8 % in multifloral honey. During the same period, an increase from 12. 20 to 16. 73 mg/mL (i. e. by 37. 1 %) was recorded in the IC 50 values in multifloral <b>honey,</b> while in <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> this increase was from 44. 64 to 407. 01 mg/mL (i. e. by 811. 7 %).

40|$|Raw Millefiori honey {{is packed}} full of {{antioxidants}} Abstract Honey {{is the natural}} substance produced by honeybees, Apis mellifera, in almost every country of the world. Raw honeys are usually produced by small farms and left in their natural state without undergoing processing (e. g., filtration and heat treatment). Honey is essentially a concentrated aqueous solution of inverted sugar, but it also contains a very complex mixture of other saccharides, enzymes, amino and organic acids, polyphenols, carotenoid-like substances, Maillard reaction products, vitamins, and minerals. Among minor honey constituents, polyphenols such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, may function as natural antioxidants in our diet. In recent years, considerable interest has been focussed on dietary antioxidants in reference to their protective effect against oxidative damage. There are many studies about the polyphenol content and antioxidative effects of fruits, vegetables and beverages; in contrast, hardly any work has been reported with honey. Available literature indicates that no previous antioxidant power {{studies have been done}} on Italian honeys; thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate antioxidant activity of two representative Italian raw honeys,, i. e., Millefiori and Acacia, obtained from beekeepers belonging to the same geographical region (central Italy) as a function of their sensorial characteristics and content of total polyphenols and flavonoids. Total polyphenols, flavonoids and antioxidant power of samples from Millefiori and <b>Acacia</b> raw <b>honey</b> varieties were evaluated. Phenolic content, expressed as caffeic acid equivalents, ranged from 12. 5 to 17. 5 mg/ 100 g and from 3 to 11 mg/ 100 g in Millefiori and <b>Acacia</b> <b>honeys,</b> respectively. All Millefiori samples exhibited the highest flavonoid concentration being between 1. 23 and 2. 93 mg catechin equivalents (CE) / 100 g honey. Total flavonoids in 100 g <b>Acacia</b> <b>honeys</b> were in the range of 0. 45 – 1. 01 mg CE. <b>Acacia</b> <b>honeys</b> had lower total antioxidant power, as assessed by ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay, than Millefiori. The relationship between phenolic content and antioxidant power was discussed. These results demonstrated a strong correlation between honey colour and antioxidant power, with darker and more crystallized honeys having stronger antioxidant activity than lighter and transparent honeys [...] Comparative experimental analysis was performed with an artificial honey and processed honeys.

Of the honey samples analysed, only pine honeydew were grouped in dark category of honey (L* 50) and possessed both red and yellow components. The concentrations of mineral content were found highest in pine honeydew followed by multi floral and least in <b>acacia</b> <b>honey.</b> All the physico-chemical properties and enzymatic activity indicated that all the three analysed varieties of honey met the criteria set by the International Honey Commission and revised codex standards for honey. The source of honey {{had a significant effect}} (p< 0. 05) on physico-chemical characteristics, enzymatic activity, mineral content and colour properties. Strong and positive correlations exhibited among minerals, colour (mmpfund) and L* value indicated that dark coloured honey contained high mineral content.

This study aimed to clarify the effects of honey on acute-phase deep burn wounds. Two deep burn wounds were created on mice which were divided into four groups: no treatment, silver sulfadiazine, manuka <b>honey,</b> and Japanese <b>acacia</b> <b>honey.</b> Wound sizes were calculated as expanded wound areas and sampled 30 minutes and 1 – 4 days after wounding for histological observation. The wound sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistological staining to detect necrotic cells, apoptotic cells, neutrophils, andmacrophages. Theno treatment group formed a scar. The redness around thewound edges in the silver sulfadiazine group was the most intense. All groups exhibited increased wound areas after wounding. The proportions of necrotic cells and the numbers of neutrophils in the manuka and <b>acacia</b> <b>honey</b> groups were lower {{than those in the}} no treatment and silver sulfadiazine groups until day 3; however, {{there were no significant differences}} between all groups on day 4. These results show that honey treatment on deep burn wounds cannot prevent wound progression. Moreover, comparing our observations with those of Jackson, there are some differences between humans and animals in this regard, and the zone of hyperemia and its surrounding area fall into necrosis, which contributes to burn wound progression. 1...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that honey contains substantial antioxidant compounds that could protect cell components from the harmful action of free radicals. One can speculate that these compounds may strengthen the organism defenses and consequently prevent oxidative stress in humans. Therefore, over time, impaired cells can accumulate and lead to age-related diseases. A comparative study was carried out to assess the antioxidant activity of three varieties of honey from different botanical and geographical (Manuka honey from New Zealand, <b>Acacia</b> <b>Honey</b> from Germany and Wild carrot honey from Algeria). Manuka honey had the highest phenolic content with 899. 09 ± 11. 75 mg gallic acid/kg. A strong correlation between the antioxidant activities of honeys and their total phenol contents has been noticed. </p...|$|R
