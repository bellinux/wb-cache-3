40|$|Leather is not {{a uniform}} {{material}} from a structural perspective. The physical properties of leather change depending on the animal type and the animal individually. Furthermore these properties {{vary depending on the}} position and direction of sampling over its area. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure some physical properties of garment sheepskin leathers over the whole areas and then draw strength maps to provide information for cutting of leathers for garment production. For this aim, surface area of 10 chromium tanned <b>nappa</b> sheep <b>leathers</b> have been sampled with standard press knife of tensile strength into 2147 samples. 5 leathers were sampled perpendicular and the other 5 leathers were sampled parallel to the line of back bone of sheep skins. Thickness, tensile strength, elongation at break values for each sample has been measured and recorded. Then strength maps were drawn by using MATLAB (Matrix LABoratory) software that allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data. The findings showed that the strength and stretch properties change directionally and locational over the area of the leather, the strength decreased gradually while moving away from the line of backbone to the edges and the areas around kidneys were weaker than the areas around neck...|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the main}} options {{included}} the sunroof $2390, satellite navigation $3800, rear-seat DVD players $3900, Xenon headlights $1800, tyre pressure monitoring system $1395. Inside it features <b>Nappa</b> <b>leather</b> on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing {{the front of the}} car to go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature is also on the current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E

2500|$|With {{production}} of the Z8 completed by November 2002, for 2003 the Z8 production {{was replaced by the}} Alpina V8 Roadster. The Alpina was a departure from the hard-edged sporting focus of the original car, and elements of the new grand touring intent were evident throughout this final edition. Instead of the original six-speed manual and 4.9L (S62) engine featured in earlier Z8's, the Alpina came only as an automatic, using a five-speed BMW Steptronic transmission mated to a downgraded 4.8L Alpina-tuned V8 motor from the Alpina E39 B10 V8 S (M62). In order to complete the car's transition from sports car to boulevardier, relaxed suspension tuning was used. The standard Z8's run-flat tires on [...] wheels were discarded in favor of conventional tires with softer sidewalls, on [...] wheels. A new, softer grade of <b>Nappa</b> <b>leather</b> replaced the Z8's less supple specification, and special Alpina gauges were featured on the dash cluster. An Alpina steering wheel with three solid spokes replaced the original, which could not be retrofitted with shift paddles for the automatic. Gear selection was displayed in an Alpina-specific display mounted in front of the wheel.|$|E
