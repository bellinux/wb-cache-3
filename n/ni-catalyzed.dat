40|$|The {{performance}} of catalyst transfer polymerization (CTP) reactions which depend on catalyst association was studied on 3, 6 -dioctylthiothieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene (TT) monomers. This monomer {{was selected because}} a strong association of the catalyst is expected, since the aromaticity of thienothiophene is largely maintained when the catalyst and thienothiophene associate. This study includes both reported and unreported Ni- and Pd-catalyst systems. It is found that no polymer formation can be observed using Ni-catalysts, whereas Pd-catalysts show a similar behavior as for other monomer systems. During {{the study of the}} <b>Ni-catalyzed</b> CTPs, the π-associated Ni 0 -complex has been isolated in situ and displayed a high stability in solution. It is shown that the associated complex interferes with the polymerization reaction and even prevents polymer formation.

Ni 0 -trapping 2 does not occur during polymerization of 3 -alkylthiophene, confirming the presence of the π-associated Ni 0 -complex in this polymerization. This introduces a new convenient method of probing Ni 0 -association during all <b>Ni-catalyzed</b> reactions.
