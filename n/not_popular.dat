5|$|Lehmann's {{work was}} {{continued}} and significantly expanded by the German chemist Daniel Vorländer, who {{from the beginning}} of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{extremely}} competent administrator, there were reservations within the New Zealand government following Godley's appointment as {{commander of the}} division. Allen, although publicly supportive of Godley, privately believed an alternative commander should be found after the division completed its training. Godley was a distant and remote divisional commander, <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> with most soldiers of his command. He also favoured the professional officers of the NZEF, {{most of whom were}} seconded from the British Army, over those drawn from the Territorial Force.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the films}} were <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images in horror and popular culture.|$|E

5|$|Helen Clark (née Brinton) won {{the seat}} for Labour in 1997. She was {{defeated}} at the 2005 general election, following {{which it was}} widely reported that Clark was planning to defect to the Conservative Party, an announcement which was <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> locally. However, by early June it emerged that while {{she had left the}} Labour Party, she had not in fact joined the Conservatives and did not intend to.|$|E
5|$|Herschel's {{proposed}} {{name was}} <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> outside Britain, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jérôme Lalande proposed {{that it be}} named Herschel in honour of its discoverer. Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the name Neptune, which was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet {{in the course of}} the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even Neptune George III or Neptune Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In Prussia, {{a reform}} in 1816 defined the Prussian civil pound {{in terms of}} the Prussian foot and {{distilled}} water. It also redefined the apothecaries' pound as 12 ounces, i.e. 3/4, of the civil pound: 350.78g. This reform was <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> with apothecaries, because it broke the uniformity of the apothecaries' pound in Germany at a time when a German national state was beginning to form. It seems that many apothecaries did not follow this reduction by 2%.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{moved to}} the Detroit Red Wings, who had just won the Stanley Cup. Joseph {{initially}} was <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> with Red Wings fans but eventually found his form {{in the latter half}} of the 2002–03 season to backstop his team to the division title. Detroit was upset in the first round of the playoffs in 2003 by the eventual conference champions, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in a four straight game sweep.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and U.S. {{courts have}} {{rejected}} this objection {{on the grounds}} that science is not based on appeals to popularity, but on evidence. The scientific consensus of biologists determines what is considered acceptable science, <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> opinion or fairness, and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, it is entirely uncontroversial among experts in the field.|$|E
5|$|The Old Strathcona Foundation {{was running}} a major deficit by 1996, and in April Edmonton City Council {{declined}} to renew a $100,000 annual grant which the Foundation had received since 1985. The Foundation needed cash, and quickly sold the theatre for $450,000 to Calgary’s Brar family, owners of the Plaza Theatre in that city. The decision was <b>not</b> <b>popular,</b> and even Old Strathcona Foundation member Judy Berghofer called the sale hasty.|$|E

5|$|The Swedes were <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> in {{the regions}} that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new war going badly, insurgents saw their chance to rise up against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, {{especially}} in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An all out terror campaign would have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or sticks to the local farmers.|$|E
5|$|The {{works were}} first adapted for the American English market by Golden Books, {{a branch of}} the Western Publishing Company in the 1950s. The albums were {{translated}} from French into American English with some artwork panels blanked except for the speech balloons. This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and free mixing of races. The albums were <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> and only six were published in mixed order. The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world.|$|E
5|$|Abaqa died in 1282 and {{was briefly}} {{replaced}} {{by his brother}} Tekuder, who had converted to Islam. Tekuder reversed Abaqa's policy of seeking an alliance with the Franks, offering instead an alliance to the Mamluk Sultan Qalawun, who continued his own advance, capturing the Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, Lattakia in 1287, and the County of Tripoli in 1289. However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was <b>not</b> <b>popular,</b> and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, {{with the support of}} the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed. Arghun then revived the idea of an alliance with the West, and sent multiple envoys to Europe.|$|E

5|$|All German {{officers}} {{were required to}} obtain official permission to marry; however, this was usually a bureaucratic formality. When Lent decided to marry Elizabeth Petersen, his admirer from Hamburg whom he had met on a blind date, his case was more complicated. 'Elisabeth Petersen' was in fact Helene (Lena) Senokosnikova, born in Moscow in April 1914. She had been afraid to reveal her true identity, since Russians were <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> in the Third Reich, but after a thorough investigation into her background and racial ancestry, she received her German citizenship on 15 March 1941. They were married on 10 September 1941 in Wellingsbüttel, Hamburg. The marriage produced two daughters. Christina was born on 6 June 1942; the second, Helma, was born on 6 October 1944, shortly after her father's fatal crash.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of Lothian Buses, {{installation}} of 30 ticket machines at key bus stops began in 2007. Passengers had to purchase tickets before boarding the bus, reducing dwell times, but the machines were <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> with users and were scrapped in 2011. Consideration was given to installing similar on-street ticket machines, and new, advanced machines (capable of reading smartcards and accepting credit/debit cards) were installed in early 2014 at each tram stop. The new ticket machines are the Galexio-Plus type supplied by the French-based company Parkeon. however the option to accept banknotes or give change is not available. The minimum spend for a card transaction is £3 {{which is more than}} the cost for a single ticket.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, FES {{accounted}} for around 5 per cent of all Guinness production, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, where it was largely used as a medicinal product. Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States. Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, selling for double the price of domestic stouts. By 1912, total production had reached 105,000 hogsheads. The American trade was disrupted by the onset of World War I and then discontinued entirely with the introduction of Prohibition. The product was <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout. Following discontinuation of export during World War II, FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was not successful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> with the other astronauts.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in Pará, Brazil. This {{was part of a}} large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government. The crops grown by the Japanese were <b>not</b> <b>popular</b> with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now mostly to the children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. The cause of death was kidney disease.|$|E
