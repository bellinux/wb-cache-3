40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to find the growth rates and trend of production and yield of HYV Boro and Aman rice. Secondary data {{for the period of}} 1974 - 75 to 1999 - 2000 were used for the study. Production and yield of HYV Boro showed significant positive growth during the study period. HYV Aman production showed significant positive growth and HYV Aman yield showed insignificant negative growth during the same period. The growth rates of yield and production of HYV Boro and HYV Aman rice were also computed for the <b>nineties.</b> The growth rates of <b>nineties</b> were computed to have a comparative measure, between the two sub-periods. During the total period of 10 years in <b>nineties,</b> yield and production growth rates of HYV Boro were positive and significant. The growth rates of yield and production HYV Aman were negative and positive respectively and growth rates were statistically insignificant. The growth rates of production of HYV Boro were positive and insignificant in sub-period-I (early <b>nineties)</b> and positively significant in sub-period-II (late <b>nineties).</b> The production growth rates of HYV Aman were positive both in sub-period-I and sub-period-II. But the growth rates were statistically insignificant. Yield had negative insignificant growth in sub-period-I for HYV Boro yield of HYV Aman showed negative insignificant growth in the two periods. The growth parameters of HYV Boro were significantly different in early <b>nineties</b> and late <b>nineties</b> but in case of HYV Aman growth parameters were not significantly different between the two sub-periods of <b>nineties...</b>|$|R

40|$|Film costumbrismo has {{historically}} represented Spanish {{local and regional}} immaterial culture. This thesis focuses on Spanish film costumbrismo of the early <b>nineties</b> {{as it is a}} period of transculturalization and of internal refigurations within Spain. After all, the transculturalization that characterizes postmodernity’s cultures in a globalized world interplays in Spain in the <b>nineties</b> with the country’s renegotiation of cultural identities caused by their necessary self-redefinition after totalitarian years. Then, how is the representation of cultural customs in Spanish film costumbrismo during the early <b>nineties</b> interlinked with the anxieties for the preservation of cultural identities? Furthermore, to what extent can the representation of regional and local immaterial culture and customs in the Spanish film production of the early <b>nineties</b> be explained by postmodernist interpretations of cultural identity...|$|R
