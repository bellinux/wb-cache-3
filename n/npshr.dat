50|$|Example 2: A well or bore with an {{operating}} level of 5 metres below the intake, minus a 2 metre friction loss into pump (pipe loss), minus the <b>NPSHR</b> curve (say 2.4 metres) of the pre-designed pump = an NPSHA (available) of (negative) -9.4 metres. NOW we add the atmospheric pressure of 10 metres. We {{have a positive}} NPSHA of 0.6 metres. (minimum requirement is 0.6 metres above <b>NPSHR),</b> so the pump should lift from the well.|$|E

50|$|Beside high {{mechanical}} energy, higher cleaning {{temperatures are}} one of the most effective methods of improving the cleaning results in a parts washer. In general, a 10 to 15 °F (5 to 8 °C) rise doubles the chemical reaction of the detergent. The increased chemical reaction between the greases and oils and the detergent delivers faster cleaning cycles and cleaner parts. Additionally, all greases and oils exhibit a lower viscosity at higher temperatures. Cleaning solution temperatures of 170 F and above softens or melts most oils and greases causing them to flow like water so they are easily removed resulting in faster cleaning, better results and cleaner parts. Many parts washers are not capable of maintaining this operating temperature due to the lack of amply heating systems. Additionally, careful design is required of the pumping system so it can pull in and deliver cleaning solution at temperatures that approach boiling in the parts washer. All centrifugal pumps require a net positive suction head (<b>NPSHr)</b> in order to be able to pump solution. As the temperature of the solution approaches the <b>NPSHr,</b> the pump stops pumping because the cleaning solution flashes to steam in the pump intake. Careful design of the pump is required to minimize <b>NPSHr</b> and allow pumping of high temperature cleaning solution.|$|E
50|$|Remembering {{that the}} minimum {{requirement}} is 600 mm above the <b>NPSHR</b> therefore this pump {{will not be}} able to pump the 70 degree Celsius liquid and will cavitate and lose performance and cause damage. To work efficiently, the pump must be buried in the ground at a depth of 2.4 metres plus the required 600 mm minimum, totalling a total depth of 3 metres into the pit. (3.5 metres to be completely safe).|$|E

NOW we add the atmospheric pressure of 10 metres {{and we have}} a negative NPSHA of -2.4 metres remaining.|$|E
50|$|Example 1: A {{tank with}} a liquid level 2 metres above the pump intake, plus the {{atmospheric}} pressure of 10 metres, minus a 2 metre friction loss into the pump (say for pipe & valve loss), minus the <b>NPSHR</b> curve (say 2.5 metres) of the pre-designed pump (see the manufacturers curve) = an NPSHA (available) of 7.5 metres. (not forgetting the flow duty). This equates to 3 times the NPSH required. This pump will operate well {{so long as}} all other parameters are correct.|$|E
50|$|Vapour {{pressure}} {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature, and thus so will both <b>NPSHR</b> and NPSHA. Centrifugal pumps {{are particularly vulnerable}} especially when pumping heated solution near the vapor pressure, whereas positive displacement pumps are less affected by cavitation, as they are better able to pump two-phase flow (the mixture of gas and liquid), however, the resultant flow rate of the pump will be diminished because of the gas volumetrically displacing a disproportion of liquid. Careful design is required to pump high temperature liquids with a centrifugal pump when the liquid is near its boiling point.|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 131 <b>NPSHR</b> is a {{significant}} pump characteristic; it is often taken {{as a measure of}} minimum suction head needed to operate a pump satisfactorily. Hydraulic institute, among others, specifies a measurement of procedure for <b>NPSHR,</b> which is at the point that a reciprocating pump loses 3. 0 percent in volumetric efficiency relative to a stable efficiency at a high suction head. Although noise, vibration, or any sign of mechanical damage would be an indication of reaching the <b>NPSHR</b> limit on test, they may not be easily observed during a short term factory performance test. Also, the difference in the test system and the field installation can result in an improper correlation with the current methods for predicting suction performance. In order to better predict successful field operation, a number of additional factors need to be considered, such as: *The influence of piping system attached to the pump. *The need to avoid cavitation damage inside the pump. *The need to operate reliably, with attention to proper valve dynamics. *Changes in fluid properties between test and the installation. *An additional term is defined (NPSHF), which is intended to better predict suction performance in the field.

40|$|Lecturepg. 29 The {{relationship}} between centrifugal pump impeller diameter, specific speed, noise and NPSH required {{is presented in}} this paper. A theoretical explanation is given to explain why <b>NPSHR</b> will significantly vary with impeller diameter for some pump designs. The degree of cavitation, as indicated by <b>NPSHR,</b> will change at different flow rates. Also, a change in impeller diameter does not generally affect <b>NPSHR,</b> because cavitation occurs at the impeller inlet. Test results have proven that this assumption is not true for some high specific speed pumps. High specific speed pumps are {{more sensitive to the}} effects of variation because of relatively shorter impeller blade lengths. When trimming the impeller diameter, the impeller blade length is also reduced. In some cases, the effects of cavitation blockage inside the impeller flow path can be more pronounced, because they interface with pressure recovery. Therefore, the degree of cavitation must be reduced to ensure proper impeller hydraulic operation. Trimming the impeller diameter of some high specific speed pumps will require higher NPSH values...|$|E

High suction energy pumps above a certain threshold, with low NPSH margins, can produce severe cavitation noise, especially at reduced flowrates. Test results on an end suction pump also demonstrate the interaction between the air content in the water and cavitation noise within the pump, over varying NPSH margin ratios, flowrate, and speed (energy level). A small amount of air is shown to dramatically reduce the suction pressure pulsation levels. Further, suction pressure pulsation levels are seen to increase as the NPSH margin is reduced, until dissolved air begins to come out of solution and reverse the trend.

40|$|One in {{a series}} of tip sheets to help {{manufacturers}} optimize their industrial pumping systems. As a result of conservative engineering practices, pumps are often substantially larger than they need to be for an industrial plant's process requirements. Centrifugal pumps can often be oversized because of ''rounding up'', trying to accommodate gradual increases in pipe surface roughness and flow resistance over time, or anticipating future plant capacity expansions. In addition, the plant's pumping requirements might not have been clearly defined during the design phase. Because of this conservative approach, pumps can have operating points completely different from their design points. The pump head is often less than expected, while the flow rate is greater. This can cause cavitation and waste energy as the flow rate typically must be regulated with bypass or throttle control. Oversized and throttled pumps that produce excess pressure are excellent candidates for impeller replacement or ''trimming'', to save energy and reduce costs. Trimming involves machining the impeller to reduce its diameter. Trimming should be limited to about 75 % of a pump's maximum impeller diameter, because excessive trimming can result in a mismatched impeller and casing. As the impeller diameter decreases, added clearance between the impeller and the fixed pump casing increases internal flow recirculation, causes head loss, and lowers pumping efficiency. For manufacturing standardization purposes, pump casings and shafts are designed to accommodate impellers in a range of sizes. Many pump manufacturers provide pump performance curves that indicate how various models will perform with different impeller diameters or trims. The impeller should not be trimmed any smaller than the minimum diameter shown on the curve. Net positive suction head requirements (<b>NPSHR)</b> usually decrease at lower flow rates and can increase at the higher end of the pump head curve. The <b>NPSHR</b> at a given flow rate will normally be greater with a smaller impeller, but engineers should consult with the pump manufacturer to determine variations in <b>NPSHR</b> before trimming the impeller. Manufacturers can often provide trim correction charts based on historical test data...|$|E

40|$|Cavitation is a {{phenomenon}} characterised {{by the presence of}} vapour bubbles in the fluid led by a local drop in pressure. In literature it is well known the impact on cavitation of pressure and temperature of pure water, but there are only few studies analysing how the presence of certain components of detergents and additives can influence the phenomenon. The impact of detergents and additives could be explained by the modified viscosity and rheology of the solution but also by the variation in the vapour tension. Most of these effects are due to the presence of surfactants and polymers in the solution. Cavitation in dynamic pumps is an important aspect that needs to be monitored and prevented, because it can cause damages affecting pump performances and inducing an increment in the level of vibration and noise. In professional warewashing machines, as for example the models of Electrolux Rack Type, this phenomenon can affect the operating functionalities of the machine. An experimental pump test rig has been realized with the aim of studying and monitoring the influence of these parameters on cavitation inception. This test rig permits measuring the pump performances at various operating conditions, in order to obtain its characteristic curves, and also forcing cavitation to measure its Net Positive Suction Head required (<b>NPSHr)</b> at different flow rates. The pump test rig allows also testing various configurations of the pump at different cavitation conditions, obtained by changing not only the suction pressure and temperature of the fluid but also its properties, adding detergents and additives.

This tekst covers {{fluid energy}} shape which uses in pump system. A pump is machine that imparts energy to a liquid to {{increase}} its pressure and move it from one point to another. There are many pump classification. One classification is acording to the method energy is imparted to the liquid: kinetic energy, or positive displacement. A centrifugal pump is of kinetic energy type because it imparts energy to a liquid by means of centrifugal force produced by a rotating impeller. Displacement pumps are of lower flow range and have pulsating flow rate. Centrifugal pump is rotodinamic pump that uses a rotating impeller to increase the pressure of liquid. They are commonly used to move liquids through a piping system. The liquid enters to the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated bay the impeler, flowing radially outward into diffuser or volute chamber (casing), from where it exist into the downstream piping system. Like most pumps, a centrifugal pumps converts mechanical energy from a motor to energy of a moving fluid (liquid). Some of energy goes into kinetic energy of liquid motion and some into potential energy, represented by a liquid pressure or by lifting the liquid against gravity to higher level. The two major components of a centrifugal pumps are impeller and the casing in which it rotates. The transfer of energy from mechanical rotation of the impeller to the motion and pressure of the liquid is usually described by means of centrifugal force. Power from the driver, which is an electric motor, a diesel engine or a steam turbine (not for firefigting use) is transmitted to the pump through the shaft, rotating the impeller at high speed. In the modern centrifugal pump, most of the energy conversation {{is due to the}} outward force that curved impeller blades impart on the liquid. Invariability, some of the energy also pushes the liquid into a circular motion, and this circular motion can also convey some energy and increase the pressure at the outlet. The pumps are identified by the direction of the flow through impeller, with refernce to the axis of rotation. The total head of the pump is the energy imparted to the liquid as it passes through the pump. It may be expressed in various units of pressure, but for fire protection it’s generally given in units for pressure-bar or in units for long-m. The total head is calculated by subtracting the energy in the incoming fluid from the energy in the discharging liquid. Neto positive suction head (NPSH) is the pressure head that causes liquid to flow through the suction pipe and fitting into the eye of a pump impeller. The pump itself has no ability to ‘lift’ and the suction pressure depends {{on the nature of the}} supply. There are a two kinds of NPSH to consider. Pump NPSH is a function of the pump design and varies with the capacity and speed of any pump and with the design of different pumps. Available NPSH is a function of the system in which the pump operates and can be calculated readily. When the water source is above the pump, available NPSH is equal atmospheric pressure plus static head on suction minus friction and fitting losses in suction pipping minus vapor pressure of liquid. For any pump installation, the available system NPSH must be equal or greater than the pump NPSH at the desired operating condition. Pumps suppliers set the NPSH required (<b>NPSHR)</b> for a given pump. The (<b>NPSHR)</b> takes into account any potential head losses that might occur between the pump’ suction nozzle and impeller, thus ensuring that the liquid doesn’t drop below it’s vapour pressure...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 211 In {{order to}} ensure safe, reliable, {{efficient}} and cost effective operation of reciprocating pumps, pump dynamics should not be ignored. Pump problems due to dynamics are often difficult to diagnose and solve. Dynamic problems usually lie {{in one or more}} of the following areas: *Pulsation control (piping acoustics) *Vibration control (piping mechanics) *Cavitation control (pulsation and pressure drop) *Pump valve dynamics (valve motion). All the areas can be interactive to such an extent that it is difficult to know where the most effective changes can be made. A clear summary of each area will be presented with a view towards understanding how these areas can interact. The topic will be approached from an engineering perception viewpoint (a spectral energy response overlay) with minimal emphasis on mathematical concepts. Following the energy as it transfers though the whole system reveals how inefficient energy transfer and local energy magnification (resonance) is key to understanding how to prevent or solve everyday problems. Problems such as vibration, bladder failure, valve failure, poor performance, fatigue failure, and safety concerns are usually linked to one or more dynamic areas. Along with a basic understanding of the physics involved in pump dynamic areas, it is also helpful to have a working knowledge of ?rule of thumb? techniques that can be reliable and extremely cost effective. Pulsation control will be viewed using mechanical analogies with cause and effect scenarios. Vibration control will be focused on reducing the shaking force through reducing acoustic-to-mechanical coupling mechanisms, instead of brute force mechanical modifications. Cavitation and <b>NPSHR</b> (the inlet pressure required to prevent cavitation) problems will be viewed from a simple understanding of local instantaneous pressure compared to vapor pressure. Valve dynamics will be viewed in terms of simple fluid pressure forces, as they are exerted on a pressure controlled valve element. This engineering perception has a firm theoretical foundation but requires only fundamental mathematics to employ. Two short case histories will be presented illustrating pulsation/vibration control, cavitation control and pump valve problems. In almost all cases, piping vibration is the result of pulsation coupling into mechanical shaking forces yielding vibration with possible fatigue failures. Pump manifolds and external piping can be modified to ensure nonresonant acoustic systems that greatly reduce vibrational force. Once the shaking force is reduced, it remains to ensure that mechanical resonance is not present. Although cavitation is generally thought to be pressure drop related, in many cases it can be traced to acoustical resonances associated with the pump manifold and connected piping. Pump valve problems are generally solved through increasing spring stiffness, decreasing lift and employing more rugged materials. The use of newly developed materials has had the tendency of appearing as a universal fix where high pulsation levels can be tolerated. The best solution for many valve problems is reducing the pulsations that induce excessive impact forces. The use of a spectral energy response overlay or window is a concept that is in use by many who deal with dynamic problems. This type of approach is easily understood, but not as rigorous as the actual model approach. It should become apparent that most design quality can be determined by the overlay approach. It is not intended to replace the full model, but it will produce a good initial starting design and form the basis for analyzing existing field problems...|$|E
