5|$|Historian Adrian R. Lewis postulates that American {{casualties}} {{would have}} been greatly reduced if a longer barrage had been implemented, although the First Infantry Division Chief of Staff stated that the Division would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> move off the beach without effective naval gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the Sun's {{development}} suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the Archean eon, the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> sustain liquid water on Earth's surface, and thus life should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. One theory among scientists is that {{the atmosphere of the}} young Earth contained much larger quantities of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of solar energy reaching it.|$|E
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E

5|$|Crew-only or cargo-only supply {{missions}} {{would have}} been launched aboard a Titan II, and the Saturn I or Saturn IB {{would have been}} used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> propel the crew far enough {{in the event of an}} explosion, so a launch escape tower was proposed, based on the one used on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 2012, Alessandro Del Piero {{signed a}} two-year deal with Sydney FC. He was paid {{approximately}} AU$3.5million {{for each of}} his first two seasons, and therefore became the highest-paid footballer to ever play in Australia. Del Piero had been linked to Liverpool prior to signing for Sydney, but later revealed due to his memories of Heysel he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> move to the club.|$|E
5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to).</b> Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
50|$|In a 1975 {{interview}} with Mike Wallace, Hill tearfully surmised {{that if he}} had reached the vehicle a second earlier, he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to take the third shot to his own body, and felt a great deal of regret for <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to reach there in time.|$|R
6000|$|Enter the {{two little}} Wards, with a message that Ave was sorry, but that she was too much tired to come that evening; and when Mary regretted <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to come and help her, Ella {{answered}} that 'Mr. Tom had come and helped {{her for a long}} time.' ...|$|R
60|$|Believe me that I have {{no other}} feeling of {{disappointment}} connected with this matter but that arising from the <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to <b>be</b> of some use to you.

5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless it reaches the halfway mark. As such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged in the lap 11 crash {{to the point where he}} would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> continue racing.|$|E
5|$|Some {{concerns}} were raised that the Gemini spacecraft's heat shield would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> protect {{it during the}} higher speed ballistic reentry associated with the trajectory {{that would have been}} required. NASA proposed using a thicker heat shield and more insulation to protect the spacecraft. This and several other modifications made the spacecraft too heavy to be launched by the Titan II rocket which was used for the original twelve Gemini missions, so several solid rocket motors would have been added to allow this additional mass to be flown.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{before the}} UEFA Euro 2008 tournament, Campo {{wrote a letter}} to the Bolton {{supporters}} expressing his regret at <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to bid the club a proper farewell, and the letter appeared on a website run by Sky Sports presenter Guillem Balagué. He eventually played in a testimonial match at the Reebok Stadium, in honour of teammate Jussi Jääskeläinen.|$|R
5|$|With the {{publication}} of the accreditation procedures for organisations to access ContactPoint, {{it became clear that the}} vast majority of voluntary organisations would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> access ContactPoint. This meant that the majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith groups, would not be able to register their involvement, representing a real challenge for practitioners who wanted to see who was working with a particular child or young person.|$|E
5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|Although Jordan {{himself had}} promised {{only a single}} book, {{according}} to Sanderson neither Jordan's widow nor Doherty believed he could achieve this. Sanderson claimed {{that he could not}} do the story and characters justice with a single volume, so a split was inevitable. The decision was made to split the final book into three separate volumes, rather than two, so that a reasonably sized and unfractured volume could be released at the promised November 2009 date. Sanderson has stated that had the book remained as a single volume, it would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> be released before November 2011, and likely would have been so large (around 2,000 pages) that it would be unpublishable.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir {{was wise}} {{enough to realize that}} such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; it would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because they would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and}} neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E

5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> write what would become his greatest works.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not understand what caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E
