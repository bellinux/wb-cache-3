40|$|MOTIVATION: Most {{experimental}} evidence on kinetic parameters {{is buried in}} the literature, whose manual searching is complex, time consuming and partial. These shortcomings become particularly acute in systems biology, where these parameters need to be integrated into detailed, genome-scale, metabolic models. These problems are addressed by KiPar, a dedicated information retrieval system designed to facilitate access to the literature relevant for kinetic modelling of a given metabolic pathway in yeast. Searching for kinetic data {{in the context of}} an individual pathway offers modularity as a way of tackling the complexity of developing a full metabolic model. It is also suitable for large-scale mining, since multiple reactions and their kinetic parameters can be specified in a single search request, rather than one reaction at a time, which is unsuitable given the size of genome-scale models. RESULTS: We developed an integrative approach, combining public data and software resources for the rapid development of large-scale text mining tools targeting complex biological information. The user supplies input in the form of identifiers used in relevant data resources to refer to the concepts of interest, e. g. EC numbers, GO and SBO identifiers. By doing so, the user is freed from providing any other knowledge or terminology concerned with these concepts and their relations, since they are retrieved from these and cross-referenced resources automatically. The terminology acquired is used to index the literature by mapping concepts to their synonyms, and then to textual documents mentioning them. The indexing results and the previously acquired knowledge about relations between concepts are used to formulate complex search queries aiming at documents relevant to the user's information needs. The conceptual approach is demonstrated in the implementation of KiPar. Evaluation reveals that KiPar performs better than a Boolean search. The precision achieved for abstracts (60 %) and full-text articles (48 %) is considerably better than the baseline precision (44 % and 24 %, respectively). The baseline recall is improved by 36 % for abstracts and by 100 % for full text. It appears that full-text articles are a much richer source of information on kinetic data than are their abstracts. Finally, the combined results for abstracts and full text compared with the curated literature provide high values for relative recall (88 %) and <b>novelty</b> <b>ratio</b> (92 %), suggesting that the system is able to retrieve a high proportion of new documents...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{investigation}} of information retrieval performance of Turkish search engines with respect to precision, normalized recall, coverage and <b>novelty</b> <b>ratios.</b> We defined seventeen query topics for Arabul, Arama, Netbul and Superonline. These queries were carefully selected to assess the capability of a search engine for handling broad or narrow topic subjects, exclusion of particular information, identifying and indexing Turkish characters, retrieval of hub/authoritative pages, stemming of Turkish words, correct interpretation of Boolean operators. We classified each document in a retrieval output as being ”relevant” or ”nonrelevant” to calculate precision and normalized recall ratios at various cut-off points for each pair of query topic and search engine. We found the coverage and <b>novelty</b> <b>ratios</b> for each search engine. We also tested how search engines handle meta-tags and dead links. Arama {{appears to be the}} best Turkish search engine in terms of average precision and normalized recall ratios, and the coverage of Turkish sites. Turkish characters (and stemming as well) still cause bottlenecks for Turkish search engines. Superonline and Netbul make use of the indexing information in metatag fields to improve retrieval results...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of Information Retrieval Performance of Turkish Search Engines This is an {{investigation}} {{on the information}} retrieval performances of search engines based on various measures. We searched 17 queries of differing types on four Turkish search engines, namely Arabul, Arama, Netbul and Superonline. We classified each document/Web site contained in the retrieval results as being “relevant” or “non-relevant”. Based on this classification, we calculated the precision and normalized ranking ratios in various cut-off points for each query run on each search engine. We checked the “dead” or “broken” links among the retrieval results to determine how often the crawlers of search engines visit the sites they index and how often they update their indexes, if needed. We found out the coverage and <b>novelty</b> <b>ratios</b> of each search engine by searching five keywords {{that have been the}} most frequently submitted queries to the Turkish search engines. Those keywords are “mp 3 ”, “oyun” (game), “sex”, “erotik” (erotica) and “porno” (porn). By means of two modest experiments, we tested to see if Turkish search engines make use of index terms that are assigned by the authors of Web pages and included under the “keywords” and “description” meta tags of HTML documents. Using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney statistics, we tested if up-to-dateness, precision, normalized ranking, coverage and <b>novelty</b> <b>ratios</b> of each search engine differ significantly from each other. Major findings of our research are as follows: On the average, one in six documents retrieved by search engines was not available due to dead or broken links. Netbul retrieved fewer documents with dead or broken links than other search engines did. Some search engines retrieved no documents (so called “zero retrievals”) or no relevant documents for some queries. On the average, five in six documents retrieved were not relevant. Average precision ratios of search engines ranged between 11 % (Netbul) and 28 % (Arama) (Superonline being 20 % and Arabul 15 %). Arama retrieved more relevant documents than that of Arabul and Netbul in the first five documents retrieved. Search engines do not seem to make every efforts to retrieve and display the relevant documents in higher ranks of retrieval results. Average normalized ranking ratios of search engines ranged between 20 % (Arabul) and 54 % (Arama) (Superonline being 37 % and Netbul 30 %). Arama retrieved the relevant documents in higher ranks than that of Arabul and Netbul. The strong positive correlation between the precision and normalized ranking ratios got weakened as the number of documents that we evaluated increased. Search engines were less successful in finding relevant documents for specific queries or queries that contained broad terms. Although nonrelevant documents were higher in number, search engines were more successful in singleterm queries or queries with Boolean “OR” operator. The success rate was lower for queries with Boolean “AND” operator. Search engines seemingly do not use stemming algorithms to better analyze queries and to increase retrieval performance. The use of Turkish characters such as “ç”, “ö”, and “ş” in queries still creates problems for Turkish search engines as retrieval results differed for such queries. Superonline’s coverage rate was much higher than that of other search engines for the most frequently searched queries on the Turkish search engines. Except Arama, search engines index fewer documents/sites with domain names ending with “. tr”. Arama is the indisputable leader in covering documents with Turkish addresses. Almost all search engines scored high in <b>novelty</b> <b>ratios</b> for the most frequently searched queries. Different search engines tend to retrieve different relevant documents for the same queries. For retrieval purposes, Netbul and Superonline seem to index and make use of metadata fields that are contained in HTML documents under “keywords” and “description” meta tags. The research report concludes with some recommendations to improve the information retrieval performances of Turkish search engines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Two {{commercial}} portable spectrometers {{were compared}} for orange quality non-destructive predictions by developing Partial Least Squares calibration models, reflectance mode spectra acquisition {{being used in}} both. One {{of them was a}} Vis/NIR spectrometer in which the radiation reflected by the fruit is collected and conducted by optic fiber to the three detectors (350 - 2500 nm) of the instrument. The other is an AOTF-NIR with a reflectance post dispersive optical configuration and InGaAs (1100 - 2300 nm) detector. Four orange varieties were included in calibrations. The parameters studied were soluble solids content, acidity, titratable acidity, maturity index, flesh firmness, juice volume, fruit weight, rind weight, juice volume to fruit weight ratio, fruit colour index and juice colour index. The results indicate a good performance of the predictive models, particularly for the direct NIR prediction of soluble solids content, and maturity index, the prediction of this last parameter being notable for its relevance and <b>novelty.</b> The RPD <b>ratios</b> for these parameters were in the range from 1. 67 to 2. 21 with the Labspec, which showed better predictive performance, and from 1. 03 to 2. 33 with the Luminar...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} multi-resolution tool for screening paper formation variations, aiming to detect abnormalities in various frequency regions ranging from millimeters to several meters. The abnormalities detected in different frequency regions give an indication for the paper maker about specific disturbances in the paper production process. A paper web, running at a speed of 30 m/s, is illuminated by two red diode lasers and the reflected light are recorded as two time series of high resolution measurements constitutes the input signal to the papermaking process monitoring system. The time series are divided into blocks and each block is analyzed separately. The task is treated as a kernel based novelty detection applied to a multi-resolution time series representation obtained from the frequency bands of the Fourier power spectra of the blocks. The frequency content of each frequency region is characterized by a feature vector, which is transformed using the canonical correlation analysis and then categorized into the inlier or outlier class by the <b>novelty</b> detector. The <b>ratio</b> of outlying data points, significantly exceeding the predetermined value, indicates abnormalities in the paper formation. The experimental investigations performed have shown that the presented paper formation deficiencies monitoring technique and the system can be used for on-line monitoring of paper deficiencies manifesting themselves in a broad frequency range. A software, implementing the technique, was developed and used for online paper formation monitoring at a Swedish paper mill...|$|R
