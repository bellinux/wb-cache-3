40|$|<b>New</b> <b>ventures</b> are {{considered}} to be a major source of small firm growth. In Indian context the contribution of <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> in terms of new employment, production and exports has largely remained unexplored. It is equally important and unexplored, the significance of the contribution of bank credit to the growth of <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> in India. This paper is an attempt to throw light on these two aspects. The research is based on secondary data of the liberalized period provided by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India and Reserve Bank of India. To analyze the influence of bank credit growth on <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> and the influence of <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> on growth of additional employment, additional production and additional exports, we used a Bi-Variate Vector Auto Regression. Based on the model generated, Granger causality tests are conducted to obtain the results. The study found that rate of growth of bank credit causes the number of <b>new</b> <b>ventures,</b> implying any increase in the rate of growth of bank credit will be beneficial to the growth of <b>new</b> <b>ventures.</b> The study also concluded that <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> are not causing the growth of additional employment or additional production. However <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> cause the growth of additional exports. This is reasonable as entrepreneurs start their <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> with minimum possible employment and relatively low rate of capacity utilization and they come up {{to take advantage of the}} process of globalization by catering to the international market...|$|R

The rugby league club were granted the East Stand, which they renamed 'The Boston Stand' in tribute to the Welsh winger Billy Boston, As Wigan Athletic had spent many years in the lower leagues it was recognised that most of their players were not known, so the West Stand was renamed 'The Springfield Stand' after the club's former ground.|$|E

5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on {{the basic principles of}} physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do.

These changes were implemented in October 1967.

The Cub arrows were replaced in 1991 with the Cub Scout Award, Adventure Award and Adventure Crest Award. All these awards were replaced following the introduction of the Programme Review in February 2002. A new concept called the Balanced Programme replaced the previous scheme. Challenge Awards could be earned by participating in activities in various Programme Zones such as outdoors, fitness, community or international. Earning a certain number of Challenge Awards and the completion of a personal challenge led to the Bronze Chief Scout's Award for Beavers, Silver for Cubs and Gold for Scouts. Proficiency Badges were revised and renamed Activity Badges. In 2015, the programme was revised again following consultation within the association, the changes being called the Programme Refresh.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} formation and outcomes of interorganizational partnerships between industry incumbents and <b>new</b> <b>ventures.</b> <b>New</b> <b>ventures</b> are often a powerful competitive force threatening established firms, but incumbent firms can also benefit from collaborating with them and acquiring external knowledge. Although there has been significant research on the topic, relatively {{little is known about}} relational factors that influence who partners with whom and how. Also, strategic benefits of partnering with <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> for incumbent firm's learning have not been scrutinized; in particular, whether making such formal arrangements is the best way for incumbents to attain knowledge from <b>new</b> <b>ventures,</b> and whether there are any alternative learning mechanisms available have not been examined. I address these issues in the context of corporate venture capital (CVC) investments, typically the first relationships formed between <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> and incumbent firms. First, I examined how new ventures' social ties with potential corporate investors based on founders' employment or prior co-investments of the lead venture capital firm influence the formation of CVC investment deals. Second, I examined the relative effects of multiple mechanisms including CVC investments on incumbent firm learning from <b>new</b> <b>ventures.</b> I find that 1) the formation of investment relationships between <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> and incumbents is a joint function of social ties between them, an incumbent firm's integrity regarding the intellectual property of others, and technological links between them; 2) CVC investments have little independent effect on incumbent firm learning from <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> when alternative knowledge transfer mechanisms such as hiring inventors from <b>new</b> <b>ventures,</b> prior knowledge spillover links and outbound inventor mobility are simultaneously accounted for...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} rewards to product introduction by <b>new</b> <b>ventures.</b> The authors {{argue that the}} <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> that gain the most from innovation are those that adopt strategies that give them legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} stakeholders. <b>New</b> <b>ventures</b> can gain legitimacy by creating associations with established entities; such associations can be internal or external to the firm.

The results show that <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> that acquire legitimacy externally by forming alliances with established firms gain more from their new products than <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> that do not form such alliances. Among <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> that do not form alliances, those that acquire legitimacy internally by creating a history of product launches or by hiring reputed executives or scientists gain more from their new products than those that do not.

Several conclusions are drawn from structural equation modeling based on a large sample of 676 <b>new</b> <b>ventures.</b> First, most of the recursive positive relationships are supported by data of the overall sample, such as those between radical CE and exploration, incremental CE and exploitation, and strong ties and exploitation. Second, in the sub-samples, we only find support for the recursive positive relationships between radical CE and exploration, and incremental CE and exploitation among all the three subsamples. Third, for <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> in the early stage, relationships are emphasized concerning incremental CE, strong ties, and exploitation; for <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> in the middle stage, new relationships concerning weak ties, exploration, and radical CE come into effect and previous ones still have influence; and for <b>new</b> <b>ventures</b> in the late stage, new relationships begin to dominate and old ones evade.|$|R
