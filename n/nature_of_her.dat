5|$|She was {{supported}} during her career by her friendship with actor Bruce Willis and her positive connections with her sisters. She {{reflects on the}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> marriages and looks back on her prior self-indulgent lifestyle. She explains to the reader how personal achievement may result from the allure of success, and simultaneously cautions against harmful byproducts of behavioral insecurity inherent in the mystique of celebrity.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal {{received}} many death threats over the years. After a bomb placed by neo-Nazis exploded outside {{his house in}} Vienna on 11 June 1982, police guards were stationed outside his home 24 hours a day. Cyla found the stressful <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's career and the dragged-out legal matters regarding Kreisky to be overwhelming, and she sometimes suffered from depression.|$|E
60|$|She {{had studied}} the <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two pupils {{in the daily}} {{intimacy}} of twelve years. Those natures, which she believed herself to have sounded through all their depths, had been suddenly tried in the sharp ordeal of affliction. How had they come out from the test? As her previous experience had prepared her to see them? No: in flat contradiction to it.|$|R

5000|$|Leto's primal nature may be deduced {{from the}} <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father and mother, {{who may have}} been Titans of the sun and moon. Her Titan father is called [...] "Coeus," [...] and though H. J. Rose {{considers}} his name and nature uncertain, he is in one Roman source given the name Polus, which may relate him to the sphere of heaven from pole to pole. The name of Leto's mother, [...] "Phoebe" [...] ( [...] "pure, bright"), is identical to the epithet <b>of</b> <b>her</b> son Apollo, , throughout Homer.|$|R
5|$|Blyton's work became {{increasingly}} controversial among literary critics, {{teachers and parents}} from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the BBC had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Havins was {{influenced}} in {{her decision to}} accept the part by her husband's appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies {{as a means of}} introducing new American audiences to the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and to not have been taken to by the audience. The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired emotional impact.|$|E
5|$|In early September 2007, she was {{featured}} {{as the lead}} story on the Yahoo! homepage, which boosted her ratings up to as high as 4000 viewers at any given moment. As of late September 2007, {{she was living in}} Pittsburgh and held a position as spokesperson for Pittsburgh Councilman Bill Peduto. She also landed a job with Xtrain, which was a firm that specializes in new media expert training. Although her father remained supportive, her friends were beginning to tire of the intrusive <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> activities by the end of 2007. In October 2007, she was described as one of the web's most popular lifecasters in Tribune Company affiliates such as the Chicago Tribune. That fall, she was a featured participant in the first annual BlogWorld & New Media Expo, which bills itself as the World's Largest Social Media Conference.|$|E

5|$|Norcross was afforded {{a privileged}} {{education}} {{that was not}} available to many young ladies of her generation. At 16 years of age, she graduated from Fitchburg High School, and, beginning in 1870, she attended Wheaton Female Seminary, now Wheaton College. When she was 16 and 17 years old she wrote essays for Rushlight, the school's literary journal. The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> essays {{provide insight into the}} woman she would become: one who would successfully operate in a male-oriented society, had an interest in bettering the plight of others, and appreciated historical things. She graduated in 1872. Frances Vose Emerson was a classmate at Wheaton, good friend from childhood, and ultimately a trustee for the Fitchburg Art Museum.|$|E

Jerry tells George about a woman he met in Lansing, Michigan, Laura (Pamela Brull), who is coming to New York, and the two discuss {{whether or not she}} has romantic intentions. The next evening, Jerry tells his neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards) that he thinks he misunderstood the situation with Laura. However, he then receives a telephone call from Laura, who asks if she can stay overnight at his apartment.

5000|$|She is {{best known}} for her 2008 book, Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women's Love and Desire. In this book, she {{discusses}} the fluidity of female sexuality, based on <b>her</b> study <b>of</b> 100 non-heterosexual women over a period of 10 years. She concluded that the term bisexual did not truly express the versatile <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> subjects. Therefore, she calls [...] "for an expanded understanding of same-sex sexuality".|$|R
25|$|She {{joined the}} Mir iskusstva {{movement}} in 1911, but {{stood out from}} {{the other members of}} the group because of her preference for popular themes and because of the harmony, plasticity and generalized <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> paintings.|$|E

Reputedly, Starkey's strong New Church {{beliefs about the}} ideal of marriage required her to conduct a close examination of the spiritual <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> feelings for him. Undeterred by her rejection, Pitcairn continued to court Starkey for five more years. Finally she accepted, and {{they were married in}} 1884.|$|E

25|$|She {{later became}} the subject of press {{interest}} over the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> relationship with an interview subject, the late Eugène Terre'Blanche. Allan strongly denied the affair allegations and took an injunction out against Terre'Blanche. Allan was forced to leave South Africa when her apartment was bombed by the far-right in 1989. Allan filed an unsuccessful and highly publicized libel suit in London against the broadcaster Channel 4 in 1992 over the affair allegations.|$|E
25|$|The exact <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{relationship}} with her royal sister-in-law is not clear either, {{and there is no}} evidence as to what she thought of her other sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn, who had been at court with Jane since they were both teenagers. It is generally assumed that Jane was not overly fond of Anne, allegedly because of Jane's jealousy of her. Regardless, Jane plotted with Anne to banish one of the King's young unnamed mistresses from court in 1534. When the King discovered her involvement, Lady Rochford was herself exiled for a few months.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made her, {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, as if she was trying to live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E
