40|$|Road anger {{constitutes}} {{one of the}} determinant {{factors related}} to safety outcomes (e. g., accidents, <b>near</b> <b>misses).</b> Although cyclists are considered vulnerable road users due to their relatively high rate of fatalities in traffic, previous research has solely focused on car drivers, and no study has yet investigated the effect of anger on cyclists’ safety outcomes. The present research aims to investigate, for the first time, the effects of cycling anger toward different types of road users on <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> involving such road users and <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> in general. Using a daily diary web-based questionnaire, we collected data about daily trips, bicycle use, <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> experienced, cyclist’s anger and demographic information from 254 Spanish cyclists. Poisson regression {{was used to assess}} the association of cycling anger with <b>near</b> <b>misses,</b> which is a count variable. No relationship was found between general cycling anger and <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> occurrence. Anger toward specific road users had different effects on the probability of <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> with different road users. Anger toward the interaction with car drivers increased the probability of <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> involving cyclists and pedestrians. Anger toward interaction with pedestrians was associated with higher probability of <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> with pedestrians. Anger toward cyclists exerted no effect on the probability of <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> with any road user (i. e., car drivers, cyclists or pedestrians), whereas anger toward the interactions with the police had a diminishing effect on the occurrence of near misses’ involving all types of road users. The present study demonstrated that the effect of road anger on safety outcomes among cyclists is different from that of motorists. Moreover, the target of anger played an important role on safety both for the cyclist and the specific road users. Possible explanations for these differences are based on the difference in status and power with motorists, {{as well as on the}} potential displaced aggression produced by the fear of retaliation by motorized vehicle users...|$|R

5|$|The {{aircraft}} scored {{four hits}} and three near misses on and around Arizona. The <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> off the port bow {{is believed to}} have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a small fire. The next forwardmost hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating {{in the area of the}} anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.|$|E
5|$|Within six minutes, Sōryū and Kaga were ablaze from stem to stern, as fires {{spread through}} the ships. Akagi, having been struck by only one bomb, took longer to burn, but the {{resulting}} fires quickly expanded and soon proved impossible to extinguish; she too was eventually consumed by flames {{and had to be}} abandoned. All three carriers remained temporarily afloat, as none had suffered damage below the waterline, other than the rudder damage to Akagi caused by the <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> close astern. Despite initial hopes that Akagi could be saved or at least towed back to Japan, all three carriers were eventually abandoned and scuttled.|$|E
5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event.

According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E

5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 degrees to starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{joined the}} Home Fleet {{off the coast}} of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the {{following}} days. She refuelled at Tromsø on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, Furious returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at Bardufoss was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.|$|E
5|$|HMS Garland, {{also known}} by her Polish {{designation}} ORP Garland, was a G-class destroyer {{built for the}} Royal Navy in the mid-1930s. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of}} the conflict. Shortly after World War II began, she was badly damaged by the premature explosion of her own depth charges and required over six months of repairs. Before these were completed, Garland was loaned to the Polish Navy in May 1940. The ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet afterwards and escorted convoys there before being assigned to the Western Approaches Command in September for escort duties. She escorted a convoy from Gibraltar to Malta during Operation Halberd in September 1941 and escorted Convoy PQ-16 from Iceland to Murmansk in May 1942. She was badly damaged by a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> from a German bomber during that operation and required three months of repairs.|$|E

5|$|New Jerseys guns {{opened the}} first shore {{bombardment}} of her Korean career at Wonsan 20 May. During her two {{tours of duty}} in Korean waters, she was {{again and again to}} play the part of seaborne mobile artillery. In direct support to United Nations troops; or in preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop positions, New Jersey used her 16-inch guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target to another, {{and at the same time}} could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection. It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a shore battery on her number one turret and received a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> aft to port.|$|E
5|$|No.5 SFTS began flight {{training}} in February 1942 using 28 Wirraways. The unit grew {{over the next}} two years, and by early 1944 was operating 128 Wirraways, two de Havilland DH.84 Dragons, two de Havilland Moth Minors and a CAC Wackett. It typically graduated one course of pilots each month, although the wastage rate sometimes exceeded 40 per cent. Among its graduates was Len Waters, the first Aboriginal Australian military aviator, and the only one to serve as a fighter pilot in the RAAF during World WarII. As a training facility, No.5 SFTS regularly suffered flying accidents. Forty-two of its students died during the war, an average of around one per month. A <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> involving more experienced pilots occurred at the school in December 1943, when aces Clive Caldwell and John Waddy, then instructors at No.2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, almost collided when they crossed paths during an aerobatics display over the base.|$|E
5|$|The Barracudas were {{targeted}} by heavy, but inaccurate, anti-aircraft gunfire as they arrived over Kaafjord.

These bombing attacks took 25 minutes to complete; seven near misses were achieved but no damage was inflicted on Tirpitz. One of the other Barracudas attacked an anti-aircraft battery, another attempted to bomb a destroyer and a third scored a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> on the tanker Nordmark. Three of the remaining four Barracudas {{did not find any}} targets and jettisoned their bombs into the sea; the fourth was unable to drop its bombs due to a faulty release mechanism.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between perceived and biological stress and <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> among Emergency Medicine residents. Design: Self-rated stress and stress biomarkers were assessed in residents in Emergency Medicine before and after a day shift. The supervising physicians and residents reported numbers of <b>near</b> <b>misses.</b> Setting: The study took place in the Emergency Department of a large trauma 1 centre, located in Detroit, USA. Participants Residents in Emergency Medicine volunteered to participate. The sample consisted of 32 residents, with complete data on 28 subjects. Residents' supervising physicians assessed the clinical performance of each resident. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Participants' preshift and postshift stress, biological stress (salivary cortisol, plasma interleukin- 6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), residents' and supervisors' reports of <b>near</b> <b>misses,</b> number of critically ill and patients with trauma seen during the shift. Results: Residents' self-reported stress increased from an average preshift level of 2. 79 of 10 (SD 1. 81) to a postshift level of 5. 82 (2. 13) (p< 0. 001). Residents cared for an average of 2. 32 (1. 52) critically ill patients and 0. 68 (1. 06) patients with trauma. Residents reported a total of 7 <b>near</b> <b>misses,</b> compared with 11 reported by the supervising physicians. After controlling for baseline work-related exhaustion, residents that cared for more patients with trauma and had higher levels of TNF-a reported a higher frequency of <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> (R- 2 = 0. 72; p= 0. 001). Residents' preshift ratings of how stressful they expected the shift to be were related to the supervising physicians' ratings of residents' <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> during the shift. Conclusion: Residents' own ratings of <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> were associated with residents' TNF-alpha, a biomarker of systemic inflammation and the number of patients with trauma seen during the shift. In contrast, supervisor reports on residents' <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> were related only to the residents' preshift expectations of how stressful the shift would be...|$|R

5|$|There was {{resistance}} from the air, though. As the fifth wave of seven LCIs was coming in to Red Beach, they were attacked by six Zeke fighters and three Betty bombers that dropped twelve bombs. One hit the deck of USS LCI-339 forward of the conning tower; another two were near misses. Badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments, the ship caught fire. LCI-339 remained on the beach, where she served as a landmark for Japanese aircraft. She was eventually towed off the beach, but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss. USS LCI-341 suffered a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> that tore a huge hole in its side. Eight Australians were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel R. E.

5|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown {{radioactive}} source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous observation that the source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940.

5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified with radiation hardening, ensuring only a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> could damage it. This would mean that the Soviets would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E

40|$|Medication errors {{can occur}} at the prescribing, transcription, {{dispensing}} and administration stage of drug therapy. However, publication of the Organisation with a Memory (OWAM) by the Department of Health in the UK has raised {{awareness of the need}} for pharmacies to collect information about dispensing errors and <b>near</b> <b>misses,</b> which occur within an organisation. Such information provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of dispensing procedures and identifies areas for improvement in dispensing systems The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the feasibility of a self-reporting system for dispensing errors and <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> in primary care (community) pharmacies. It was also to identify the types of errors or <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> commonly encountered in community pharmacies. A data collection form was designed and modified for use after a pilot study. Four community pharmacies volunteered to participate in this feasibility study. The data collection was conducted in two phases each of 4 weeks' duration. Any dispensing errors and <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> that occurred during the study periods were recorded by the pharmacy staff in a standard data collection form. A focus group discussion was held with the dispensing staff of participating pharmacies to identify and evaluate the feasibility of the reporting system. Out of a total of 51 357 items dispensed during the two phases of the study, 39 dispensing errors (0. 08) and 247 <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> (0. 48) were detected. The results show that <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> occurred six times more often than dispensing errors, indicating the importance of final checking in pharmacies. The most common types of dispensing errors or <b>near</b> <b>misses</b> appeared to be incorrect strength of medication, followed by incorrect drug, incorrect quantity, incorrect dosage form and incorrect label. Feedback during the focus group discussion indicated that the outcome of the self-reporting scheme was more important than the incidence of errors or <b>near</b> <b>misses.</b> Participating pharmacies also agreed that the self-reporting scheme used was feasible and they would continue using the scheme although some incentives would be helpful. The quantitative results of this study and the qualitative feedback from the participating pharmacies indicate that the self-reporting scheme used is practical and feasible...|$|R

5|$|The RAF made {{a second}} attempt on 29 October, after {{the ship was}} moored off Håkøya Island outside Tromsø. Thirty-two Lancasters {{attacked}} the ship with Tallboys during Operation Obviate. As on Operation Paravane, No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> partially the result of bad weather over the target. The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. Tirpitzs 38cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns. Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. Tirpitz retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared {{for her role as}} a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when it was near an enemy aircraft, a <b>near</b> <b>miss</b> would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them.

5|$|After {{ten months}} of training, Miller {{was offered a}} {{commission}} as a pilot officer. His best friend missed out, so he arranged for Flight Lieutenant Keith Johnson an Australian cricket official, to pull some strings, ensuring his friend's promotion. The pair were posted to 12 Advanced Flying Unit in Grantham, Lincolnshire in on 15 August 1944, which was an Operations Training Unit {{for the purpose of}} familiarising officers with flying aircraft. However, on a trip back to Ouston to visit their colleagues, a night of drunken revelry led to property damage and injury to another airman. Miller and his friend were charged with eight offences and faced possible expulsion. Luckily for Miller, the Commanding Officer (CO) at his new posting at Cranfield, Buckinghamshire was his old CO at Ouston. Miller was given another three-week disciplinary course, but his pleas convinced the CO to reduce the sentence to a fine for the property damage. Miller was allowed to resume his training in Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. Again he had a <b>near</b> <b>miss,</b> when some instruments on his plane failed and he was forced to land his Beaufighter for repairs. After the repairs, another pilot used the plane and the problem recurred. The second pilot crash-landed and was killed. Later, Miller was returning from a training mission over France and misjudged the runway, bouncing his plane on the tarmac. Trying to lift off again, only one engine responded and the unequal power supply caused the plane to swerve, missing the hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment that he had agreed to attend. A V1 rocket hit the venue and killed many of the patrons inside. In October, he went AWOL to watch violinist Yehudi Menuhin perform in London and was dismissed, but the CO revoked his decision on the condition that Miller play for his cricket team.|$|E
