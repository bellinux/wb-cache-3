25|$|Back in the present, an {{encounter}} with Kulan Gath results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. After the Giant-Man Pym spends some time appearing almost emotionally stunted, reciting facts with no sense of emotional depth even when facing the new threat of a supercharged Count Nefaria, the Yellowjacket Pym replaces him, only for his impulsive nature to making a situation worse when Diablo turns an entire village into variations of the Hulk, Yellowjacket's plan to stop the Hulks resulting in them merging into one massive Hulk before he can shrink {{it down to a}} more manageable level. The two versions begin to deteriorate from being apart, but are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they <b>need</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Pym is eventually able to resolve his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona once again.|$|E

500|$|Sanctus Real's main genre is {{typically}} labeled as Christian rock and alternative CCM. Their first three independent albums were described by Allmusic as power pop.

Their second release, Fight the Tide, was described as [...] "melodic power rock" [...] with similarities to Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World, Switchfoot, U2, and PFR. The band's music on The Face of Love blended the styles from their previous two albums, evolving into less of a heavier rock sound. With We <b>Need</b> <b>Each</b> <b>Other,</b> lead singer Matt Hammitt noted that he [...] "just pushed the limits of what I can do vocally" [...] during some songs, [...] "whether it be on a soft, kind of rustic sounding vocal or whether it be this overdriven, rock high-range kind of vocal." ...|$|E

We're spiritually connected. We <b>need</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> ... and 'Judas' is ultimately a representation of our true bond," [...] she added. With The Hollywood Reporter, Gibson explained that within the video they created a new Jerusalem. The shock value in the video was purposefully added, but ultimately the story was about oppression; and about following one's heart and the glory of being free. With NME magazine Gaga revealed that the video involved motorbikes and a death sequence. She also described the portrayal of her character as being [...] "beyond repentance", which evolved from the continuous media accusations towards her that [...] " [...] trashy. or pretentious or this and that. [...] is my way of saying 'I've crossed the line, I won't even try to repent. Nor should I'." [...] Forgiveness and destiny also played a part in the video, and Gaga wanted to portray a Federico Fellini-esque story with apostles being revolutionaries in a modern-day Jerusalem. They are led to Jesus, by Gaga as Magdalene. Although initially reported to be premiered during an episode of the tenth season of American Idol, the music video premiered on May 5, 2011, on E!
