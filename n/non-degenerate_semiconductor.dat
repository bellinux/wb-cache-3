The reassigned band-edge positions and the small-polaron band are crucial to properly understand pure and/or lattice-coupled electronic processes of photo-induced interfacial charge transfer for small-polaron semiconductors. Applications are demonstrated in small-polaron-like rutile and rigid-band-like anatase TiO 2, in which we rationalize the dilemma of charge transfer at rutile/anatase interface in mixed-phase TiO 2 for photocatalysis, and revisit the electron-injection process in dye-sensitized TiO 2 solar cells. 大连化学物理研究...|$|E

40|$|We studied {{electrical}} transport in magnetic semiconductors, {{which is}} determined by scattering of free carriers off localized magnetic moments. We calculated the scattering time and the mobility of the majority and minority-spin carriers with both the effects of thermal spin fluctuations and of spatial disorder of magnetic atoms taken into account. These {{are responsible for the}} magnetic-field dependence of electrical resistivity. Namely, the application of the external magnetic field suppresses the thermodynamic spin fluctuations thus promoting negative magnetoresistance. Simultaneously, scattering off the built-in spatial fluctuations of the atomic spin concentrations may increase with the magnetic field. The latter effect is due to the growth of the magnitude of random local Zeeman splittings with the magnetic field. It promotes positive magnetoresistance.

40|$|Spin {{transport}} in non-degenerate semiconductors {{is expected}} to pave a way {{to the creation of}} spin transistors, spin logic devices and reconfigurable logic circuits, because room temperature (RT) spin transport in Si has already been achieved. However, RT spin transport has been limited to degenerate Si, which makes it difficult to produce spin-based signals because a gate electric field cannot be used to manipulate such signals. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of spin transport in non-degenerate Si with a spin metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) structure. We successfully observed the modulation of the Hanle-type spin precession signals, which is a characteristic spin dynamics in <b>non-degenerate</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> We obtained long spin transport of more than 20 μm and spin rotation, greater than 4 π at RT. We also observed gate-induced modulation of spin transport signals at RT. The modulation of spin diffusion length as a function of a gate voltage was successfully observed, which we attributed to the Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism. These achievements are expected to make avenues to create of practical Si-based spin MOSFETs.

40|$|While {{thermoelectric}} {{transport theory}} {{is well established}} and widely applied, there remains some degree of confusion on the proper thermodynamic definition of the Seebeck coefficient (or thermoelectric power) which {{is a measure of}} the strength of the mutual interaction between electric charge transport and heat transport. Indeed, as one considers a thermoelectric system, it is not always clear whether the Seebeck coefficient is to be related to the gradient of the system's chemical potential or to the gradient of its electrochemical potential. This pedagogical article aims to shed light on this confusion and clarify the thermodynamic definition of the thermoelectric coupling. First, we recall how the Seebeck coefficient is experimentally determined. We then turn to the analysis of the relationship between the thermoelectric power and the relevant potentials in the thermoelectric system: As the definitions of the chemical and electrochemical potentials are clarified, we show that, with a proper consideration of each potential, one may derive the Seebeck coefficient of a <b>non-degenerate</b> <b>semiconductor</b> without the need to introduce a contact potential as seen sometimes in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phenomenological expression of the electrical current resulting from thermoelectric effects may be directly obtained from the drift-diffusion equation...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} Internal Technical Memorandum (1) and in {{subsequent}} work(2), {{it has been}} demonstrated that {{a particular kind of}} resistance network, in which non-linear elements are associated with each mesh point, can be made to represent an exact analogue to a <b>non-degenerate</b> <b>semiconductor</b> system in the equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium state. The term !exact' in this context implies that the difference equation which governs the potential distribution in the network becomes identical, for the limit of vanishing mesh interval, with the differential equation for the electrostatic potential within the semiconductor system, i. e. the Shockley-Poisson equation. From this type of analogue network information concerning the variation of maximum field intensity and of junction capacitance with applied bias voltages can be obtained for one, two and three dimensional configurations of p and n type regions of arbitrary geometry and impurity concentration profiles. One limitation to the applicability of the analogue technique arises from the restriction to quasi-equilibrium conditions. This restriction precludes the investigation of situations in which current flow contributions to the carrier concentration pattern become significant - for example, in the case of strongly forward biassed p-n junctions, and of p-i-n junctions and transistors operating at high injection levels. In the present paper, the problems involved in an extension of the basic analogue method to the treatment of non-equilibrium situations are examined, and means for their solution are discussed. A review of the methods previously described and an illustration of the nature of their limitations is given in Section 2. This is followed, in Sections 3 to 7, by a detailed treatment of the case of a current carrying semiconductor system in one dimension which leads to a theoretically possible realization in terms of resistancenetwork/ analogue computer techniques, which is, however, too complex to. be considered practical. Section 8 discusses means for the simplification of the proposed schemes and leads to the description of a relatively simple system in which a significant reduction in equipment complexity has been made possible by the adoption of an operating mode based upon an iterative process of successive approximations. The extension of the technique to three dimensions is outlined in Section 9...|$|E
40|$|As {{devices are}} scaled down to nanoscale, the high-field and quantum effects are {{becoming}} important in characterization and performance evaluation of semiconducting devices and circuits.

It is shown {{that in the}} high-electric field, the current {{is limited by the}} saturation velocity that is ballistic, independent of scattering interactions. The enhanced scattering in quantum wells reduces the mobility of a given device, but does not change the nature of saturation velocity. The saturation velocity is comparable to thermal velocity for <b>non-degenerate</b> <b>semiconductors</b> and Fermi velocity for the degenerate semiconductors. The emission of an optical phonon may further lower this velocity. Similarly, transit-time delay and RC switching delays are enhanced over and above what is expected for the application of Ohm’s law.

The results of quantum confined Ill-V compounds form the special cases of our generalized analysis. The photoemission has also been studied for quantum confined II-VI, n-GaP, n-Ge, PtSb 2, stressed materials and Bismuth {{on the basis of}} respective dispersion relations. It has been found taking quantum confined CdGeAS(2), InAs, InSb, CdS, GaP, Ge, PtSb 2, stressed n-InSb and B 1 that the photoemission exhibits quantized variations with the incident photon energy, changing electron concentration and film thickness, respectively, for all types of quantum confinement. The photoemission from CNs exhibits oscillatory dependence with increasing normalized electron degeneracy and the signature of the entirely different types of quantum systems are evident from the plots.

Undoped room temperature mobilities {{are used to}} examine the scattering {{as a function of the}} Sb content. Two scattering mechanisms are considered: ionised impurity and alloy scattering. The alloy scattering potential is found to be 1. 868 eV, which is about twice the theoretical value. Samples of various doping levels are also used, from undoped to heavily doped, to examine the temperature dependence of the mobility. The van der Pauw-Hall method is employed to determine the mobility at temperatures ranging from 4. 2 K to 320 K. Three scattering mechanisms are considered: ionised impurity, lattice, alloy, and surface charge scattering. Surface charge scattering is found to be negligible, but lattice scattering is important at high temperatures. Ionised impurity scattering is dominant at low temperatures, where two forms for it are found: one for <b>non-degenerate</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> and one for degenerate semiconductors. The alloy scattering potential is determined for each of the samples, and lies in the range of 1. 3 to 1. 6 eV. This is also larger than the theoretical value.

40|$|In {{analyzing}} zT improvements due to lattice {{thermal conductivity}} (κ_L) reduction, electrical conductivity (σ) and total thermal conductivity (κ_(Total)) {{are often used}} to estimate the electronic component of the thermal conductivity (κ_E) and in turn κ_L from κ_L = ∼ κ_(Total) − LσT. The Wiedemann-Franz law, κ_E = LσT, where L is Lorenz number, is widely used to estimate κ_E from σ measurements. It is a common practice to treat L as a universal factor with 2. 44 × 10 ^(− 8) WΩK^(− 2) (degenerate limit). However, significant deviations from the degenerate limit (approximately 40 % or more for Kane bands) are known to occur for <b>non-degenerate</b> <b>semiconductors</b> where L converges to 1. 5 × 10 ^(− 8) WΩK^(− 2) for acoustic phonon scattering. The decrease in L is correlated {{with an increase in}} thermopower (absolute value of Seebeck coefficient (S)). Thus, a first order correction to the degenerate limit of L can be based on the measured thermopower, |S|, independent of temperature or doping. We propose the equation: L= 1. 5 +exp[−_(|S|) _(116) ] (where L is in 10 ^(− 8) WΩK^(− 2) and S in μV/K) as a satisfactory approximation for L. This equation is accurate within 5 % for single parabolic band/acoustic phonon scattering assumption and within 20 % for PbSe, PbS, PbTe, Si_(0. 8) Ge _(0. 2) where more complexity is introduced, such as non-parabolic Kane bands, multiple bands, and/or alternate scattering mechanisms.

40|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} of a 6092 -T 6 Al metal-matrix composite (MMC) {{reinforced with}} boron carbide (B 4 C) particulates was exam-ined through electrochemical {{characterization of the}} MMC {{as well as a}} monolithic B 4 C. The results were interpreted based on a recently proposed electronic model for B 4 C that emphasizes a conventional <b>non-degenerate</b> p-type <b>semiconductor</b> band structure with high density of gap states. The electrochemical behavior of B 4 C in the dark that was characteristic of non-active metal elec-trodes was attributed to the very high density of gap states of B 4 C; while the phenomenon of the enhanced cathodic currents of B 4 C under illumination was attributed to the presence of a depletion layer at the B 4 C/electrolyte interface, characteristic of non-degenerate p-type semiconductor=electrolyte interface. The results suggested that galvanic corrosion of the MMC in the dark was limited by slow oxygen reduction kinetics at the B 4 C reinforcements and that illumination promotes galvanic corrosion of the MMC as a result of photo-enhanced cathodic activity of the B 4 C reinforcements. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that cor-rosion of the MMC initiated from carbon particles that are likely introduced into the matrix during the processing of the MMC. A combination of scanning vibration electrode technique and scanning ion-selective electrode technique revealed that localized an-odic and cathodic sites co-exist during the corrosion of the MMC in an air-exposed 3. 15 wt % NaCl solution.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is a theoretical investigation {{of the effects of}} band structure, strain, pressure, and growth orientation on the performance of semiconductor quantum well lasers. The effect of degenerate light- and heavy-hole bands on the carrier and current density and the differential gain are studied and compared with the <b>non-degenerate</b> case in <b>semiconductor</b> quantum well (QW) lasers. It is demonstrated that the presence of two degenerate bands at the valence band maximum will always lead to an increased threshold radiative current density compared to the case where only one band is significantly populated. When the two valence bands are separated by an energy E 5, the current density decreases rapidly with increasing E 5, with greater reductions being achieved for a given tensile than compressive strain. The effect of the second subband becomes less important with increasing E 5, and the radiative current density reverts to that of the one valence band case, demonstrating the importance of maximising the subband energy separation to optimise laser characteristics. We investigate different formulations of the envelope function method and show that the accuracy of the calculated zone-centre confinement energies can be simply predicted by plotting the equivalent bulk band structure using the various formulations. We show how coupling to the conduction and spin-split-off bands can decrease the light-hole zone-centre energies and lead to significant differences in the calculated subband dispersion, with the effects being most pronounced for systems having a narrow band gap and small spin-orbit splitting energy. Since the loss mechanisms in a semiconductor laser are often strongly wavelength dependent and hydrostatic pressure can vary the band gap, the pressure dependence of the threshold current can then provide a clear picture of the dominant loss mechanisms in a given laser structure. The pressure dependence of the optical confinement factor, band structure, transparency and threshold carrier density, and the combined effect of these on both radiative- and non-radiative current contributions have been evaluated for lasers operating at a range of wavelengths. We investigate in particular the predicted pressure dependence of several Auger processes in long wavelength (1. 5 mum) lasers. It is found that the rate of decrease of phonon-assisted Auger recombination with pressure is close to that observed experimentally, implying that phonon-assisted Auger is the dominant loss mechanism. It is shown that although the transparency carrier density increases with pressure in all laser structures, the threshold carrier density, nth, can decrease in long wavelength single quantum well (SQW) lasers due to the pressure dependent parameters. The decrease of nth in the long wavelength SQW case results in a quicker decrease in the threshold current of a SQW laser compared to that of a multiple quantum well (MQW) laser, in agreement with experimental measurements. The optical properties of quantum well structures can also change with crystal orientation, and, therefore, the substrate orientation is an additional parameter which can be used in engineering the band structure. The effects of orientation on critical thickness and material parameters are reviewed for (001) and (111) oriented strained InGaAs QWs grown on GaAs substrates and their consequences for laser emission wavelength are investigated. Calculations are presented which show that a significant fraction of the piezoelectric field remains unscreened at laser threshold in (111) lasers, which, together with decreased HH 1 -HH 2 separation, adversely affect the laser threshold characteristics in comparison to (001) oriented strained lasers...|$|R

The main objective of the presented work is: To investigate the potential of III-nitride (In(Ga) N, in particular) thin films/nanostructures for biosensors and water-splitting. The investigated structures have varying In contents (from medium to high) and varying morphologies, that are: thin compact InGaN films, InGaN nanowall networks, InGaN nanocolumns and InN quantum dots The thesis addresses: The molecular beam epitaxy growth of the mentioned thin films/nanostructures, on either GaN templates or Si(111) substrates, and their detailed morphological, structural, optical and electrochemical characterization. The insight and systematic evaluation of their electrochemical performance, for their final employment in bio-sensing and water-splitting applications. The work is presented as follows: Chapter I: The motivation for the work (including state of the art) and main goals of the thesis are explained. Chapter II: The fundamental properties of the employed material (III-nitrides) and employed nanostructures (nanocolumns and quantum dots (QDs)) are given. Due to their importance for the thesis development, the fundamental properties having {{a direct impact on}} the electrochemical activity of the employed material (III-nitrides). Chapter III: Details about experimental techniques used for the thesis realization are presented: epitaxial growth technique (MBE), morphological characterization (SEM and AFM), structural characterization (X-ray diffraction and TEM), optical characterization (PL, CL and SNOM), as well as chemical (GC) characterization. Chapter IV: Application related characterization of the structures, grown on both GaN templates and on Si(111), is addressed. For this, a general overview of electrochemistry for metals and (non degenerated n-type) semiconductors electrodes is provided after which a discussion on the (degenerated n-type semiconductor) high Incontent InGaN electrode is given. The biosensor concept is introduced as are the parameters that characterize its performance. A general introduction to water-splitting is given (both induced by electrolysis or {{with the aid of a}} <b>non-degenerated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> (photo) -electrode). Important parameters needed to fully characterize the water-splitting process/device will be highlighted. Chapter V: Specifications concerning the thin film/nanostructures growth. The samples fabricated and studied throughout this thesis, contain the following structures: (a) Grown on GaN templates: (i) high Indium (In) content InGaN single layers (ii) InN QDs on the top of (previously addressed) InGaN single layers (b) Grown on Si(111) substrate: (iii) high In-content InGaN single layers (iv) InGaN nanowall networks (v) InN QDs directly on top of the substrate, and also on the top of (previously addressed) InGaN single layers and nanowall networks (vi) InGaN nanocolumns This chapter provides a systematic analysis, regarding the control of the thin film/nanostructure morphology by the means of III/V flux ratio. As the III/V ratio changes from nearly stoichiometric (~ 1), to nitrogen rich (< 1), and further, to highly nitrogen rich (<< 1) one, the layer morphology evolves from compact to a nanowallnetwork morphology and further to a fully columnar morphology (nanocolumns). This chapter also provides insight into those morphological and structural properties of the grown thin films/nanostructures, which are relevant for the further development of the thesis. Chapter VI (divided in three parts) : In the first part it presents results of potentiometric measurements of the structures grown on GaN templates, targeted for biosensing applications. Specifically, the response of the samples containing surface InN QDs on single InGaN layers is compared to their counterpart samples, consisting of bare single In(Ga) N layers. The measurements reveal that the sample containing surface QDs show higher and more stable (in time) responsivity (actually, the response of bare In(Ga) N films is found highly decreasing over time). We consequently show that the employment of surface InN QDs (on the top of thin InGaN layers) leads to a significantly improved performance of glucose and cholesterol biosensors. Nonnernstian behaviour is observed indicating that the InN QDs have a catalytic effect enhancing the redox reaction at the surface. All figures of merits are addressed and thoroughly discussed. In the second part it presents two comparative studies related to water-splitting applications. The first study involves two different structures (i) a thin InGaN single layer grown on GaN template substrate: and (ii) InGaN nanowall network grown on (a nitridated) Si(111). While excellent photocurrent and Hydrogen production efficiency are observed in both cases (with zero bias applied), somewhat better results are obtained for the latter structure. The second study involves two different structures grown on GaN templates: (i) a single InGaN layer and its (ii) InN QDs on InGaN layer counterpart. In this case, a considerable efficiency increase is observed by the inclusion of InN QDs. The background results for the observed tendencies are thoroughly discussed. The third and last part includes electrochemical analysis of the grown samples by cyclic voltammetry measurements. An extensive analysis of the redox reaction occurring at the interface of all the layers/nanostructures grown on Si(111) and, on the other hand, an analysis determining which parameters (redox potentials, shape, etc) in a typical CV scan are influenced by: (i) In content, (ii) surface area and (iii) presence of surface InN QDs. To conduct experiments, a redox potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) / potassium hexacyanoferrate (III) probe was used. The results show that an optimum balance between catalytic efficiency (which is increased by the addition of surface InN QDs),and (active) surface area (the free c- crystal plane (0001) is identified as the crystal plane inducing surface electrochemical activity), needs to be found, to further boost the efficiency of InN-QDs-on-InGaN-layer based biosensors and water-splitting electrodes. In this sense, the enhancement of catalytic efficiency and increase of electrochemically active surface area (that is, increase of free c-plane surface) are essential.
