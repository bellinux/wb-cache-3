40|$|With {{regard to}} the {{processing}} of structural lightweight components there exists an increasing demand {{for the application of}} magnesium base wrought alloys, which are highly textured due to the forming process. However, magnesium has a poor deformability at room temperature due to the hexagonal structure that limits its application considerably. Although the focus of recent research activities is on investigations of the texture evolution and the mechanical behaviour of magnesium base alloys during processing and in service, there still exists a lack of understanding of their mechanical-technological characteristics e. g. the knowledge about the deformability or the cyclic deformation behaviour with respect to the initial crystallographic texture. The deformation behaviour during cyclic loading of the highly textured hot rolled magnesium base wrought alloy AZ 31 was investigated in-situ during elasto-plastic 4 -point-bending using energy dispersive diffraction. Loading or residual stress distributions were determined for one load cycle including loading, load release and load reversion. The experiments were carried out at the energy dispersive diffraction beamline EDDI at Bessy II, Berlin. The results obtained for the multitude of reflexions being recorded simultaneously in one single diffraction spectrum clearly indicate the elastic isotropic behaviour of the textured alloy. For elasto-plastically bent bars a strong plastic anisotropy was observed leading to a distinct shift of the <b>neutral</b> <b>fibre</b> of the bars. Reverse loading causes a shift of the <b>neutral</b> <b>fibre</b> almost symmetrically in the opposite direction of the bar which {{can be attributed to the}} reversibility of twinning.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{optimize}} the metallurgical quality of advanced high strength steels for automotive applications, the present study aims at understanding damage mechanisms involved in air-bending of two low alloy TRansformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) -aided steels. Air-bending tests were performed together with metallographic investigations of damage development in bent specimens. In order to assess the role of hard bands induced by chemical segregations, air-bending tests on specimens with various locations of the main hard band (with respect to the <b>neutral</b> <b>fibre)</b> were performed. Cracking initiates from the outer surface or from just below, mainly by decohesion between ferrite and secondary (martensite) phases, at hard bands located close to the outer surface. From these examinations, together with a simple kinematics analysis of bending, a quantitative relationship between cracking, local thickness of hard band and local "mesoscopic" strain is proposed...|$|E

The final <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> concentrations were 12 %, 16 %, 22 % and 23 % (dry matter basis). The addition of wheat bran to puppy rations, bringing the <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> up to 16 % in a 21 % crude protein diet had no deleterious effects on feed intake, feed and protein efficiency or growth in Beagle puppies. Over a sufficiently long period of time, the growth of this group did not differ from that of the controls (12 % <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre,</b> 23 % crude protein) although it was higher at intermediate times. The effects of the high fibre (22 or 23 % <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre)</b> diets on growth, feed intake feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio are consistent with an energy deficit resulting from the animals' inability to adapt fully to the dilution of their rations leading to lower growth, less efficient use of feed and, in the case of group 3 (22 % crude protein, 22 % <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre),</b> a lower protein efficiency ratio. The protein efficiency ratio of group 4 (16 % crude protein, 23 % <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre)</b> was higher than that of group 3, most likely the result of a more limiting amount of dietary protein leading to a more efficient use for growth by the animal.

40|$|ABSTRACT A total 120 piglets with {{an average}} live weight of 7. 00 kg, weaned at 21 days, were used to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> levels on the digestibility of nutrients and energy from the diets, productive performance, and the composition and rate of deposition of nutrients and energy in the bodies of piglets in the nursery phase. The animals were distributed according to a randomized-block design into five treatments, which consisted of <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> levels, with six replicates and four animals per plot. A quadratic effect was detected for the digestibility coefficients of nutrients and energy, feed intake and weight gain. The increase in fibre level promoted a linear increase in fat content in the carcass, blood, and body, whereas the energy in the carcass, organs, and body showed an inverse response. The results showed a quadratic effect on the nutrient deposition rate in the carcass, organs and body. In conclusion, the best digestibility of nutrients and energy from the diet is obtained with 10 - 11. 5 % <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre,</b> as higher weight gain and greater protein deposition in the body are achieved at <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> levels of 10. 6 % and 10. 3 %, respectively...|$|R

There were four treatments arranged factorially, with two sources of fibre (WB or MC) and two concentrations of ES (0 or 0. 15 g/kg) that contained 800 U/kg of endo- 1, 4 - -cellulase, 1800 U/kg of endo- 1, 3 (4) - -d-glucanase and 2600 U/kg of endo- 1, 4 - -xylanase. The digestibility of the <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> was higher (P< 0. 001) in diets containing WB and the digestibility of the acid detergent fibre increased with ES. Small intestine digesta contents (g/kg live weight) at slaughter were higher (P< 0. 01) in pigs fed MC than in pigs fed WB. Fibre source {{did not affect}} the amounts (mmol/l) of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the small intestine. However, replacement of WB by MC increased acetic acid and decreased butyric acid concentrations (P< 0. 05) in the caecum. In addition, pigs fed diets with MC as the major fibre source had lower (P< 0. 05) concentration of butyric acid in the colon than pigs fed diets with WB. Enzyme supplementation affected molar proportions of SCFA formed in the small intestine and tended to increase acetic acid, propionic acid and total SCFA concentrations in the colon of piglets fed WB (P< 0. 10).

Increased digestibility could substantially improve animal production in these industries. These experiments investigated the variation in agronomic and quality of natural populations selected from diverse regions within Australia. Runners of 14 kikuyu selections were collected by project staff or local agronomists from areas considered to have grown kikuyu for over 30 years while Whittet and Noonan were established by seed. Entries were established as single spaced plants on a 1. 5 m grid in a randomised block with 3 replicates and evaluated under irrigation at Mutdapilly (brown podsol) and Wollongbar (red ferrosol). Foliage height, forage production and runner yield were assessed along with crude protein (CP), in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), metabolisable energy (ME), acid detergent <b>fibre</b> (ADF) and <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> (NDF) content of the leaf in autumn, winter and spring...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of different carbohydrate sources, with rapid and medium fermentabilities, on the digestibility and rumen fermentability of Atriplex nummularia cv. De Kock fed to sheep. Maize was used as the medium fermentable carbohydrate source and barley as the rapid fermentable carbohydrate source. The trial ran in four sequential experimental periods using two groups of animals. The two groups stayed constant during the entire trial, one group receiving the maize treatment and the other the barley treatment. During each experimental period the groups of animals received different levels of the two carbohydrate sources. Each experimental period consisted of a digestibility trial and a rumen fermentation trial. Four different levels of supplementation were used, namely 0, 15 %, 30 % and 45 %. Measurements included dry matter intake, water intake, percentage dry matter digestibility, percentage <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> digestibility, rumen pool sizes, rumen pH, rumen ammonia nitrogen and rumen volatile fatty acid production. Supplementation of A. nummularia cv. De Kock with an energy source tended to increase feed and water intake. The tendency of energy sources to increase dry matter and <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> digestibilities diminished when the level of supplementation was raised from 15 % to 30 % and from 30 % to 45 %. The results suggest that maize and barley supplementation at a level of 15 % resulted in the highest incremental increase in dry matter and <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> digestibilities of A. nummularia cv. De Kock. The results also indicated that energy supplementation tended to increase dry matter intake and rumen fill. Rumen pools of dry matter, <b>neutral</b> detergent <b>fibre</b> and total nitrogen all increased with an increase in the level of supplementation. The tendency of energy supplementation to increase the different rumen pools diminished as the level of supplementation increased from 30 % to 45 % for both the energy sources. The results also indicate that the rumen environment was more favourable for fibre degradation when maize was used as an energy source. In the final phase it is reported that ruminal ammonia nitrogen increased as the rate of supplementation was increased from the 0 % to the 15 % level. The drop in rumen ammonia nitrogen as the rate of supplementation was increased to 30 % indicates an improvement in microbial protein synthesis. Ruminal pH decreased as the rate of supplementation increased with barley supplemented animals having lower rumen pH values. The decrease in rumen pH supports the increase in volatile fatty acid production as the level of energy supplementation was increased. It is concluded that an energy supplement of maize or barley will increase the intake and digestibility of A. nummularia cv. De Kock and that a level of 30 % should be optimal for microbial protein synthesis without significantly affecting fibre degradation.
