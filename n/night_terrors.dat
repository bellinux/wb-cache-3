25|$|For example, Rivers {{proposed}} that officers and soldiers {{who suffer from}} <b>night</b> <b>terrors</b> {{do so because they}} are trying to wittingly repress emotions and their associated instincts back into the unconscious. Repression, according to Rivers, is never adequate for removing conflict; it is only fruitful when a person can exert a conscious effort to do so. As a result, the repressed instincts, along with their associated emotions and memories, seep into consciousness when soldiers are sleeping. The result is <b>night</b> <b>terrors.</b>|$|E

25|$|A night terror, {{also known}} as a sleep terror or pavor nocturnus, is a parasomnia {{disorder}} that predominantly affects children, causing feelings of terror or dread. <b>Night</b> <b>terrors</b> {{should not be confused with}} nightmares, which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or fear.|$|E

The depiction of the nocturnal and predatory owls, however, have led many to believe the relief is an affirmation of Lilith’s role as a demon who flies about the underworld, delivering <b>night</b> <b>terrors</b> to those who sleep.|$|E

50|$|<b>Night</b> <b>terror,</b> {{also known}} as sleep terror, is a sleep disorder, causing {{feelings}} of terror or dread, and typically occurs during the first hours of stage 3-4 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleep terrors begin in {{children between the ages}} of 3 and 12, and usually stop during adolescence. In adults, they most commonly occur between the ages of 20 to 30. Though the frequency and severity vary between individuals, the episodes can occur in intervals of days or weeks, but can also occur over consecutive nights or multiple times in one night. This has created a situation in which any type of nocturnal attack or nightmare may be confused with and reported as a <b>night</b> <b>terror.</b>|$|R

Hand struggled with his name during his childhood and adulthood, worried that [...] "Billings" [...] and [...] "Learned" [...] were not sufficiently masculine.

She lived there with her mother, aunt, and grandparents who did not get along well and consistently spoke ill of her father, to her dismay. Her mother, whom Marjory characterized as [...] "high strung", was committed to a mental sanitarium in Providence several times. Her parents' separation and the contentious life with her mother's family caused her to suffer from <b>night</b> <b>terrors.</b> She credited her tenuous upbringing with making her [...] "a skeptic and a dissenter" [...] {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E

Rasa intended to use Gaara as the village's personal weapon, but Shukaku's bloodlust proved too much for Gaara as he suffered <b>night</b> <b>terrors</b> brought about by the tailed beast's influence. With Gaara's sand adding to his inability to control Shukaku, the boy became feared to the point his father decided to have him assassinated. Gaara has the belief that he could only rely upon himself and Shukaku, and that he had to kill others in order to confirm the value of his own existence. He thus became narcissistic, even permanently scarring his left temple with the kanji for [...] for his new drive.|$|E

500|$|A concept album, Man on the Moon: The End of Day is an autobiographical track {{series of}} moody dark {{material}} that is separated into five acts that all surround [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] with an arcane account. One reviewer summed up the story to be: [...] " [...] lonely guy sits in his room and dreams of success. He uses drugs to calm his fears and fend off <b>night</b> <b>terrors.</b> He eventually gets recognized as the star he always knew he was, and lives the superstar life… or maybe he's still dreaming about that stage of his life, and we're just witnessing what his dreams sound like." [...] According to Cudi, more lively songs had to be added so that listeners did not feel like they were listening to a [...] "slit-your-wrists album". It was observed by a reviewer that on Man on the Moon: The End of Day, Cudi neither raps nor sings, instead he goes [...] "puzzling through some third way: a sort of loose, hazily melodic talking." [...] Musical collaborators included Kanye West, Ratatat and MGMT, among others, and the record is narrated by Common. Lyrically, he raps about anxiety and his frequent nightmares.|$|E

This is the stage in which parasomnias such as <b>night</b> <b>terrors,</b> nocturnal enuresis, sleepwalking, and somniloquy occur. Many illustrations and descriptions still show a stage N3 with 20–50% delta waves and a stage N4 with greater than 50% delta waves; these have been combined as stage N3.|$|E
2500|$|The late antique magico-medical {{compilation}} Cyranides provides defensive spells {{against the}} [...] "frightful woman" [...] (horrida mulier) who attacks babies.

A cross or image of Christ might be placed by a child's bed to ward off Gello or demons in general; burning lamps to illuminate sacred images and incense were also used in the bedroom.

But there was one real good bright pleasure near, that would come before her misfortunes; and that was the birthday to be spent at the Wardours'. As to the present, Josephine had had the album in her pocket, and had never restored it, and Kate had begun to feel a distaste to the whole performance, to recollect its faults, and to be ashamed of the entire affair; but that was no reason she should not be very happy with her friends, who had promised {{to take her to the}} Zoological Gardens.|$|E
