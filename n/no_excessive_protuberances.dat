50|$|Multiple Elevation Scan Option for Supplemental Adaptive Intra-Volume Low-Level Scan (MESO-SAILS) is an {{enhancement}} to SAILS, {{which allows}} the radar operator to run one, two or three additional base scans {{during the course of}} a volume scan, per the operators request. During June 2013, the Radar Operations Center first tested SAILSx2, which adds two additional low-level scans per volume. It was executed for approximately 4 and 1/2 hours and during the testing, a Radar Technician observed the pedestal/antenna assembly's behavior. <b>No</b> <b>excessive</b> wear was noted to the assembly of the Radar.

40|$|Abstract. A second order forward {{differences}} based subdivision depth computation {{technique for}} extra-ordinary Catmull-Clark subdivision surface (CCSS) patches is presented. The new technique improves a previous technique {{in that the}} computation of the subdivision depth {{is based on the}} patch’s curvature distribution, instead of its dimension. Hence, with the new technique, <b>no</b> <b>excessive</b> subdivision is needed for extra-ordinary CCSS patches to meet the precision requirement and, consequently, one can make trimming, finite element mesh generation, boolean operations, and tessellation of CCSSs more efficient. ...|$|R

The duke preferred hunting and left the administration of his county in the hands his advisors. In 1697, he married Joanna Elisabeth of Baden-Durlach.|$|R
30|$|The {{main reason}} is that the {{distance}} between the transmitter and the receiver in these three areas is relatively close, and there is <b>no</b> <b>excessive</b> signal interference. However, the detection rates for the first three grids are lower because the three areas are far from the receiving end to the sending end with the interference of multipath effects such as tables and walls next to them. The results show that the detection rate of the PCA-Kalman method is higher than the other two systems.|$|R
30|$|When TEP {{takes into}} account a variety of {{uncertainties}} such as load and wind power output, a commonly used approach is using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to sample uncertainty scenarios. After simulation stops, EENS is obtained as the average or mean of unsupplied power in the simulation after solving the optimal power flow problems. Planning schemes selected by this method are optimal in the statistical sense, leading to low-probability scenarios being discounted [6]. Moreover, in practice, TEP investment costs may be very high to guarantee that there is <b>no</b> <b>excessive</b> load curtailment at all times.|$|R
