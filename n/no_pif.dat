40|$|We have {{measured}} the surface potential {{and the space}} charge generated during the first stages of atomic force microscopy field-induced oxidation. Space charge densities are about 1017  cm− 3 for oxidation times below 10 ms. In a dry atmosphere, the surface potential is negative. However, in humid air the surface potential could be either positive or negative. This effect is attributed to a screening effect of the water molecules. These results explain and {{support the use of}} local oxidation patterns as templates for building molecular architectures. They also establish the space charge build up as an intrinsic feature in local oxidation experiments.

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} evidence of plasmon-enhanced Kerr rotation in purely ferromagnetic membranes with sufficiently small dimensions {{to be out}} of extraordinary optical transmission conditions (45 nm pore diameter, 90 nm lattice constant), is reported in this work. It is shown that the spectral location of the enhanced Kerr rotation region varies as the refractive index of the material inside the pore is modified. A similar behavior is obtained if the pore radius changes while keeping the pore concentration unchanged. Those are clear signatures indicating that localized surface plasmon resonances propagating along the pores govern the magneto-optical response of the membraneWe acknowledge Spanish MICINN (Grant Nos.

40|$|We have {{observed}} {{the evolution of}} the accumulated stress during heteroepitaxial growth of highly lattice mismatched AlSb on GaAs by measuring the deformation of the substrate as a function of time. High resolution transmission electron microscopy images show almost all of the plastic relaxation is accommodated by an array of 90 Â° misfit dislocations at the interface. The in-plane lattice parameter of the resulting metamorphic AlSb is slightly smaller (0. 3 %) than the bulk value and perfectly matches the lattice parameter of bulk GaSb. It is, therefore, possible to grow nearly stress-free GaSb on GaAs using a metamorphic AlSb buffer layer. Â© 2012 American Institute of Physics. We acknowledge ﬁnancial support by MICINN (Grant Nos.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the incidence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of pelvic insufficiency fracture (PIF) {{in patients with}} cervical cancer. Materials and Methods: Between July 2004 and August 2009, 235 patients with non-metastatic cervical cancer were treated with definitive chemoradiation or postoperative radiotherapy. Among 235 patients, 117 (49. 8 %) underwent the first positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) within 1 year after radiotherapy. The median radiation dose was 55 Gy (range, 45 to 60 Gy). Medical charts and imaging studies, including PET/CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT, bone scintigraphy were reviewed to evaluate the patients with PIF. Results: Among 235 patients, 16 developed PIF. The 5 -year detection rate of PIF was 9. 5 %. The 5 -year detection rate of PIF in patients who underwent the first PET/CT within a year was 15. 6 %. The median time to development of PIF was 12. 5 months (range, 5 to 30 months). The sites of fracture included 12 sacroiliac joints, 3 pubic rami, 3 iliac bones, and 1 femoral neck. Eleven of 16 patients having PIF complained of hip pain requiring medications. One patient required hospitalization for pain control. The significant risk factors of PIF were old age, body mass index less than 23, bone mineral density less than- 3. 5 SD, and the first PET/ CT within a year after radiotherapy. Radiation dose and concurrent chemotherapy had <b>no</b> impact on <b>PIF</b> rate. Conclusion: PIFs were not rare after pelvic radiotherapy in cervical cancer patients {{in the era of}} PET/CT. Timely diagnosis and management of PIF can improve quality of life in patients with cervical cancer, in addition to reducing unnecessary medica...|$|R
40|$|A qualidade pós-colheita de pêssegos 'Marli', cultivados nos sistemas de produção integrada (PIF) ou convencional (PCF), foi avaliada durante três anos consecutivos. Os pêssegos foram colhidos em duas áreas distintas, em pomares comerciais, no Município de São Jerônimo, RS, e foram armazenados a 0, 5 ºC por 10, 20 ou 30 dias. Os pêssegos foram avaliados na colheita, nas retiradas do armazenamento e após os períodos de amadurecimento a 20 ºC. Não foram observadas diferenças na perda de peso entre os sistemas de produção. A ocorrência média de podridões foi baixa e sem diferenças entre os sistemas em 2001 e 2002, mas em 2000, os pêssegos da PCF apresentaram mais podridões. A firmeza da polpa foi {{superior}} <b>nos</b> pêssegos da <b>PIF</b> em 2000 e 2001. Em 2002, a firmeza pouco variou durante a armazenagem e o amadurecimento. Pêssegos da PIF apresentaram, em 2000, menores teores de sólidos solúveis e maior acidez titulável. Em 2000, observou-se escurecimento de polpa em frutos com podridões, sempre no amadurecimento após 20 ou 30 dias em frio. Danos por frio na forma de escurecimento, lanosidade e retenção de firmeza ocorreram em 2002. Não ocorreram diferenças entre os sistemas de produção quanto à qualidade dos pêssegos. Over {{three years}} the postharvest quality of 'Marli' peaches harvested from the integrated (IFP) and conventional production (CFP) systems was evaluated. The peaches were harvested from commercial orchards of Prunus persica at two locations {{close to the}} city of São Jerônimo, RS, Brazil, and stored at 0. 5 °C for 10, 20 or 30 days. The peaches were evaluated at harvest, at retrieval from storage and after ripening periods at 20 °C. No differences in fruit weight losses were determined. Decay incidence was low, and no differences were detected amongst systems in both 2001 and 2002 seasons, but in the 2000 season CFP peaches were more decayed. Flesh firmness of peaches from the IFP system were greater than CFP fruits in the years 2000 and 2001. In 2002, firmness changed little during storage and ripening. Peaches from the IFP in 2000 had higher titratable acidity and lower soluble solids. In the 2000 season, flesh browning was observed in decayed fruits, always at ripening after 20 or 30 days of cold storage Chilling injuries such as browning, woolliness and leatheriness ocurred in 2002. There were no differences amongst systems related to peach quality...|$|R
40|$|No {{studies have}} yet {{evaluated}} jointly central foveal thickness (CFT) {{and the presence}} of intraretinal fluid (PIF) to diagnose diabetic macular oedema (DMO) using optic coherence tomography (OCT). We performed a cross-sectional observational study to validate OCT for the diagnosis of DMO using both CFT and PIF assessed by OCT (3 D OCT- 1 Maestro). A sample of 277 eyes from primary care diabetic patients was assessed in a Spanish region in 2014. Outcome: DMO diagnosed by stereoscopic mydriatic fundoscopy. OCT was used to measure CFT and PIF. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to predict the outcome using CFT and PIF. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the model was calculated and non-linear equations used to determine which CFT values had a high probability of the outcome (positive test), distinguishing between {{the presence or absence of}} PIF. Calculations were made of the sensitivity, specificity, and the positive (PLR) and negative (NLR) likelihood ratios. The model was validated using bootstrapping methodology. A total of 37 eyes had DMO. AUC: 0. 88. Positive test: CFT ≥ 90 µm plus PIF (≥ 310 µm if <b>no</b> <b>PIF).</b> Clinical parameters: sensitivity, 0. 83; specificity, 0. 89; PLR, 7. 34; NLR, 0. 19. The parameters in the validation were similar. In conclusion, combining PIF and CFT provided a tool to very precisely discriminate the presence of DMO. Similar studies are needed to provide greater scientific evidence for the use of PIF in the diagnosis of DMO...|$|E
40|$|Baculoviruses orally infect {{caterpillars}} in {{the form}} of occlusion-derived viruses (ODVs). The ODV-envelope contains a number of proteins which are essential for oral infectivity, called per os infectivity factors (PIFs). Most of these PIFs are involved {{in the form}}ation of an ODV-entry complex that consists of a stable core, formed by PIF 1, PIF 2, PIF 3 and PIF 4, and the more loosely associated PIFs P 74 (PIF 0) and P 95 (PIF 8). PIF 1, PIF 2 and PIF 3 are essential for formation of the stable core, whereas deletion of the pif 4 gene results in the formation of a smaller complex. P 74 is not needed for formation of the stable core. We show here in larva-derived ODVs of the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus that PIF-proteins are degraded by host-derived proteases after deletion of a single pif-gene. Constituents of the stable core-complex appeared to be more resistant to proteases as part of the complex than as monomer, as in ODVs of a p 74 deletion mutant only the stable core was found but <b>no</b> <b>PIF</b> monomers. When the stable core lacks PIF 4, it lost its proteolytic resistance as the resulting smaller core complex was degraded in a pif 4 deletion mutant. We also identified PIF 6 as a loosely associated component of the entry complex that appeared nevertheless important for the proteolytic resistance of the stable core, which was degraded after deletion of pif 6. We conclude from these results that an intact entry-complex in the ODV-envelope is prerequisite for proteolytic resistance of PIF-proteins under the alkaline conditions of the larval midgut...|$|E
40|$|Implications Pre-implantation factor (PIF) has the {{potential}} to be a candidate treatment for endometritis. The present study demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects of PIF on normal endometrium. Further work is needed to assess effects of PIF following low dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Introduction Endometritis is a postpartum uterine infection affecting 5 - 26 % of dairy cows, caused by bacterial contamination of the uterus. LPS is an endotoxin of E. coli which is a commonly isolated pathogen of endometritis. There is a call for new endometritis treatments due to increases in antibiotic resistance. An anti-inflammatory agent may reduce the disease associated inflammation that causes infertility. Pre-implantation factor (PIF) is a pregnancy specific peptide, secreted from viable embryos. PIF has immune-modulatory roles within pregnancy and as such has been shown to modulate inflammation in mouse models of autoimmune diseases (Weiss et al., 2012). The present study aimed to assess the use of a pre-treatment of PIF on endometrial tissue explants before LPS stimulation to investigate the immune-modulatory role of PIF within a bovine model of E. coli endometritis. Material and methods Bovine uteri (n= 12; n= 6 dairy, n= 6 beef animals) with stage I corpus luteum and absence of endometrial inflammation were used. All animals were tested for the presence of inflammation at collection by taking a cytobrush smear. Smears were fixed and stained using Diff-Quick to assess for the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) present compared to uterine epithelial cells. Tissue was sampled from the ipsilateral uterine horn to the corpus luteum. Weighed tissue explants were pre-treated with media alone or PIF at 50, 100 or 500 nM for 24 hrs, then with media alone, LPS (1 ?g/ml), PIF (50, 100 or 500 nM) or LPS (1 ?g/ml) with PIF (50, 100 or 500 nM) for a further 48 hrs Media samples were collected 24 and 48 hrs post LPS challenge and PGF 2 ?, PGE 2 and IL- 6 measured via radioimmunoassays and ELISA. Data were expressed as secretion per mg of tissue and analysed using an analysis of variance, with treatment and cow type as main effects. Conclusion PIF was shown to interact with the IL- 6 pathway in un-stimulated endometrial tissue at 100 nM and 500 nM. There was <b>no</b> effect of <b>PIF</b> on PGE 2 or PGF 2 ? secretion, or LPS stimulated IL- 6 secretion. However, the latter may be due to the high dose of LPS used. A lower concentration of LPS will be used in future experiments to further test the effect of PIF. Research is needed to establish effects of PIF on components of IL- 6 pathway. Furthermore, cytokines other than IL- 6 should be investigated to assess the effect of PIF on other aspects of the TLR 4 stimulation pathway. Earlier sample time points should be tested due to the half -life of PIF being short, at ~ 45 min in circulation.
