5|$|El Salvador {{hosted the}} 2007 UNCAF Nations Cup. The tournament changed formats, <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> two–round {{system with a}} group stage {{followed}} by a knockout–style competition for the remaining four teams. There were still two groups and the top two teams still advanced from each group for the first round. El Salvador topped their group with wins over Belize (2–1), Nicaragua (2–1), and a draw with Guatemala (0–0). In the semifinals El Salvador lost to the eventual champions Costa Rica 0–1. In the third place playoff they lost 0–1 to Guatemala but nonetheless qualified for the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup (as now 5 Central American teams qualified for the Gold Cup). The team was coached by Carlos de los Cobos. At the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup they were drawn into four–team Group B with Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States. They defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2–1 in their opening match with goals from Ramón Sánchez (38') and Dennis Alas (81'), but this was their only win of the tournament. They lost the following two matches against Guatemala 0–1 and United States 0–4 and exited the tournament.|$|E

25|$|The Dalhousie Springs {{complex in}} Australia had a peak total flow {{of more than}} 23,000liters/second in 1915, giving the average spring in the complex an output of more than 325liters/second.

500|$|Many {{cultures}} have stories describing {{the origin of}} the world and universe. Cultures generally regard these stories as having some truth. There are however many differing beliefs in how these stories apply amongst those believing in a supernatural origin, ranging from a god directly creating the Universe as it is <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> god just setting the [...] "wheels in motion" [...] (for example via mechanisms such as the big bang and evolution).|$|E
2500|$|Although the Epping Forest Act almost {{certainly}} saved the forest from total destruction, {{it has to}} some extent had a deleterious effect on the area's biodiversity. The pollarded trees allowed light through to the woodland floor, increasing the numbers of low-growing plants. Since the Act, the vast crowns of the pollards cut {{out most of the}} light to the underbrush. [...] In addition, the area surrounding the forest is <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> great extent urbanised; the corresponding reduction in grazing has led to former areas of grassland and heathland being overcome by secondary woodland – this has been exacerbated by the majority of the forest's deer being enclosed to prevent impacts with vehicles on the major roads that run through the forest. In recent years, the Conservators have experimented with pollarding in selected areas of the forest, and a herd of English Longhorn cattle has been reintroduced to graze the heathland and grassland.|$|E

2500|$|... 2 February 2005: The IRA {{issued a}} {{statement}} summarizing their [...] "ambitious initiatives designed to develop or save the peace process", including three occasions {{in which they had}} complied with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning in putting weapons beyond use. The statement went on to say, [...] "At this time it appears that the two governments are intent on changing the basis of the peace process. They claim that 'the obstacle <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lasting and durable settlement… is the continuing terrorist and criminal activity of the IRA'. We reject this. It also belies the fact that a possible agreement last December was squandered by both governments pandering to rejectionist unionism instead of upholding their own commitments and honouring their own obligations." [...] The statement concluded with two points: [...] "We are taking all our proposals off the table" [...] and [...] "It is our intention to closely monitor ongoing developments and to protect {{to the best of our}} ability the rights of republicans and our support base".|$|E
