60|$|As the Coercion Bill {{coming from}} the Lords {{appeared}} on the paper {{of the day in}} the form of a notice of motion, the Secretary of State, this being a day on which orders have precedence, had to move that such orders of the day should be postponed, so that he might proceed with the motion on the state of Ireland, of which notice had been given. The strict rule of the House is, that on Mondays and Fridays, orders of the day should have precedence of <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> so that it was impossible for the Secretary of State to make his motion, that a certain bill (the Protection of Life--Ireland--Bill) should be read a first time without permission of the House, a permission always granted as a matter of course on such nights to the government, since the business which can be brought forward, whether in the shape of orders or motions, is purely government business, and thus the interests and privilege of no independent member of Parliament can be affected by a relaxation of the rules which the convenience of a ministry and the conduct of public business occasionally require. However, on this night, no sooner had the Secretary of State made, in a few formal words, this formal request, than up sprang Sir William Somerville to move an amendment, that the orders of the day should not be postponed, which he supported in a spirited address, mainly on the ground of the great inconvenience that must be suffered from the postponement of the Corn Bill. The motion of the Secretary of State would produce a long, exciting, and exasperating debate. Time would be lost--for what? To advance one stage of a measure which it was avowedly not the intention of the government to press at the present moment. Sir William concluded with a very earnest appeal to Lord George Bentinck and his friends, who might at no very distant period have the government of Ireland entrusted to them, not, for the sake of a momentary postponement of the Corn Bill, to place themselves, by voting for this measure of coercion, in collision with the Irish nation.' He called upon Lord George Bentinck to weigh the position in which he was placed.|$|E

This occasion, the seventy-fifth anniversary of Edith Cowan 2 ̆ 7 s {{election to the}} Legislative Assembly, was immediately followed by a breakfast at the nearby Parliament of Western Australia. During the evening a touring exhibition of Edith Cowan 2 ̆ 7 s life was launched titled 2 ̆ 2 A Tough Nut to Crack 2 ̆ 2. Then five days later Professor Geoffrey Bolton spoke at St George 2 ̆ 7 s Cathedral to celebrate a 2 ̆ 2 Life of Service 2 ̆ 2 by Edith Cowan. The Voice of Edith Cowan is another contribution to the anniversary. The publication focuses upon {{her role as a}} parliamentarian. What, too, was the content of her speeches? How did she conduct herself as a parliamentarian? What was her legislative contribution? What was her impact as a politician? In an introductory essay tentative answers have been formulated to these questions. Edith Cowan 2 ̆ 7 s parliamentary speeches have been organised by firstly recording each of her annual Address-in-Reply Speeches. This has been followed by the two private member 2 ̆ 7 s Bills (Administration Act Amendment Bill and Women 2 ̆ 7 s Legal Status Bill) she piloted through the Legislative Assembly. Her participation in a range of legislative measures, in subject alphabetical order, then follow. The Parliamentary Questions which Edith Cowan directed to Minister 2 ̆ 7 s are then presented before her <b>Notices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> and Complimentary Remarks.

40|$|In 2011 {{there were}} {{increases}} in rape cases, and theft/fraud/robbery cases and decreases in murder cases, drugs cases and road traffic {{cases in the}} criminal courts. In the civil courts, there were increases across all jurisdictions in applications relating to the recovery of debt though there were decreases in applications for possession in the High Court and applications for committal for non payment of debt, in the District Court. In the family courts there was little change in the numbers applying for judicial separation and divorce - with wives applying {{for the majority of}} both. There was a significant reduction in drink driving and other driving offences at District Court level. Judicial and administrative responses to the resources issue •	In the Supreme Court a number of list management initiatives were introduced to address the delay in the hearing of cases and the delivery of judgments. These included the categorisation of appeals where common issues of law arose and the sitting of the Court in two divisions. •	The President of the High Court scheduled additional sittings of the High Court, with the voluntary assistance of High Court Judges, during September 2011. This resulted in the disposal of over 300 additional common law matters. That and the allocation of an extra judge from the following month on helped reduce the waiting time for motions for judgment from 20 weeks to nine weeks. •	The High Court also assumed the hearing of <b>Notices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Motion</b> seeking an order for discovery, previously dealt with by the Master of the High Court. This measure reduced the waiting time in the Master’s Court from 26 weeks to eight weeks. •	The President of the Circuit Court assigned extra judges to deal with criminal cases in 13 provincial venues - thus reducing waiting times in those areas, and bringing justice in a timely manner. •	The President of the District Court scheduled additional sittings in Dublin in August and September to further reduce waiting times. She also facilitated the extension of the catchment area of the Drug Treatment Court - allowing for more people to avail of its resources to restore them as citizens and to restore them to he community. •	Additional adjudicative functions were transferred by Statute to county registrars during the year, which also saw the appointment of five county registrars as vice chairs of the Employment Appeals Tribunal. •	Twenty court venues were amalgamated in 2011 freeing up judicial and staff time to hear extra cases, allocate specific family law and children’s hearings, and reduce waiting times. Drug Treatment Court (page 20) The catchment area for the Drug Treatment Court (DTC) was extended during the year to include participants from additional areas of Dublin. There were four graduations from the third and final (gold) phase of the DTC programme with others completing the first (bronze) and second (silver) phases.
