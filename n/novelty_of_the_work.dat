6000|$|By {{the time}} that the work was done it was midnight, and the Warreners' turn for guard. They had {{received}} rifles, and were posted with six others in the battery. There were three guns here, all of which were loaded to the muzzle with grape; three artillerymen, wrapped in their cloaks, lay asleep beside them, for the number of artillerymen was so small that the men were continually on duty, snatching what sleep they could by their guns during the intervals of fighting. The orders were to listen attentively for the sound of the movement of any body of men, and to fire occasionally at the flashes of the enemy's guns. The four hours passed rapidly, for the <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> the thunder of cannon and crackling of musketry, all round the Residency, were so exciting that the Warreners were surprised when the relief arrived. They retired to their room, and were soon asleep; but in an hour the alarm was sounded, and the whole force at the post rushed to repel an attack. Heralded by a storm of fire from every gun which could be brought to bear upon the battery, thousands of fanatics rushed from the shelter of the houses outside the intrenchments and swarmed down upon it. The garrison lay quiet behind the parapet until the approach of the foe caused the enemy's cannon to cease their fire. Then they leaped to their feet and poured a volley into the mass. So great were their numbers, however, that the gaps were closed in a moment, and with yells and shouts the enemy leaped into the ditch, and tried to climb the earthwork of the battery. Fortunately at this moment the reserve of fifty men of the Thirty-second, which were always kept ready to launch at any threatened point, came up at a run, and their volley over the parapet staggered the foe. Desperately their leaders called upon them to climb the earthworks, but the few who succeeded in doing so were bayoneted and thrown back into the ditch, while a continuous musketry fire was poured into the crowd. Over and over again the guns, charged with grape, swept lines through their ranks, and at last, dispirited and beaten, they fell back again to the shelter from which they had emerged. The Thirty-second men then returned to the brigade messroom, and the garrison of the fort were about to turn in when Mr. Gubbins said cheerfully: ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> has waned, and [...] "Wellingtons Victory" [...] is not {{performed}} much today. Many critics lump it into {{a category}} of so-called [...] "battle pieces", along with Tchaikovskys 1812 Overture and Liszts Hunnenschlacht (Battle of the Huns): Charles Rosen wrote that Beethovens contribution lacks the serious pretentiousness or the incorporation of ideology of Mendelssohns Reformation Symphony, or of Berlioz Symphonie funèbre et triomphale, {{but it is only}} the less interesting for its modesty.|$|E

5000|$|An {{abstract}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{costs in}} Dummer's 1694 account amounted to £50,000, {{but he was}} at pains {{to point out that}} this was because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatness and <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works,</b> which overcame <b>the</b> deficiencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other yards. Obstructions had been brought about because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> irregular cash flow, <b>the</b> weakness <b>of</b> contracts and [...] "the imbecile stock of a private man under <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> so chargeable a work" [...] (probably referring to the stonemason Robert Waters who was also blamed by Dummer for problems with <b>the</b> <b>works),</b> not {{to mention the fact that}} the country was at war. Increases on the original estimate (£23,406 in 1692, which nearly tripled by 1698) had, he maintained with some aplomb, been made purposefully by stealth so that they would be borne more easily, rather than by demanding too great a lump sum and getting rejected at the outset.|$|R
5000|$|Pomone (Pomona) is a {{pastoral}} opera in a prologue and five acts by Robert Cambert with a libretto by Pierre Perrin. It {{has been described}} as [...] "effectively the first French opera." [...] It was first performed in Paris at the Jeu de Paume de la Bouteille theatre belonging to Cambert and Perrin's Académie d'Opéra on 3 March 1671. The production had ballets choreographed by Des Brosses and sets and machinery designed by Alexandre de Rieux, marquis de Sourdéac. The <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> drew large audiences and the opera enjoyed 146 performances over the eight months of its run. The score of Pomone has only partially survived.|$|E
50|$|Roskopf met {{indifference}} {{and hostility}} among the watchmakers {{of the area}} who were still working as a home industry and who {{did not wish to}} make a watch such as he was offering. It is said, that in 1866 Roskopf ordered two boxes of ebauches from Emile Roulet and asked Gustave Rosselet to make escapements; both refused to take his orders because of the <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> He finally succeeded in producing a watch in 1867, using ebauches and cases from the Malleray Watch Co., and parts from many other makers, and having them assembled in Damprichard, Doubs, France, by M. Chatelain. The original order to Malleray Watch Co., was 2000 pieces. By the end of 1867 he was in business and by 1870 he had ordered 20,000 ebauches.|$|E
50|$|The Liebeslieder Waltzes {{continue}} to be performed quite frequently, with at least four performances in 2013 alone The “ad libitum” of the original score allows for different ensemble sizes to perform the Liebeslieder Waltzes Op. 52 {{as opposed to the}} Liebeslieder Waltzes, Op. 65, which is usually performed solely by a choir; there is also versatility found in the opus with the four-hand arrangement of Liebeslieder Waltzes Opus 52a and the elimination of a vocal ensemble. The sixth and eleventh movements are some of the better-known pieces from the work due to their adaptation to choral works. The Liebeslieder Waltzes suit current day audiences because of the brevity of the movements along with the <b>novelty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> within Brahms’ outpourings. The movements are all relatively short and encompass a variety of emotions and moods. It also is a distinct piece since Brahms did not regularly compose for small vocal ensembles and piano. Brahms usually wrote vocal - particularly choral - pieces for choir and organ or choir and orchestra, thus the presence of a piano accompaniment in the Liebeslieder Waltzes adds to the uniqueness of the piece.|$|E
