40|$|SummaryNeuronal arborization is {{regulated}} by cell-autonomous and nonautonomous mechanisms including endosomal signaling via BDNF/TrkB. The endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE 6) is mutated {{in a new}} autism-related disorder. NHE 6 functions to permit proton leak from endosomes, yet the mechanisms causing disease are unknown. We demonstrate that loss of NHE 6 results in overacidification of the endosomal compartment and attenuated TrkB signaling. Mouse brains with disrupted NHE 6 display reduced axonal and dendritic branching, synapse number, and circuit strength. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that the proton leak function of NHE 6 is required for <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization.</b> We find that TrkB receptor colocalizes to NHE 6 -associated endosomes. TrkB protein and phosphorylation are reduced in NHE 6 mutant neurons in response to BDNF signaling. Finally, exogenous BDNF rescues defects in <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization.</b> We propose that NHE 6 mutation leads to circuit defects that are {{in part due to}} impoverished <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> that may be treatable by enhanced TrkB signaling...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of wild-type, mutant and loss of leucine-rich repeat kinase- 2 (LRRK 2; Lrrk 2) on dendritic <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization.</b> BACKGROUND: LRRK 2 mutations are recognized as the major genetic determinant of susceptibility to Parkinson's disease for which a cellular assay of Lrrk 2 mutant function would facilitate the development of targeted molecular therapeutics. METHODS: Dendritic <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> (neurite length, branching {{and the number of}} processes per cell) was quantified in primary hippocampal and midbrain cultures derived from five lines of recombinant LRRK 2 mice, including human BAC wild-type and mutant overexpressors (Y 1699 C and G 2019 S), murine knock-out and G 2019 S knock-in animals. RESULTS: <b>Neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> in cultures from BAC Lrrk 2 wild-type animals is comparable to non-transgenic littermate controls, despite high levels of human transgene expression. In contrast, primary neurons from both BAC mutant overexpressors presented with significantly reduced neuritic outgrowth and branching, although the total number of processes per cell remained comparable. The mutant-specific toxic gain-of-function observed in cultures from BAC mutant mice may be partially rescued by staurosporine treatment, a non-specific kinase inhibitor. In contrast, <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> is far more extensive in neuronal cultures derived from murine knock-out mice that lack endogenous Lrrk 2 expression. In Lrrk 2 G 2019 S knock-in mice, arguably the most physiologically relevant system, neuritic arborization is not impaired. CONCLUSIONS: Impairment of neuritic arborization is an exaggerated, albeit mutant specific, consequence of Lrrk 2 over-expression in primary cultures. The phenotype and assay described provides a means to develop therapeutic agents that modulate the toxic gain-of-function conferred by mutant Lrrk 2...|$|E

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of human populations suffer memory impairments either caused by normal aging or afflicted by diverse neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Memory enhancers and other drugs tested so far against memory loss have failed to produce therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials and thus, {{there is a need}} to find remedy for this mental disorder. In search for cure of memory loss, our laboratory discovered a robust memory enhancer called RGS 14 (414). A treatment in brain with its gene produces an enduring effect on memory that lasts for lifetime of rats. Therefore, current thesis work was designed to investigate whether RGS 14 (414) treatment can prevent memory loss and furthermore, explore through biological processes responsible for RGS-mediated memory enhancement. We found that RGS 14 (414) gene treatment prevented episodic memory loss in rodent models of normal aging and Alzheimer´s disease. A memory loss was observed in normal rats at 18 months of age; however, when they were treated with RGS 14 (414) gene at 3 months of age, they abrogated this deficit and their memory remained intact till the age of 22 months. In addition to normal aging rats, effect of memory enhancer treatment in mice model of Alzheimer´s disease (AD-mice) produced a similar effect. AD-mice subjected to treatment with RGS 14 (414) gene at the age of 2 months, a period when memory was intact, showed not only a prevention in memory loss observed at 4 months of age but also they were able to maintain normal memory after 6 months of the treatment. We posit that long-lasting effect on memory enhancement and prevention of memory loss mediated through RGS 14 (414) might be due to a permanent structural change caused by a surge in neuronal connections and enhanced neuronal remodeling, key processes for long-term memory formation. A <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> analysis of both pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons in brain of RGS 14 (414) -treated rats exhibited robust rise in neurites outgrowth of both kind of cells, and an increment in number of branching from the apical dendrite of pyramidal neurons, reaching to almost three times of the control animals. To further understand of underlying mechanism by which RGS 14 (414) induces <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization,</b> we investigated into neurotrophic factors. We observed that RGS 14 treatment induces a selective increase in BDNF. Role of BDNF in <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization,</b> as well as its implication in learning and memory processes is well described. In addition, our results showing a dynamic expression pattern of BDNF during ORM processing that overlapped with memory consolidation further support the idea of the implication of this neurotrophin in formation of long-term memory in RGS-animals. On the other hand, in studies of expression profiling of RGS-treated animals, we have demonstrated that 14 - 3 - 3 ζ protein displays a coherent relationship to RGS-mediated ORM enhancement. Recent studies have demonstrated that the interaction of receptor for activated protein kinase 1 (RACK 1) with 14 - 3 - 3 ζ is essential for its nuclear translocation, where RACK 1 - 14 - 3 - 3 ζ complex binds at promotor IV region of BDNF and promotes an increase in BDNF gene transcription. These observations suggest that 14 - 3 - 3 ζ might regulate the elevated level of BDNF seen in RGS 14 (414) gene treated animals. Therefore, it seems that RGS-mediated surge in 14 - 3 - 3 ζ causes elevated BDNF synthesis needed for <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> and enhanced ORM. The prevention of memory loss might be mediated through a restoration in BDNF and 14 - 3 - 3 ζ protein levels, which are significantly decreased in aging and Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, our results demonstrate that RGS 14 (414) treatment could be a viable strategy against episodic memory loss...|$|E

Inducible Braf knockout mice, which exhibit protein depletion in principle forebrain neurons, enabled us to unravel a new role of neuronal MAPK signaling for emotional behavior. Braf mice that were induced during adulthood showed normal anxiety but increased depression-like behavior, in accordance with pharmacological findings. In contrast, the inducible or constitutive inactivation of Braf in the juvenile brain leads to normal depression-like behavior but decreased anxiety in adults. In juvenile, constitutive mutants we found no alteration of GABAergic neurotransmission but reduced <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> in the dentate gyrus. Analysis of gene expression in the hippocampus revealed nine downregulated MAPK target genes that represent candidates to cause the mutant phenotype.

40|$|IgLON {{proteins}} are GPI anchored adhesion {{molecules that}} control neurite outgrowth. In particular, Negr 1 down-regulation negatively influences <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, {{we found that}} the metalloprotease ADAM 10 releases Negr 1 from neuronal membrane. Ectodomain shedding influences several neuronal mechanisms, includingsurvival, synaptogenesis and the formation of neurite trees. By combining morphological analysis and virus-mediated selective protein silencing in primary murine cortical neurons, we found that pharmacologically inhibition of ADAM 10 results in an impairment of neurite tree maturation that can be rescued upon treatment with soluble Negr 1. Furthermore, we report that released Negr 1 influences neurite outgrowth in a P-ERK 1 / 2 and FGFR 2 dependent manner. Together our findings suggest a role for Negr 1 in regulating neurite outgrowth through the modulation of FGFR 2 signalling pathway. Given the physiological and pathological role of ADAM 10, Negr 1 and FGFR 2, the regulation of Negr 1 shedding may {{play a crucial role in}} sustaining brain function and development...|$|E

40|$|The way {{in which}} a {{neuronal}} tree expands {{plays an important role in}} its functional and computational characteristics. We aimed to study the existence of an optimal neuronal design for different types of cortical GABAergic neurons. To do this, we hypothesized that both the axonal and dendritic trees of individual neurons optimize brain connectivity in terms of wiring length. We took the branching points of real three-dimensional neuronal reconstructions of the axonal and dendritic trees of different types of cortical interneurons and searched for the minimal wiring arborization structure that respects the branching points. We compared the minimal wiring arborization with real axonal and dendritic trees. We tested this optimization problem using a new approach based on graph theory and evolutionary computation techniques. We concluded that neuronal wiring is near-optimal in most of the tested neurons, although the wiring length of dendritic trees is generally nearer to the optimum. Therefore, wiring economy is related to the {{way in which}} <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborizations</b> grow irrespective of the marked differences in the morphology of the examined interneurons...|$|R
40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to the characterization of neural cells by means of semi-automated generation of dendrograms; data structures which describe the inherently hierarchical nature of <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborizations.</b> Dendrograms describe the branched structure of neurons in terms of the length, average thickness and bending energy of each of the dendritic segments and allow in a straightforward manner, the inclusion of additional measures. The bending energy quantifies the complexity of the shape and can be used to characterize the spatial coverage of the arborizations (the bending energy is an alternative for other complexity measures such as the fractal dimension). The new approach is based on the partitioning of the cell's outer contour {{as a function of the}} high curvature points followed by a syntactical analysis of the segmented contours. The semi-automated method is robust and is an improvement on the time consuming manual generation of the dendrograms. Several experimental results are included in this paper which illustrate and corroborate the effectiveness of the approach.

40|$|Neuronal {{survival}} and morphological maturation {{depends on the}} action of the transcription factor calcium responsive element binding protein (CREB), which regulates expression of several target genes in an activity-dependent manner. However, it remains largely unknown whether CREB-mediated transcription could play a role at early stages of neuronal differentiation, prior to the establishment of functional synaptic contacts. Here, we show that CREB is phosphorylated at very early stages of neuronal differentiation in vivo and in vitro, {{even in the absence of}} depolarizing agents. Using genetic tools, we also show that inhibition of CREB-signaling affects neuronal growth and survival in vitro without affecting cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Expression of A-CREB or M-CREB, 2 dominant-negative inhibitors of CREB, decreases cell {{survival and}} the complexity of <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization.</b> Similar changes are observed in neurons treated with protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors, which also show decreased levels of pCREBSer 133. Notably, expression of CREB-FY, a Tyr 134 Phe CREB mutant with a lower Km for phosphorylation, partly rescues the effects of PKA and CaMKII inhibition. Our data indicate that CREB-mediated signaling play important roles at early stages of cortical neuron differentiation, prior to the establishment of fully functional synaptic contacts...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNeurotrophins, via {{activation}} of Trk receptor tyrosine kinases, serve as mitogens, survival factors and regulators of arborization during retinal development. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB regulate <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> and survival in late retinal development. However, TrkB is expressed during early retinal development where its functions are unclear. To assess TrkB/BDNF {{actions in the}} early chick retina, replication-incompetent retroviruses were utilized to over-express a dominant negative truncated form of TrkB (trunc TrkB), or BDNF and effects were assessed at E 15. Clones expressing trunc TrkB were smaller than controls, and proliferation and apoptosis assays suggest that decreased clone size correlated with increased cell death when BDNF/TrkB signaling was impaired. Analysis of clonal composition revealed that trunc TrkB over-expression decreased photoreceptor numbers (41 %) and increased cell numbers in the middle third of the inner nuclear layer (INL) (23 %). Conversely, BDNF over-expression increased photoreceptor numbers (25 %) and decreased INL numbers (17 %). Photoreceptors over-expressing trunc TrkB demonstrated no increase in apoptosis nor abnormalities in lamination suggesting that TrkB activation is not required for photoreceptor cell survival or migration. These studies suggest that TrkB signaling regulates commitment to and/or differentiation of photoreceptor cells from retinal progenitor cells, identifying a novel role for TrkB/BDNF in regulating cell fate decisions...|$|E
40|$|Cell to cell {{communication}} in {{the central nervous system}} is encoded into transient and local membrane potential changes (ΔVm). Deciphering the rules that govern synaptic transmission and plasticity entails to be able to perform Vm recordings throughout the entire <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization.</b> Classical electrophysiology is, in most cases, not able to do so within small and fragile neuronal subcompartments. Thus, optical techniques based on the use of fluorescent voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) have been developed. However, reporting spontaneous or small ΔVm from neuronal ramifications has been challenging, in part due to the limited sensitivity and phototoxicity of VSD-based optical measurements. Here we demonstrate the use of water soluble VSD, ANNINE- 6 plus, with laser scanning microscopy to optically record ΔVm in cultured neurons. We show that the sensitivity (> 10 % of fluorescence change for 100 mV depolarization) and time response (submillisecond) of the dye allows the robust detection of action potentials (APs) even without averaging, allowing the measurement of spontaneous neuronal firing patterns. In addition, we show that back-propagating APs can be recorded, along distinct dendritic sites and within dendritic spines. Importantly, our approach does not induce any detectable phototoxic effect on cultured neurons. This optophysiological approach provides a simple, minimally invasive and versatile optical method to measure electrical activity in cultured neurons with high temporal (ms) resolution and high spatial (&# 181;m) resolution...|$|E

The tarsus of the front legs (olfactory nerves) and the fourth palpal segment (gustatory nerves) of unfed Amblyomma americanum males and females were excised. A neuronal tracer, dextran tetramethylrhodamine, was used for filling of the sensory neurons. The synganglion preparations were examined using a confocal microscope. <b>Neuronal</b> <b>arborizations</b> from the Haller&# 8217;s organ were confined to the olfactory lobes and the first pedal ganglion. The estimated number of olfactory glomeruli ranged from 16 to 22 per olfactory lobe in the females. The number of glomeruli was not counted in males because they were densely packed. Sensory neurons associated with sensilla at the distal end of the palpal organ projected into the palpal ganglion in the synganglion through the palpal nerve. Gustatory sensory neurons associated with palpal sensilla projected into a commissure with several bulges, which are confined in the palpal ganglion.

Consequently, lncRNAs could help us bring together apparent unrelated findings in schizophrenia; namely, genomic deficiencies on one side and neuroimaging, as well as postmortem results on the other. In fact, the most consistent finding in schizophrenia is decreased brain size together with enlarged ventricles. This anomaly appears to originate from shorter and less ramified dendrites and axons. But a decrease in <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborizations</b> cannot explain the complex pathophysiology of this psychotic disorder; however, dynamic changes in neuronal structure present throughout life could.

What the neuroscientific field is still trying to understand is how these dynamic changes are regulated and lncRNAs represent promising candidates to fill this knowledge gap. Here, we present evidence that associates specific lncRNAs with schizophrenia. We then discuss the potential role of lncRNAs in neurostructural dynamics.

This age-related neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by brain atrophy in the frontal and temporal lobes and such typical symptoms as cognitive and memory impairment, profound behavioral abnormalities, and personality changes {{is thought to be}} related to connectome dysfunctions. Recently, PGRN reduction has been found to induce a behavioral phenotype reminiscent of FTLD symptoms in mice by affecting neuron spine density and morphology, suggesting that the protein can influence neuronal structural plasticity. Here, we evaluated whether a partial haploinsufficiency-like PGRN depletion, achieved by using RNA interference in primary mouse cortical neurons, could modulate GluN 2 B-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and tau phosphorylation, which are crucially involved in the regulation of the structural plasticity of these cells. In addition, we studied the effect of PGRN decrease on neuronal cell arborization both in the presence and absence of GluN 2 B-containing NMDA receptor stimulation. We found that PGRN decline diminished GluN 2 B-containing NMDA receptor levels and density as well as NMDA-dependent tau phosphorylation. These alterations were accompanied by a marked drop in <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> that was prevented by an acute GluN 2 B-containing NMDA receptor stimulation. Our findings support that PGRN decrease, resulting from pathogenic mutations, might compromise the trophism of cortical neurons by affecting GluN 2 B-contaning NMDA receptors.

40|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinemia}} is {{a common}} condition {{in the first week}} of postnatal life. Although generally harmless, some neonates may develop very high levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), which may surpass the protective mechanisms of the brain at preventing UCB accumulation. In this case, both short-term and long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities, such as acute and chronic UCB encephalopathy, known as kernicterus, or more subtle alterations designed as bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) may be produced. There is a tremendous variability in babies’ vulnerability towards UCB for reasons not yet explained, but preterm birth, sepsis, hypoxia and haemolytic disease are comprised as risk factors. Therefore, UCB levels and neurological abnormalities are not strictly correlated. Even nowadays, the mechanisms of UCB neurotoxicity are still unclear, as are specific biomarkers, and little is known about lasting sequelae attributable to hyperbilirubinemia. On autopsy, UCB was shown to be within neurons, neuronal processes and microglia, and to produce loss of neurons, demyelination and gliosis. In isolated cell cultures, UCB was shown to impair <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> and to induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from microglia and astrocytes. However, cell dependent-sensitivity to UCB toxicity and the role of each nerve cell type remain understood. This review provides a comprehensive insight into cell susceptibilities and molecular targets of UCB in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, and on phenotypic and functional responses of microglia to UCB. Interplay among glia elements and cross-talk with neurons, with a special emphasis in the UCB-induced immunostimulation, and the role of sepsis in BIND pathogenesis are highlighted.

There are no drugs available to prevent or treat chemotherapy-induced cognitive deficits. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish a mouse model of cisplatin-induced cognitive deficits and to determine the potential preventive effects of the anti-diabetic drug metformin. Treatment of C 57 /BL 6 J mice with cisplatin (cumulative dose 34. 5 mg/kg) impaired performance in the novel object and place recognition task as well as in the social discrimination task indicating cognitive deficits. Co-administration of metformin prevented these cisplatin-induced cognitive impairments. At the structural level, we demonstrate that cisplatin reduces coherency of white matter fibers in the cingulate cortex. Moreover, the number of dendritic spines and <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborizations</b> as quantified on Golgi-stained brains was reduced after cisplatin treatment. Co-administration of metformin prevented all of these structural abnormalities in cisplatin-treated mice. In contrast to what has been reported in other models of chemobrain, we do not have evidence for persistent microglial or astrocyte activation in the brains of cisplatin-treated mice. Finally, we show that co-administration of metformin also protects against cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. In summary, we show here for the first time that treatment of mice with cisplatin induces cognitive deficits that are associated with structural abnormalities in the brain. Moreover, we present the first evidence that the widely used and safe anti-diabetic drug metformin protects against these deleterious effects of cancer treatment.

VAChT-immuno-reactive fibers and terminals were also visualized in these regions and in hippocampus, at neuromuscular junctions within skeletal muscle, and in sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic ganglia and target tissues. Cholinergic nerve terminals contain more VAChT than ChAT immunoreactivity after routine fixation, consistent with a concentration of VAChT within terminal <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborizations</b> in which secretory vesicles are clustered. These include VAChT-positive terminals of the median eminence or the hypothalamus, not observed with ChAT antiserum after routine fixation. Subcellular localization of VAChT in specific organelles in neuronal cells was examined by immunoelectron microscopy in a rat neuronal cell line (PC 12 -c 4) expressing VAChT as well as the endocrine and neuronal forms of the vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT 1 and VMAT 2). VAChT is targeted to small synaptic vesicles, while VMAT 1 is found mainly but not exclusively on large dense-core vesicles. VMAT 2 is found on large dense-core vesicles but not on the small synaptic vesicles that contain VAChT in PC 12 -c 4 cells, despite the presence of VMAT 2 immunoreactivity in central and peripheral nerve terminals known to contain monoamines in small synaptic vesicles.

40|$|Background: De novo loss-of-function (dnLoF) {{mutations}} {{are found}} twofold {{more often in}} autism spectrum disorder (ASD) probands than their unaffected siblings. Multiple independent dnLoF mutations in the same gene implicate the gene in risk and hence provide a systematic, albeit arduous, path forward for ASD genetics. It is likely that using additional non-genetic data will enhance the ability to identify ASD genes. Methods. To accelerate the search for ASD genes, we developed a novel algorithm, DAWN, to model two kinds of data: rare variations from exome sequencing and gene co-expression in the mid-fetal prefrontal and motor-somatosensory neocortex, a critical nexus for risk. The algorithm casts the ensemble data as a hidden Markov random field in which the graph structure is determined by gene co-expression and it combines these interrelationships with node-specific observations, namely gene identity, expression, genetic data and the estimated effect on risk. Results: Using currently available genetic data and a specific developmental time period for gene co-expression, DAWN identified 127 genes that plausibly affect risk, {{and a set of}} likely ASD subnetworks. Validation experiments making use of published targeted resequencing results demonstrate its efficacy in reliably predicting ASD genes. DAWN also successfully predicts known ASD genes, not included in the genetic data used to create the model. Conclusions: Validation studies demonstrate that DAWN is effective in predicting ASD genes and subnetworks by leveraging genetic and gene expression data. The findings reported here implicate neurite extension and <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> as risks for ASD. Using DAWN on emerging ASD sequence data and gene expression data from other brain regions and tissues would likely identify novel ASD genes.

Using primary melanocyte cultures, we assessed for UVR-mediated alterations in over 47, 000 transcripts using Affymetrix Human Genome U 133 Plus 2. 0 microarrays. From the 100 most statistically robust changes in transcript level, there were 84 genes that were suppressed > 2. 0 -fold by UVR; among these transcripts, the identities of 48 of these genes were known. Similarly, there were 99 genes that were induced > 2. 0 -fold by UVR; the identity of 57 of these genes were known. We then subjected these top 100 changes to the Ingenuity Pathway analysis program and identified a group of p 53 targets including the cell cycle regulator CDKN 1 A (p 21 CIP), the WNT pathway regulator DKK 1 (dickkopf homolog 1), the receptor tyrosine kinase EPHA 2, growth factor GDF 15, ferrodoxin reductase (FDXR), p 53 -inducible protein TP 53 I 3, transcription factor ATF 3, DNA repair enzyme DDB 2, and the β-adrenergic receptor ADBR 2. These genes were also found to be consistently elevated by UVR in six independent melanocyte lines, although there were interindividual variations in magnitude. WWOX, whose protein product interacts and regulates p 53 and p 73, {{was found to be}} consistently suppressed by UVR. There was also a subgroup of neurite/axonal developmental genes that were altered {{in response to}} UVR, suggesting that melanocytic and <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> may share similar mechanisms. When compared to melanomas, the basal levels of many of these p 53 -responsive genes were greatly dysregulated. Three genes – CDKN 1 A, DDB 2 and ADRB 2 – exhibited a trend towards loss of expression in melanomas thereby raising the possibility of a linked role in tumorigenesis. These expression data provide a global view of UVR-induced changes in melanocytes and, more importantly, generate novel hypotheses regarding melanocyte physiology...|$|E
40|$|Axon {{guidance}} is {{the developmental}} process during which outgrowing neurites of cells travel long distances {{to reach their}} proper synaptic targets. Precision in wiring is essential for any function of the nervous system. Therefore, axon guidance {{is critical to the}} existence of all animals. The navigation of growing neurites occurs at their tips in a sensory-motor structure known as the growth cone. The cell membranes of growth cones are equipped with axon-guidance-receptor-molecules. These trans-membrane proteins sense the composition of the environment and respond to the information by initiating intracellular signaling cascades. Hence, axon guidance receptors represent the regulatory central elements of neural wiring. Higher order species distinguish themselves from evolutionary lower species by more complex nervous systems. The formation of complex neuronal networks calls for a specialized sub-class of guidance receptors. The larger extent of the <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborization</b> requires that neurites are capable of sensing the position of a given neurite in relation to other neurites derived from the same cell. This task is assumed by “self recognition receptors”. They guarantee that a neuron covers the biggest possible area with a given set of neurites. Unnecessary “self-crosses “are avoided by triggering repulsion between neurites of the same cell. The importance of an organizing principle based on self-recognition is emphasized {{by the fact that it}} has evolved more than once. Interestingly vertebrates and invertebrates use different combinatorial systems of surface receptors to unmistakably label a neuronal surface. Among such neuronal self-recognition molecules, Drosophila Dscam 1 is the first receptor described. Therefore, Dscam 1 mediated neuronal self-recognition is very well understood. The Dscam 1 gene can be spliced into thousands of different isoforms, providing the basis for a cell surface code: Each cell expresses a distinct subset of 10 - 50 Dscam 1 isoforms, rendering its surface uniquely recognizable. The importance of Dscam 1 for axonal and dendritic patterning has been demonstrated in numerous in vivo assays. However, surprisingly little is known regarding the signaling pathway of the Dscam 1 receptor. This dissertation describes my efforts into gaining insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal self-recognition. My dissertation is divided into three chapters: The first two chapters consist of two published papers to which I have contributed during my time in the neuronal wiring laboratory (Dascenco and Erfurth et al., 2015; He et al., 2014 a). They demonstrate that the Dscam 1 receptor is indispensable for the axonal patterning of mechanosensory neurons in the ventral nerve cord. In contrast to its role in uniform dendritic patterning however, it is critical to regulate Dscam 1 signaling in some sub-compartments of the outgrowing axons. Such spatial regulation of Dscam 1 signaling by the novel ligand Slit and tyrosine-phosphorylation allows the formation of complicated neurite patterns, such as the branched arborization of mechanosensory-neurons. Dscam 1 tyrosine phosphorylation is positively regulated by Src kinases and negatively modulated by the receptor tyrosine phosphatase RPTP 69 D. I identified three critical tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of Dscam 1 important for the interaction with RPTP 69 D. We also show that Dscam 1 physically interacts with RPTP 69 D substrate traps on both of the two RPTP 69 D phosphatase domains. These interactions modulate Dscam 1 phosphorylation, rendering Dscam 1 the first identified substrate of RPTP 69 D as of today. In the third part of my dissertation, I summarize the results of a combination of proteomic screens. They were aimed at unraveling the Dscam 1 signaling complex and identifying tyrosine phosphorylated proteins that are regulated by Dscam 1 signaling. I identified new downstream targets of the pathway. These results link the Dscam 1 receptor directly to the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton and suggest that the receptor is capable of physically recruiting components of the translational machinery to the membrane. Furthermore, I found the cytoplasmic domain to be associated with components of the cellular endomembrane system, suggesting that receptor internalization might be an important regulatory mode, fine-tuning the signaling response. Among the confirmed novel Dscam 1 binding partners are the receptor Pvr, the scaffolding protein α-Spectrin and the guanine nucleotide exchange (GEF) DOCK 4. Surprisingly, I also detected a link of Dscam 1 to the transcriptional machinery, which I confirmed via microarrays in hemocytes. Notably, some of the novel interactors, such as the Dscam 1 -Pvr complex, might be of special interest, because they can be detected among the vertebrate orthologue receptors as well. Taken together, this dissertation demonstrates that Dscam 1 signaling is tightly regulated at several levels: An intrinsic sensitivity threshold for self-recognition is set by regulating the number of isoforms expressed on the cell surface. In a second layer, distinct ligands activate the receptor and the phosphorylation state of the intracellular domain, affecting thereby local translation, Dscam 1 endocytosis and local cytoskeletal dynamics. It will be a challenge in the future, to dissect under which circumstances and in which cellular context the different signaling complexes are formed and activated. nrpages: 315 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal {{information}} processing in cortical networks critically {{depends on the}} organization of synaptic connectivity. Synaptic connections can form when axons and dendrites come in close proximity of each other. The spatial innervation of <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborizations</b> can be described by their axonal and dendritic density fields. Recently we showed that potential locations of synapses between neurons can be estimated from their overlapping axonal and dendritic density fields. However, deriving density fields from single-slice neuronal reconstructions is hampered by incompleteness because of cut branches. Here, we describe a method for recovering the lost axonal and dendritic mass. This so-called completion method {{is based on an}} estimation of the mass inside the slice and an extrapolation to the space outside the slice, assuming axial symmetry in the mass distribution. We validated the method using a set of neurons generated with our NETMORPH simulator. The model-generated neurons were artificially sliced and subsequently recovered by the completion method. Depending on slice thickness and arbor extent, branches that have lost their outside parents (orphan branches) may occur inside the slice. Not connected anymore to the contiguous structure of the sliced neuron, orphan branches result in an underestimation of neurite mass. For 300 ^m thick slices, however, the validation showed a full recovery of dendritic and an almost full recovery of axonal mass. The completion method was applied to three experimental data sets of reconstructed rat cortical L 2 / 3 pyramidal neurons. The results showed that in 300 ^m thick slices intracortical axons lost about 50 % and dendrites about 16 % of their mass. The completion method can be applied to single-slice reconstructions as long as axial symmetry can be assumed in the mass distribution. This opens up the possibility of using incomplete neuronal reconstructions from open-access data bases to determine population mean mass density fields. © 2014 van Pelt, van Ooyen and Uylings...|$|R

40|$|Although insect {{brains are}} small in {{comparison}} to those of vertebrates, some species show astonishing navigational abilities. Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) are well-known for forming huge swarms consisting of millions of animals and their long-range migrations throughout North Africa and the Middle East. Experiments on tethered flying locusts showed that the animals respond with a 180 °-periodicity of yaw-torque to a dorsally rotating polarizer. This suggests that locusts are able to use celestial polarized light as navigational cue during spatial orientation and navigation. A number of recent studies have explored the neural basis of sky compass orientation in locusts {{by focusing on the}} processing of polarized light signals in the brain. In contrast, (1) the mechanisms of compensation for changes of solar position {{over the course of the}} day and (2) the integration of different signals from the sky (polarization pattern, solar position, chromatic gradient) are poorly understood, particularly at the level of the optic lobe. Finally, (3) no data exist comparing the sky compass system in diurnal gregarious locusts with that of nocturnal solitarious locusts. Towards these goals, polarization-sensitive neurons at different levels of the polarization vision pathway were analyzed physiologically through intracellular recordings and anatomically by means of detailed three-dimensional reconstructions of <b>neuronal</b> <b>arborizations.</b> First, neurons of the medulla in the optic lobe were analyzed and characterized to understand the combination and integration of sky compass information in the locust brain. These experiments showed that neurons of a distinct layer of the medulla (layer 4) integrate polarized light information from the dorsal rim area of the compound eye in the locust brain. In addition, all polarization-sensitive neurons responded also to an unpolarized green/UV light spots that moved around the locust head. Taken together, this chapter shows that neurons of medulla layer 4 combine polarized light information of the sky with azimuth-dependent unpolarized light input that might represent celestial chromatic contrast information. In the next chapter, receptive field properties and responses of neurons to different light intensity conditions were studied. These investigations focused on neurons of the anterior optic tubercle – the next processing stage of the polarization pathway – and compared the physiology of these neurons in gregarious and solitarious locusts. The data showed that both locust phases rely on the same sky navigation system, although they have strikingly different life styles. The experiments revealed novel aspects of the response characteristics of intertubercle neurons and a possible modulatory role of the LoTu 1 neuron in the anterior optic tubercle in both locust phases. In the third chapter, evidence for a second polarization vision pathway in the brain is presented. This pathway connects the dorsal rim area of the medullae via the accessory medullae to the central complex and might provide time-compensated polarized light signals to the central complex. Finally, chapter four presents a standardized three-dimensional atlas of the central complex and reveals a possible connection between a particular type of polarization-sensitive columnar neuron and a neuron that is modulated during flight. This chapter illustrates how the polarization-vision network of the central complex might be modulated in a context-dependent manner...|$|R

Repeated psychological stress, aging and dementia may leads to the dendritic atrophy in CA 1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampus. Accordingly, the present study was designed to investigate the role of aqueous root extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Gg) treatment on the dendritic arborization and dendritic intersections of hippocampal CA 1 neurons in 3 months old male Wistar albino rats. The aqueous root extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra was administered orally in four different doses (75, 150, 225 and 300 mg/kg) for 2, 4 and 6 weeks duration, respectively. At the end of the spatial memory tests, the rats were sacrificed by deeply anesthetized Pentobarbitone, their brains were removed rapidly and Hippocampal CA 1 region studied through Rapid Golgi staining. Hippocampal CA 1 neurons were traced using camera lucida, and Quantification of dendritic branching points and dendritic intersections were quantified by using concentric circle method of Sholl.

40|$|The {{cause of}} many {{neurodegenerative}} disorders can be {{ascribed to the}} loss of functional neurons, and thus agents capable of promoting neuronal differentiation may have therapeutic benefits to patients of these disorders. In this study, the effects and underlying mechanisms of bis(12) -hupyridone (B 12 H), a novel dimeric acetylcholinesterase inhibitor modified from huperzine A (HA), on neuronal differentiation were investigated using both the rat PC 12 pheochromocytoma cell line and adult rat hippocampus neural stem cells. B 12 H (3 - 30 μM), characterized by morphological changes and expression of GAP- 43, induced neurite outgrowth in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with almost 3 -fold higher efficacy than that of HA in PC 12 cells. Furthermore, B 12 H (2. 5 - 10 μM), but not HA, promoted neuronal differentiation as shown by the percentage increase of βIII-tubulin positive neurons in neural stem cells. The activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), as well as its downstream transcription factors Elk- 1 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were elevated in the B 12 H-treated PC 12 cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitors and alpha 7 -nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α 7 nAChR) antagonist blocked the neurite outgrowth and the activation of ERK induced by B 12 H. All these findings suggest that B 12 H potently induces pro-neuronal cells into differentiated neurons by activating the ERK pathway possibly via regulating α 7 nAChR. These findings support the recent proposition that α 7 nAChR is required for the <b>neuronal</b> dendritic <b>arborization</b> and differentiation in the adult mice hippocampus, and provide insights into the possible therapeutic potential of B 12 H in treating neurodegenerative disorders.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to utilize mice with knocked-down lysophosphatidic acid 1 (LPA 1) receptor to ascertain changes in glutamatergic transmission that may help to explain part of the cognitive and memory deficits shown by these KO-LPA 1 mice. Material & methods: A well characterized KO-LPA 1 mouse strain was used as animal model and compared with wild-type (WT) and heterozygous animals. Expression studies were implemented by immunohistochemistry and Western analysis of mouse brain regions, real-time quantitative RT-PCR of GA isoforms, enzymatic analysis of regional GA activity and Golgi staining to assess dendritic spine morphology and density. Results: A strong reduction of KGA immunoreactivity was mostly revealed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of KO-LPA 1 mice versus WT and heterozygous animals. In contrast, neither mRNA levels nor enzyme activity were significantly altered in KO mice suggesting compensatory mechanisms for neurotransmitter Glu synthesis. Interestingly, Golgi staining of hippocampal and cortical neurons revealed a clear morphology change toward a less-mature undifferentiated spine phenotype, without changes in the total number of spines. Conclusions: The molecular mechanisms underlying KGA downregulation in null LPA 1 mutant mice are unknown. However, LPA increases <b>neuronal</b> differentiation, <b>arborization</b> and neurite outgrowth of developing neurons, while Gln-derived Glu, through GA reaction, has been also involved in neuronal growth and differentiation. It is tempting to speculate that downregulation of KGA protein in KO-LPA 1 mice induce morphological changes in dendritic spines of cortical and hippocampal neurons which, in turn, may account for memory and cognitive deficits shown by KO-LPA 1 mice.
