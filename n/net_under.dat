The {{mosquitoes}} had been maddening that night; they flew about the <b>net</b> <b>under</b> which he slept in such numbers that their humming, pitiless and menacing, {{had the effect of}} a note, infinitely drawn out, played on a distant organ, and whenever he dozed off he awoke with a start in the belief that one had found its way inside his curtains. It was so hot that he lay naked. He turned from side to side. And gradually the dull roar of the breakers on the reef, so unceasing and so regular that generally you did not hear it, grew distinct on his consciousness, its rhythm hammered on his tired nerves and he held himself with clenched hands in the effort to bear it. The thought that nothing could stop that sound, for it would continue to all eternity, was almost impossible to bear, and, as though his strength were a match for the ruthless forces of nature, he had an insane impulse to do some violent thing. He felt he must cling to his self-control or he would go mad. And now, looking out of the window at the lagoon and the strip of foam which marked the reef, he shuddered with hatred of the brilliant scene. The cloudless sky was like an inverted bowl that hemmed it in. He lit his pipe and turned over the pile of Auckland papers that had come over from Apia a few days before. The newest of them was three weeks old. They gave an impression of incredible dullness.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether reported net income as per US-generally accepted accounting principles (US-GAAP) has become comparable to net income as per International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board right before the removal of the US-GAAP reconciliation requirement and what major accounting elements have caused the differences, if any. Design/methodology/approach – Using Gray's index of comparability suggested by Haverty, the paper compares the reported <b>net</b> income <b>under</b> IFRS for a sample of US-listed Chinese companies using IFRS with the reconciled <b>net</b> income <b>under</b> US-GAAP. Findings – Consistent with Haverty is the finding that <b>net</b> income <b>under</b> IFRS is still not completely comparable to <b>net</b> income <b>under</b> US-GAAP for the same company and that the adjustment for tangible assets revaluation is a major contributor to the difference. In addition, different treatment of business acquisition is found to be another major cause of the incomparability. The comparability has improved at 10 percent threshold since Haverty's study. Originality/value – This paper provides an update on the status of IFRS and US-GAAP comparability and highlights an additional major area to work on towards improved comparability.
