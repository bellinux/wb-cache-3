Others suggest that it may be more accurate to describe change driven by nanotechnology as a “technological tsunami”. Just like a tsunami, analysts warn that rapid nanotechnology-driven change will necessarily have profound disruptive impacts. As the APEC Center for Technology Foresight observes: ...|$|E

In this work quantum-mechanical investigations of the potential surface merocyanine-spiropyran transformation were carried out. Under dark conditions, such transition will be possible when potential barrier with height ~ 0. 7 eV is overcomed. Rotating the phenyl moiety relative to the plane of the molecule by 90 ° without simultaneously changing all other parameters of the molecule (optimization of the molecular structure) increases the molecule's energy by 1. 376 eV...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recent <b>nanotechnological</b> <b>revolution</b> {{mandates}} astonishing imagination {{about future}} nanoworld. Nature has {{ability to create}} nanobiomolecules which can function in extraordinary way {{which can be used}} to produce nano hybrid systems. The opportunity to use such nanobiomolecules in combination of nanomechanical systems for development of novel nano hybrid systems for their various applications needs to explore in further nanotechnological development. F 1 ATPase is a subunit of ATP synthase, {{which is one of the}} biomolecular structure works on the plasma membrane of the living cell. The reversible function of F 1 ATPase gives a counterclockwise rotation of γ shaft by hydrolyzing ATP and the energy released in the form of rotational torque. This rotational torque of F 1 ATPase can be used to power the functional movement of nanodevice. This feature article discusses comparisons of various biomolecular motors for their powering capacities, recent developments, presents new discoveries, experimentations on F 1 ATPase and its novel imaginary futuristic applications where F 1 ATPase could be used as nanobioengine for powering functional nanoworld...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of one- {{as well as}} two-dimensional molecular networks confined to surfaces is nowadays considered as a promising alternative to the conventional top-down approach for the design and development of future electronic devices. In the framework of this doctoral thesis, various low-dimensional molecular networks were successfully constructed on different metal surfaces and their structural formation was investigated {{by a combination of}} different experimental techniques, including scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low-energy electron diffraction. In particular, two main research topics are presented in this doctoral thesis. In the first one, {{the focus is on the}} creation of self-assembled molecular networks which are held together by (weak) non-covalent intermolecular interactions (halogen/hydrogen bonding, coordination bonding and vdW forces) on metal surfaces. The emphasis is on examining the interplay of intermolecular and molecule substrate interactions with respect to the structural formation of molecular networks. Moreover, the impact of the number and position of functional endgroups attached to the precursors on the resulting intermolecular interactions was studied. The second topic deals with the on-surface synthesis of polymer networks. The aim is to obtain robust molecular networks on metal surfaces with improved chemical and physical properties. Two chemical concepts were employed for the polymer formation: Ullmann coupling and protecting group chemistry. Moreover, the influence of different metal substrates on the outcome of the Ullmann coupling reaction was also investigated. Thus, the results presented in this doctoral thesis are expected to considerably contribute to the ongoing <b>nanotechnological</b> <b>revolution</b> in materials science...|$|E
40|$|Although {{scientists}} have for decades now {{had the ability}} to manipulate matter at the atomic level, we have yet to see the <b>nanotechnological</b> <b>revolution</b> that these scientists predicted would follow. Despite the years of effort and billions of dollars that have been invested into research and development thus far, nanotechnology has yielded surprisingly few end-user applications. A number of commentators have blamed this lack of progress on the Bayh-Dole Act and other changes to patent law, arguing that, although these laws are supposed to stimulate technological development, they have in fact had the exact opposite effect when it comes to nanotechnology. Because universities now own too many “upstream” patent rights with the potential to obstruct “downstream” development of usable applications, their argument goes, the Bayh-Dole Act has caused an unnecessary drag on nanotechnology development. This Article shows, however, that contrary to this common criticism, patents on university-based nanotechnology research are most often simply irrelevant. While nanotechnology applications have been slow to emerge, this Article shows that the latency in development is due not to patents but rather to the fact that nanotechnology is a science-based technology and as such faces various additional hurdles that far outweigh the potential effect of any upstream patenting by universities. Just the inherent technological difficulties alone of working in science-based fields makes development cycles in these fields unavoidably long. To make matter worse, science-based fields typically also face issues with tacit knowledge and the lack of widespread expertise as well as the “valley of death” and the difficulties of attracting investment in intermediate-stage development. Add to this mix constraints due to concerns about public health and safety along with limited access to proprietary materials and equipment and {{it is not difficult to}} understand why nanotechnology development has not advanced as quickly as some might have hoped. Thus, while nanotechnology and other science-based technologies may occasionally experience patent-related holdup problems, development in these fields would be more effectively addressed by looking instead at the multitude of other, nonpatent factors that pose well-recognized obstacles in such science-based technologies...|$|E
40|$|Lithography, universally {{considered}} to be the backbone of nanotechnology, has been consistently undergoing several developments to achieve a resolution of 10 nm or less. Such resolution can be attained by using traditional electron-beam excitation and chemical protocols. Interestingly, optical lithography, which is a process of transferring features on a photosensitive material using light, has also been evolving {{to meet the demands of}} the semiconductor industry. For more than three decades, optical lithography and the semiconductor industry cooperatively work together where the former acts as the engine that powers the so called <b>nanotechnological</b> <b>revolution.</b> 	Two-photon photopolymerisation (TPP), a nonlinear optical phenomenon, provides an alternative route for fabricating three dimensional (3 D) nanostructures. Such a fabrication technique has outshone any other optical lithography in terms of resolution and flexibility. The resolution of TPP is characterized by the size of voxel. Moreover, the size of the polymerized spot is strongly influenced by several parameters. Carefully combining the optimal parameters (e. g., photon density, wavelength, scanning speed, material and its processing) in the experiments allows one to fully fabricate nanostructures with line widths below the diffraction limit. 	In this thesis, a spin-coated negative photoresist (SU- 8 5) on glass substrate is used to demonstrate nonlinear lithography. The effects of sample thickness, laser power, scanning speed were studied by using a custom-built TPP experimental setup with a Ti-Sapphire (TiSa) femtosecond (fs) laser as an excitation source. The results showed that optimal fabrication of nanostructures can be achieved using sample thickness of 5 μm, laser power of 43 mW and scanning speed of 15 μm/s. The results obtained were similar to the result mentioned in the reference ‘S. Kawata, H. Sun. Two-photon photopolymerisation as a tool for making micro-devices. Elsevier 208 - 209 (2003), pp. 153 - 158. ’ The smallest linewidth drawn with these optimized parameters was 358 nm. Additionally, the aspect ratio of the sample and its reproducibility were investigated. The aspect ratio matches with the results revealed in ‘H. J. Kong et al. Ultrafast Laser Induced Two Photon Polymerization of SU- 8 High-Aspect-ratio structure and nano wire. Journal of the Korean Physical Society 54 (2009) 1, pp 215 - 219 ’. Implementation of vectorial scanning was another aspect of this work. Here, the spin coated photoresist on glass substrate is guided along the fixed laser focus to photopolymerize and subsequently fabricate a plurality of nanostructures ranging from simple (e. g. lines) to arbitrary (e. g. like star, TUT emblem and maps). In future, the current workstation will be improved by introducing polarization and tailored light distribution, stimulated emission depletion (STED) concept, and the spectroscopy of photoinitiators to achieve fully controllable photo-induced processes at sub-diffraction resolution. /Kir 1...|$|E
