50|$|Reuben Lasker has a traction-type oceanographic winch with {{a maximum}} pull weight of 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) which can deploy up to 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 17.3-mm (0..681-inch) {{electromechanical}} cable. She also has two CTD winches {{with a maximum}} pull weight of 7,700 pounds (3,493 kg), each of which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 9.5-mm (.375-inch) electromechanical cable, two trawl winches with a maximum pull weight of 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg), each of which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 25.4-mm (1-inch) wire, and a <b>net</b> <b>sonde</b> winch with a maximum pull weight of 8,100 pounds (3,674 kg) which can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 11.4-mm (.450-inch) electromechanical wire. She has a 65-foot (19.8-meter) telescopic boom with a lifting capacity of 1,000 pounds (454 kg) at full extension and of 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) when extended 23 feet (7 meters) and a 23-foot (7-meter) telescopic boom with a 1,000-pound (454 kg) lifting capacity. She has a movable A-frame on her starboard side with a maximum safe working load of 2,000 pounds (907 kg) and a large A-frame aft with a maximum safe working load of 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg) {{that serves as a}} stern gantry. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while two winches work with the starboard-side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and Reuben Laskers configuration allows her to have three scientific packages ready for sequential operations. One of her winches also can deploy lines and equipment over her stern. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. Her winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Reuben Lasker also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays. While trawling, Reuben Lasker uses wireless and hard-wired systems to monitor the shape of the trawl net and to work in conjunction with an autotrawl system that sets trawl depth and trawl wire tension and adjusts the net configuration.|$|E
40|$|Seabird {{mortality}} occurs {{most often}} from interactions with cables {{running from the}} vessel to the net (<b>net</b> <b>sonde</b> and warps) and with the net itself. Mortality can also occur during vessel collisions. The latter {{are not included in}} this bibliography. Seabird-Trawler Interactions (mortality and mitigation; ‡ PDF available) Bartle, J. A. 1991. Incidental capture of seabirds in the New Zealand subantarctic squid trawl fishery, 1990. Bird Conserv. Int. 1 : 351 - 359. Observers recorded seabird mortalities in a squid trawl fishery. 83 % (of 279 birds) were recovered from the <b>net</b> <b>sonde</b> cable; remainder entangled {{in various parts of the}} net. Average catch rate was 0. 263 birds/haul. Proposed that weather and seabird abundance in area may have an effect on interaction rates but very little data was collected on interactions while fishing. Suggested that hull-mounted transducers or towed aquaplanes could replace the towed transducer...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-frequency}} scanning sonar, mounted as a <b>net</b> <b>sonde,</b> {{was used}} to study fish behaviour in the mouth area of the Norwegian bottom-sampling trawl. Fish distribution patterns were significantly different by day and night. At night the fish entered {{the middle of the}} trawl, close to the bobbins, and no fish were observed escaping over the headline. During daytime the fish entered more irregularly, using the whole opening of the trawl, and haddock (Melanogrammus) were lost over the headline. The daytime sonar observations were confirmed visually with an underwater vehicle with video camera. The observations indicate that the herding process during bottom trawling may be equally efficient by day and night, and that hearing must {{play a significant role in}} this process under non-visual conditions...|$|E

40|$|D aw du w us au {{as often}} {{observed}} {{far below the}} foot rope of the trawl, indicating vertical avoidance. The <b>net</b> <b>sonde</b> transducer often recorded schools in the net mouth for long periods: {{it was assumed that}} these fast-swimming fish were able to swim along with the trawl, and escaped when the towing speed was reduced during hauling. No correlations were found, however, between towing speed (2. 7 – 5. 0 knots) and the total catch of sardinella. Increasing the two duration during the day to more than 2 h also failed to yield consistently higher catches. A negative correlation at night between tow duration (15 – 60 min) and catch size arose simply because the trawl was towed for a longer time to obtain adequate samples in areas with scattered recordings. During the day, sardinella was caught both inshore and further oVshore, while horse mackerel (Trachurus trecae and Trachurus capensis) was caught further oVshore only. Both species were well represented in catches made at night. There were substantial day and night diVerences in the length distributions of sardinella, with small sardinella being caught only at night...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} pelagic trawl {{sampling}} trials on pelagic species distributed near surface off Angola {{were conducted by}} R/V «Dr. Fridtjof Nansen» operating a medium sized pelagic trawl with a vertical opening of about 20 m. The results have been analysed with respect to effects such as vessel and gear avoidance, time of day, towing speed and tow duration. Numerous trawls targeting on dense sardinella shoals failed to yield large catches. Shoals that were at the trawl depth as the vessel passed over were often observed far below the foot rope of the trawl, indicating vertical avoidance. Often shoals in the net mouth were recorded by the <b>net</b> <b>sonde</b> for long periods. It was assumed that these fast swimming fish were able to swim along with the trawl, and escaped out of the trawl when slowing down the towing speed during hauling. No correlations were, however, found between towing speed in the range 2. 7 - 5. 0 knots and the total catch of sardinella. Increasing the tow duration during the day to more than 120 minutes also failed to yield consistently higher catches. At night, there was a negative correlation between tow duration in the range 15 - 60 min and the catch size, simply because the trawl was towed for a longer time to obtain proper samples in areas with scattered recordings. During the day sardinella was caught both inshore and further offshore, while horse mackerel was caught further offshore only. Both species were well represented in the catches made at night. There were substantial day and night differences in the length distributions of sardinella with small sardinella being caught only at night...|$|E
