5|$|Subtropical Storm <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} {{subtropical}} storm {{to receive a}} name using the standard hurricane name list that did not become a tropical cyclone. The fourteenth tropical or subtropical storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole developed on October 10 near Bermuda from the interaction of an upper level trough and a cold front. The storm turned to the northeast, and after attempting to transition into a tropical cyclone, it dissipated as it was absorbed into a larger extratropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> a {{short-lived}} and unusually asymmetric tropical cyclone that caused extensive rainfall and flooding in Jamaica during the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the sixteenth tropical cyclone and the fourteenth named storm of the season, {{as well as}} the last of a record eight tropical storms to form in September. Originating from a broad monsoonal low, Nicole became a tropical depression over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September28. It maintained an unusual structure as it tracked northeastward, with a poorly defined wind circulation and few thunderstorms near its center. Nicole approached the coast of Cuba as a weak tropical storm, losing its status as a tropical cyclone over the territory on September29. The remnants emerged over the Bahamas and eventually became absorbed by a separate extratropical system.|$|E
5|$|While <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> intensifying offshore, {{its outer}} bands {{produced}} heavy downpours over drought-stricken Cuba. Rain quantities were particularly high along the southeastern coast; a 48-hour total of 9.22inches (235mm) fell at Cape Cruz, in the mountainous Granma Province. The region also briefly observed gale-force winds, with gusts to 53mph (85km/h) at Guantánamo Bay. Throughout eastern Cuba, nearly 300people sought {{refuge from the}} storm. As the rivers in Granma overflowed, eighthouses collapsed and more than 300others were inundated in the coastal town of Pilón. The flooding obstructed several roads, with sections of the highway between Granma and Santiago de Cuba destroyed. The storm resulted in 5,000lbs (2.5tons) of lost crops and livestock. These effects were nevertheless considered to be minor when viewed against the alleviation of a persistent dry spell provided by the rains.|$|E

5|$|On the August 29, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and {{defeated}} Victoria. She quickly began a scripted rivalry with Victoria and Victoria's accomplice, Natalya, {{and had a}} series of matches against them. In each match, Brie would roll out of the ring and go underneath it, emerging and appearing revived, and then win the match. On the October 31 episode of SmackDown, when Brie went under the ring Victoria grabbed her legs, but a second pair of legs kicked her off, implying that a second person was under the ring. The following week on SmackDown, Brie picked up a win against Victoria and then ran under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria, but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring, resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out. The twins then attacked them and celebrated afterward. <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> then introduced as Nikki Bella.

He predicted that the viewers would respond [...] "really well" [...] to her. <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> initially portrayed as a shallow [...] "party girl" [...] with [...] "wild ways". Also described as a [...] "high maintenance" [...] female, she {{has been shown to}} dress constantly in a stylish manner. Nicole is also become notable for her many relationships. Her first prominent romance was with Geoff Campbell. Described as [...] "complete opposites", Geoff is credited as a catalyst in Nicole mellowing her brash attitude. Their storyline allowed the actors to take part in one of the serial's [...] "biggest ever location shoots", when the couple became stranded on a [...] remote desert island. In one storyline <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> involved in a same sex kiss with fellow character Freya Duric, which was branded controversial by various media sources. The plot saw Nicole question her persona, believing Geoff had transformed her into a boring person.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, {{the serial}} {{embarked}} on two lesbian storylines, {{one of which}} involved Nicole. It featured Freya Duric (Sophie Hensser) kissing Nicole, which sparked complaints. However, for Nicole it wasn't about sexuality, rather finding herself the center of attention. James described their dynamic, stating: [...] "Freya's exactly what <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> like when she first arrived in the bay, {{that is why they}} click. Nicole relates to the wild side of Freya, but has no idea how far Freya is going to take it." [...] Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present. James said <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> [...] "angry" [...] because she was on Freya's [...] "not hot list". Freya kissed her to prove she thinks she is hot, James opined that Nicole did not enjoy the kiss, but was just [...] "happy to be center of attention" [...] and happy that people were talking about her again. The incident eventually brought her to the realisation that she had become boring. Nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with Geoff, however James said Geoff was the reason she became bored.|$|E

500|$|As the Metafilter thread progressed, users {{discovered}} that Kaycee's CollegeClub account {{was tied to}} the CollegeClub account of Debbie Swenson's teenaged daughter, and that records showed that someone had logged into Kaycee's account days after {{she was supposed to}} have died. A user investigated the photographs that Kaycee had shared on her blog, identified a school mascot pictured, and traced it back to a particular high school, then traced the jersey number that [...] "Kaycee" [...] was wearing to an actual player. Investigation of the player showed that the only connection she had to Kaycee <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> that her family had once been acquainted with the Swenson family; she was not ill, was not named Kaycee Nicole, and not aware that her photo was being used by someone else.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> {{pleased that}} the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{relationship}} Nicole pursued {{was with}} Aden Jefferies, her longtime closest friend. Aden {{had a strong}} fanbase from his previous relationship with Belle Taylor.

Nicole has also been featured in various other romantic storylines, such as a brief fling with Liam Murphy, James {{said that he was}} compatible with Nicole because he had [...] "the edge she was after". She also dated Trey Palmer and they became involved in sex tape storyline, many newspapers reported on the plot because it [...] "echoed" [...] co-star Lewis' real life sex tape scandal. Producer Welsh once stated he believed <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> destined to become [...] "full circle" [...] and Nicole began behaving erratic and wild once more, due to her failed romances and the death of her friend Belle. She also had an affair with an older male character, Sid Walker. James liked the fact Nicole had so many romances because she got to kiss many of her co-stars.|$|E

500|$|Nicole later {{decided to}} let Marilyn and Sid Walker (Robert Mammone) adopt the baby upon its birth. Marilyn was desperate to mother a child and her {{obsession}} with that and her controlling behaviour became too much for Nicole. Of the situation, Symons said [...] "Marilyn is in Nicole's face every minute. She's doing it out of love, but she doesn't realise she's becoming obsessed with the baby." [...] <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> still questioning whether she is making the right decision about her unborn baby's future and she argued with Marilyn. Nicole began dating a student from university, Angus McCathie (Tim Pocock), they got along well on their first dates. Marilyn was left worried about their agreement and she felt [...] "distanced." [...] Symons explained, [...] "Marilyn is scared of being replaced. She's scared of losing the baby, which could happen because there isn't a legal agreement." [...] Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) helped Nicole by convincing Marilyn to re-evaluate the situation. Symons added that there is [...] "still {{a long way to}} go" [...] with the arrangement, but thereafter she was supportive and offered constructive help to Nicole.|$|E
500|$|Nicole {{had a brief}} {{relationship}} with Penn Graham (Christian Clark) and after he was murdered, she discovered {{that she was pregnant}} with his child. James told Sunrise that viewers could expect a [...] "realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy" [...] and she explained {{that it was important to}} respect the issue. She added [...] "We took it very seriously with the writers, and you do a lot of research and things like that. You can only do your best, I guess!" [...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> going to have a baby, James said [...] "I went in to see our producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different. However the situation was explained to her and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead.|$|E
500|$|Angelo {{was forced}} to help Nicole {{give birth to a}} baby boy, George, and she handed him over to Marilyn {{immediately}} as agreed. She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] <b>Nicole</b> <b>was</b> unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby. Of the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby. James defended Nicole stating: [...] "I think it's hard to not bond, but this is Marilyn's baby, and Nicole is so young and wants very much to give Marilyn and Sid this gift." ...|$|E
