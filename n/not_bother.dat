The Roman Catholic Church objected to it being {{held on the}} most sacred day of the liturgical year, suggesting that riders would {{not have time to}} attend mass and that spectators might <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> to attend either. Tracts were distributed in Roubaix decrying the venture.|$|E

5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Lana Crawford is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Bridget Neval. The actress's casting {{was announced in}} June 2004, and she stated that she was excited {{to take on the}} role of Lana, a schoolgirl and the serial's first lesbian character. Neval explained that Lana's sexuality did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> her, but she hoped her story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|Shelley wrote eleven poems for Jane {{during that}} time. She {{served as the}} primary {{inspiration}} for the last poems that he wrote before his death. This did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> Edward; he was proud that his wife inspired such poetry. Some biographers of Shelley have maintained that Shelley's feelings for Jane were strictly platonic, although different scholars have observed themes of frustrated sexual desires in Shelley's poetry during this period. Other critics have noted that Shelley's poems during this period struggle to define his feelings.|$|E

5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> {{to occupy the}} Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently. On {{his way back to}} Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience. Therefore, Khazar {{successor}} statelets continued their precarious existence in the region. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
5|$|Pemberton was {{boxed in}} {{with lots of}} munitions and little food. The poor diet was showing on the Confederate soldiers. By the end of June, half were out sick or hospitalized. Scurvy, malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and other {{diseases}} cut their ranks. At least one city resident had to stay up at night to keep starving soldiers out of his vegetable garden. The constant shelling did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> {{him as much as}} the loss of his food. As the siege wore on, fewer and fewer horses, mules, and dogs were seen wandering about Vicksburg. Shoe leather became a last resort of sustenance for many adults.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{had long}} seen a Senate seat as a logical next step once he {{concluded}} {{his time as}} governor. Senator Butler, whose term expired in March 1895, had soon after the 1890 election begun to shift his positions towards Tillman's, hoping to retain Conservative backing while appealing to the governor's supporters. The senator signed on to most demands of the Farmers' Alliance, and {{did not support the}} forces trying to prevent Tillman's re-nomination in 1892. Butler's seeming apostasy disheartened Conservatives, who did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> to run candidates for the legislature in many counties in 1894, abandoning the field (and Butler's Senate seat) to the Tillmanites. The governor took nothing for granted, seeing to it that popular candidates, loyal to him, ran for the legislature. In addition to electing Tillman to the Senate, these legislators could help preserve his gubernatorial legacy, including the dispensary.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria {{became a}} member of the United Nations in 1955 and since 1966 has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council three times, most {{recently}} from 2002 to 2003. Bulgaria was also among the founding nations of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 1975. It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, signed the European Union Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005, and became a full member of the European Union on 1 January 2007. Polls carried out seven years after the country's accession to the EU found only 15% of Bulgarians felt they had personally benefited from membership, with almost 40% of the population saying they would <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> to vote in the 2014 EU elections. Euro-Atlantic integration became a priority for the country since the fall of Communism, although the Communist leadership also had aspirations of leaving the Warsaw Pact and joining the European Communities by 1987.|$|E
5|$|Despite many {{attendees}} at the festival, {{there were}} relatively few witnesses, and the incident {{did not cause}} any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew {{that they would not}} be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|Director Scott Derrickson {{admired the}} {{original}} film's director Robert Wise, {{whom he met}} as a film student. He generally dislikes remakes, but he enjoyed the script, which he decided was a retelling {{of the story and}} not a true remake. He also explained that The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a widely seen classic film, unlike The Wizard of Oz, which he would <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> remaking. Derrickson's benchmark was Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Klaatu was made more menacing than in the original, because the director felt he had to symbolize the more complex era of the 2000s. There was debate over whether to have Klaatu land in Washington, D.C., as in the original; but Derrickson chose New York City because he liked the geometry of Klaatu's sphere landing in Central Park. Derrickson also did not write in Gort's original backstory, which was already absent from the script he read. He already thought the script was a good adaptation and didn't want the negative connotations of fascism from the original film.|$|E

5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do <b>not</b> <b>bother.</b> Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks together. This seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in {{a change in the}} match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E
5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries {{to act as if}} it does <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> him, but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E

5|$|They reached Laodicea on the Lycus {{early in}} January 1148, {{around the same}} time Otto of Freising's army had been {{destroyed}} in the same area. Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated {{from the rest of the}} army at Mount Cadmus, and Louis’ troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks. Louis himself, according to Odo of Deuil, climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> to attack further and the French marched on to Adalia, continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and sail for Antioch. After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{was only}} in the Third XI of St. George at the time, but by December, he was in the First XI along with future Invincibles {{teammate}} Arthur Morris. The senior team was captained by Bill O'Reilly, a leg spin bowler who represented Australia in Tests and was regarded as the best bowler in the world. O'Reilly was a firm man and came to be a father figure for Lindwall. Lindwall came into the team seeing himself as an into-the-wind swing bowler. O'Reilly felt that pace bowlers were only useful for a few overs with new ball, so he instructed Lindwall to lengthen his run-up and bowl as fast as possible. O’Reilly also decided that the team needed more bowlers. He placed Lindwall low in the batting order, where he often did not get an opportunity to bat. Lindwall did <b>not</b> <b>bother</b> protesting, realising that dissent against the autocratic O’Reilly would be futile. O'Reilly also reversed Morris from a bowler into a batsman. Both Morris and Lindwall became world-leading players in the fields that O’Reilly chose for them. By the end of the 1938–39 season, Lindwall had not yet established himself as a cricketer. Former Test batsman Charlie Macartney lamented what he perceived as a lack of talent and substance at St. George. Lindwall returned to school, attempting to obtain his Leaving Certificate while also playing third-grade rugby. In July, Lindwall's father died, leaving him and his four siblings orphaned.|$|E
