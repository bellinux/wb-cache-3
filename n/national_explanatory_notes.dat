40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new method for {{computing}} the probabilistic vector expression of words based on dictionaries. This method provides a well-founded procedure based on stochastic process whose applicability is clear. The proposed method exploits {{the relationship between}} headwords and their <b>explanatory</b> <b>notes</b> in dictionaries. An <b>explanatory</b> <b>note</b> {{is a set of}} other words, each of which is expanded by its own <b>explanatory</b> <b>note.</b> This expansion is repeatedly applied, but even <b>explanatory</b> <b>notes</b> expanded infinitely can be computed under a simple assumption. The vector expression we obtain is a semantic expansion of the <b>explanatory</b> <b>notes</b> of words. We explain how to acquire the vector expression from these expanded <b>explanatory</b> <b>notes.</b> We also demonstrate a word similarity computation based on a Japanese dictionary and evaluate it in comparison with a known system based on TF · IDF. The results show the effectiveness and applicability of this probabilistic vector expression. ...|$|R
