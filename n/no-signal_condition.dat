40|$|Many have {{proposed}} that free will would use quantum indeterminism. Strict adherence to the Born rule, which follows from the <b>no-signal</b> <b>condition,</b> seems to block this possibility. I propose here that if state collapse really does occur {{then there is a}} further form of indeterminism occurring in multipartite systems in that the basis upon which the collapse is to occur could be ambiguous. The choice of this basis is not covered by quantum mechanics nor subject to probability constraints and this provides a ground for a physical and eventually a mathematical model of free will.

40|$|The no-signaling {{constraints}} {{state that}} the probability distribution of the outputs of any subset of parties is independent of the inputs of the complementary set; here we re-examine these {{to see how they}} arise from relativistic causality. We show that while the usual no-signaling constraints are sufficient, in general they are not necessary to ensure that a theory does not violate causality. Depending on the exact space-time coordinates of the measurement events in a multi-party Bell experiment, causality only imposes a subset of the usual <b>no-signaling</b> <b>conditions.</b> After revisiting the derivation of the two-party no-signaling constraints, we consider the three-party Bell scenario and characterise a space-time region in which a subset of the <b>no-signaling</b> <b>conditions</b> is sufficient to preserve causality. Secondly, we examine the implications for device-independent cryptography against an eavesdropper constrained only by the laws of relativity. We show an explicit attack in certain measurement configurations on a family of protocols based on the n-party Mermin inequalities that were previously proven secure under the old <b>no-signaling</b> <b>conditions.</b> We then show that security of two-party protocols can also be compromised when the eavesdropper's measurement configuration is not constrained. The monogamy of non-local correlations that underpin their use in secrecy can also be broken in certain space-time configurations. Thirdly, we inspect the notion of free-choice and propose a definition of free-choice in the multi-party Bell experiment. We then re-examine the question whether quantum correlations may admit explanations by finite speed superluminal influences. Finally, we study genuine multiparty non-locality and present a new class of causal bilocal models. We propose a new Svetlichny-type inequality that is satisfied by the causal bilocal model and show its violation within quantum theory. Comment: 40 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

We introduce generalizations {{based on the number}} of inputs provided to Alice, B_n-BOX and (n→ 1) RAC. We show that a B_n-BOX is equivalent to a no-signaling (n→ 1) RACBOX (RB). Further we introduce a signaling (n→ 1) RB which cannot simulate a B_n-BOX. Finally to quantify the same we provide a resource inequality between (n→ 1) RB and B_n-BOX, and show that it is saturated. As an application we prove that one requires atleast (n- 1) PRs supplemented with a bit of communication to win a (n→ 1) RAC. We further introduce generalizations based on the dimension of inputs provided to Alice and the message she sends, B_n^d(+) -BOX, B_n^d(-) -BOX and (n→ 1,d) RAC (d> 2). We show that <b>no-signaling</b> <b>condition</b> is not enough to enforce strict equivalence in the case of d> 2.

40|$|Quantum {{cryptography}} {{shows that}} one can guarantee the secrecy of correlation on the sole basis {{of the laws of}} physics, that is without limiting the computational power of the eavesdropper. The usual security proofs suppose that the authorized partners, Alice and Bob, have a perfect knowledge and control of their quantum systems and devices; for instance, they must be sure that the logical bits have been encoded in true qubits, and not in higher-dimensional systems. In this paper, we present an approach that circumvents this strong assumption. We define protocols, both for the case of bits and for generic $d$-dimensional outcomes, in which the security is guaranteed by the very structure of the Alice-Bob correlations, under the <b>no-signalling</b> <b>condition.</b> The idea is that, if the correlations cannot be produced by shared randomness, then Eve has poor knowledge of Alice's and Bob's symbols. The present study assumes, on the one hand that the eavesdropper Eve performs only individual attacks (this is a limitation to be removed in further work), on the other hand that Eve can distribute any correlation compatible with the <b>no-signalling</b> <b>condition</b> (in this sense her power is greater than what quantum physics allows). Under these assumptions, we prove that the protocols defined here allow extracting secrecy from noisy correlations, when these correlations violate a Bell-type inequality by a sufficiently large amount. The region, in which secrecy extraction is possible, extends within the region of correlations achievable by measurements on entangled quantum states. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Some of the Bell inequalities associated with our construction correspond to facets of the local polytope.
