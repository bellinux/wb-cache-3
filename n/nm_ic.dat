50|$|Nociceptive pain is {{immediate}} pain felt as {{a result}} of injury inflicted upon tissue. Neuropathic pain, in contrast, is long-lasting pain that develops when the peripheral and the central nervous system are sensitized following injury to these systems. Neuropathic pain may be continuous pain, spontaneous, or pain caused by hypersensitivity to non-nociceptive levels of stimulus.Angiotensin II (AngII) is an octapeptide that regulates blood pressure, controls water fluid balance, and pain perception. It activates two membrane bound G protein-coupled receptors: angiotensin II type 1 receptors (ATR) and angiotensin II type 2 receptors (ATR). AgnII co-localization with substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide implies its role in nociception. ATR, the receptor mainly responsible for AngII's effect on the pain mechanisms within the nervous system, is expressed in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), as well as human trigeminal ganglia. These receptors are locally produced inside DRG neurons, implying the presence of an intrinsic angiotensinergic system. Injured nerves and painful neuromas show higher ATR expression compared to normal undamaged nerves. AngII contributes to neuropathic pain by potentiating neuronal pathways that signal pain when AngII activates ATR expressed on pain detecting neurons. AngII potentiates neuronal pathways by increasing neurite length and density in DRG neurons. AngII potentiates neuronal pathways by sensitizing nociceptors as well. Nociceptor sensitization suggests a decreased thresholds for activation of nociceptors. ATR activation increases kinase levels in DRG neurons, such as levels of PKA, PKC and MAPK, via G protein-coupled receptor-activated second messenger pathways. These phosphorylating enzymes sensitize major voltage-gated ion channels found on DRG neurons. Sensitization increases neuronal excitation following receptor channel activation. EMA401 antagonized human ATR with a Ki of 5.4 <b>nM,</b> <b>IC</b> of 39 nM and a Hill coefficient of 1.3. EMA401 alleviates pain and provides relief by blocking the AngII induced potentiation.|$|E

Histone deacetylase inhibitors radiosensitise tumour cells but not normal cells in vitro and variously downregulate DNA damage signalling, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair proteins. We investigated panobinostat (PAN) as a potential radiosensitiser in bladder cancer cells. Materials and methodsClonogenic assays were performed in RT 112 bladder cancer cells, and RT 112 cells stably knocked down for RAD 51 or Ku 80 by shRNAi. Resolution of γH 2 AX foci was determined by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, cell cycle progression by FACS analysis and protein expression by western blotting. ResultsPAN had a greater radiosensitising effect in Ku 80 KD than RT 112 or RAD 51 KD cells; enhancement ratios 1. 35 for Ku 80 KD at 10 <b>nM</b> (<b>IC</b> 20 for Ku 80 KD) and 1. 31 for RT 112 and RAD 51 KD at 25 <b>nM</b> (<b>IC</b> 40 for both).

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Supernatants from {{epithelial}} cell cultures enhance eosinophil survival in vitro, this effect being abrogated by previous incubation of eosinophils with glucocorticosteroids. This property {{has resulted in}} the development of an in vitro test to compare the potency of these drugs. A comparative study was performed with dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, deflazacort, and budesonide. METHODS [...] Human {{epithelial cell}} conditioned media (HECM) was generated from cultured epithelial cells obtained from healthy nasal mucosa and polyps. Eosinophils isolated from the peripheral blood were incubated with different corticosteroids for one hour before the addition of HECM. The inhibitory potency of the four steroids on the eosinophil survival index was compared using the concentration of steroid causing 50 % inhibition (IC 50). RESULTS [...] Eosinophil survival was increased by HECM from both healthy nasal mucosa and polyps. All four steroids blocked HECM-induced eosinophil survival in a dose-dependent manner. On healthy nasal mucosa methylprednisolone was the least potent (IC 50 = 536 <b>nM),</b> deflazacort (<b>IC</b> 50 = 264 nM) was twice as potent as methylprednisolone, while budesonide and dexamethasone were approximately nine times as potent (both IC 50 = 58 nM). When potency was evaluated on the promoting effects of the HECM obtained from nasal polyps, the inhibitory potencies were lower and consequently the IC 50 values were higher when compared with HECM generated from healthy nasal mucosa: methylprednisolone (IC 50 = 546 <b>nM),</b> deflazacort (<b>IC</b> 50 = 390 <b>nM),</b> dexamethasone (<b>IC</b> 50 = 76 <b>nM),</b> and budesonide (<b>IC</b> 50 = 78 nM). CONCLUSIONS [...] The potencies of glucocorticosteroids can be compared by evaluating their effects on the survival of eosinophils previously primed by supernatants obtained from epithelial cell culture. The different effects of steroids on eosinophils primed by HECM obtained from healthy nasal mucosa compared with HECM obtained from nasal polyps suggest that polyps might represent more active tissue which is relatively resistant to treatment with corticosteroids...|$|R

The most potent in vitro inhibitors for human erythrocyte and mouse brain APH are DFP (IC 50 11 – 17 <b>nM),</b> chlorpyrifos oxon (<b>IC</b> 50 21 – 71 <b>nM),</b> dichlorvos (<b>IC</b> 50 230 – 560 <b>nM),</b> naled (<b>IC</b> 50 370 – 870 nM), and their analogs with modified alkyl substituents. 3 H-diisopropyl fluorophosphate is a potent inhibitor of mouse blood and brain APH in vivo (ED 50 0. 09 – 0. 2 mg/kg and 0. 02 – 0. 03 mg/l for ip and vapor exposure, respectively). Mouse blood and brain APH and blood butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are of similar sensitivity to DFP in vitro and in vivo (ip and vapor exposure), but APH inhibition is much more persistent in vivo (still> 80 % inhibition after 4 days). The inhibitory potency of OP pesticides in vivo in mice varies from APH selective (dichlorvos, naled, and trichlorfon), to APH and BChE selective (profenofos and tribufos), to ChE selective or nonselective (many commercial insecticides). Sarin administered ip at a lethal dose to guinea pigs inhibits blood acetylcholinesterase and BChE completely but erythrocyte APH only partially.

We improve HR by employing two RF-receivers, integrated in a single 65 <b>nm</b> CMOS <b>IC,</b> and using a small offset in their LO-frequencies. The offset is corrected in the digital baseband, after which the final receiver outputs are crosscorrelated. Our measurements show that the HR can be significantly improved without calibration or time penalty, even for high initial HR, but that the improvement is limited by crosstalk between the receivers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractKinetic {{constants}} of KM = 0. 8 μM, 3 μM and 1. 6 μM, and kcat = 9 s− 1, 7 s− 1 or 9 s− 1 {{were determined}} for histidine dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases 1, 2 A and 2 C respectively. IC 50 values were determined for the inhibition of {{protein phosphatase 1}} by inhibitor 1 (IC 50 = 1 <b>nM),</b> inhibitor- 2 (<b>IC</b> 50 = 3 nM) and okadaic acid (IC 50 = 30 nM) and for the inhibition of protein phosphatase 2 A by okadaic acid (IC 50 = 0. 02 <b>nM)</b> and microcystin-LR (<b>IC</b> 50 = 1 nM). Inhibitor- 1 (Ki = 0. 7 nM) and okadaic acid (Ki = 32 nM) are noncompetitive with protein phosphatase 1. some of the IC 50 values were low enough to violate the assumptions of the usual inhibition equations and a more general approach {{to the analysis of}} the data was used. On the basis of these kinetic parameters and the presence of phosphohistidine, the major cellular protein serine/threonine phosphatases are likely to act as protein histidine phosphatases in the cell...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} step in today’s Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing is optical proximity correction (OPC). While OPC increases the fidelity of pattern transfer to the wafer, it also results in significant increase in IC layout file size. In this paper, we develop two techniques for compressing post-OPC layout data while remaining compliant with existing industry standard data formats such as OASIS and GDSII. The motivation for doing so is for the resulting compressed files to be viewed and edited by any industry standard CAD tools without a decoder. Our approach is to eliminate redundancies in {{the representation of the}} geometric data by finding repeating groups of polygons between multiple cells as well as within a cell. We refer to the former as “inter-cell sub-cell detection” and the later as “intra-cell sub-cell detection”. Both problems are NP hard, and as such, we propose two sets of greedy algorithms to solve them. We show the results of our proposed inter-cell and intra-cell algorithms on actual 90 nm, 130 nm, and 180 <b>nm</b> <b>IC</b> layouts. Index Terms — IC layout, compression, OPC, repeatin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—While {{the dynamic}} thermal {{management}} problem {{is closely related}} to the dynamic power management problem, it has its own distinct features. In this paper, we study the feasibility checking problem for real-time periodic task sets under the peak temperature constraint. We show that the traditional scheduling approach, i. e. to repeat the schedule that is feasible through the range of one hyperperiod, does not apply any more. We then present new necessary and sufficient conditions to check the feasibility of real-time schedules. We further incorporate the close relationship of leakage, temperature, and supply voltage into our feasibility analysis, and develop more elaborated feasibility con-ditions. Our experiments, based on technical parameters derived from a processor using the 65 <b>nm</b> <b>IC</b> technology, demonstrate the effectiveness of our feasibility conditions and, at the same time, highlight the fact that a power/thermal-aware computing technique becomes ineffective at the submicron scale if the inter dependency of leakage, temperature, and supply voltage is not properly addressed. Index Terms—Feasibility analysis, leakage, power aware, real-time systems, temperature, thermal management. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} {{of a series of}} bicyclic ring containing dual aromatase-sulfatase inhibitors (DASIs) based on the aromatase inhibitor (AI) 4 -[(4 -bromobenzyl) (4 H- 1, 2, 4 -triazol- 4 -yl) amino] benzonitrile are reported. Biological evaluation with JEG- 3 cells revealed structure-activity relationships. The X-ray crystal structure of sulfamate 23 was determined, and selected compounds were docked into the aromatase and steroid sulfatase (STS) crystal structures. In the sulfamate-containing series, compounds containing a naphthalene ring are both the most potent AI (39, IC 50 AROM = 0. 25 nm) and the best STS inhibitor (31, IC 50 STS = 26 nm). The most promising DASI is 39 (IC 50 AROM = 0. 25 <b>nm,</b> <b>IC</b> 50 STS = 205 nm), and this was evaluated orally in vivo at 10 mg kg(- 1), showing potent inhibition of aromatase (93 %) and STS (93 %) after 3 h. Potent aromatase and STS inhibition can thus be achieved with a DASI containing a bicyclic ring system; development of such a DASI could provide an attractive new option for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-established}} pace {{of progress}} in semiconductor electronics, expressed by Moore's Law, has led to new opportunities in medical ultrasound imaging. Traditionally, ultrasound systems have separated the transducer array {{from most of the}} electronic instrumentation, with multicore physical cabling in between. This avoids problems with electrical power, functional density, and communication bandwidth. However, it is far from ideal in terms of cost, ergonomics, and the need to interface instrumentation and the transducer with the cable, and it causes particular difficulties with miniature devices. Given these issues, and the relatively slow progress in front end transducer technology, integration of the transducer with electronics is certain to increase, most likely at a pace governed by financial investment, development of electronics for other applications, and the realisation of high volume ultrasound applications. This paper therefore considers motivations for increased integration, technical barriers, and relevant new techniques, particularly related to microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Increased integration will rely on advances in integrated circuit (IC) electronics, device assembly, and microsystems engineering, with key constraints being the packaging of a system in a small volume and the power supply. System partitioning will determine where functionality will reside physically within the imaging hardware and software. This paper considers relevant recent developments in academic research and industry, with a particular focus on medical applications. IC design is important because it defines parameters such as power consumption. 45 <b>nm</b> <b>ICs</b> are now in high volume production but the present relatively small ultrasound market makes adoption difficult. Ingenuity in exploiting existing technology cost-effectively and bespoke engineering where required are likely to be important for integration of piezoelectric material with electronics technology and funct- - ionality will correspond with different layers in a device. In this paper, examples are selected from the authors' work to illustrate progress and suggest how MEMS roadmaps and application demands may relate to future systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of artemether against 56 African isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from Senegal was evaluated using an isotope-based drug susceptibility semi-microtest. The 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values for artemether {{were in a}} narrow range from 0. 8 to 15. 2 <b>nM</b> (mean <b>IC</b> 50 5 3. 43 nM) and the 95 % confidence interval (CI) was 2. 50 – 4. 36 nM. Artemether was equally effective on chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant isolates (mean IC 50 5 346 nM, 95 % CI 5 2. 08 – 4. 84 <b>nM</b> versus mean <b>IC</b> 50 5 2. 80 nM, 95 % CI 5 2. 00 – 3. 60 nM). There was a significant positive correlation between responses to artemether and mefloquine (r 2 5 0. 36, P, 0. 001), artemether and quinine (r 2 5 0. 085, P, 0. 05), artemether and halofantrine (r 2 5 0. 075, P, 0. 05), quinine and mefloquine (r 2 5 0. 205, P, 0. 01), quinine and halofantrine (r 2 5 0. 124, P, 0. 05), and mefloquine and halofantrine (r 2 5 0. 801, P, 0. 001). A positive correlation between these drugs suggests in vitro cross-resistance {{or at least in}} vitro cross-susceptibility. In the absence of effective and practical preventive mea-sures, the only current options for reducing the morbidity and mortality of malaria especially in Africa are chemopro-phylaxis and chemotherapy. For this reason, the increasing prevalence of strains of Plasmodium falciparum resistant t...|$|R
40|$|Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and glucose-depend-ent insulinotropic {{polypeptide}} (GIP; {{also known}} as gas-tric inhibitory polypeptide) are incretin hormones that reduce postprandial glycemic excursions via enhancing insulin release but are rapidly inactivated by enzymatic N-terminal truncation.
