5000|$|The {{limiting}} factor for direct voltages is a shock-hazard protection limit of 60 V, which {{must not be}} exceeded even during voltage fluctuations caused by extreme conditions. This limit eliminates the option of an automotive electrical system with a <b>nominal</b> <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> of 48 V, because at low temperatures the charging voltage of the battery can attain 60 V. Also, the price, weight and volume of batteries {{are influenced by the}} number of cells, which must therefore be kept to a minimum.|$|E
50|$|The {{solar array}} {{consists}} of hundreds (or thousands) of photovoltaic solar cells converting sunlight into electricity.

The cells are wired together into strings while strings are often wired together to form a panel. Panels normally have voltages close to the <b>nominal</b> <b>battery</b> <b>voltage.</b> The main aim is to get as much cell area in as small a space as possible. Designers encapsulate the cells to protect them from the weather and breakage.|$|E
40|$|The University of Canterbury {{purchased}} a modern Toyota MR 2 sports {{car with the}} intention of converting it into an electric vehicle. Similar to the common combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles requires power and control systems to operate the 12 Vdc auxiliaries, such as lights, indicators and wipers. Traditional technology results in a large number of wires in the wiring harness. To reduce the number of wires, an alternative method is to use a pair of control lines and a universal power connection around the vehicle. This power and control system is named the "Power Distribution Network" and it is implemented by using multiple power converters and a differential control system. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and test results of the Power Distribution Network for the MR 2. The 300 Vdc <b>nominal</b> <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> is converted to an intermediate voltage of 48 V. This configuration is considered more efficient than the usual 12 V distribution system since smaller and lighter wires can be used to carry same amount of power. The Power Distribution Network operates off the 48 V intermediate voltage, and provides 12 V output power to drive all the auxiliaries in the vehicle. The Power Distribution Network also has the ability of detect faults from the auxiliary loads as well as turn on and off these loads. The Power Distribution Network is implemented with two major systems: the Auxiliary Power System, which consists of a 360 W Cuk converter with current limiting control circuits to step-down voltage from the 48 V intermediate voltage to the 12 V. The other system is the CAN Control system, it is developed using micro-controllers and standalone CAN controllers that control and monitor the auxiliary loads in the vehicle. The prototype Power Distribution Network is fully operational and has been tested with eight of 12 V light bulbs which are used to simulate the auxiliary loads in the vehicle. Experimental measurements show that the prototype is able to successfully control the light bulbs under the full load condition. This confirms that in principle the Power Distribution Network is suitable as the power and control system for the auxiliary loads in an electric vehicle...|$|E
50|$|The {{telephone}} company maintains large battery systems that supply DC line voltage {{for the operation}} of analog telephone service at customer locations. The voltage supplied is a compromise between operational needs for reliable service and safety precautions for customers and service personnel. The length of the line to a customer telephone interface presents a resistance across which the central office voltage experiences a drop and therefore the voltage at the customer site may vary. The <b>nominal</b> <b>battery</b> (system) <b>voltage</b> is 52.1 V, based on a 24-cell lead-acid <b>battery.</b> The <b>voltage</b> at a subscriber's network interface is typically 48 V between the ring and tip wires.|$|R

40|$|The University of Canterbury has {{purchased}} a 1992 Toyota MR 2 {{and used it}} as the platform to construct a new electric car. Similar to the common combustion engine vehicle, electric vehicles require control systems to control the operation of 12 Vdc auxiliary loads, such as lights, indicators and windscreen wipers, where traditional technology results in {{a large number of}} wires in the wiring harness. Also, with the added complexity of modern vehicles, the need for integrating independent control systems together has become very important in providing safer and more efficient vehicles. To reduce the number of wires and make it possible for different control systems to communicate, and so perform more complex tasks, a flexible and reliable control system is used. The CAN (Controller Area Network) control system is a simple two-wire differential serial bus system, which was developed by Bosch for automotive applications in the early 1980 s. The power and control system within the vehicle is named the "Power Distribution Network" and it is implemented by using multiple power converters and the CAN control system. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and test results of the CAN control system for the MR 2. The 312 Vdc <b>nominal</b> <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> is converted to an intermediate voltage of 48 Vdc. This configuration is considered more efficient than the usual 12 Vdc distribution system since smaller and lighter wires can be used to carry the same amount of power.

The Power Distribution Network is implemented with two major subsystems: the auxiliary power system, which consists of multiple converters to step-down voltage from the 48 Vdc intermediate voltage to the 12 Vdc, and the CAN control system, which is developed to control and integrate the 12 Vdc auxiliary loads within the vehicle. The prototype CAN control system is fully operational and has been tested with 12 Vdc loads which are used to simulate most of the auxiliary loads in the vehicle.

This confirms that in principle the CAN control system is suitable for controlling the auxiliary loads in an electric vehicle...|$|E
40|$|This study proposes an {{improved}} cell balancing circuit for fast equalization among lithium-ion (Li-ion) <b>batteries.</b> A simple <b>voltage</b> sensorless charge balancing circuit {{has been proposed}} in the past [1]. This cell balancing circuit automatically transfers energy from high-to low-voltage battery cells. However, the circuit requires a switch with low on-resistance because the balancing speed {{is limited by the}} on-resistance of the switch. Balancing speed decreases as the voltage difference among the battery cells decrease. In this study, the balancing speed of the cell balancing circuit is enhanced by using the auxiliary circuit, which boosts the balancing current. The charging current is determined by the <b>nominal</b> <b>battery</b> cell <b>voltage</b> and thus, the balancing speed is almost constant despite the very small voltage differences among the batteries. Simulation results are provided to verify the validity of the proposed cell balancing circuit. ? ??? 2014 ? ???????? ????? ?????...|$|R

40|$|In Domestic Wind Machines, if {{the wind}} speed is low, the output voltage is not {{sufficient}} to charge the battery as it is lower than the rated charging <b>voltage</b> of the <b>battery.</b> This limits the overall efficiency of the Wind Machine to 20 %. This study proposed to design and develop a Buck Boost Controller for the effective utilization of the wind machine. By implementing a controller based Buck Boost converter, the voltage produced at the lower wind speeds can also be utilized effectively by boosting it to the rated charging <b>voltage</b> of the <b>battery.</b> Also {{if the wind}} speed is high (> 14 m/s), the DC output voltage will increase to more than 65 V.

Thus the effective utilization of the wind machine has been achieved by the use of the proposed Buck Boost Controller...|$|R
25|$|One other notable change {{occurred}} during the 1916 modifications. The high voltage propulsion control was replaced with a safer low voltage propulsion control, which utilized <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage</b> in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the <b>battery</b> <b>voltage,</b> by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors.
