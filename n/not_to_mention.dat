5|$|Linezolid {{was quite}} {{expensive}} in 2009; {{a course of}} treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90.

In the backstory of Mortal Kombat X, Mileena is the sole surviving heir of Shao Kahn and vies for the Outworld throne with the warlord Kotal Kahn. Despite conflicting messages from the dualism of her design, leading to some negative criticism, Mileena has had mostly positive reception from fans and critics alike.|$|E

5|$|Cabral was not {{the first}} European to stumble upon areas of present-day Brazil, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> other parts of South America. Roman coins have been found in today's Venezuela, {{northwest}} of Brazil, presumably from ships that were carried away by storm in ancient times. Norsemen reached North America and even established settlements, though these ended in failure sometime {{before the end of the}} 15th century. Christopher Columbus, on his third voyage to the New World in 1498, traveled along part of what would later become Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F.

Pembleton asks for {{time to consider}} it, and the duo ask him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the offer to Gee. Gee is inquisitive and immediately senses Pembleton is lying when he says the discussion was nothing. After discussing the offer with his wife Mary (Ami Brabson), Pembleton decides {{not to take the}} job and confesses to Gee, who has already learned the truth and is disappointed Pembleton did not tell him sooner. The episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives, which he seldom does.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led {{to a loss of}} nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express {{was a special}} target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Set {{before the}} events of Thor, Phil Coulson stops {{at a gas station}} on his way to Albuquerque, New Mexico. While Coulson shops for snacks {{in the back of the}} station, two robbers enter and demand the money from the register. When the robbers ask whose car is outside, Coulson reveals himself, {{surrender}}s his keys, and offers to surrender his pistol as well. As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> his involvement to the police and leaves the station.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were the}} religiously diverse {{part of the}} British Empire, {{with a high degree}} of tolerance. The Penn family were Quakers, and the colony became a {{favorite}} destination for that group as well as German Lutherans, German Reformed and numerous small sects such as Mennonites, Amish and Moravians, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> Scotch Irish Presbyterians. The Dutch Reformed were strong in upstate New York and New Jersey, and Congregationalists were important in Long Island. The First Great Awakening invigorated religiosity and helped stimulate the growth of Congregational, Methodist and Baptist churches. Non-British colonists included Dutch Calvinist, Swedish Lutherans, Palatine Mennonites, and the Amish.|$|E

5|$|The exact terms {{by which}} Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The {{existence}} of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that there never was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the occupation of {{a part of his}} country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> {{the millions}} of dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Valérie is repulsed by her ugly {{husband and}} has gone five years without kissing him. She {{explains}} bluntly that her {{position as a}} married woman provides subtleties and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price; after Marneffe dies, Valérie jockeys for position between Hulot and Montés (while also sleeping with Steinbock), then discards them all to marry Crevel, who offers the most wealth. She amuses herself by mocking her lovers' devotion, and this wickedness– <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> her gruesome demise– has led some critics to speculate that she is actually the focus of Balzac's morality tale.|$|E

5|$|With {{financial}} success came more clients {{and opportunities to}} serve his community. Tucker received many cases in debt collection, and he was appointed trustee of the Lynchburg Female Academy and vestryman at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. Tucker was also elected {{to serve in the}} United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825, representing the Lynchburg area in the 16th, 17th, and 18th United States Congresses. His financial largess was short-lived, as Tucker was unable to resist the allure of society and lavish living in Washington, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the increased expenses of a larger immediate family.|$|E
5|$|An Associate Professor of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Stafford L. Warren, was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps, and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos. The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, {{but also for the}} MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.|$|E
5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time}} in casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
