5000|$|This {{differs from}} {{traditional}} insurance, which attempts to differentiate and reward [...] "safe" [...] drivers, giving them lower premiums and/or a <b>no-claims</b> <b>bonus.</b> However, conventional differentiation {{is a reflection}} of history rather than present patterns of behaviour. This means that it may take a long time before safer (or more reckless) patterns of driving and changes in lifestyle feed through into premiums.|$|E
50|$|Bonus {{usually is}} a {{discount}} in the premium which is given on {{the renewal of}} the policy if no claim {{is made in the}} previous year. Malus is an increase in the premium if there is a claim in the previous year. Bonus-malus systems are very common in vehicle insurance. This system is also called a no-claim discount (NCD) or <b>no-claims</b> <b>bonus</b> in Britain and Australia.|$|E
50|$|There are 8 {{equipments}} kinds: weapons, {{the familiar}} ones, rings, amulets, boots, capes, hats and Dofus. Each character can carry only one equipment of each category. All {{the categories of}} equipment bring <b>no-claims</b> <b>bonus</b> to the carrier. The weapons have however a role particular to Dofus Arena (in addition to that to strike) because they {{make it possible to}} regulate the initiative of the characters.|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an answer to}} the question of whether negative or positive financial consequences which were intended to stimulate drivers to be involved in fewer accidents really cause fewer accidents. The research question was worded as follows: what are the effects of financial stimuli on reported damages? Two groups of insured motorists were compared: one group insured according to a <b>no-claim</b> <b>bonus</b> system, and one group who was not insured according to a <b>no-claim</b> <b>bonus</b> system. From the claims data made available by the Association of Dutch Insurers, a selection was made in order to create the two groups. Injury accidents were excluded from the analysis. The analysis was conducted in three steps: (1) An analysis of the claim amounts made to investigate the similarity of the groups showed no marked differences between the two; (2) A paired comparison was based on groups differing only in insurance policy; and (3) a comparison was made based on individual policies by applying a generalised linear model. The most important conclusion from this analysis was that it is not true that a <b>no-claim</b> <b>bonus</b> arrangement generally causes fewer reported claims and/or less third-party loss. (A...|$|R
40|$|The <b>no-claim</b> <b>bonus</b> {{problem has}} given rise to a {{considerable}} amount of discussion throughout the whole world. There is quite a difference of opinion among the actuaries and other experts concerned in this field and several exchanges of view have taken place the last few years. The ASTIN section of the Permanent Committee has been well aware of this fact and it has devoted one Colloquium to this subject and discussed it at others. In 1959 the major part of the La Baule meeting was dedicated to this subject and attention was focussed on this problem once again at Rattvik in 1961. Nevertheless controversies on this subject still continue. Almost every conference where the bonus problem is discussed is marked by a widespread difference of opinion. As is well known, the claim frequencies under insurance policies show a considerable heterogeneity, especially in the early years. It is not possible to get homogeneous sub-groups by means of a continuous subdivision; what may be gained in homogeneity, is lost in credibility. It seems therefore that a subsequent adjustment of premiums according to the past claim record may well be a suitable way of obtaining a fair premium. Those who are in favour of a rating procedure granting a bonus at a careful driver will stress that criticism is useless as long as no better solution is available, whereas actuaries who reject such a rating system argue that the unfairness of a flat rate is not at all eliminated by means of a bonu...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optional bonus-malus contract {{based on a}} pri-ori risk classification of the underlying insurance contract. By inducing self-selection, {{the purchase of the}} bonus-malus contract {{can be used as a}} screening device. This gives an even better pricing performance than both an experience rating scheme and a classical <b>no-claims</b> <b>bonus</b> system. An application to the Danish automobile insurance market is considered...|$|E
40|$|You loose your <b>no-claims</b> <b>bonus,</b> ” instead of, “You {{lose your}} <b>no-claims</b> <b>bonus,</b> ” {{is an example}} of a real-word {{spelling}} error. One way to enable a spellchecker to detect such errors is to prime it with information about likely features of the context for loose (as a verb) as compared with lose. To this end, we extracted all the examples of loose used as a verb from the BNC (British National Corpus, XML edition, written part (Burnard, 2007)). There were, apparently, 159 occurrences of loose (VVB or VVI). However, on inspection, well over half of these were not verbs at all (tagging errors) and over half of the rest were misspellings of lose; far from providing us with useful information for correcting the loose-for-lose error, they were themselves examples of it. Only about fifteen percent of the 159 occurrences were genuine occurrences of loose as a verb. This prompted us to undertake a small investigation into errors in the BNC. Let us make it clear at the outset that we consider the BNC a very valuable resource, that we make great use of it and that we are most appreciative of the wor...|$|E
