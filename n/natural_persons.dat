On December 31, 2013, this total was reduced to 782 when Antler, Gladmar, Ruthilda and Shackleton all dissolved from village status. It was further reduced to 779 after the dissolutions of Elstow (effective December 16, 2014), Rabbit Lake (effective October 30, 2015) and Primate (effective December 31, 2015).

500|$|Part V of the Act, {{sections}} 28 to 33, {{deals with}} trustees' remuneration. Section 28 states the default {{position is that}} trustees are entitled to remuneration if it says so in the trust instrument or if a trustee acts in a [...] "professional capacity". A trust can differ from this default, but the Act confirms the recent developments in the common law from the old default position that trustees were entitled to nothing unless it was explicitly stated that they were. Section 29 {{goes on to say}} that non-charitable professional trustees are entitled to [...] "reasonable remuneration" [...] which will be a sum that the court thinks is commensurate to the work done, along the principles of quantum meruit. This is automatic if the trustee is a corporation, but will require consent of all other trustees if the trustees are <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> Section 30 stipulates that rules on charitable trustee remuneration are to be found in a statutory instrument drawn up by the Secretary of State. Trustees will be reimbursed from the trust fund itself, as will be authorised agents, nominees and custodians who are properly appointed by the trustees all so long as the expenses and payable remuneration are incurred while conducting the affairs of the trust.|$|E

500|$|Persons [...] "within its jurisdiction" [...] are {{entitled}} to equal protection from a state. Largely because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV has from the beginning guaranteed the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states, the Supreme Court has rarely construed the phrase [...] "within its jurisdiction" [...] in relation to <b>natural</b> <b>persons.</b> In Plyler v. Doe (1982), where the Court held that aliens illegally present in a state are within its jurisdiction and may thus raise equal protection claims the Court explicated {{the meaning of the}} phrase [...] "within its jurisdiction" [...] as follows: [...] "se of the phrase [...] "within its jurisdiction" [...] confirms the understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment's protection extends to anyone, citizen or stranger, who is subject to the laws of a State, and reaches into every corner of a State's territory." [...] The Court reached this understanding among other things from Senator Howard, a member of the Joint Committee of Fifteen, and the floor manager of the amendment in the Senate.
