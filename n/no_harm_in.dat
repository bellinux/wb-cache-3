5|$|Criticism often arises after single acts of {{violence}} committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, Colton Orr of the New York Rangers fought with Todd Fedoruk of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk unconscious. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight {{earlier in the season}} with Derek Boogaard. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players acknowledge that there is <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> discussing the issue; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of convincing {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when used as a vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that despite {{the lack of}} evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E

500|$|Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar praised Trevor {{for being}} the first {{character}} in the series that [...] "makes sense". He stated that, upon their first playthrough of a Grand Theft Auto game, most players [...] "carjacked some poor schlub, then started doing 90mph on the sidewalk, mowing over civilians", as opposed to playing peacefully. [...] "Trevor's existence isn't a commentary on any group of people–he's just the first logical fit to the way people have been playing GTA games for the past decade," [...] he said. Sullivan concluded that Trevor {{is one of the}} few protagonists in the Grand Theft Auto that would willingly execute popular player actions, such as murder and violence. Trevor has been compared to many other characters in video games and films. Calvin Khan of IGN compared Trevor to Heath Ledger's Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight. Khan felt that Trevor is the only character in Grand Theft Auto V not trying to fake his persona, stating [...] "Trevor absolutely knows that he's a monster but just doesn't care. He enjoys causing misery and harm, lives for it and embraces it and – much like Heath Ledger's Joker – he exists purely for unadulterated anarchy." [...] He also felt that Trevor's only reasoning for hurting people and messing everything up around him is simply because it's just too much fun not to. Khan concluded saying that it's clear that the world through the eyes of Trevor is already royally broken and he sees <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> messing it up some more, hence the reason for Trevor's actions.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) asked vaccine {{makers to}} remove the organomercury {{compound}} thiomersal (spelled [...] "thimerosal" [...] in the US) from vaccines as quickly as possible, and thiomersal has been phased out of US and European vaccines, except for some preparations of influenza vaccine. The CDC and the AAP followed the precautionary principle, which assumes that there is <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> exercising caution even if it later {{turns out to be}} unwarranted, but their 1999 action sparked confusion and controversy that Thiomersal was the cause of autism.|$|E

Minchin states that {{there is very little}} harm in something like reiki, but asks [...] "where do you draw the line?" [...] when it comes to needing real evidence if a therapy works or not. He states that he is an atheist as well as a skeptic, and cannot understand how someone can be a skeptic and still be religious.

2500|$|The {{publisher}} John Murray made {{an offer}} of payment for a revised second edition of Journal and Remarks, diverting Darwin's attention from South America. On 25 April Darwin began extensive revisions incorporating his latest information and interpretations, including several hints about his species speculation. He now saw the Galápagos Archipelago as [...] "a little world within itself, or rather a satellite attached to America, whence it has derived a few stray colonists," [...] where we were [...] "astonished {{at the number of}} their aboriginal beings, and at their confined range", and [...] "seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact – that mystery of mysteries – the first appearance of new beings on this earth." [...] On 5 August Darwin began reading Lyell's Travels in North America, and was horrified that it saw <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> slavery. He added two new paragraphs to his Journal, cataloguing atrocities after stating [...] "I thank God, I shall never again visit a slave-country", and finished his revisions on 26 August.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{psychologist}} Carol Tavris noted {{several other}} groups that reacted negatively to the study. The anti-homosexuality group National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), who [...] " [...] the long-discredited psychoanalytic notion {{that homosexuality is}} a mental disorder {{and that it is}} a result of seduction in childhood by an adult", objected to the study's implications that boys who are sexually abused are not traumatized for life and do not become homosexuals as a result. [...] Therapists who supported the existence of recovered memories and recovered-memory therapy, {{as well as those who}} attributed mental illnesses such as dissociative identity disorder, depression and eating disorders to repressed memories of sexual abuse also rejected the study. [...] Tavris attributed this rejection to the fear of malpractice lawsuits. [...] Tavris herself believed that the study could have been interpreted positively as an example of psychological resilience in the face of adversity, and noted that CSA causing little or <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> some individuals is not an endorsement of the act, nor does it make it any less illegal.|$|E
2500|$|Some Christians feel {{concerned}} about the modern celebration of Halloween because they feel it trivializes– or celebrates– paganism, the occult, or other practices and cultural phenomena deemed incompatible with their beliefs. Father Gabriele Amorth, an exorcist in Rome, has said, [...] "if English and American children like to dress up as witches and devils on one night of the year {{that is not a}} problem. If it is just a game, there is <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> that." [...] In more recent years, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has organized a [...] "Saint Fest" [...] on Halloween. Similarly, many contemporary Protestant churches view Halloween as a fun event for children, holding events in their churches where children and their parents can dress up, play games, and get candy for free. To these Christians, Halloween holds no threat to the spiritual lives of children: being taught about death and mortality, and the ways of the Celtic ancestors actually being a valuable life lesson and a part of many of their parishioners' heritage. Christian minister Sam Portaro wrote that Halloween is about using [...] "humor and ridicule to confront the power of death".|$|E

2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? He told us we were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, you know there are millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that.

2500|$|Ryan Buell {{began to}} merge the two spirits {{together}} into a new character called, [...] "The Shadow Man", ignoring that Bill even existed, and even tried to over-dramatize it by reciting the name [...] "Shadow Man" [...] in a deeper tone of voice {{to make it sound}} ominous. Several cuts were also made for the purpose of all but omitting Bill from the picture, thus making an attempt to sensationalize the Ryans' story and make it all about the evil spirit terrorizing the family. Furthermore, Kelli had been asked to pretend that she knew nothing of Bill or his accident so that the producers of the show could play up the effect of an unfolding story. This did not bother Kelli as she felt there was <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> playing this up a bit (since, in her opinion, the ghost of Bill was very real) but DID have an issue with the producers and staff asking Kelli to scream or yell out so that she would appear to be terrified during her premonitions. Kelli maintains that the crew was disappointed when she told them that she usually froze up when she got premonitions or perceptions and that screaming out was not accurate. Because of all of this, combined with the editing, the viewer is given the mistaken impression that Kelli is attempting to get Bill to leave instead of the dark spirit.|$|E
2500|$|If {{seen from}} another aspect, {{the order of}} the evil of the whisperers seems to be this: first, they incite one to open unbelief, polytheism, or {{rebellion}} against God and Muhammad], and enmity of the righteous (godly) people. If they fail in this and a person does enter God's religion, they misguide him to some innovation. If they fail in this too, they tempt him to sin. If they do not succeed even in this, they inspire the man with the suggestion that there is <b>no</b> <b>harm</b> <b>in</b> indulging in minor sins, so that if he starts committing these freely, he is over burdened with sin. If one escapes from this too, in the last resort they try that one should keep the true religion confined to oneself, and should do nothing to make it prevail, but if a person defeats all these plans, the whole party of the devils froth among men and jinn makes a common front against him incites and stirs up the people and makes them shower him with invective and accusation and slander, and defames him as widely as they can. Then, Satan comes to the believer and excites him to anger, saying: [...] "It is cowardly of you to have borne all this insult: arise and clash with your opponents." [...] This is the last and final device with Satan by which he tries to thwart the struggle of the caller to truth and entangle him in difficulties and obstructions. If he succeeds in escaping from this too, Satan becomes powerless before him. About this same thing it has been said in the Qur'an: [...] "If Satan ever excites you to anger, seek refuge with God."
