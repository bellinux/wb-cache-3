Periodos Ges was divided into two books, [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Asia", with the latter including Libya, the name of which was an ancient term for all of the known Africa.|$|E
2500|$|According to Hans Eysenck: [...] "The main {{dimension}} in the MBTI is called E-I, or extraversion-introversion; this {{is mostly a}} sociability scale, correlating quite well with the MMPI social introversion scale (negatively) and the Eysenck Extraversion scale (positively). Unfortunately, the scale also has a loading on neuroticism, which correlates with the introverted end. Thus introversion correlates roughly (i.e. averaging values for males and females) -.44 with dominance, -.24 with aggression, +.37 with abasement, +.46 with counselling readiness, -.52 with self-confidence, -.36 with personal adjustment, and -.45 with empathy. The failure of the scale to disentangle Introversion and Neuroticism (there is <b>no</b> <b>scale</b> for neurotic and other psychopathological attributes in the MBTI) is its worst feature, only equalled by the failure to use factor analysis {{in order to test}} the arrangement of items in the scale." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Middle-earth storyverse, Hobbits are [...] tall, Dwarves are taller {{at about}} , and Men and Elves are average human height, about [...] However, the films used two scale sets instead of three by casting taller than average actors to play Dwarves, then {{combining}} Dwarves and Hobbits into one size scale. For example, John Rhys-Davies, who played Gimli, is taller than Elijah Wood, who played Frodo. Thus in the ending {{shot of the}} Council of Elrond scene when all nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring are standing together, Rhys-Davies and the four Hobbit actors were filmed all at once, then the human-sized characters (Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas) were filmed in a second take, then the two shots were composited at different scale to make one image, with the initial Dwarf/Hobbit character shot made smaller. A practical upshot of not creating a third scale for Dwarves {{is that in a}} scene in which only Dwarves and Hobbits interact, <b>no</b> <b>scale</b> doubles are needed. For example, when they are entering Lothlórien {{for the first time and}} Gimli claps Frodo on the shoulder and says [...] "stay close, young hobbits", the entire scene employs no size doubles, because Rhys-Davies is naturally the proportionately taller height needed between Dwarves and Hobbits.|$|E

6000|$|These {{two short}} trips {{gave me a}} just measure of the {{comparative}} difficulties in travelling through Eastern and Western Africa, and {{to a certain extent}} accounted for the huge vacuum which disfigures the latter, a few miles behind the seaboard. The road to Unyamwezi, for instance, has been trodden for centuries; the people have become trained porters; they look forward annually to visiting the coast, and they are accustomed to the sight of strangers, Arabs and others. If war or blood-feud chance to close one line, the general interests of the interior open another. But in this section of Africa there is no way except from village to village, and a blood-feud may shut it for months. The people have not the habit of dealing with the foreigner, whom they look upon as a portent, a walking ghost, an ill-omened apparition. Porterage is in embryo, <b>no</b> <b>scale</b> of payment exists; and no dread of cutting off a communication profitable to both importer and exporter prevents the greedy barbarian plundering the stranger. Captain Speke and I were fortunate in being the first whites who seriously attempted the Lake Region; our only obstacles were the European merchants at Zanzibar; the murder of M. Maizan, although a bad example to the people, had been so punished as to render an immediate repetition of the outrage improbable. I say immediate, for, shortly after our return, the unfortunate Herr Roscher was killed at the Hisonguni village, near the Rufuma River, without apparent reason. [FN#22] ...|$|E

6000|$|I first [...] "realised" [...] Fourteenth Street at a {{very tender}} age, and I {{perfectly}} recall that flush of initiation, consisting as it did of an afternoon call with my father at a house there situated, one of an already fairly mature row {{on the south side}} and quite near Sixth Avenue. It was as [...] "our" [...] house, just acquired by us, that he thus invited my approval of it--heaping as that does once more the measure of my small adhesiveness. I thoroughly approved--quite as if I had foreseen that the place was to become to me for ever so long afterwards a sort of anchorage of the spirit, being at the hour as well a fascination for the eyes, since it was there I first fondly gaped at the process of [...] "decorating." [...] I saw charming men in little caps ingeniously formed of folded newspaper--where in the roaring city are those quaint badges of the handicrafts now?--mounted on platforms and casting plaster into moulds; I saw them in particular paste long strips of yellowish grained paper upon walls, and I vividly remember thinking the grain and the pattern (for there was a pattern from waist-high down, a complication of dragons and sphinxes and scrolls and other fine flourishes) a wonderful and sumptuous thing. I would give much, I protest, to recover its lost secret, to see what it really was--so interesting ever to retrace, and sometimes so difficult of belief, in a community of one's own knowing, is the general æsthetic adventure, are the dangers and delusions, the all but fatal accidents and mortal ailments, that Taste has smilingly survived and after which the fickle creature may still quite brazenly look one in the face. Our quarter must have bristled in those years with the very worst of the danger-signals--though indeed they figured but as coarse complacencies; the age of [...] "brown stone" [...] had just been ushered in, and that material, in deplorable, in monstrous form, over all the vacant spaces and eligible sites then numerous between the Fifth and Sixth Avenues, more and more affronted the day. We seemed to have come up from a world of quieter harmonies, the world of Washington Square and thereabouts, so decent in its dignity, so instinctively unpretentious. There were even there spots of shabbiness that I recall, such as the charmless void reaching westward from the two houses that formed the Fifth Avenue corner to our grandfather's, our New York grandfather's house, itself built by him, with the happiest judgment, not so long before, and at no distant time in truth to be solidly but much less pleasingly neighboured. The ancient name of the Parade-ground still hung about the central space, and the ancient wooden palings, then so generally accounted proper for central spaces--the whole image infinitely recedes--affected even my innocent childhood as rustic and mean. Union Square, {{at the top of the}} Avenue--or what practically then counted for the top--was encased, more smartly, in iron rails and further adorned with a fountain and an aged amateur-looking constable, awful to my generation in virtue of his star and his switch. I associate less elegance with the Parade-ground, into which we turned for recreation from my neighbouring dame's-school and where the parades deployed on <b>no</b> <b>scale</b> to check our own evolutions; though indeed the switch of office abounded there, for what I best recover in the connection is a sense and smell of perpetual autumn, with the ground so muffled in the leaves and twigs of the now long defunct ailanthus-tree that most of our own motions were a kicking of them up--the semi-sweet rankness of the plant was all in the air--and small boys pranced about as cavaliers whacking their steeds. There were bigger boys, bolder still, to whom this vegetation, or something kindred that escapes me, yielded long black beanlike slips which they lighted and smoked, the smaller ones staring and impressed; I at any rate think of the small one I can best speak for as constantly wading through an Indian summer of these disjecta, fascinated by the leaf-kicking process, the joy of lonely trudges, over a course in which those parts and the slightly more northward pleasantly confound themselves. These were the homely joys of the nobler neighbourhood, elements that had their match, and more, hard by the Fourteenth Street home, in the poplars, the pigs, the poultry, and the [...] "Irish houses," [...] two or three in number, exclusive of a very fine Dutch one, seated then, this last, almost as among gardens and groves--a breadth of territory still apparent, on the spot, in that marginal ease, that spread of occupation, to the nearly complete absence of which New York aspects owe their general failure of [...] "style." ...|$|E
