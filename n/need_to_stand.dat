25|$|Pietersen {{continued}} {{to lead the}} team during a 5–0 defeat to India in ODI matches; the series was supposed to consist of seven matches, but was abandoned after the fifth due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Pietersen however had a decent series with the bat hitting a quick 63 in the first match and 111 not out in the fifth match. Pietersen's men returned to England before resuming the tour amid unprecedented security, to play a two-Test series. Pietersen was highly vocal {{in regards to the}} resumption of the tour, citing a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to terrorism. He had an aggregate of 5 runs in 2 innings in the first test being dismissed by Yuvraj Singh in the second innings which showed Pietersen's struggles against Yuvraj from the ODI series carried on. England were defeated in the first, however the team recovered to draw the second with Pietersen scoring 144.|$|E

Fierstein had won four Tonys: acting and writing awards for Torch Song Trilogy, an acting Tony for Hairspray, and one for writing the book of La Cage; Lauper is a chart-topping singer-songwriter and actress who had won Grammy, Emmy and many other awards for her songs and performances. Fierstein noted a change in focus between the film [...] "about the saving of a factory" [...] and the musical, which include [...] "drag queens singing as they pass along the assembly line." [...] He said the main {{difference is that the}} musical is, [...] "at its core, about two young men who come from seemingly opposite worlds who figure out that they have a lot in common, beginning with the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> up to their dads." [...] Lauper's inspirations ranged from listening as a child to her parents' recordings of South Pacific and West Side Story, as well as musical inspirations as diverse as Aaron Copland's [...] "Appalachian Spring" [...] and pop singer Lana Del Rey. In a broadcast interview with Patrick Healy of The New York Times, Lauper and Fierstein said that, in adapting the film, they stressed themes of community and the universality of the father-son bond as vehicles to explore the issues of tolerance and self-acceptance.|$|E

Jaime Weinman writing in Maclean's said, [...] "hether {{it was supposed to be}} or not, GamerGate is largely about women".

At the start of 2013 the National Episcopal Conference of Cameroon followed this up by issuing a public statement urging [...] "all believers and people of good will to reject homosexuality and so-called 'gay marriage.

I will spend truth,--all my wealth on thee,"--and the Friend responds silently through his nature and life, and treats his Friend with the same divine courtesy. He knows us literally through thick and thin. He never asks for a sign of love, but can distinguish it by the features which it naturally wears. We never <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> upon ceremony with him with regard to his visits. Wait not till I invite thee, but observe that I am glad to see thee when thou comest.
