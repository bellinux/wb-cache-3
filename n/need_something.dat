5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will <b>need</b> <b>something</b> other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} that Charlie {{has not been}} taking her medication, Serena and Vanessa reluctantly team up to find her. Chuck, Nate, Vanessa, and Serena soon encircle Dan, exclaiming that they <b>need</b> <b>something</b> from him. Chuck asks him where Blair is while Serena and Vanessa ask for Charlie's whereabouts. One of Blair's old friends reveals that Blair left the party. While accompanying Chuck to their apartment to look for Blair, Nate confesses that he told Raina (Tika Sumpter) everything behind her mother's death. Chuck reprimands Nate until Raina interrupts them to apologize. Blair is held hostage by Russell in Chuck's hotel. Pretending to escape, she calls Chuck on her phone, revealing her location. Russell explains his reason for kidnapping Blair: to burn down the hotel with her in it. A drunk Charlie is seen dancing wildly until Dan confronts her, but she escapes. Serena greets Headmistress Queller (Jan Maxwell), who expresses her concern with Serena's choice of staying in New York City, having hoped that Serena would find her place outside of the Upper East Side. Georgina offers her aid in their scheme but Dan, Vanessa, and Serena reject her help, going their separate ways to find Charlie.|$|E
25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because the longer you stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E

500|$|The {{team made}} two minor {{changes to the}} design: they removed Davros' {{microphone}} and completely redesigned Davros' headpiece. The team felt that the microphone was redundant because Davros did not [...] "speak in a whisper and <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to make him more audible", and originally intended to leave Bleach's voice unaltered in post-production: the decision to treat the voice was not made until late May 2008; and Gorton thought the original headpiece [...] "always seemed particularly weak" [...] for [...] "such a powerful character". After he was informed that the production designer for Genesis of the Daleks wanted the headpiece to resemble a medical brace, Gorton redesigned it to appear to be [...] "screwed directly into [...] head".|$|E

500|$|The third {{generation}} MacBook Pro received positive {{reviews of the}} Retina Display, flash storage and power. It was criticized, however, for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive. Roman Loyola of Macworld said that the Retina MacBook Pro was [...] "groundbreaking" [...] and made people [...] "rethink how they use technology". He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body. Dan Ackerman of CNET commented [...] "I've previously called the 15-inch MacBook Pro {{one of the most}} universally useful all-around laptops you can buy. This new version adds to that with HDMI, faster ports, and more portability. But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port, plus its very high starting price. The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users, and with the exception of all-day commuters who <b>need</b> <b>something</b> closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook, one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy." ...|$|E

When I tried to write an Olympic lyric, though, {{it was full of}} sports socks and ribbons. I ended up pissing myself laughing". Then, she called Sjón, an Icelandic poet who had previously collaborated with her on songs such as [...] "Bachelorette" [...] from her fourth studio album Homogenic (1997). When she said to him that they would <b>need</b> <b>something</b> [...] "suitably epic" [...] for the Olympics, the poet even took a short course about Greek mythology at Reykjavík University. [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last song recorded for Medúlla. Björk said about the song: [...] "I am incredibly honoured to have been asked to write a song and sing it at the Olympics. The song is written {{from the point of view}} of the ocean that surrounds all the land and watches over the humans to see how they are doing after millions of years of evolution.

500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this <b>need</b> <b>something.</b> I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E
500|$|The limited series Infinite Crisis (2005), {{written as}} {{a sequel to}} the 1985 maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths, altered DC Comics continuity. Subsequently, all comic book titles {{published}} by DC Comics skip forward one year and a new maxi-series entitled 52 retroactively chronicles the 52 weeks which directly followed Infinite Crisis. When DC editors called for a redesign of Batwoman, comic book artist Alex Ross drew inspiration from the modified Batgirl costume he designed for Barbara Gordon, seven years prior to Kate Kane's debut in the limited comic book series 52. Ross and comic book author Paul Dini initially planned to revive the former Batgirl Barbara Gordon using {{an updated version of}} the character's original costume, with red accents in place of the traditional yellow. However, since Gordon served as one of {{a very small number of}} disabled superheroes of DC Comics as Oracle, DC's editorial staff decided to revitalize the original Batwoman instead. In an interview with Newsarama, Ross states [...] "They had me change the mask and hair to make it a bit more Batwoman, rather than Batgirl...I pointed out to them that the mask makes her look like the Huntress a little overall—but there weren't many options. The original mask that I had in there when it was to be a Batgirl design was the complete head cover that we've seen, so they did <b>need</b> <b>something</b> different from that." ...|$|E

[...] While waiting, Rachel approaches him about his plans and attacks him. [...] Castiel kills her, but is left weakened by a stab wound she managed to inflict on him first. [...] Castiel manages to teleport to Bobby's and draws a sigil to hide himself from the other angels before passing out. [...] He wakes in time to retrieve the Winchesters, but his weakened state prevents this so he is forced to draw power from Bobby's soul. [...] While Dean killed the Phoenix, Castiel brought them back before they could gather the ashes so it all appears for nothing and he lacks the power to send them back. [...] Luckily, Samuel Colt collected the ashes and sent a package with them to be delivered to Bobby's after the boys return.|$|E

John Bergstrom of PopMatters described it as [...] "smooth, winning blue-eyed soul", and Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound commented that its breathy vocals, piano chords and synth backing made it a [...] "successful blend of melancholy and dancefloor-ready rhythms". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian deemed the falsetto vocals and synths [...] "naggingly infectious", citing it as the band's strong point: [...] "the trio may be faceless, but they write a good tune". Sputnikmusic's staff reviewer Rudy Klapper felt that the [...] "techno swirl" [...] of the song [...] "nail the juxtaposition between Wyatt's moody lyrics and the irrepressible production". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated [...] "Black & Blue" [...] four stars out of five and recommended it for when [...] "you just <b>need</b> <b>something</b> to lift the spirits a bit, without someone shouting something stupid in your ear". He continued, [...] "It basically wants to rub your shoulders {{at the end of}} a long hard day, and whisper something funny in your ear while your shoulders untie." [...] Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com said that although it begins melancholy, it [...] "swells to become one of the noisiest points on Miike Snow". Paul Mitchell of The Skinny felt that Wyatt channels Paddy McAloon's breathy vocal style on [...] "Black & Blue", but without the [...] "lyrical wit". He rated the song three stars out of five and called it [...] "decent", finding the remixes available on the release more interesting. A more critical review came from Pitchfork Media's Marc Hogan, who wrote that it [...] "promisingly... splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole".|$|E
