5|$|During the pre-dawn {{coup and}} {{throughout}} the day, there was little reaction by the public who went about their daily life as though <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Many appeared unaware that a coup had occurred {{while they were still}} sleeping. There was no disruption to road traffic or the media, and although flights were halted in the morning, they resumed in the afternoon. There were plans to enact a curfew but this was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the hurricane, many {{residents}} in shanty towns failed to hear tropical cyclone warnings and watches. Some did hear the warnings, but they did not believe them as the same warning had been issued several weeks before and <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> In addition, city officials warned the residents living near the dam to take shelter in public buildings though most refused to leave. The government ignored all requests to shore up an earthen dam, as they did not believe Liza would pose a significant threat of damage to the Baja California Peninsula. Along the Gulf Coast, troops evacuated residents, and radio stations warned all nearby ships to remain at harbor. During the afternoon hours of September29, the education department suspended classes as it began to rain.|$|E

25|$|Dmitry's {{mother died}} in 1911, at her funeral the grand duke’s poor {{eyesight}} became the source of temporary mirth {{at the end of}} the ceremony when he tried to kiss the icon his mother held in her hands. Unable to see clearly, he misjudged the distance and, bending forward to make his farewell, missed the open coffin completely, tumbling off the steps with a loud crash as his ceremonial saber and medals struck the stone floor. Relatives rushed to his side, but the grand duke appeared unfazed and went on as though <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
25|$|North Vietnamese {{security}} forces simply captured a team, turned its radio operator, {{and continued to}} broadcast as though <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Supplies and reinforcements were requested, parachuted in to the requesting team's location, and were likewise captured. During the period 1960–1968 both the CIA and MACSOG dispatched 456 South Vietnamese agents to either their deaths or long incarcerations in northern prisons. Hanoi continued this process year after year, learning SOG's operational methods and bending them to its purpose. In the end, it was running {{one of the most}} successful counterintelligence operations of the post-Second World War period.|$|E
25|$|After {{dropping}} the nixies {{in a nearby}} pond (their reward for having sung to the giants), Jules, Laurie and Nick pass by Cindy's house and notice a large sinkhole close to it. When they go to warn Cindy and her parents, Laurie and Sandspur fall into the growing sinkhole and a tree falls on Jules's legs when attempting to rescue her. When Nick tries to help Laurie {{get out of the}} sinkhole, he finds that she still hadn't died from the methane exhaled by the dragons because Sandspur (who had grown to a huge size, revealing himself to be a spriggan) had been eating them, proceeding to eat Nick whole and only regurgitating him when Laurie drops rocks into the creature's mouth to make him sick. Nick and Laurie get out of the sinkhole and go back to meet Jack Jr. and the Grace kids, leaving Jules at Cindy's house waiting for an ambulance (being followed back by Sandspur, back in his small size, like <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened).</b>|$|E

25|$|After the {{way they}} had left the AWA Michaels and Jannetty could not just return like <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> instead the Midnight Rockers started working for the AWA {{affiliated}} Championship Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis, Tennessee. The team had made a couple of appearances in the CWA in the past as part of their working agreement with the AWA but now they were in Memphis full-time. Their first feud in Memphis was against a recently formed team known as The Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobs) whom they faced in several brutal matches all over the CWA territory. After The Nasty Boys, The Rockers got involved in a feud with “The Nightmares” (Danny Davis and Ken Wayne). Their villainous personas were that of self-obsessed, glory seeking ”superstars”, the same persona Michaels would later adopt as ”The Hearbreak Kid”. Their feud with the RPMs saw the Midnight Rockers defeat Lane and Davis to win the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on October 26, 1987. Jannetty and Michaels lost then regained the Southern Tag Team title as the Midnight Rockers / RPMs feud raged on.|$|E

David met his future Seinfeld stars during that early stage of his career: he worked with Michael Richards (Kramer) on Fridays and with Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Elaine) [...] on SNL.

During his performance, the Black Tom explosion took place at a munitions works in New Jersey, more than [...] from Scarborough. Frank Vanderlip Jr., ten {{years old at the}} time, later recalled that he saw the detonation shake the jammed theater building, and that Paderewski had played on as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> The automatic fire doors {{at the top of the}} theater had sprung open, and two men were sent aloft to sit on them until the end of the performance to prevent a cold draft from entering the room.|$|E
500|$|The {{murder of}} {{the heir to the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire and his wife {{produced}} widespread shock across European royal houses, and there was initially much sympathy for the Austrian position.

[...] An angry exchange followed between the Austrian Chargé d'Affaires at Belgrade and Gruic.|$|E
500|$|To {{reflect the}} {{attitude}} of the country’s leaders, Vietnam's state-controlled media stepped up its propaganda war against the Khmer Rouge, with the official Nhân Dân newspaper regularly calling for international intervention to save the Kampuchean people from domestic terror initiated by the Khmer Rouge regime. Furthermore, instead of sending congratulatory messages like they had done in the previous years, the Vietnamese media changed their tone and began referring to the Kampuchean Government as the [...] "Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique" [...] as the Kampuchean military continued their campaign in Vietnam. By the end of June, the Vietnamese military assembled a multi-division task force to launch another limited-objective campaign against the Kampucheans. Again, the Vietnamese pushed the Kampuchean forces back into the provincial cities of Suong and Prey Veng and then pulled out. However, as they had done before, the Kampuchean Army moved its artillery back towards the border and continued shelling Vietnamese villages as though <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

500|$|Tokyo {{during the}} Meiji period (1868–1912) {{had a great}} {{openness}} to foreign—especially European—influence, and Western trends in art were quickly replacing traditional Japanese ones until word spread of the impact exported ukiyo-e had had on art in the West. [...] Artists who had all but abandoned {{the culture of the}} Edo period began to reconsider it and mix elements of it with Western approaches. [...] Kanae took part in meetings of the Pan no Kai group of writers and artists whose goal was to replicate the atmosphere of Parisian cafés such as Café Guerbois of the Impressionists. [...] At one of these rowdy bohemian meetings, a drunken Kanae fell through a window and landed in the garden below, wrapped in a [...] paper screen; he returned to the gathering as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> [...] The police kept watch over these meetings whose members they suspected of having socialist sympathies and held grudges over caricatures some of the members had published. [...] Pan no Kai waned and came to and end in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{proposed}} a structure within a structure, monumental [...] "pylons of Jerusalem stone {{on each side}} enclosing four huge central pillars of reinforced concrete, so that the pylons function as a container and the pillars as its content". Following the Beaux-Arts tradition, the elements of architecture were conceived as hollow, thus creating pocketing spaces within both structures. The outer structure was composed of 16 piers covered in golden Jerusalem stone cut in blocks of the same proportions and same course finish {{as those of the}} Western Wall. In the bases of the four corners of the two-story, [...] high structure delineated by the piers, there would be small alcoves for meditation or individual prayer. Such alcoves would be used for daily prayer services, allowing larger crowds on Sabbath or festivals. Boston-based architect Moshe Safdie, who had built extensively in Jerusalem and trained with Kahn in Philadelphia, was also in favour of rebuilding using contemporary design: [...] "It's absurd to reconstruct the Hurva as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> If we have the desire to rebuild it, let's have the courage to have a great architect do it." ...|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... For kids to see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened,</b> is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, but there will be a day of reckoning". Commenting on the WWF's decision {{to continue the}} show after her husband's death, Martha stated, [...] "After he lost his fight for life they just scooped him up and ordered the next match out. Where's the humanity? Would he have wanted the show to go on? Absolutely not." ...|$|E

500|$|Nosanchuk {{gave his}} final {{statement}} to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury {{that every one of}} the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing? ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creator Larry David and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. All prior Seinfeld episodes were co-written by Seinfeld and David. The Revenge is the first episode written by David alone, though Seinfeld did proofread the script and would {{continue to do so}} for all scripts up to the eighth season. George's storyline in the episode is based on David's own experiences while a writer at Saturday Night Live. David had quit SNL halfway through the 1984-1985 television season, but felt he had made a mistake once he reached his home. His neighbor Kenny Kramer, who later served as the main inspiration for Kramer, suggested David return to work the following Monday and act as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> Unlike George Costanza, the ploy succeeded for David, who remained with SNLs writing staff until the end of that season. George's reason for quitting was inspired by Seinfeld writer Larry Charles' use of the private restroom in Seinfeld and David's office instead of the public one. The Newman sub plot was inspired by one of David's neighbors, who once jumped from {{the second floor of the}} apartment building in which they both lived. The unseen character Mr. Papanickolas, who is mentioned by Kramer, was named after Pete Papanickolas, a member of the production crew.|$|E
500|$|Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{said that}} the scene where Santana comes out to her {{grandmother}} only to be rejected was a [...] "powerful moment and Rivera delivered in a way equal to Chris Colfer and Mike O'Malley's scenes during Kurt's coming out". Bell also complimented the sequence, though she criticized the next scene for showing [...] "a happy, smiling Santana" [...] with no further explanation, and Canning and Kubicek were also unhappy with her abrupt change in mood, as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> <b>happened.</b> VanDerWerff, though he called the coming-out scene [...] "a moment that's played {{with a sort of}} bracing honesty and moving empathy" [...] for what Santana was going through, stated that the [...] "Santana storyline {{has been one of the}} best things about the back half of season two and this front half of season three, and the scenes that should be its emotional crux are occurring in our imaginations", such as when she comes out to her parents. Goldberg called the fact that Finn suffered no consequences for his outing of Santana [...] "a missed opportunity". Bell, however, thought that his telling Santana that [...] "he cares about her and doesn't want her to hold her feelings for women in anymore" [...] was [...] "one of the most touching scenes of the series", though Kubicek characterized Finn's statement that he cared for her because Santana [...] "was his first" [...] as creepy. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan derided the choice to perform [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] as [...] "poor comprehension of song lyrics", since Santana [...] "is a lesbian and not just [...] drunk girl who kissed another girl after drinking". VanDerWerff wondered why Santana was so happy during the song, since she had just experienced [...] "the sort of outrageous bigotry she'll have to put up with for the rest of her life".|$|E
