5|$|Mary strived {{for peace}} in the Netherlands. Charles paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{problems}} she was facing as governor and often ignored her warnings. One such incident led to Charles's loss of the city of Metz to France. Mary was forced to wage war against France in 1537 and to deal with the Revolt of Ghent between 1538 and 1540. Mary's appointment as Governor of the Netherlands was renewed on 14 October 1540, after the revolt in Ghent had been subdued.|$|E

5|$|The French met the {{remnants}} of Conrad's army at Lopadion, and Conrad joined Louis' force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and they arrived at Ephesus in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, {{and there was no}} guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a small battle outside Ephesus, the French were victorious. The French fended off another Turkish ambush at the Meander River.|$|E

25|$|Owner {{and founder}} Frederic McLaughlin died in December 1944. His estate sold {{the team to}} a {{syndicate}} headed by longtime team president Bill Tobin. However, Tobin was only a puppet for James E. Norris, who owned the rival Red Wings. Norris had also been the Black Hawks' landlord since his 1936 purchase of Chicago Stadium. For the next eight years, the Norris-Tobin ownership, as a rule, paid almost <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Black Hawks. Nearly every trade made between Detroit and Chicago ended up being Red Wing heists. As a result, {{for the next several}} years, Chicago was the model of futility in the NHL. Between 1945 and 1958, they only made the playoffs twice.|$|E

25|$|In 1606, a {{conflict}} between Venice and the Holy See began with the arrest of two clerics accused of petty crimes, and with a law restricting the Church's right to enjoy and acquire landed property. Pope Paul V held that these provisions were contrary to canon law, and demanded that they be repealed. When this was refused, he placed Venice under an interdict. The Republic paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interdict or the act of excommunication, and ordered its priests {{to carry out their}} ministry. It was supported in its decisions by the Servite monk Paolo Sarpi, a sharp polemical writer who was nominated to be the Signoria's adviser on theology and canon law in 1606. The interdict was lifted after a year, when France intervened and proposed a formula of compromise. Venice was satisfied with reaffirming the principle that no citizen was superior to the normal processes of law.|$|E

500|$|The {{local news}} reports that Stephen Hawking has {{discovered}} a new black hole {{at the edge of}} the solar system, but the Griffin family pays <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> announcement. Peter alerts the family that he has been selected for jury duty, which he believes is an exclusive experience. After Brian informs him that everyone serves jury duty at some point, Peter tries to be kicked out of court by annoying the others, expressing fabricated prejudices, singing Surfin' Bird, and attempting to discuss the trial outside of the courtroom. When Peter returns home that night, the local news announces that the Earth will be destroyed by the newly discovered, and continually expanding, black hole within the next 24 hours. Frantic over the news, everyone in Quahog attempts to live out the best last day possible. Herbert finally attempts to have sex with Chris, Quagmire has sex with Bonnie, and Peter finally manages to steal a lion from the zoo and say the [...] "you-know-what word" [...] in a black neighborhood (he is well respected as a result). As the countdown reaches its final seconds, Peter confesses to Lois that while he loves her, he hates spending time with his kids. Immediately afterward, the news anchors reveal the black hole report was an April Fools' joke.|$|E
500|$|The {{gigantic}} {{proportions of}} A. fragillimus have been debated by paleontologists. Carpenter {{has argued that}} {{there is every reason}} to take Cope at his word, noting that the paleontologist's reputation was at stake. The discovery took place during the Bone Wars, and Cope's rival Marsh, who was [...] "ever ready to humiliate" [...] Cope, never called the claims into question. Marsh was known to have employed spies to monitor Cope's discoveries, and may have even had confirmation of the enormous size of the Amphicoelias fragillimus bones. Paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and C.C. Mook in 1921, as well as John S. McIntosh in 1998, also accepted Cope's data without question in published reviews. Other paleontologists have been more critical. In an analysis of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the publication and interpretation of A. fragillimus, Woodruff and Foster (2015) concluded that its size has been over-estimated and that modern palaeontologists were accepting Cope's interpretation without due scepticism. They note that no comparably gigantic sauropod fossils have been discovered in the Morrison Formation or elsewhere, that 19th century palaeontologists - including Cope himself - paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> size of A. fragillimus (even when it may have substantiated Cope's Rule of size increase in animal lineages over time), and that typographical errors in his measurements - such as reporting vertebral measurements in meters rather than millimeters - undermine their reliability. They concluded that the super-gigantic A. fragillimus is a 'highly unlikely' creature based on unquestioning interpretation of Cope's report.|$|E

Dean concludes that conservatism must regenerate itself to remain true to its core ideals of limited government and the rule of law.|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after taking}} over, United laid off all but nine of WMUR's {{employees}} and reduced local programming to its two daily newscasts.

[...] It paid almost <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station even as equipment broke down.

2500|$|Boyle's great merit as a {{scientific}} investigator is that he carried out the principles which Francis Bacon espoused in the Novum Organum. Yet he would not avow himself a follower of Bacon, or indeed of any other teacher. On several occasions he mentions that to keep his judgment as unprepossessed as might be {{with any of the}} modern theories of philosophy, until he was [...] "provided of experiments" [...] to help him judge of them, he refrained from any study of the Atomical and the Cartesian systems, and even of the Novum Organum itself, though he admits to [...] "transiently consulting" [...] them about a few particulars. Nothing was more alien to his mental temperament than the spinning of hypotheses. He regarded the acquisition of knowledge as an end in itself, and in consequence he gained a wider outlook on the aims of scientific inquiry than had been enjoyed by his predecessors for many centuries. This, however, did not mean that he paid <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practical application of science nor that he despised knowledge which tended to use.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was also}} a time of {{significant}} student disturbances, fomented by the law on Jewish emancipation. In December 1923, SlÄtineanu stood up to antisemitism and calls for racial segregation, demanding Gendarmerie cordons between Jewish students their Christian attackers, as well as punitive measures against professors who would not teach desegregated classes. A year later, following renewed pressures from his Romanian students, SlÄtineanu authorized a nationalist demonstration to take place on university grounds, but demanded guarantees {{that it would not}} lead to violence, and alerted the Gendarmes to stand by. The meeting degenerated into a riot, and this paralyzed academic life. SlÄtineanu's subsequent decision to resign was vetoed by other members of the university staff. On the occasion the nationalist philosopher Ion Petrovici alleged that SlÄtineanu was in part guilty for the riots, having [...] "isolated himself" [...] and [...] "paying <b>no</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> students' soul." [...] In March 1926, SlÄtineanu, faced with an antisemitic students' strike and cases of criminal assault on Jewish students, pleaded for the expulsion of confirmed instigators.|$|E
