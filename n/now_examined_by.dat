40|$|In the Burgdorf Museum of Ethnology, a mummy {{rests in}} a coffin. According to the {{inventory}} book, it was purchased from the Cairo Egyptian museum in 1926. The coffin was <b>now</b> <b>examined</b> <b>by</b> Egyptologists and the mummy was radiocarbon dated and examined by Anthropologists. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare the results and to check whether mummy and coffin actually belong together. The skull was examined morphological-anthropologically and by CT as a “blank sample”. Coffin and skull imply that the individual was female. The coffin dates to the Ptolemaic period. Only skull bones are preserved, the ethmoid is damaged. CT images Show resinous substances, bone fragments and brain remnants inside the skull. The ethmoid bone was probably foraminated during the mummification process and thus ended up inside the skull. The individual was mummified between the New Kingdom and the Ptolemaic period. Due to its style, it is most probable that the coffin comes from the Gamhud necropolis. The Burgdorf museum of ethnology inventory book chronicles were largely falsified by the examinations. There is a time gap between coffin and the mummy, there are two possible interpretations: the body was mummified with older linen, or the mummy and the coffin do not belong together.

40|$|The acyl {{carrier protein}} (ACP) of Escherichia coli is a 77 -amino acid, highly {{negatively}} charged three-helix protein that plays {{a central role in}} fatty acid biosynthesis. Previous NMR studies have suggested the presence of multiple conformations and marginally stable secondary structural elements. The stability of these elements is <b>now</b> <b>examined</b> <b>by</b> monitoring amide exchange in apo-ACP using NMR-based methods. Because ACP exhibits many rapid exchange rates, application of traditional isotope exchange methods is difficult. In one approach, heteronuclear correlation experiments with pulsed field-gradient coherence selection have reduced the time needed to collect two-dimensional 1 H- 15 N correlation spectra to the point where measurement of exchange of amide protons for deuterium on the timescale of minutes can be made. In another approach, water proton selective inversion-exchange experiments were performed to estimate the exchange rates of protons exchanging on timescales of less than a second. Backbone amide protons in the region of helix II were found to exchange significantly more rapidly than those in helices I and III, consistent with earlier structural models suggesting a dynamic disruption of the second helix. Highly protected amides occur on faces of the helices that may pack into a hydrophobic core present in a partially disrupted state...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of reconstructing the weather of Southeast Asia for the last decades using an atmospheric regional climate model, the Climate version of the Lokal-Modell (CLM). For this purpose global National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalyses data were dynamically downscaled to 50 km and in a double-nesting approach to 18 -km grid distance. To prevent the regional model from deviating significantly from the reanalyses with respect to large-scale circulation and large-scale weather phenomena, a spectral nudging technique was used. The performance of this technique in dealing with Southeast Asian typhoons is <b>now</b> <b>examined</b> <b>by</b> considering an ensemble of one simulated typhoon case. This analysis is new insofar as it deals with simulations done in the climate mode (so that any skill of reproducing the typhoon {{is not related to}} details of initial conditions), is done in ensemble mode (the same development is described by several simulations), and is done with a spectral nudging constraint (so that the observed large-scale state is enforced in the model domain). This case indicates that tropical storms that are coarsely described by the reanalyses are correctly identified and tracked; considerably deeper core pressure and higher wind speeds are simulated compared to the driving reanalyses. When the regional atmospheric model is run without spectral nudging, significant intraensemble variability occurs; also additional, nonobserved typhoons form. Thus, the insufficiency of lateral boundary conditions alone for determining the details of the dynamic developments in the interior becomes very clear. The same lateral boundary conditions are consistent with different developments in the interior. Several sensitivity experiments were performed concerning varied grid distances, different initial starting dates of the simulations, and changed spectral nudging parameters...|$|E

40|$|This report {{considers}} the numerical efficiency {{of part of}} a model for three-dimensional ocean circulation problems, which {{was developed by the}} oceanography group of Utrecht University. The main objective of oceanography research is to predict and explain climate change. The recent change in climate, global warming, is mainly accounted to the increased concentration of CO 2 gases in the atmosphere, which are caused by human emissions. In order to lay a direct link between global warming and the increased CO 2 concentration, natural causes must also be examined. The climate system consists of the atmosphere, the hydrosphere (oceans) and the cryosphere (permanent ice). So natural variations in the state of these three elements are examined. The state of the ocean can change significantly due to perturbations in the external forcings of the climate system. Examples of these forcings are the radiation received from the sun, wind stress and fresh water fluxes. The atmosphere responds relatively fast to perturbations. However the response times in the hydrosphere differ greatly. Oceans contain two basic circulation systems. The first is the wind-driven surface circulation. The second is the density-driven circulation, or thermohaline circulation, which is mainly controlled by differences in temperature and salt content. The wind-driven circulation responds faster to perturbations in the external forcings than the thermohaline circulation. Therefore response times in oceans can vary from several months to thousands of years, so the oceans {{play a major role in}} climate change occurring on longer time scales. The current research is focussed on the thermohaline circulation, the model that is used is described in [1]. The model describes the ocean circulations by a time-dependent coupled system of partial differential equations: three momentum equations, a continuity equation and equations for heat and salt transport. The state variables are the velocities in three dimensions (u, v, w), pressure p, temperature T and salinity S. To study the behaviour of the flow patterns, u(t) = (u, v, w,p, T, 5), steady states of the system are computed. Steady states are states where the system is at rest, they are defined by solutions = 0. This condition leads to solving a nonlinear system of equations. Once a steady state has been computed, its stability can be determined by solving an eigenvalue problem. The response of the ocean circulation to perturbations in the external forcings is <b>now</b> <b>examined</b> <b>by</b> a dynamical systems theory approach. This is done by varying the ocean model parameters, which leads to qualitative changes to the state of the system, and monitoring the steady states of the system. This dependence of the steady states on the model parameters is studied using a continuation code that is part of the ocean model. The continuation code eventually leads to solving large systems of linear equations. This is done using the MRILU solver, a linear systems solver for unstructured grids that was developed by the numerical mathematics group of Groningen University. This solver makes results for sufficiently high spatial resolution possible. The MRILU solver consists of an incomplete LU factorization as preconditioner, combined with an iterative solver. The continuation code is described in more detail in chapter 2, and the MRILU solver is described shortly in chapter 3. The objective of this report is to improve the continuation code. First the cost is reduced of the method for solving the nonlinear system of equations in the continuation code. This is done in two ways: (i) by tuning the accuracy with which the solution is computed, (ii) by implementing a simple, cheaper method for solving the nonlinear system. Finally part of the continuation code is implemented in parallel on the TERAS, the new Dutch national supercomputer. The aim is to obtain a speedup by parallelizing the most expensive components of the MRILU solver: matrix multiplications. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) and Pupil Attainment data have been collected annually from all maintained sector primary, secondary, and special schools in Wales since 2004. Statutory requirements govern the returns made by schools. Before 2004 data on pupil enrolments and attainment were collected at school level only. Prior to 2008, the census and attainment data were collectively {{referred to as the}} National Pupil Database (NPD) which was maintained by the Local Government Data Unit for Wales (not {{to be confused with the}} English NPD, which is run by the Department for Education). Following a review of the NPD, the management of schools data was transferred to the Welsh Government School Statistics team. Both the PLASC and Pupil Attainment datasets are now referred to separately, although they are still linked at the individual level using a Unique Pupil Number, as was the case with the NPD. Whilst the PLASC and Pupil Attainment datasets could be used independently, they are more valuable as a merged dataset in order to combine information on pupil characteristics with attainment results. The PLASC and Pupil Attainment dataset covers pupil and school level data for all maintained primary, secondary, nursery and special schools in Wales. England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate systems. From 2004, PLASC and Pupil Attainment data have been collected from schools at an individual pupil level and in a standardised computerised form. Previously data were collected at school level only. Each school maintains electronic records on their pupils throughout the year using a Management Information System. Returns are made via a secure online data transfer system managed by the Welsh Government. The PLASC data contain approximately 0. 475 million records for each academic year and include variables on pupil characteristics including date of birth, gender, home postcode, special education need status and free school meal status. PLASC data are collected annually from schools in January. The Pupil Attainment data are collected annually from schools in June for Foundation Phase (formerly known as Key Stage 1), Key Stages 2 to 3 and from awarding organisations for Key Stage 4 and above in August of each year. Data on the results of pupils’ Foundation Phase and Key Stage attainment tests are collected from schools during a separate exercise, usually carried out in June. Foundation Phase and Key Stage tests are taken at four different age points during compulsory education, typically at ages 7, 11, 14 and 16. In Wales, Foundation Phase, Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 are <b>now</b> <b>examined</b> <b>by</b> teacher assessment only. More specifically, Key Stage 4 relates to attainment in GCSE and equivalent qualifications. Foundation Phase covers pupils from the age of 5 - 7. Key Stage 2 covers pupils from 7 - 11 years of age. Key Stage 3 covers pupils from 11 - 14 years of age. Key Stage 4 covers pupils from 14 - 16 years of age. The Welsh Government website contains information on PLASC and Pupil Attainment data as well as other data collected from schools including absenteeism rates, teacher assessments of non-core subjects and information on teachers (note that these datasets may not be at an individual level). StatsWales is run by the Welsh Government and provides access to a range of government data including data on schools and teachers. Some of the data are available across a time series dating back to 1977 / 78, and there is a further section on historical data containing data collected prior to 1974. The data are presented as aggregated totals limiting its use as a resource for detailed analysis. It is important for researchers to take into consideration any changes to the data collection over time and how these changes affect the comparability of data from subsequent years. In line with the requirements of the data holders and attempts to improve the quality of the data, there have been various changes made to the variables collected in PLASC. Recently the coding of a pupil’s ethnicity has been extended to cover a series of sub-categories not previously available. Another recent change is the introduction of more detailed categories of English as an Additional Language to provide information about the level of English speaking acquired by the pupil. The guidance notes issued to schools to aid in their completion of PLASC provide a full overview of the variables currently collected and further details of recent amendments (see Documentation section). The computerised systems used by schools to record and make returns include robust validation checks. Further checks on the accuracy of data are made by the Schools Statistics team before the data are published or made available to researchers. Furthermore, the data are expected to be of a high quality. However, there may be instances where pupil data are missing, for example, if a child did not attend school on the day of a GCSE exam assessment or when a child has previously been educated outside of the state system or moved to Wales from abroad. Independent schools and Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) do not produce a PLASC return. Pupils who leave or join the education system in Wales between the PLASC census day and the time of the assessments (May to July) are not included in the dataset. Such pupils will either be missing pupil characteristics or an attainment level. In 2002, the Welsh Government decided to stop the tests at Foundation Phase. Instead, optional teacher assessment materials were provided to schools in 2003 for use in English, Mathematics, and Welsh. At the end of 2003, the Daugherty Report was commissioned by the Welsh Government to undertake a review of the country’s assessment procedures. Following the outcome of the Daugherty Assessment Review Group in 2004, Key Stage 2 tasks/tests were made optional in 2005 and Key Stage 3 tasks/tests were made optional in 2006. At Key Stage 3, the National Curriculum consists of the “core subjects” of English and Welsh, Mathematics and Science, and the “non-core subjects” of Welsh second language, modern foreign languages, design and technology, information technology, history, geography, art, music, physical education and religious education. At Key Stage 4, only five National Curriculum subjects are mandatory (English, Welsh or Welsh second language, Mathematics, Science, and Physical Education) and schools have greater flexibility to provide optional subjects that meet the needs and interests of their pupils. Care should be taken when comparing the performance of ethnic groups with relatively few pupils because results for such small groups will show more volatility year on year than for groups with larger numbers of pupils. In the PLASC data collection, pupils and their parents are encouraged to choose the most appropriate ethnic background. However in 2010, the ethnic background for between around 12 and 16 per cent of pupils in the relevant key stages each year was chosen by the school after parents/pupils did not choose a category (and did not explicitly state that they did not want one recorded by the school). The category chosen by the school will have been made available to parents/pupils for amendment but in cases where it was not amended the chosen category may not reflect the ethnic background to which the pupils feel they belong. Pupils from an ethnic minority background are not evenly dispersed around Wales. They are concentrated in four local authorities, and in particular schools within these local authorities. The educational policies in place in such areas may have an impact on the academic achievement of such pupils. Research Usage and Linkage Both the PLASC and Pupil Attainment datasets are a key source of education statistical analysis used by the Welsh Government and are published as Official Statistics. For example, yearly reports are published on National Curriculum assessments and GCSE attainment, class sizes, absenteeism rates and other topics. It is particularly useful for schools and local authorities for comparisons and benchmarking purposes. Other key users include the Ministers and the Members Research Service in the National Assembly for Wales, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education and Training in Wales, Wales Audit Office, the Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills in the Welsh Assembly Government, local authorities and the Department for Education in England. The Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) provides a good example of a research project which uses pupil level data. Using data from a linked dataset of PLASC and Pupil Attainment, the WIMD contains indicators of Key Stages 2, 3 and 4 average point scores and primary and secondary school absence rates. The home postcode information collected in PLASC enables the indicators to be constructed at a small area level (Lower layer Super Output Area). Each individual pupil record in PLASC can be linked to the corresponding Pupil Attainment data via the Unique Pupil Number (UPN). Data can also be linked longitudinally using the UPN to trace pupils over time. In theory it is also possible to compare PLASC and Pupil Attainment records with those from the English NPD. Attainment comparisons with the Scottish and Northern Ireland education systems should be treated with caution due to differing examination systems. </div...|$|E

This is accompanied by the apparent shortening of the microtubules running between the asters. This is the first example of isolated microtubules undergoing a process that has similarities to half-spindle shortening during anaphase A. Formation of aster-like structures without preformed microtubule organizing centers raises the possibility that a similar process may contribute to microtubule organization in vivo...|$|R

This possible role of RIC was <b>now</b> <b>examined</b> specifically <b>by</b> evaluating its ability to donate iron ions to apo-iron-sulfur proteins, determining the iron binding constants and assessing the lability of its iron ions. We show, by UV-visible, EPR and resonance Raman spectroscopies that RIC may participate in the synthesis of an iron-sulfur cluster in the apo-forms of the spinach ferredoxin and IscU when in the presence of the sulfide donating system IscS and L-cysteine. Iron binding assays allowed determining the as-isolated and fully reduced RIC dissociation constants for the ferric and ferrous iron of 10 - 27 M and 10 - 13 M, respectively. Mössbauer studies revealed that the RIC iron ions are labile, namely when the center is in the mixed-valence redox form as compared with the (μ-oxo) diferric one. Altogether, these results suggest that RIC is capable of delivering iron for the formation of iron-sulfur clusters...|$|R

The development of element tagging approaches for ICP-MS has slowed considerably, largely due to the dearth of available standards for biological assays, but some advances have been made in this area which point the way forward. The number of stable isotope systems which are <b>now</b> <b>examined</b> routinely <b>by</b> ICP-MC-MS has grown over the period of the review. Such methods may eventually lead to new insights into isotopic fractionation effects that result from environmental and biological processes which involve these elements. There have been several novel developments in instrumentation, such as ambient desorption ionisation, using a variety of modified sources and liquid electrode plasmas for AES. These hold some promise as low-cost sources that may be incorporated into miniaturised systems of the future...|$|R
40|$|The interjection {{of a new}} and {{dynamically}} different {{reading of}} Lawrence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy is imperative, if scholars want to clearly see many of the hidden facets of the novel that have gone unexamined because of out-dated scholarship. Ian Watt’s assumption that Sterne “would probably have been the supreme figure among eighteenth-century novelists” (291) if he had not tried to be so odd, and the conclusion that he draws, that “Tristram Shandy {{is not so much a}} novel as a parody of a novel” (291), is incorrect. Throughout the thesis, I argue that Sterne was not burlesquing other novelists, but instead, was engaging with themes that are <b>now</b> being <b>examined</b> <b>by</b> postmodern theories of Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Jean François Lyotard: themes like the impenetrability of identity (“Don’t puzzle me” (TS 7. 33. 633)), the insufficiency of language (“Well might Locke write a chapter upon the imperfections of words” (5. 6. 429)), and the unavailability of permanence (“Time wastes too fast” (9. 8. 754)). I actively engage with their theories to deconstruct unexamined themes inside Tristram Shandy, and illuminate postmodern elements inside the novel. However, I do not argue that Tristram Shandy is postmodern. Instead, I argue that if the reader examines the novel outside of its usual context inside the eighteenth-century novel, there are themes that are apparent in the narrative which have gone unexamined because of the way it has been classified inside academia, and that postmodernist theory allows for these themes to be re-examined in the postmodern culture in which we now reside...|$|R
