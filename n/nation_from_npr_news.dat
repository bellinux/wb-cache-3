5000|$|One hour's topics did {{not carry}} {{into the next}} hour. This is because many {{stations}} carried only one hour of the program. In addition, the host delivered a concluding [...] "This is Talk of the <b>Nation</b> <b>from</b> <b>NPR</b> News" [...] as a cue to stations that wish to cut away to local programming before the scheduled break.|$|R
5000|$|When WFGR debuted its oldies format, it was satellite-fed using ABC Radio's [...] "Oldies Radio" [...] feed, {{but soon}} debuted a mostly-local lineup of DJs, playing {{music from the}} 1960s and early 1970s. On June 29, 2009, the station {{changed its name to}} Classic Hits [...] "98.7 WFGR" [...] and began to focus more on the 1970s and 1980s. The change left the Grand Rapids market without a local outlet for oldies in the {{traditional}} sense of the format, until Grand Valley State University stepped in to fill the void by flipping its WGVU-AM <b>from</b> <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk to [...] "Real Oldies" [...] a few months later.|$|R
5000|$|Interlochen Center for the Arts {{acquired}} {{and launched}} sister station WICA in 2000 to feature a news- and talk-oriented format, {{and since that}} time WIAA and its two satellites (WICV and WIAB) have devoted almost all of their broadcast schedule to classical music and have not aired <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> shows such as [...] "Morning Edition" [...] and [...] "All Things Considered", although they do feature hourly <b>news</b> updates <b>from</b> <b>NPR.</b> <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> shows are, however, available over a portion of IPR Music Radio's listening area on CMU Public Radio, and within the coverage areas of the IPR News Radio stations (see below).|$|R
50|$|Available in Southeast Idaho {{and other}} {{outlying}} areas (mainly Rexburg, Idaho Falls, and Pocatello) this local station provides classical music, {{morning and afternoon}} national <b>news</b> reports <b>from</b> <b>NPR,</b> and local <b>news</b> stories.|$|R
50|$|MPBN's {{television}} network {{shows a block}} of standard PBS programming, {{as well as many}} documentaries including nature programs and other science programs. MPBN's radio network airs news and talk programming <b>from</b> <b>NPR,</b> locally produced <b>news</b> programming, jazz and classical music.|$|R
50|$|Despite these threats, though, {{the network}} has {{announced}} plans to increase news and talk programming later in 2014 to cater to WRAS listeners, who would presumably be turning away from WABE, which, despite criticisms <b>from</b> devotees of <b>NPR</b> <b>news,</b> talk, and feature programs, resisted pressure to reduce daytime classical music for years. Indeed, many NPR staples weren't heard at all in Atlanta until WABE launched an all-news station on one of its HD Radio channels. WABE has since dropped the daytime music in favor of news and feature programming, a clear response to the WRAS move.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2000, IPR has {{operated}} a two-service network. [...] "Classical IPR" [...] (formerly known as [...] "IPR Music Radio") provides classical music and hourly <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> updates for three stations. News and talk programming <b>from</b> <b>NPR</b> {{and other sources}} is heard on three stations, branded as [...] "IPR News Radio".|$|R

50|$|After the sale, WKNO/WKNP reconfigured its {{schedule}} into {{a combination}} more typical among NPR stations across the country. The new lineup features NPR newscasts throughout the day; <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> magazines, such as All Things Considered and Morning Edition in {{morning and afternoon}} drive-time slots; Marketplace from American Public Media in the late afternoons; Fresh Air in the early evening; feature (local) programming during the daytime on weekends, {{as well as the}} Metropolitan Opera broadcasts, and comedy shows <b>from</b> <b>NPR,</b> APM, and PRI; and classical music at other times.|$|R

50|$|For {{the most}} part, NWPR behaves like two large networks. Seven stations, based on KWSU, {{broadcast}} <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk. Eleven other stations, based on KRFA, broadcast {{a mix of}} NPR programming and classical music. One station, KJEM 89.9, broadcasts 24-hour jazz music without any <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> or talk programming.|$|R
50|$|KNPR {{signed on}} {{for the first time}} on March 24, 1980. It was the first NPR member in Nevada, {{originally}} airing <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and classical music at 89.5 FM. In 2003, KNPR moved to 88.9 and switched to <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk. Classical music moved to a new station, KCNV at 89.7.|$|R
5000|$|KUAF began {{broadcasting}} in 1973 {{using a small}} transmitter {{which sent}} a signal that reached most of the U of A campus and parts of surrounding Fayetteville. Many listeners referred to the station as [...] "the 10-watt wonder". It joined NPR in 1985, bringing NPR to western Arkansas for the first time. Prior to joining NPR, KUAF was a student-run and -programmed radio station. Students studying Radio, Television, and Film were {{given the opportunity to}} volunteer for various time slots available throughout the week. Aside from a few mandatory promos and songs, students were free to play whatever music was of interest to them. During this period, the station was broadcast on frequency 89.3. In 2006, KUAF became the first station in its market to sign-on with an HD Radio signal. While KUAF HD1 repeats the station's regular FM signal, KUAF HD2 broadcasts around-the-clock classical music from Classical 24, and KUAF HD3 broadcasts news and information programming <b>from</b> <b>NPR,</b> overnight world <b>news</b> <b>from</b> the BBC World Service, and programming from independent producers.|$|R

50|$|In September 2004, KOSU {{moved to}} a new 1,100-foot tower near Guthrie that gave it primary {{coverage}} of Oklahoma City. Previously, <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk had gotten spotty reception in much of the area since KCSC went all-classical in 1996. The University of Oklahoma's NPR outlet, KGOU, needed a second full-power station, KROU, to cover a large portion of Oklahoma City, and even then this left much of central Oklahoma without a clear signal for <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> programming until KOSU activated its new tower.|$|R
5000|$|Programming {{is mostly}} <b>NPR</b> <b>news</b> and talk, with some KUNI {{produced}} music {{programs in the}} evenings and on weekends.
