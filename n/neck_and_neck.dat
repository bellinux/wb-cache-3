5|$|The hot {{and humid}} {{conditions}} in Nanning slowed the runners' pace and twelve of them remained within the main pack by the 10km point. The following five kilometres was decisive for the race, as Samuel Tsegay, Titus Masai and Mosop were all left trailing. The leading four runners were soon reduced to three, as Kipruto fell away to leave Zersenay Tadese, Wilson Kiprop and Sammy Kitwara to battle for the medal positions. Zersenay and Kiprop were <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> in the lead from the last kilometre and it was Kiprop who pulled away in the final 100metres to break the Eritrean's four-year undefeated streak. Zersenay faded badly {{at the end and}} appeared injured after taking second place. Kitwara and Kipruto were third and fourth, sealing the Kenyan team victory, while Samuel Tsegay's fifth place helped Eritrea to the team silver.|$|E

40|$|The <b>neck</b> {{formation}} <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> propagation {{behavior of}} plastic moldings are very complicated {{and one of}} the most important subjects in the field of polymer processing. In this paper, we report our results on the <b>necking</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> propagation behavior for Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) in uniaxial tension tests. In addition, a numerical model for PBT molding has been developed, <b>and</b> the <b>neck</b> propagation behavior under tensile load has been analyzed by the finite element method (FEM). By comparing numerical results with experimental ones, it could be confirmed that <b>necking</b> initiates <b>and</b> propagates after the specimen undergoes uniform plastic deformation. The effect of strain rate on load-displacement behavior has also been studied in uniaxial tensile tests. Furthermore, a constitutive relationship at low strain rates, which can be used to estimate the actual load-displacement behavior, could be obtained by FEM...|$|R
40|$|Unlike metals, {{necking in}} {{polymers}} under tension {{does not lead}} to further localization of deformation, but to propagation of the neck along the specimen. Finite element analysis is used to numerically study <b>necking</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> propagation in amorphous glassy polymers under plane strain tension during large strain plastic flow. The constitutive model used in the analyses features strain-rate, pressure, and temperature dependent yield, softening immediately after yield and subsequent orientational hardening with further plastic deformation. The latter is associated with distortion of the underlying molecular network structure of the material, and is modelled here by adopting a recently proposed network theory developed for rubber elasticity. Previous studies of necking instabilities have almost invariably employed idealized prismatic specimens; here, we explicitly account for the unavoidable grip sections of test specimens. The effects of initial imperfections, strain softening, orientation hardening, strain-rate as well as of specimen geometry and boundary conditions are discussed. The physical mechanisms for <b>necking</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> propagation, in terms of our constitutive model, are discussed {{on the basis of a}} detailed parameter study. ...|$|R

25|$|Despite most {{opinion polls}} {{predicting}} that the Conservatives and Labour were <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck,</b> the Conservatives secured a surprise victory after having won a clear lead over their rivals and incumbent Prime Minister David Cameron {{was able to}} form a majority single-party government with a working majority of 12 (in practice increased to 15 due to Sinn Féin's 4 MPs' abstention). Thus the result bore resemblance to 1992. The Conservatives gained 38 seats while losing 10, all to Labour, with Employment Minister Esther McVey the most senior Conservative to lose her seat. Cameron became the first Prime Minister since Lord Salisbury in 1900 to increase his popular vote share after a full term, and is sometimes credited as being the only Prime Minister other than Margaret Thatcher (in 1983) to be re-elected with {{a greater number of}} seats for his party after a 'full term'.|$|E
25|$|In August 1987, the Israeli {{government}} cancelled the IAI Lavi project, {{an attempt}} to develop an independent Israeli fighter aircraft. The Israelis found themselves unable to sustain the huge development costs, and faced U.S. opposition to a project that threatened U.S. influence in Israel and U.S. global military ascendancy. In September 1988, Israel launched an Ofeq reconnaissance satellite into orbit, using a Shavit rocket, thus becoming one of only eight countries possessing a capacity to independently launch satellites into space (two more have since developed this ability). The Alignment and Likud remained <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> in the 1988 elections (39:40 seats). Shamir successfully formed a national unity coalition with the Labour Alignment.

25|$|In the women's competition, Laura Bennett and Andrea Hewitt joined Paula Findlay at {{the front}} {{coming out of the}} swim. However, once on the bike the three women were caught and a peloton of 16 formed. At the end of the bike, the lead peloton had a 30-second lead over the chasers. On the run Findlay raced away with Hewitt as the pair was pursued by Helen Jenkins and Díaz, {{creating}} a group of four. But after four kilometres, Díaz dropped off the pace on the final lap and Hewitt found the pace to be too tough and dropped back only to be passed for third by Emmie Charayron. Findlay and Jenkins were <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> until the final 400 metres when Findlay kicked away for her second consecutive 2011 World Series win.

25|$|On December 16, 1996, federal {{election}} overseers announced that Carey had defeated Hoffa, 52 percent to 48 percent. More than 475,000 ballots were {{cast in the}} election. The vote count proceeded very slowly, leading to protests from both candidates the vote-counting rules had been violated. Carey declared victory on December 15, 1996. Hoffa, however, refused to concede, claiming 31,000 challenged ballots remained to be counted. Federal officials overseeing the election confirmed the victory the next day, and certified the election on January 10, 1997. Later analyses showed that Carey drew most of his support from Teamsters locals in the East and Deep South and Canada, Hoffa led in the Midwest, and the two candidates were <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> in the West. Despite the victory, many observers noted that Hoffa ran a much stronger campaign than expected. Many union members were attracted by the Hoffa name, while others (particularly in the Midwest) felt Carey had negotiated weak contracts. But federal officials and labor movement insiders pointed out that Carey had undermined the power, income, prestige, and perks of hundreds of local union officials through his anti-corruption drive. Hoffa {{had the support of}} a large majority of these local leaders, and they ensured that the Hoffa message reached the rank and file and the Carey message did not.|$|E

30|$|Constructive thought pattern {{strategies}} {{involve the}} development of new thoughts or thought-patterns and make a habit out of them which would influence individual’s performance positively (Anderson and Prussia 1997; Houghton <b>and</b> <b>Neck</b> 2002; <b>Neck</b> <b>and</b> Houghton 2006). Constructive thought pattern strategies include visualizing successful performance, self-talk and evaluating beliefs and assumptions. Visualizing successful performance is the cognitive imagination {{in the mind of the}} individual before facing the situation. Visualizing successful performance increases the possibility of fulfilling the task effectively due to the mental rehearsal prior to the task (Houghton <b>and</b> <b>Neck</b> 2002). Self-talk is defined as the quiet talk of the individual with him/herself or as the internal talk, and it involves mental self-evaluations <b>and</b> reactions (Houghton <b>and</b> <b>Neck</b> 2002; <b>Neck</b> <b>and</b> Houghton 2006). Evaluating beliefs and assumptions include the evaluation of habits, thinking methods or models that are developed by individuals. According to Ho and Nesbit (2009), evaluating beliefs and assumptions concerns ‘examining one’s thoughts, especially self-defeating thoughts that detract from successful task performance’ (p. 454). Evaluating beliefs and assumptions aims to help one to eliminate undesirable and dysfunctional habits (Houghton <b>and</b> <b>Neck</b> 2002; Ho <b>and</b> Nesbit 2009). Consequently, it is made possible by constructive thought pattern strategies that individuals use their experiences and/or thoughts positively and develop the desired behaviors (Houghton <b>and</b> <b>Neck</b> 2002; D’Intino et al. 2007).
