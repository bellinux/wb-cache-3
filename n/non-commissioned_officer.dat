5|$|Virtually all the Turkish Army {{commander}}s, down {{to company}} commander level, were very experienced, being {{veterans of the}} Balkan Wars. But their command structure was weaker at the <b>non-commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> (NCO) level, with only one NCO in each company. One advantage that the Turkish Army had over the New Zealanders, at the time, was their hand grenades, which were not used by the British forces.|$|E

5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They were typically a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his <b>Non-commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants.

5|$|After the war, courts-martial were convened to {{investigate}} possible war crimes {{by members of}} the division. In the first case, dubbed the Biscari massacre, American troops from C Company, 180th Infantry Regiment, were alleged to have shot 74 Italian and two German prisoners in Acate in July 1943 following the capture of an airfield in the area. Lieutenant General George Patton, the Seventh Army commander, asked Major General Omar Bradley, commanding II Corps, to get the case dismissed to prevent bad press, but Bradley refused. A <b>non-commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> later confessed to the crimes and was found guilty, but an officer who claimed he had only been following orders was acquitted.|$|E

5|$|At 21:50 the British {{artillery}} opened fire, and the Germans {{responded with}} their own artillery and mortars which forced most of the British to take cover, for the next fifteen minutes, until a lull in the German fire allowed them to continue. In the lead 'C' Company had crossed the start line at 22:00, however all its officers and the company sergeant major (CSM) became casualties and a senior <b>non-commissioned</b> <b>officer</b> took command of the company. They continued to advance through the artillery and mortar bombardment, guided towards their objective by tracer rounds from the Hussars tanks.

Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in the Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E
