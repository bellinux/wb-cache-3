500|$|In 1960, Hilliard became {{director}} of the Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) Western Research Center where he widened his scope of research to include the study of sonic booms, missile launch noise, atmospheric noise refraction, highway noise mitigation, hearing conservation and gun silencing. He helped develop an air-driven <b>noise</b> <b>generator</b> that produced 10,000 acoustic watts and was driven by a [...] diesel engine. He helped NASA with voice communication equipment including long lines between Cape Canaveral and Houston as well as assisting the Air Force with their worldwide telephone system. He worked on military listening systems. In 1968, Hilliard retired from regular employment at LTV, continuing to work with LTV as a consultant {{but in the same}} manner as if he hadn't retired. In the early 1970s, Hilliard directed the hearing conservation program at Bio-Medical Engineering Corporation. He founded J.K.Hilliard and Associates in the mid-1970s, performing architectural acoustic analysis and creating the standards for California's multi-family housing construction acoustic design policies, significantly influencing interior and exterior noise-control standards for homeowners across the United States.|$|E

50|$|For {{higher power}} output <b>noise</b> <b>generators,</b> {{amplification}} is needed. For broadband <b>noise</b> <b>generators,</b> that amplification {{can be difficult}} to achieve. One method uses avalanche multiplication within the same barrier that generates the noise. In an avalanche, one carrier collides with other atoms and knocks free new carriers. The result is that for each carrier that starts across a barrier, several carriers synchronously arrive. The result is a wide-bandwidth high-power source. Conventional diodes can be used in breakdown.|$|R

Sumption claims he received his design instructions from the spirit world. The device is described as a combination white <b>noise</b> <b>generator</b> and AM radio receiver modified to sweep back and forth through the AM band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of pareidolia.|$|E
2500|$|Digital {{loudspeaker}} {{management systems}} (DLMS) that combine digital crossover functions, compression, limiting, {{and other features}} in a single unit have become popular since their introduction. They are used to process the mix from the mixing console and route it to the various amplifiers. [...] Systems may include several loudspeakers, {{each with its own}} output optimized for a specific range of frequencies (i.e. bass, midrange, and treble). [...] Bi-amplifiication, tri-amplification, or quad-amplification of a sound reinforcement system {{with the aid of a}} DLMS results in a more efficient use of amplifier power by sending each amplifier only the frequencies appropriate for its respective loudspeaker. [...] Most DLMS units that are designed for use by non-professionals have calibration and testing functions such as a pink <b>noise</b> <b>generator</b> coupled with a real-time analyzer to allow automated room equalization.|$|E
