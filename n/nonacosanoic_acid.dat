40|$|From {{the stem}} barks of Jacaranda mimosifolia benzoic acid (1), 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid, 5 -carboxy- 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 a, 7, 8, 8 a-octahydro- 1, 2, 4 a-trimethyl-[1 S-(1 α, 2 β, 4 aβ, 8 aα) ] (2), betulinic acid (3), lupeol (4) and ursolic acid (5) were {{isolated}}. Similarly, lapachol (6), dehydro-α-lapachone (7), 2 - acetylfuro- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (8), p-coumaric acid (9), caffeic acid (10), <b>nonacosanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethyl ester (11), β-sitosterol (12), kigelinol (13), oleanolic acid (14), β-friedelinol (15), pomolic acid (16), and kojic acid (17) were {{isolated from the}} stem barks of Kigelia africana. All the isolated compounds were characterized by using spectroscopic methods especially 1 D and 2 D NMR and ESI mass spectrometry and comparison with literature data. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, compounds 1, 2, 3 and 5, and compounds 11, 14, 15 and 16 were isolated for the first time from Jacaranda mimosifolia and Kigelia africana, respectively. All these compounds were screened for anticandidal activity by agar diffusion method and microbroth dilution technique on four Candida albicans strains (ATCCL 26, ATCC 12 C, ATCCP 37039, and ATCCP 37037). Among them, compounds 9, 10, and 17 exhibited the highest anticandidal activity that varied between the microbial species (MIC= 0. 01 ± 0. 00 − 0. 03 ± 0. 00 mg/mL) on C. albicans ATCCL 26, ATCCP 37037, ATCCP 37039 and ATCC 12 C strains. Compound 17 was likely the most active against the four Candida albicans strains (MIC= 0. 01 ± 0. 00 − 0. 02 ± 0. 00 mg/mL). ...|$|E
