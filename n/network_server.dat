25|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that as a {{consequence}} of the above Orange Book definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the <b>network</b> <b>server</b> example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system's TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, it definitely is part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user's browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, but it certainly constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.|$|E

40|$|Efficiency and {{portability}} are conflicting {{objectives for}} clusterbased <b>network</b> <b>servers</b> that distribute the clients' requests across the cluster {{based on the}} actual content requested. Our work {{is based on the}} observation that this efficiency vs. portability tradeoff has not been fully evaluated in the literature. To fill this gap, in this paper we use modeling and experimentation to study this tradeoff {{in the context of an}} interesting class of content-based <b>network</b> <b>servers,</b> the locality conscious servers, under different inter-node communication subsystems. Based on our results, our main conclusion is that portability should be promoted in cluster-based <b>network</b> <b>servers</b> with low processor overhead, given its relatively low cost (# 16 %) in terms of throughput performance. For clusters with high processor overhead communication, efficiency should be the overriding concern, as the cost of portability can be very high (as high as 107 % on 96 nodes). We also conclude that user-level communication can be useful even for non-scientific applications such as <b>network</b> <b>servers...</b>|$|R

[...] The DOTS, upgraded and frequently referred to as [...] "DOTS +", permits airlines to save fuel by flying random routes, in contrast to structured routes, and permits the air traffic controller to achieve lateral spacing requirements more efficiently. [...] The DOTS generates flexible oceanic tracks that are optimized for best airspace utilization and best time/fuel efficiency. [...] Flexible tracks are updated twice a day using forecasted winds aloft and separation (vertical and lateral) requirements. [...] The DOTS oceanic traffic display gives a visual presentation of tracks and weather. [...] The DOTS sends traffic advisories and track advisories to users and receives aircraft progress reports from the commercial communications service providers (CCSP). [...] These external data exchanges are achieved through interfaces with the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN) Packet Switch Network (PSN) for Position Reports, Air Traffic Management (ATM) messages, Pilot Reports (PIREPS), and the Anchorage FDP2000. [...] An interface to the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) will improve coordination between the oceanic and domestic Traffic Flow Management (TFM) systems/activities. [...] The DOTS Weather Server, installed at the ATCSCC, receives National Weather Service (NWS) wind and temperature data via the Weather and Radar Processor / Weather Information <b>Network</b> <b>Server</b> (WARP/WINS) system.
