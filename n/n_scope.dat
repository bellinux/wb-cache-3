The One-Word Sentence Completion (OWSC) instrument was designed to elicit data suitable for machine processing, while retaining most {{of the advantages of}} a free-response format. Two operative scoring systems are described. The first employs a ndictionary " of 4366 weignted response words to yield 25 scores from a 90 -item OWSC form. The second system utilizes a complex word-root data reduction procedure and a bank of 892 generic roots to produce scores for 40 variables. Initial reliability data and normative sex differences are reported, and future development of the technique is discussed.

Learning to read requires {{knowledge of}} word meanings for those words most commonly encountered in basic reading materials. Many young students lack the basic vocabulary knowledge needed to facilitate learning to read. Two randomized studies {{were conducted to}} test the effects of an online, computer-adaptive vocabulary instruction program designed to provide remedial instruction on word meanings for high frequency words. Study 1 was small in <b>scope</b> (<b>N</b> = 43) and tested whether the program could improve word knowledge on a corpus of 100 target words taught to {{all students in the}} treatment group. Study 2 was larger in <b>scope</b> (<b>N</b> = 192) and tested whether more extensive use of the computer-adaptive program, which teaches students individualized sets of words from a 4000 word corpus, could improve vocabulary test scores. Scaling up from 100 words in Study 1 to 4000 words in Study 2 necessarily corresponded to a proportionally equivalent decrease in posttest sensitivity to changes in students' vocabulary knowledge. It is argued that such a decrease in standardized test sensitivity requires post-intervention analyses to be conducted at the item-level rather than the posttest total score level. These studies suggest that computer-delivered vocabulary instruction may be an efficient mechanism for remediation of vocabulary deficits. Assessment of post-intervention results at the item-level may be appropriate in other attempts to scale up curricula from pilot studies to classroom use...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the adaptations made by plants in their nitrogen (N) uptake systems in response to reduced N supply {{is important to the}} development of cereals with enhanced N uptake efficiency (NUpE). Twenty seven diverse genotypes of maize (Zea mays, L.) were grown in hydroponics for 3 weeks with limiting or adequate N supply. Genotypic response to N was assessed on the basis of biomass characteristics and the activities of the nitrate ([Formula: see text]) and ammonium ([Formula: see text]) high-affinity transport systems. Genotypes differed greatly for the ability to maintain biomass with reduced N. Although, the N response in underlying biomass and N transport related characteristics was less than that for biomass, there were clear relationships, most importantly, lines that maintained biomass at reduced N maintained net N uptake with no change in size of the root relative to the shoot. The root uptake capacity for both [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] increased with reduced N. Transcript levels of putative [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] transporter genes in the root tissue of a subset of the genotypes revealed that predominately ZmNRT 2 transcript levels responded to N treatments. The correlation between the ratio of transcripts of ZmNRT 2. 2 between the two N levels and a genotype's ability to maintain biomass with reduced N suggests a role for these transporters in enhancing NUpE. The observed variation in the ability to capture N at low <b>N</b> provides <b>scope</b> for both improving NUpE in maize and also to better understand the N uptake system in cereals.

40|$|The pulsed high-flux {{neutron source}} ESS, in synergy with {{advanced}} neutron optics and spectrometers, will require imaging detectors with better resolution and faster response than presently available. Thus in this work, {{which is part}} of a project of the Hahn-Meitner-Institut (HMI), a novel neutron detector has been developed. In the central detector plane a composite foil converter (" 1 " 5 " 7 Gd/CsI) is located, emitting, after neutron capture and subsequent emission of conversion electrons, a detectable cluster of low-energy electrons. In two adjacent low-pressure gas gaps, sandwiched between fourfold segmented micro-strip gas chamber (MSGC) plates on each side, the clusters are pre-amplified in parallel-plate mode and further in the strong alternating fields between the micro-strips. The advanced micro-strip design is made in multilayer technology on a robust glass substrate. Two closely spaced electrode planes are used for two-dimensional position readout. The expected position resolution is 0. 1 - 0. 3 mm and the time-of-flight resolution for thermal neutrons is less than 4 <b>ns.</b> Within the <b>scope</b> of this work all electrodes have been optimised for low-pressure, two-stage amplification by a comprehensive modelling.

40|$|Simplified {{equations}} {{are presented}} for the elastic properties of randomly oriented short fiber-glass composites. The suggested equations for the Young’s modulus, the shear modulus and the Poisson ratio {{are given in}} terms of the fiber-glass content and the Young’s moduli of the constit-uents. The equations are applicable for fiber-glass volume fractions in the range 0. 1 to 0. 4. The theoretical results are compared with experimental values, and the achieved good correlation, shows the utility of the pro-posed approximations. <b>SCOPE</b> <b>N</b> RECENT YEARS, much work has been done on both elastic and strength be-Ihavior of polymeric materials reinforced with randomly oriented discontinuous fibers. In most cases, the prediction of these properties were based on the classical laminate analogy: the material is constructed from a large number (> 3) or an infinite number of orthotropic plies oriented in all directions. This model, coupled with the usual micromechanic formulation, gives complex equations for ~’, G and v which are difficult to use in practice. In this study, the classical laminate analogy [1, 2] is used in conjunction with invariants defined by Tsai and Pagano [3], and with Puck’s micromechanic formu-lation [4]. Numerical approximations become possible, by linking the range of fiber-glass volume content to 0. 1 - 0. 4. This range includes practically almost all of the short fiber-glass composites made by the usual fabrication methods. The approximate equations are compared with both exact theory and experi-mental results from tensile, flexure and torsion tests...|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled, 2. 54 -cm {{diameter}} tubular {{specimens of}} graphite/epoxy (Fiberite T 300 / 1034) were fatigue cycled in combinations of axial, torsion-al, and internal pressure loading. Two different four-ply layup configura-tions were tested: [0 / 90]sand [&plusmn; 45]s; each tube contained a 0. 48 -cm diameter circular hole penetrating one wall midway along the tube length. S-N curves {{were developed to}} characterize fatigue behavior under pure axial, torsional, or internal pressure loading, as well as combined loading fatigue. A theory was developed based a plane stress model which enabled the S-N curve for combined stress states to be predicted from the S-N data for the uniaxial loading modes. Correlation of the theory with the experi-mental data proved to be remarkably good. <b>SCOPE</b> <b>N</b> MANY CASES composite materials offer a substantial improvement over metalsin application to structures under cyclic loading. However, the response of com-posites to fatigue {{is different from that}} of metals. Metals usually exhibit one failure mode (cracking), while composites may exhibit a combination of complex failure modes. Some of these failure modes are fiber breakage, delamination, matrix crack-ing, and fiber-matrix debonding. This combination of failure modes has contributed to the complexity of predicting the fatigue characteristics of fiber-reinforced com-posites and has inspired a large number of fatigue investigations on composites. Recent review papers by Boller [1] and Salkind [2] list many of these investiga-tions. No attempt will be made in this paper to survey the large number of publica-tions in composite fatigue. However, several general conclusions can be made re-garding composite fatigue results...|$|R

We conducted a scoping review to characterize these methodological approaches and identify research gaps.

We included 35 publications describing population-based (N =  27), medical facility-based (N =  4), and regional or global pandemic spread (N =  4) forecasts. They included areas of North America (N =  15), Europe (N =  14), and/or Asia-Pacific region (N =  4), or had global <b>scope</b> (<b>N</b> =  3). Forecasting models were statistical (N =  18) or epidemiological (N =  17). Five studies used data assimilation methods to update forecasts with new surveillance data. Models used virological (N =  14), syndromic (N =  13), meteorological (N =  6), internet search query (N =  4), and/or other surveillance data as inputs.

40|$|Abstract Background General Practitioners and {{community}} nurses rely on easily accessible, evidence-based online information to guide practice. To date, the methods that underpin the scoping of user-identified online information needs in palliative care have remained under-explored. This paper describes {{the benefits and}} challenges of a collaborative approach involving users and experts that informed {{the first stage of}} the development of a palliative care website 1. Method The action research-inspired methodology included a panel assessment of an existing palliative care website based in Victoria, Australia; a pre-development survey (<b>n</b> = 197) <b>scoping</b> potential audiences and palliative care information needs; working parties conducting a needs analysis about necessary information content for a redeveloped website targeting health professionals and caregivers/patients; an iterative evaluation process involving users and experts; as well as a final evaluation survey (n = 166). Results Involving users in the identification of content and links for a palliative care website is time-consuming and requires initial resources, strong networking skills and commitment. However, user participation provided crucial information that led to the widened the scope of the website audience and guided the development and testing of the website. The needs analysis underpinning the project suggests that palliative care peak bodies need to address three distinct audiences (clinicians, allied health professionals as well as patients and their caregivers). Conclusion Web developers should pay close attention to the content, language, and accessibility needs of these groups. Given the substantial cost associated with the maintenance of authoritative health information sites, the paper proposes a more collaborative development in which users can be engaged in the definition of content to ensure relevance and responsiveness, and to eliminate unnecessary detail. Access to volunteer networks forms an integral part of such an approach. </p...|$|R
