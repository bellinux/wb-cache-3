5|$|In May 2009, Java SE was ported and {{optimized}} for Snapdragon. At the November 2009 Computex Taipei show, Qualcomm announced the QSD8650A {{addition to the}} Snapdragon product suite, {{which was based on}} 45 <b>nanometer</b> manufacturing processes. It featured a 1.2GHz processor and had lower power consumption than prior models.|$|E
5|$|A {{compound}} that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts {{within the same}} molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule. Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a <b>nanometer</b> scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{can also}} form under other {{naturally}} occurring high-pressure conditions. Very small diamonds of micrometer and <b>nanometer</b> sizes, known as microdiamonds or nanodiamonds respectively, {{have been found}} in meteorite impact craters. Such impact events create shock zones of high pressure and temperature suitable for diamond formation. Impact-type microdiamonds can be used as an indicator of ancient impact craters. Popigai crater in Russia may have the world's largest diamond deposit, estimated at trillions of carats, and formed by an asteroid impact.|$|E
40|$|The dark {{synthesis}} of biliproteins in the blue-green alga Tolypothrix tenuis {{is controlled by}} brief light treatments. Green light potentiates {{synthesis of}} phycoerythrin and red light potentiates synthesis of phycocyanin. Red reverses the effect of green and vice versa. Action spectra for the red and green effects were obtained for the wavelength region 320 <b>nanometers</b> to 710 <b>nanometers,</b> at 10 -nanometer intervals. The principal action band in the red peaks at 660 <b>nanometers,</b> with a half-band width of 58 <b>nanometers</b> and an accompanying shortwave band at 360 <b>nanometers.</b> The green action band peaks at 550 <b>nanometers,</b> with a half-band width of 76 <b>nanometers,</b> and a shortwave band at 350 <b>nanometers.</b> Chromatic adaptation and another photomorphogenic response in the blue-green algae are {{discussed in terms of}} possible regulation by a photoreversible pigment recently isolated from Tolypothrix...|$|R
40|$|An action {{spectrum}} was determined for the photoinduced formation of perithecia in a homothallic strain of Nectria haematococca Berk. and Br. var. cucurbitae (Snyder and Hansen) Dingley. Dose-response curves for perithecial formation {{were obtained from}} 340 to 510 <b>nanometers</b> at 10 -nanometer intervals. Radiation longer than 510 <b>nanometers</b> was not effective for inducing perithecial formation. The {{action spectrum}} indicated peaks of activity near 360, 440, and 480 <b>nanometers</b> with shoulders near 420 and 460 <b>nanometers.</b> Minima occurred near 350 <b>nanometers,</b> 390 to 410 <b>nanometers,</b> and 470 <b>nanometers.</b> The general shape of this action spectrum appears {{to be similar to}} those obtained for many different near ultraviolet-blue-sensitive organisms in which a flavoprotein molecule was postulated to be the photoreceptor...|$|R
40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} {{action spectrum}} of the bean plant leaf, Phaseolus vulgaris L. (variety Red Kidney), has been determined with a diffraction grating illuminated by a 6500 -watt xenon arc. An infrared CO 2 analyzer {{was used to determine}} the gross photosynthetic rate of the terminal leaflet of the first trifoliate leaf. The rate was measured {{as a function of the}} light intensity at steps of 12. 5 <b>nanometers</b> which approximates the length of the leaflet used. Twenty-five curves between 400 and 700 <b>nanometers</b> were used to establish the action spectrum. All light curves were some linear function of the incident intensity, and all were extrapolated to zero. The action spectrum shows the following features. (a) there are two peaks (i. e., at about 670 and 630 <b>nanometers)</b> and a shoulder between 600 and 612 <b>nanometers</b> in the red region where the highest rate of photosynthesis is found. Lower peaks in descending order are found in the blue (at about 437 <b>nanometers)</b> and the green (at about 500 <b>nanometers)</b> regions. (b) There are two small minima at about 650 <b>nanometers</b> and between 470 and 480 <b>nanometers,</b> and a broad minimum is found between 540 and 530 <b>nanometers.</b> (c) The photosynthetic rate declines rapidly above 680 <b>nanometers,</b> reaching the lowest value at 700 <b>nanometers.</b> (d) At wave lengths below the blue maximum, the rate decreases progressively to 400 <b>nanometers...</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with <b>nanometer</b> resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the <b>nanometer</b> phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E
5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for <b>nanometer</b> control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E
40|$|Briefly described, {{new types}} of {{nanostructures}} and methods of fabrication thereof are disclosed. A representative nanostructure includes a free-standing, helical semiconductor oxide nanostructure. The free-standing, helical semiconductor oxide nanostructure includes a nanobelt having a substantially rectangular cross-section. The the nanobelt is about 5 <b>nanometers</b> to about 200 <b>nanometers</b> in width and about 3 <b>nanometers</b> to about 50 <b>nanometers</b> in height, and the radius of the helical semiconductor oxide nanostructure is about 200 to 5000 <b>nanometers.</b> Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
40|$|Different {{groups of}} ducklings reared under sodium {{monochromatic}} light (589 <b>nanometers)</b> and under white light {{were trained to}} discriminate between the stimulus correlated with reinforcement (589 <b>nanometers),</b> and the stimulus correlated with extinction, whole value was either 570 or 610 <b>nanometers.</b> The peaks of subsequently obtained gradients of wavelength generalization of both groups were displaced away from the stimulus correlated with extinction. The peaks of the groups trained not to respond to 570 <b>nanometers</b> were located at 600 <b>nanometers.</b> The peaks of the groups trained not to respond to 610 <b>nanometers</b> were located at 580 <b>nanometers.</b> These results (in agreement with earlier data of Rudolph and Honig, 1972) suggest that ducklings have an innate basis for ordering stimuli of different wavelengths along the hue dimension...|$|R
40|$|Irradiation {{of maize}} (Zea mays) roots and coleoptiles with visible light causes dark-reversible {{absorbance}} changes in these organs. There {{is an increase}} in absorbance near 440 <b>nanometers</b> and smaller increases below 410 <b>nanometers</b> and about 595 <b>nanometers.</b> Decreases in absorbance are observed at about 420 <b>nanometers</b> and minor ones at 537 and 575 <b>nanometers.</b> These responses are also observed in cell-free preparations from roots and coleoptiles if dithionite, NADPH, or NADH is added prior to illumination. The dose curve for these effects has a distinct maximum at 420 <b>nanometers</b> and a minor one at 575 <b>nanometers.</b> Difference spectra and dose response curves indicate that heme compounds such as cytochromes or, more probably, peroxidase complexes are the photoreceptive and chemical reacting molecules. Siroheme-containing proteins may also be taken into consideration...|$|R
5|$|The {{entry-level}} 200 {{series was}} expanded with six new processors using 28 <b>nanometer</b> manufacturing and dual or quad-core options in June 2013. The Snapdragon 805 was released that November. The 410, which {{is intended for}} low-cost phones in developing nations, was announced the following month. In January 2014, Qualcomm introduced {{a modified version of}} the Snapdragon 600 called 602A that is intended for in-car infotainment screens, backup cameras, and other driver assistance products. The quad-core Snapdragon 610 and eight-core 615 were announced in February 2014. The Snapdragon 808 and 810 were announced in April 2014. The newest iteration in Snapdragon 800 series is Snapdragon 835, which is the first Qualcomm SOC that is built on a 10nm architecture. As of October 2016, the Snapdragon 835 contained the fastest processor in the Snapdragon line.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of current transistors on ICs are composed principally of doped silicon and its alloys. As silicon is fabricated into single <b>nanometer</b> transistors, short-channel effects adversely change desired material properties of silicon as a functional transistor. Below are several non-silicon substitutes in the fabrication of small <b>nanometer</b> transistors.|$|E
25|$|To {{put that}} scale in another context, the {{comparative}} {{size of a}} <b>nanometer</b> to a meter {{is the same as}} that of a marble to the size of the earth. Or another way of putting it: a <b>nanometer</b> is the amount an average man's beard grows in the time it takes him to raise the razor to his face.|$|E
40|$|The nyctinastic {{closing of}} Albizzia julibrissin pinnules is delayed by {{exposure}} to far-red radiation at 710 and 730 <b>nanometers,</b> with the former {{more effective than the}} latter. Far-red radiation at 750 and 770 <b>nanometers</b> has no effect on the process. Red light at 660 <b>nanometers,</b> which by itself has no effect, delayed closure when given before or simultaneously with far-red radiation at 750 or 770 <b>nanometers.</b> Low doses of green light, on the other hand, prevented all far-red radiations from delaying closure when given together with one of them. Effectiveness peaks at 550 <b>nanometers.</b> Green light by itself has no effect on the closing process...|$|R

25|$|The lamps used in {{phototherapy}} {{contain a}} phosphor that emits only UVB ultraviolet light. There are two types: broadband UVB that gives 290–320 <b>nanometer</b> with peak wavelength of 306nm, and narrowband UVB that gives 311–313 <b>nanometer.</b> Due to its longer wavelength the narrowband UVB requires a 10 times higher dose to the skin, {{compared to the}} broadband. The narrowband is good for psoriasis, eczema (atopic dermatitis), vitiligo, lichen planus, and some other skin diseases. The broadband is better for increasing Vitamin D3 in the body.|$|E
25|$|Different {{semiconducting}} {{materials are}} used to synthesize quantum dots of different sizes and therefore emit different wavelengths of light. Materials that normally emit light in the visible region are often used and their sizes are fine-tuned so that certain colors are emitted. Typical substances used to synthesize quantum dots are cadmium (Cd) and selenium (Se). For example, when the electrons of two <b>nanometer</b> CdSe quantum dots relax after excitation, blue light is emitted. Similarly, red light is emitted in four <b>nanometer</b> CdSe quantum dots.|$|E
25|$|Microelectronics {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the design and microfabrication of very small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components (resistors, capacitors etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. Nanoelectronics is the further scaling of devices down to <b>nanometer</b> levels. Modern devices {{are already in the}} <b>nanometer</b> regime, with below 100nm processing having been standard since about 2002.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{determined the}} effects of early color experience on gradients of wavelength generalization. In each experiment, one group of ducklings was raised in monochromatic (589 <b>nanometers)</b> sodium-vapor light and a second group, in white light. In Exp.
