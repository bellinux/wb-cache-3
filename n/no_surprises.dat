25|$|The cricket season started early, on 8 April, with MCC {{playing the}} Champion County, {{or at least}} it would have done if the rain had not delayed the start till the next day. The other games played were all between the {{first-class}} counties and university sides. The first matches showed a bumper crop of centuries, with little joy for bowlers, but there were <b>no</b> <b>surprises.</b> The MCC ended up beating Warwickshire.|$|E

The U.S. beat Kazakhstan {{in the first game}} in a 10–0 blowout, while France won against Italy in the decisive match for second place. There were <b>no</b> <b>surprises</b> on the second game-day, with the U.S. defeating France and Italy winning against Kazakhstan. The U.S. then defeated Italy in a shootout and France beat Kazakhstan 5–3. The final relegation results saw Kazakhstan and Italy go directly back down to DivisionI. Group-winners U.S. and second-placed France both qualified for the 2011 World Championships.|$|E

[...] Although still not liking the political process, which she referred to as [...] "a very difficult game", she urged her husband to run again {{and was one of the}} few family members to initially support the notion.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Writing for Tor.com, Keith DeCandido {{questioned}} why the shuttlebay wasn't guarded, comparing it to a similar situation in [...] episode, [...] "". He also felt that the sequence where the shuttle is bounced off an atmosphere resembled the [...] "Premiere" [...] episode of Farscape, an odd criticism considering this episode aired some 11 years before the Farscape episode. [...] DeCandido said that the exam made no sense, and that there were <b>no</b> <b>surprises</b> as it was obvious that Wesley and Picard were not due to leave the series. Despite Remmick representing [...] "the ultimate cliché of the jackass interrogator", DeCandido liked the episode. [...] He credited the strong performance by the cast and called Wheaton's performance the best of the first season. DeCandido gave the episode a score of five out of ten.|$|E
500|$|Ford {{remained}} relatively {{active in the}} years after his presidency. He continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation, such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services. In January 1977, he became the president of Eisenhower Fellowships in Philadelphia, then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from 1980 to 1986. Later in 1977, he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by James M. Naughton, a New York Times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former President's advance obituary, an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication. In 1979, Ford published his autobiography, A Time to Heal (Harper/Reader's Digest, 454 pages). A review in Foreign Affairs described it as, [...] "Serene, unruffled, unpretentious, like the author. This is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs, but there are <b>no</b> <b>surprises,</b> no deep probings of motives or events. No more here than meets the eye." ...|$|E

I go into them impulsively. I scorn any notion of their permanence. I forget the fever associated with them when a new interest presents itself." ...|$|E

Callas proceeded to give a series of concerts around Greece, and then, against her teacher's advice, she returned to America to see her father and to further pursue her career. When she left Greece on September 14, 1945, two months short of her 22nd birthday, Callas had given 56 performances in seven operas and had appeared in around 20 recitals. Callas considered her Greek career {{as the foundation of}} her musical and dramatic upbringing, saying, [...] "When I got to the big career, there were <b>no</b> <b>surprises</b> for me." ...|$|E

It was the knowledge that she would always do so that had driven him away. Thus his thoughts ran.|$|E

60|$|Thus he {{had come}} down, foreseeing with {{confidence}} how almost everything would be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed, {{that there would be}} <b>no</b> <b>surprises</b> in his visit. But he had found that humdrum world in a terribly dynamic condition, in which even badinage and lyrism had turned explosive; and the first day of this visit had become the most fatal epoch of his life. The next morning he felt so harassed with the nightmare of consequences--he dreaded so much the immediate issues before him--that seeing while he breakfasted the arrival of the Riverston coach, he went out hurriedly and took his place on it, that he might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing or saying anything in Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those tangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine, from the shallow absoluteness of men's judgments. He had found Lydgate, for whom he had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which claimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why, in spite of that claim, {{it would have been better}} for Will to have avoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To a creature of Will's susceptible temperament--without any neutral region of indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him into the collisions of a passionate drama--the revelation that Rosamond had made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty which his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for him. He hated his own cruelty, and yet he dreaded to show the fulness of his relenting: he must go to her again; the friendship could not be put to a sudden end; and her unhappiness was a power which he dreaded. And all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life before him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his fresh start on crutches. In the night he had debated whether he should not get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat. But there were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure: the blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of that chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged necessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for him to resign himself to it and go straightway into a distance which was also despair.|$|E
