Many of these options are costly {{and may not}} be effective. This report will review both traditional and <b>non-traditional</b> <b>options</b> available in the treatment of head lice. Education that can help with prevention of the spread of head lice is essential. The practitioner must be empathetic and supportive with patients that present or call for assistance in treating this annoying problem. 'While validating parental concerns, it is equally important to reassure that head lice, while annoying, are not a cause of any major health problems...|$|E
40|$|Inadequate {{economic}} restructuring and {{a decline in}} agricultural production in South Africa have reduced the economic opportunities of rural communities. They have limited the economic development options of rural areas, rendering older development strategies less viable and forcing many to look for alternative methods to help them survive and prosper. Rural tourism and its associated businesses have emerged among the most popular <b>non-traditional</b> <b>options</b> for rural development, because of their ability to generate income and jobs. This study examines national and international strategies for developing tourism, and investigates the opinions of participants in the tourism industry of the Limpopo province, with a view to identifying the key strategic issues that can ensure the success of rural tourism. The research consisted of a literature study, field surveys, and interviews with policy-makers and administrators, tourism operators, academics and tourists. The results identify rural tourism as a viable development tool for Limpopo province. Six strategic issues were identified as fundamental for its success. It is believed that these guidelines could also be applied to other rural provinces, thus creating a generic strategy for developing rural tourism. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} {{of cocaine and}} heroin, {{the two most important}} drugs economically, has been concentrated in a small number of poor nations for 25 years. A slightly larger number of developing nations have been affected by large-scale trafficking in these two drugs. This paper reviews what is known about drug control programs and considers <b>non-traditional</b> <b>options.</b> The usual array of programs for suppressing drug problems, enforcement, treatment, harm reduction and prevention have been assessed almost exclusively in wealthy nations. Although treatment {{has been shown to be}} cost-effective, it is of minimal relevance for reducing the drug problems of nations such as Afghanistan, Colombia, Mexico or Tajikistan, which are primarily harmed by production and trafficking rather than consumption. Efforts to reduce drug production and trafficking have not been subject to systematic evaluation but the best interpretation of the available evidence is that they have had minimal effect on the quantities produced or trafficked. It is reasonable to conclude that international drug control efforts can do more to affect where these drugs are produced rather than the quantity. If that is the case, and given that spreading a specific level of production or trafficking to more rather than fewer nations probably decreases global welfare, it may be appropriate to consider a less aggressive stance to current producers and to make strategic decisions about the location of an industry producing a global bad.

40|$|Canadian provincial {{governments have}} made {{significant}} investments in nurse advice telephone lines and Internet resources as <b>non-traditional</b> <b>options</b> to reduce emergency department visits and improve {{access to health}} care for the population. However, {{little is known about the}} characteristics of users of these services, and who chooses to use them first, before accessing other sources of health advice. Additionally, individuals with lower levels of education tend to be late adopters of technology and have inconsistent utilization of health services. The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of educational attainment levels on the use of non-traditional health information sources first, before other more conventional sources of health information. The study utilized Canadian Survey of Experiences with Primary Health Care (CSE-PHC), 2007 - 2008 survey data. Logistic regression models were constructed to examine the relationship between use of non-traditional health information sources first, and educational attainment, adjusted for confounders. Relative to someone with less than secondary education, individuals with secondary education (OR = 4. 30, 95 % CI: 2. 44 – 7. 59), and individuals with post-secondary education (OR 4. 91, 95 % CI: 2. 78 – 8. 67), had significantly greater odds of using non-traditional health information sources first. These findings suggest that educational attainment has a significant effect on the use of non-traditional health information sources first. Future providers of non-traditional health information sources, especially in the design of future eHealth tools and consideration of eHealth literacy, should consider these results in development and implementation of their communications strategies to maximize the reach of their services...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of EducationDepartment of Educational LeadershipTeresa N. MillerThe {{purpose of}} this study was to research, develop, and {{validate}} a handbook of effective strategies that Kansas school district leaders can use to increase their ability to maximize their school districts’ nontraditional funding. Kansas School District Leaders’ Handbook for Maximizing Nontraditional Donations and Grant Funding was developed using the research and development methodology as recommended by Gall, Borg, and Gall (2007) through a seven-step development cycle. The review of the literature, the needs assessment, and the proof of concept survey provided information for developing the outline and initial prototype for the final handbook. Non-educators in Kansas who had significant success in acquiring nontraditional funding and fostering entrepreneurial leadership throughout the state served as experts for the preliminary field test. Revisions were then made based on their feedback. The main field test was conducted with a representative group of Kansas superintendents, who were the potential users of the guide. These two groups of experts provided feedback by using a Likert scale and survey responses about the content and format of the handbook. Final revisions were based on the main field test evaluators’ feedback. The conclusions from the research project were: (1) there was a strong need for Kansas school district leaders to be educated regarding the proactive steps they can take in order to increase the possibilities for additional grant and donation funding for their school districts; (2) since Kansas’ state educational funding had been significantly reduced in Kansas during the years between 2008 - 2012, schools districts were forced to look at <b>non-traditional</b> <b>options</b> that could ease the strain on the districts’ general fund or provide additional resources for the schools during a downturn in the economy; (3) the development of a comprehensive handbook that blended theory, research, and practice for instructional leaders on how to conduct effective campaigns on acquiring additional revenue could be used to develop a mindset for Kansas school leaders to one that was focused more on the principles of entrepreneurial leadership...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we {{advocate}} two effective <b>non-traditional</b> performance-based stock <b>option</b> schemes: Parisian and Asian executives’ stock option plans. Under a Parisian option scheme, {{the stock price}} should have outperformed a certain stock price for a fixed length of time. Under an Asian scheme, the executives’ compensation is coupled with the average performance of the stock price. Both schemes make the manipulation through the executives less likely. In the Parisian scheme, it {{can be achieved by}} setting the length of excursion sufficiently long and in the Asian scheme, by requiring the average rate of return of the stock to exceed a relatively high fixed rate of return. We focus on the valuation of these new performance-vested stock options and conduct some numerical analyses based on the valuation formulae we obtain...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) {{occupational}} therapy program commenced in 2008. A {{rapid increase in}} the number of {{occupational therapy}} programs, combined with a steady increase in cohort sizes at USC has created pressure on traditional placement models. Use of alternate placement models has slowly increased globally,generally in response to placement shortages. Using HWA funding, USC has successfully piloted a range of <b>non-traditional</b> placement <b>options</b> which address placement shortages, but also promote the unique student learning inherent in these models. Through this, USC alternate placement models have emerged where students are supported to develop and provide occupational therapy services in facilities where such services do not currently exist. Aims: In this paper we will describe the processes used to develop and implement the USC role emerging placement model, exemplars of the experiences of students and organisations and explore implications for future practice. Method: An action-research method was employed. This included grounding in the literature, development of a trial model, student and facility preparation, piloting different placement models, and evaluating outcomes through feedbackfrom key stakeholders. Practice implications: By sharing our experiences we will facilitate understanding about the benefits of our approach and its capacity to extend student knowledge and expandopportunities for our profession. Conclusion: Developing alternate placement models for use across undergraduate cohorts suggests that the USC roleemerging placement models are an excellent way to provide sustainable placements that may better equip students for increasingly diverse work roles...|$|R
40|$|Water {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} natural resources in the West Bank, Palestine. Due to its limited availability, it is a resource that needs particular protection. Although agriculture consumes most of the water (70 %) in the West Bank, the domestic water supply is strategically not less important. It is the aim of this study to evaluate domestic water management options suitable for Palestinian conditions that contribute to achieving water sufficiency in the domestic water use in the house of tomorrow. A number of options were evaluated economically, environmentally and socially using the concept of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Results of the study showed that by introducing a combination of domestic water management options, a substantial decrease in the water consumption of more than 50 % can be achieved, thereby reducing the pressure on the scarce water resources. The annual environmental impact of the in-house water use can be reduced in the range of 8 %, when using low-flow shower head to 38 % when using rainwater harvesting systems. Some of the options (faucet aerators, low-flow shower heads and dual flush toilets) were found to be financially attractive with a pay back period of less than their expected lives, others (rainwater harvesting, graywater reuse and dry toilets) were found to be financially unattractive because of the high investment. In the social context, it was found that introducing such options can improve the quality of life of those not having enough water. There is already a popular willingness to take part in water conservation in the domestic sector in the West Bank. The strongest driving force for using water conservation measures is the awareness that water is a scarce resource. It was concluded that, theoretically, the house of tomorrow can be largely independent in terms of water and sanitation. Education and awareness campaigns in the context of water management with a focus on <b>non-traditional</b> <b>options</b> are key to achieve such a house.

The positive responses on the evaluations conducted on the same day girls participated in the conference spawned a new interest in whether or not these one-day conferences had lasting effects on girls??? decisions around math and science classes. Therefore, a longitudinal study was designed to try to answer this important question. The outcomes of the longitudinal project will impact girls in a rural, economically disadvantaged area with a high Native American population. The local AAUW branch will use longitudinal evaluation reports to determine how to best use its resources to encourage girls to pursue careers in the math and science.
