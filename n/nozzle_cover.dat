Major requirements were to (1) protect the booster separation motors (BSMs) from the ascent aerothermal environment; (2) provide a humidity seal for the BSM during storage and readiness on the launch pad; (3) open completely during the ignition transient; and (4) produce no debris during ascent, separation, and booster reentry.

40|$|A thermal {{analysis}} of the compressible CO 2 flow for the Portable Fire Extinguisher (PFE) system has been performed. A SINDA/FLUINT model has been developed for this analysis. The model includes the PFE tank and the TeSS nozzle, and both have initial temperature of 72 F. In order to investigate the thermal effect on the nozzle due to discharging CO 2, the PFE TeSS nozzle pipe has been divided into three segments. This model also includes heat transfer predictions for PFE tank inner and outer wall surfaces. The simulation {{results show that the}} CO 2 discharge rates have fulfilled the minimum flow requirements that the PFE system discharges 3. 0 Ibm CO 2 in 10 seconds and 5. 5 Ibm of CO 2 in 45 seconds during its operation. At 45 seconds, the PFE tank wall temperature is 63 F, and the TeSS <b>nozzle</b> <b>cover</b> wall temperatures for the three segments are 47 F, 53 F and 37 F, respectively. Thermal insulation for personal protection is used for the first two segments of the TeSS nozzle. The simulation results also indicate that at 50 seconds, the remaining CO 2 in the tank may be near the triple point (gas, liquid and solid) state and, therefore, restricts the flow...|$|E
40|$|Eleven {{tests have}} been carried out on mild steel {{cylindrical}} pressure vessels with flush nozzles. The cylindrical vessel was 18 -in outside diameter x +in thick and the <b>nozzles</b> <b>covered</b> a range of outside diameters from 23 in to 6 in and thicknesses from;k in to 3 in. The nozzle-vessel weld was in all cases to B. S. 1500, Fig. 32 e. Two plain cylindrical vessels 18 -in 0. d. x +-in thick were also tested to establish datum curves for the vessels with nozzles. Clock gauges and strain gauges capable of measuring up to 2 per cent strain were used to measure the strain and change of geometry {{in the vicinity of the}} nozzle-cylinder intersection. Measurements were also made of the pumped water volume as the pressure was increased. After pressurizing until the main vessel had yielded the insttunentation was removed and all vessels were tested to rupture. The results do not show a well defined plastic limit pressure as normally understood but it has been possible to define from the experiments a series of pressures for each specimen at which consistent patterns of stress, strain and deflection are evident. One of these pressures is chosen to derive an empirical relationship which can be used in formulating a minimum design requirement...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCold O 2 /NO {{supersonic}} expansions {{through an}} axisymmetric convergent-divergent nozzle into a low-pressure background gas {{have been investigated}} both experimentally and numerically. Temperature and density measurements have been carried out, using tracer NO in an O 2 main flow. NO two-dimensional rotational temperature and density flow field patterns in the jet behind the nozzle have been measured by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The spectroscopic investigations are complemented by static and impact pressure measurements along the jet centreline. Two nozzles with the same inner profile but with a short and long divergent section and small and large lip have been examined. Three experiments performed using these <b>nozzles</b> <b>cover</b> {{a wide range of}} regimes of underexpanded free jet flow, from highly oscillating multi-cycle structure to the regime with smooth deceleration of the issuing flow by the background gas. The numerical simulation of the whole flow field from the conditions in the stagnation chamber to those in the flooded space is performed in the framework of the full set of Navier-Stokes equations by employing a recently developed algorithm based on a staggered grid. The flow inside a long nozzle is shown to be strongly affected by the boundary layer, which leads to the degeneration of the isentropic core at the nozzle exit and transforms the jet regime from overexpanded for inviscid flow to underexpanded for a real flow. The model reproduces the experimental structures of the low-density free jet flow fairly well...|$|R

Those consequences can prove drastic if the outlet cross-section of the cover-nozzle is not designed properly. A second part is dedicated to the performance of the system itself. The intensity of the lateral forces created are checked for dierent geometric conguration of the cover-nozzle. Some linearity is also expected between the deviation of the <b>cover</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the creation of lateral force, to ease the handling quality implementation on the nal aircraft.

40|$|A {{possibility}} to easily calibrate probes for flow field measurements is always welcome. From this reason, a {{design of a}} test facility for probe calibration was made. The probes will be calibrated in a free jet of known properties, which is created by an exchangeable <b>nozzle</b> to <b>cover</b> {{a wide range of}} Mach numbers up to Mach 2. The most important is to create a homogeneous flow across the test section. This is accomplished by a precise design of the nozzles carried out by numerical tools. The convergent nozzle part is common for all subsonic flow regimes while the divergent part (forming a de Laval nozzle) is suited for a specific supersonic Mach number. These parts are designed using the method of characteristics. Numerical simulations performed by a CFD code show a feasibility and quality of the proposed test facility...|$|R
40|$|At DLR, Göttingen, a new {{facility}} for probe calibration was built where dried air is driven by two compressors forming a closed circuit system with a free jet test section. Mach number and Reynolds number are the parameters to be varied while the total temperature is kept constant at T 0 = 298 K (25 °C). The Mach number covers the range from Ma = 0. 3 to 1. 6 and will be extended down to Ma = 0. 2 and up to 1. 8 when the some modifications in the circuit will be installed. Variation of the Reynolds number is possible via the total pressure which can range from p 0 = 30 kPa up to 300 kPa. There are different axisymmetric nozzles with an exit diameter up to 50 mm to achieve different Mach numbers. First a convergent <b>nozzle</b> <b>covers</b> the subsonic range, second a slotted nozzle is used within the transonic range and third three Laval nozzles are available for supersonic Mach numbers (Ma = 1. 4, 1. 5 and 1. 6). The orientation of the probe head positioned downstream of the exit plane on the centre line of the nozzle flow can be varied from - 22 ° up to + 22 ° for both the angle of attack and the yaw angle using stepping motors. Data acquisition is done {{by means of a}} PSI-module (for the most important pressures) and a SIMATIC operating system from Siemens, while the automatic data collection and a first evaluation is done using a software based on LabVIEW. First measurements of the jet quality at different distances from the nozzle exit plane showed that the flow field is well suited for probe calibrations. Then two probes, a pyramid probe to be used in 3 D flow fields and a wedge type probe to be used in 2 D flow fields were calibrated. These results were already applied when wake traverses were performed in the Wind Tunnel for Straight Cascades (EGG) at DLR, Göttingen. The technical set up of the wind tunnel, first measurements concerning the flow quality and some results of probe calibration will be presented...|$|R
50|$|On September 25, Missile 6A was launched. Aside {{from more}} {{instrumentation}} in the thrust section and the above-mentioned helium vent modification, it was identical to 4A and predictably met {{the same fate}} as once again, the thrust section overheated. Thrust levels in both engines dropped to only 35% at T+32 seconds and two seconds later, the propulsion system completely shut down. The Range Safety destruct command was sent at T+63 seconds. This time, overheating and high vibration levels had caused a LOX regulator to fail, resulting in gas generator flameout. After this debacle, the Air Force relented and accepted {{the need for an}} improved heat shield. Other modifications were made as well, including removal of the long skirt covering the boattail and engine nozzles. The gas generator vent pipe was changed to point outward and away from the missile instead of directly underneath it. The engine <b>nozzles</b> were <b>covered</b> with fiberglass insulation boots and aluminum plumbing in the Atlas changed to steel plumbing which had a greater heat tolerance. The autopilot was also modified to reduce vibration levels.|$|R

40|$|End-to-end {{integration}} {{tests are}} critical risk reduction efforts for any complex vehicle. Phasing tests are an end-to-end integrated test that validates system directional phasing (polarity) from sensor measurement through software algorithms to end effector response. Phasing tests are typically performed on a fully integrated and assembled flight vehicle where sensors are stimulated {{by moving the}} vehicle and the effectors are observed for proper polarity. Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Pad Abort 1 (PA- 1) Phasing Test was conducted from inertial measurement to Launch Abort System (LAS). Orion Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT- 1) has two end-to-end phasing tests planned. The first test from inertial measurement to Crew Module (CM) reaction control system thrusters uses navigation and flight control system software algorithms to process commands. The second test from inertial measurement to CM S-Band Phased Array Antenna (PAA) uses navigation and communication system software algorithms to process commands. Future Orion flights include Ascent Abort Flight Test 2 (AA- 2) and Exploration Mission 1 (EM- 1). These flights will include additional or updated sensors, software algorithms and effectors. This paper will explore the implementation of end-to-end phasing tests on a flight vehicle which has many constraints, trade-offs and compromises. Orion PA- 1 Phasing Test was conducted at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) from March 4 - 6, 2010. This test decreased the risk of mission failure by demonstrating proper flight control system polarity. Demonstration was achieved by stimulating the primary navigation sensor, processing sensor data to commands and viewing propulsion response. PA- 1 primary navigation sensor was a Space Integrated Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) (SIGI) which has onboard processing, INS (3 accelerometers and 3 rate gyros) and no GPS receiver. SIGI data was processed by GN&C software into thrust magnitude and direction commands. The processing changes through three phases of powered flight: pitchover, downrange and reorientation. The primary inputs to GN&C are attitude position, attitude rates, angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS). Pitch and yaw attitude and attitude rate responses were verified by using a flight spare SIGI mounted to a 2 -axis rate table. AOA and AOS responses were verified by using a data recorded from SIGI movements on a robotic arm located at NASA Johnson Space Center. The data was consolidated and used in an open-loop data input to the SIGI. Propulsion was the Launch Abort System (LAS) Attitude Control Motor (ACM) which consisted of a solid motor with 8 nozzles. Each nozzle has active thrust control by varying throat area with a pintle. LAS ACM pintles are observable through optically transparent <b>nozzle</b> <b>covers.</b> SIGI movements on robot arm, SIGI rate table movements and LAS ACM pintle responses were video recorded as test artifacts for analysis and evaluation.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} {{for the two}} phase choked flow of three cryogenic fluids - nitrogen, methane, and hydrogen - in four converging-diverging <b>nozzles.</b> The data <b>cover</b> a range of inlet stagnation conditions, all single phase, from well below to well above the thermodynamic critical conditions.

40|$|Student Number : 0105159 R - MSc(Eng) Dissertation - School of Electrical and Information Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentThis {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design of a re-usable rocket for use in triggered-lightning experiments. It is intended that the rocket will tow a thin wire to sufficient height so that the lightning mechanism will attach onto the wire and follow it to ground. The rocket design is inherently safe as it does not use explosive materials for its propulsion system, and hence conforms to South African explosive legislation. The designed rocket consists of a hybrid motor, which uses a solid combustion chamber and liquid oxidiser rather than solid motors which use a single solid fuel or a liquid motor which uses two liquid propellants. The mechanical performance of the oxidiser stage is critical in containing the pressurised oxidiser and regulating the flow of the oxidiser into the combustion chamber. The design of the combustion chamber and {{the rate at which the}} solid material burns is key to the generation of the pressure which is expelled through the nozzle to produce thrust. The design of the <b>nozzle</b> is <b>covered</b> in which the material from which it is made must withstand temperatures in excess of 1600 ◦C. The entire system was modelled to calculate the parameters of the various subsystems. The simulation study shows that the rocket will be able to reach 1 km with a complete section of wire towed behind it. A cost analysis, against other commercial rocket systems, was performed. The analysis concludes from the total cost of ownership that it is significantly cheaper to operate the designed rocket, over the course of the experiment, than other rocket systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} experimental, theoretical, and computational {{study of}} separated nozzle flows has been conducted. Experimental testing was {{performed at the}} NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel Complex. As {{part of a comprehensive}} static performance investigation, force, moment, and pressure measurements were made and schlieren flow visualization was obtained for a sub-scale, non-axisymmetric, two-dimensional, convergent- divergent nozzle. In addition, two-dimensional numerical simulations were run using the computational fluid dynamics code PAB 3 D with two-equation turbulence closure and algebraic Reynolds stress modeling. For reference, experimental and computational results were compared with theoretical predictions based on one-dimensional gas dynamics and an approximate integral momentum boundary layer method. Experimental results from this study indicate that off-design overexpanded nozzle flow was dominated by shock induced boundary layer separation, which was divided into two distinct flow regimes; three- dimensional separation with partial reattachment, and fully detached two-dimensional separation. The test nozzle was observed to go through a marked transition in passing from one regime to the other. In all cases, separation provided a significant increase in static thrust efficiency compared to the ideal prediction. Results indicate that with controlled separation, the entire overexpanded range of nozzle performance would be within 10 % of the peak thrust efficiency. By offering savings in weight and complexity over a conventional mechanical exhaust system, this may allow a fixed geometry <b>nozzle</b> to <b>cover</b> an entire flight envelope. The computational simulation was in excellent agreement with experimental data over most of the test range, and {{did a good job of}} modeling internal flow and thrust performance. An exception occurred at low nozzle pressure ratios, where the two-dimensional computational model was inconsistent with the three-dimensional separation observed in the experiment. In general, the computation captured the physics of the shock boundary layer interaction and shock induced boundary layer separation in the nozzle, though there were some differences in shock structure compared to experiment. Though minor, these differences could be important for studies involving flow control or thrust vectoring of separated nozzles. Combined with other observations, this indicates that more detailed, three-dimensional computational modeling needs to be conducted to more realistically simulate shock-separated nozzle flows...|$|R
40|$|Contaminated surfaces, such as {{the face}} of a nuclear reactor, need to be {{stabilized}} (fixed) to avoid airborne contamination during decontamination and decommissioning activities, and to prepare for interim safe storage. The traditional (baseline) method of fixing the contamination has been to spray a coating on the surfaces, but ensuring complete coverage over complex shapes, such as nozzles and hoses, is difficult. The Hanford Site C Reactor Technology Demonstration Group demonstrated innovative technologies to assess stabilization properties of various coatings and to achieve complete coverage of complex surfaces on the reactor face. This demonstration was conducted in two phases: the first phase consisted of a series of laboratory assessments of various stabilization coatings on metal coupons. For the second phase, coatings that passed the laboratory tests were applied to the front face of the C Reactor and evaluated.
