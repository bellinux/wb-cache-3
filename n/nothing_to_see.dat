25|$|Walter de Paduwa on his Dr Boogie {{radio show}} of 11/11/2016 {{described}} (in French) his 1990s visit to Fredericksburg eating sauerkraut at 35 degrees, {{and seeing the}} Nimitz statue but summing up with the somewhat sweeping advice N'allez jamais a Fredericksburg. Il n'y a RIEN a voir a Frederiksburg (Never go to Fredericksburg. There is <b>NOTHING</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at Fredericksburg).|$|E
25|$|Vincent's DNA mutates as {{the season}} progresses, as he becomes more beast-like. He begins {{experiencing}} black-outs, which J.T. associates with Catherine's interference. Cat and Vincent will stop at <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> each other, however. Assistant District Attorney Gabriel Lowen visits Cat's precinct to investigate the beast-like attack {{in the city and}} over time he reveals that not only does he know about Muirfield but that he shares the same ability as Vincent. At first an enemy, Gabriel goes on to become an ally to Vincent {{by the end of the}} first season and suggests he has found a cure to the virus inflicted on them by Muirfield. Vincent ultimately wonders if he wants to be cured or not.|$|E
500|$|When the pin {{is removed}} {{and the small}} doors opened, there is now <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> but [...] "a flat layer of plaster, with a sheet of nineteenth-century paper or vellum in front of it". Whatever was {{designed}} to be displayed has now gone; it must have been flat, and was perhaps another relic, probably a textile, or a picture on vellum. The Veil of Veronica, in either form, is a possibility; the face of Christ at the top in a circular setting often represents this. Outside the doors the foliate border of the front is continued, uninterrupted by figures. Below two of the angels with trumpets can be seen, with an unpopulated stretch of the green hillside, and below it the back of the castle base, which has apparently had another arched [...] "leg" [...] in the centre crudely removed, leaving a jagged edge, and also making the reliquary rather less stable.|$|E

500|$|In July 2012, it was {{reported}} that Andrew Stanton was developing a sequel to Finding Nemo, to be titled Finding Dory, with Victoria Strouse writing the script, and the film scheduled to be released in 2016. The same day the news of a potential sequel broke, Stanton called into question the accuracy of the reports. The message said, [...] "Didn't you all learn from Chicken Little? Everyone calm down. Don't believe everything you read. <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> here now. #skyisnotfalling". According to the report by The Hollywood Reporter published in August 2012, Ellen DeGeneres was in negotiations to reprise her role of Dory. In September 2012, Stanton confirmed, saying, [...] "What was immediately on the list was writing a second Carter movie. [...] When that went away, everything slid up. [...] I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to Carter not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit". In February 2013, it was confirmed by the press that Albert Brooks would reprise the role of Marlin in the sequel.|$|E
500|$|Quinn's storyline {{received}} widely divergent commentary. Hankinson {{thought the}} writers had missed {{an opportunity to}} [...] "do something hugely daring" [...] and also {{reduce the size of}} the cast. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal characterized their message as [...] "Move on, folks, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> here", added that [...] "there wasn’t even a scratch on her face" [...] and concluded that it was [...] "nice to know that touches of irony haven’t left the show". Strecker called Quinn [...] "a walking wheeling PSA about texting dangers in general". Dodge said that one of his [...] "favorite scenes" [...] of the episode was [...] "when Artie tries to get Quinn to wheel herself up a steep ramp outside McKinley". VanDerWerff noted the pair's [...] "chemistry" [...] as friends, and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman described [...] "Quinn's kids-in-wheelchairs bonding scenes with Artie" [...] as the [...] "second best thing about the episode". Michael Slezak of TVLine expressed the wish that the extras in the scene in the skateboard park [...] "had actually gotten a chance to, um, speak like real humans, not just like props for a kicky musical number". VanDerWerff's summation was that the episode [...] "gave Dianna Agron more shades to play than she’s usually asked to, and that was a good thing".|$|E
2500|$|Through the 1980s and 1990s, {{a number}} of pay-to-get-in tourist {{destinations}} were built on the island, most of which the local people found uninteresting. Consequently, there was a joke that the name Sentosa stood for [...] "So Expensive and <b>Nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> Also".|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Baer began {{investigating}} the gambling industry. He noted that tourists paid a US$5 to US$6 admission {{to tour the}} [...] "Ponderosa Ranch", which was the location for filming some episodes of TV's Bonanza. There was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> but a working cattle ranch, but people enjoyed {{it because of the}} Bonanza connection. Baer decided that tourists would also pay for something dealing with The Beverly Hillbillies. He began using his Jethro Bodine role as a marketing opportunity toward the gambling and hotel industry. Baer obtained the sublicensing rights, including food and beverage rights, to The Beverly Hillbillies from CBS in 1991. His business partner estimates the cost of obtaining the rights and developing the ideas has been US$1 million. Sixty-five Beverly Hillbillies slot machines were built in 1999 and placed in 10 casinos.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Suárez {{played down}} the {{incident}}, saying [...] "These are just {{things that happen}} out on the pitch. It was {{just the two of}} us inside the area and he bumped into me with his shoulder", while Chiellini was adamant the incident cost Italy the game, and thought the lack of a red card was part of a conspiracy to keep the best players in the tournament. Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) announced they would be investigating the incident. The Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) attempted to claim that the images of bitemarks on Chiellini's shoulder had been manipulated to appear worse than reality, while Suárez's lawyer Alejandro Balbi claimed that there was a conspiracy between England, Italy and Brazil for Suárez and Uruguay to be severely punished, a sentiment Uruguay manager Óscar Tabárez agreed with, saying [...] "If the referee did not see anything, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> But Suárez is the target of some British press anyway". It was compared to Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Marco Materazzi at the 2006 World Cup, however Zidane was shown a red card while Suárez did not go into the book.|$|E

60|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{ordinary}} hour for rising, an order was issued by Captain Hubbell, and enforced by Samuel Block, {{that no one}} should be allowed to come on deck who had not eaten breakfast. There were those on board that vessel who would have stayed on deck during all the hours which should have been devoted to sleeping, had it not been so cold. There would probably be <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> when they reached the pole, but they wanted to be on hand, that they might see for themselves that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{unemployed}} waiter {{was on the}} house-steps, looking about him--with <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> He {{made his}} bow to Mrs. Vimpany, and informed her that the landlady had gone out.|$|E
