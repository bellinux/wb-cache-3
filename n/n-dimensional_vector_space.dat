When it is of the form M × Rn, then the tangent bundle is said to be trivial. Trivial tangent bundles usually occur for manifolds equipped with a 'compatible group structure'; for instance, in the case where the manifold is a Lie group. The tangent bundle of the unit circle is trivial because it is a Lie group (under multiplication and its natural differential structure). It is not true however that all spaces with trivial tangent bundles are Lie groups; manifolds which have a trivial tangent bundle are called parallelizable. Just as manifolds are locally modelled on Euclidean space, tangent bundles are locally modelled on U × Rn, where U is an open subset of Euclidean space.|$|E

2500|$|As was {{mentioned}} above, the matrix p(A) in {{statement of the}} theorem is obtained by first evaluating the determinant and then substituting the matrix A for t; doing that substitution into the matrix [...] before evaluating the determinant is not meaningful. Nevertheless, {{it is possible to}} give an interpretation where p(A) is obtained directly as the value of a certain determinant, but this requires a more complicated setting, one of matrices over a ring in which one can interpret both the entries [...] of A, and all of A itself. One could take for this the ring M(n, R) of n×n matrices over R, where the entry [...] is realised as , and A as itself. But considering matrices with matrices as entries might cause confusion with block matrices, which is not intended, as that gives the wrong notion of determinant (recall that the determinant of a matrix is defined as a sum of products of its entries, {{and in the case of}} a block matrix this is generally not the same as the corresponding sum of products of its blocks!). It is clearer to distinguish A from the endomorphism φ of an <b>n-dimensional</b> <b>vector</b> <b>space</b> V (or free R-module if R is not a field) defined by it in a basis e1, ..., e'n, and to take matrices over the ring End(V) of all such endomorphisms. Then φ ∈ End(V) is a possible matrix entry, while A designates the element of M(n, End(V)) whose i,j entry is endomorphism of scalar multiplication by similarly I'n will be interpreted as element of M(n, End(V)). However, since End(V) is not a commutative ring, no determinant is defined on M(n, End(V)); this can only be done for matrices over a commutative subring of End(V). Now the entries of the matrix [...] all lie in the subring R generated by the identity and φ, which is commutative. Then a determinant map M(n, R) → R is defined, and [...] evaluates to the value p(φ) of the characteristic polynomial of A at φ (this holds independently of the relation between A and φ); the Cayley–Hamilton theorem states that p(φ) is the null endomorphism.|$|E
