25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{is named}} after The Great Gatsby, a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. <b>Nobody</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> when or how the concept came about (even though many falsely laid {{claim to be the}} originators because of its popularity) except that it originated in various factories in and around in the 70s. It is believed that the workers from factories in and around Cape Town would share lunches and thus created sandwiches from whatever they had for lunch that day. As the French loaf allowed for extra filling space, they would prefer to use these over traditional bread slices that way it could also be easier shared amongst co-workers. A Gatsby is thus better enjoyed when shared and best served in its largest form.|$|E
500|$|The Margaritaville blender itself {{served as}} a metaphor for {{consumerism}} and the tendency of Americans to buy luxuries that they do not need. Stone said, [...] "We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It {{was one of those things}} where we all screwed up and <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> what's going on, but it has something to do with buying shit like Margaritavilles." [...] The Margaritaville also serves {{as a metaphor for}} the housing bubble. Parker himself actually owns a Margaritaville, of which he said, [...] "It's pretty stupid because it really is just a blender".|$|E

[...] Was the explosive eruption of Meager Mountain the last gasp of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt or {{only the most}} recent event in its on-going life? The short answer is <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> for sure. So just in case I sometimes do a quick check of the old hot-spots when I get off the Peak Chair.|$|E

[...] Recent seismic imaging from Geological Survey of Canada employees supported lithoprobe studies {{in the region of}} Mount Cayley in which scientists found a large reflector interpreted to be a pool of molten rock roughly [...] below the surface. The existence of hot springs at Mount Meager and Mount Cayley indicates that magmatic heat is still present beneath or near these volcanoes. This long history of volcanic activity along a still active plate boundary indicates that volcanic eruptions in the Garibaldi Belt have not ended and risks for future eruptions remain.|$|E

We thought that we were going into another Korean War, but this was a different country. Secondly, we didn't know our South Vietnamese allies… And we knew less about North Vietnam. Who was Ho Chi Minh? <b>Nobody</b> <b>really</b> <b>knew.</b> So, until we know the enemy and know our allies and know ourselves, we'd better keep out of this kind of dirty business.

[...] President Ronald Reagan coined the term [...] "Vietnam Syndrome" [...] to describe the reluctance of the American public and politicians to support further international interventions after Vietnam.|$|R

In life, Jamie {{was in love with}} Adam, but thought the love unrequited. Over time, Adam admits that he had noticed Jamie in life but had never pursued friendship on any level. In death, Jamie finds the courage to court Adam. Adam and Jamie begin a loving but platonic relationship, which is complicated by their outside relationships in the spirit and material worlds.|$|R

[...] The Penguin Guide to Jazz remarks that Echo is [...] "a swirling, all-in blast that palls very quickly."

Still, The Penguin Guide says that [...] "this is a historical document, hard to listen to now."

We were pleasantly surprised when our email inboxes started to fill with articles from around the world and from different mathematical areas. We were even happier when we learned that the quality of the contributions was very high. Although, truth to be told, sometimes we were completely at a loss at first when we needed to find a suitable referee. As in all cases, only a part of the contributions could be published. Those are found in this book. We hope you enjoy reading the result. The financial help from our sponsors cannot be thanked enough. Without their support this event would still be just a dream.

50|$|Kalākaua {{was a man}} {{of searching}} intelligence, who sought to enhance Hawaii's {{position}} among nations. He was fascinated with scientific advancements, and sought spiritual knowledge without limitations to any particular faith. The king was also someone who made errors of judgement in choosing his friends and advisors, a liability that helped lead to a new constitution. Caesar Celso Moreno, while ingratiating his way into Kalākaua's favor, also made several attempts at manipulating the legislature into passing bills that would financially benefit himself. The king also chose Jewish immigrant Elias Abraham Rosenberg as his personal kahuna, and named him to several low-level government positions. There were rumors about Rosenberg's background, but <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> much about him. He specialized in reading the king's horoscope while he taught him Hebrew. Many in Kalākaua's inner circle, Gibson in particular, viewed Rosenberg with suspicion and deemed him to be nothing more than a fortune teller. Rosenberg left Hawaii three weeks before the forced change in the constitution.|$|R

She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> who I was.

I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life.

Mike doesn't remember Carlos at all, but Carlos tells him they were best friends, so Mike lets him stay.

Mike asks his two best friends what he was like before the accident, and they say that he was very secretive and <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> him that well. When Mike catches Detective Ridley and his work partner, Detective Shrank, spying on him, he tells them to leave him alone. Detective Ridley tells Mike that the only piece of evidence they have yet to find to prosecute him for Monique's murder is the toolbox containing the wrench Mike is accused of killing her with.

5000|$|The {{users of}} Dumpert are called [...] "reaguurders". Reaguurders {{make fun of}} {{themselves}} by saying they are pathetic, lonely, and still living with their parents.

Most people consider this is as a waste of time. The comments posted by reaguurders are called [...] "reaguursels". The word [...] "reaguurder" [...] is a portmanteau of the Dutch noun reageerder (meaning someone who reacts/comments) and the adjective guur (meaning cold/unfriendly).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} paper is to study and analyze the criticism expressed by Montaigne on different doxic themes that pervade the social discourse of his time. To do so, we consider two problems connected and coextensive to {{the second part of}} the XVI century. The first one that extends over the first two chapters analyzes the way by which the religious wars of the era have found their justification in God. In the first chapter, we try to analyze the discursive vector of the divine ire whereas in the second chapter, we investigate the relationship between the tide of a battle and the elect sign that is supposed to give to the winner. The second problem, that deals with various attempts of pacification, forms the third chapter of this paper. It focuses on the efforts undertaken by some "well intentioned" jurists to end "fratricidal" wars by royal by-laws (edits) whose unfortunate results are to stir up hatred among different ideological factions. The fourth chapter is a reflection on some criticism stated by XVI century thinkers who perceived actual wars as lacking religious foundation, and even as a carnage where <b>nobody</b> <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> why the fighting was going on. Finally, we put forward some hypotheses on the specificity of the Essais in the sociodiscursive context of this age...|$|R
