5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{well-known}} {{problem with}} student surveys is a too low response rate. Experiences with predicting electoral outcomes, which required much smaller sample sizes, inspired us {{to adopt a}} similar approach to course evaluation. We expected that having respondents estimate the average opinions of their peers required fewer respondents for comparable outcomes than giving own opinions. METHODS: Two course evaluation studies were performed among successive first-year medical students (N = 380 and 450, respectively). Study 1 : Half the cohort gave opinions on nine questions, while the other half predicted the average outcomes. A prize was offered for the three best predictions (motivational remedy). Study 2 : Half the cohort gave opinions, a quarter made predictions without a prize and a quarter made predictions with previous year's results as prior knowledge (cognitive remedy). The <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> required for stable outcomes were determined following an iterative process. Differences between <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> required and between average scores were analysed with ANOVA. RESULTS: In both studies, the prediction conditions required significantly fewer respondents (p < 0. 001) for comparable outcomes. The informed prediction condition required the fewest respondents (N < 20). CONCLUSION: Problems with response rates can be reduced by asking respondents to predict evaluation outcomes rather than giving opinions...|$|R
