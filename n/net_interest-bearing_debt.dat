In its cur- rent state, ecological monetary economics is at odds with post-Keynesian economics in its analysis of the money– growth relationship.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} religion on the earnings management practices and capital structure of Malaysian firms. While prior studies have been useful in identifying economic factors affecting earnings management and capital structure decisions, the prior research has ignored cultural factors generally and religion specifically. My study attempts to augment this research by investigating whether religion, a non-economic motive, has any influence on management decisions related to earnings management and capital structure. In particular, I contrast the behaviour of Muslim and non-Muslim managers in Malaysia. Because Islam discourages <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debts,</b> I first hypothesise that Muslim managed firms use less <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debts</b> and preference shares relative to straight equity than the non-Muslim managed firms. Using a sample of 1607 firm-year observations over the period 1987 - 1998 {{and a series of}} univariate and multivariate analyses, I find that the firms' capital structure decisions are not influenced by the religious orientation of their managers. This suggests that Muslim managers and non-Muslim managers behave alike when making capital financing decisions. While this is contrary to expectations, a possible reason for this finding is that Islamic debt instruments were only available after 1991, and Muslim managed firms that had already issued ordinary debt capital were not able to switch to Islamic debt within the timeframe covered by the study. Another possible reason is that Muslim managers do not adhere strictly to the teachings of Islam and are influenced by the Western economic system. Second, I establish the argument that Islam prohibits earnings management practices and hypothesise that Muslim managed firms are less likely to manage earnings than their non-Muslim counterparts. I analyse the data from 170 Malaysian firms listed on the KLSE since 1980 using four common earnings management detecting models, i. e., the Healy, DeAngelo, Jones, and Modified Jones models. The results of the univariate and multivariate analysis are mixed. Tests using the Healy model provide some support for the earnings management hypothesis while the others do not. However, on balance, I conclude that religion does not affect the earnings management practices of Malaysian firms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} the role interest {{has played in}} the modern financial system, highlighting the money creation process in particular and the key questions that arise within Islamic Finance as a result. The paper contends that the legalisation of interest built the foundations for much of our modern day financial architecture with the modus operandi of commercial banking being its central element. As a result, money today is mainly created as <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debt</b> {{with a host of}} associated consequences. Among these are an artificial economy of scarcity, endemic debt pressure, constant inflation, wealth polarisation, an ever present risk of default, and the environmentally irreconcilable paradigm of perpetual growth. Consequentially the interest-based modern financial system has seemingly set the world on a path necessitating an incessant demand to privatise, commoditise, and monetise ever increasing amounts of the earth’s resources, causing us to live in an age where finance 1, energy 2, health care 3, and the ecosystem 4 are reportedly headed towards imminent collapse. The question for Islamic finance practitioners is whether their discipline as currently practiced is actually providing a solution towards tackling these crises, or whether it is instead normalising the problems within an “Islamic ” framework...|$|R
40|$|Reforms {{have begun}} in Pakistan {{to sustain the}} funded pension scheme for government-operated pension schemes such as the Employees Old Age Benefit Institution (EOBI).

The public sector's domestic debt was substantial, however, {{and the high}} interest rates drove the public sector's interest bill considerably above its non-interest surplus. The public sector could therefore cover its interest bill only by taking on additional debt. Because the interest bill was so large, domestic debt grew rapidly. Hyperinflation resulted when the outstanding debt became larger than domestic financial markets could be persuaded to hold. The Central Bank played a focal role in these processes. It issued <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debt</b> in the forms of remunerated bank reserves,"inaccesible deposits,"and Central Bank bills, to absorb money. The interest bill on these liabilities generated mounting"quasi-fiscal"borrowing requirements, which the Central Bank financed through additional debt issues. This debt was held mainly by commercial banks who financed themselves through high-yielding short-term deposits. Hyperinflationary pressure developed when depositors, perceiving that the Central Bank's debt accumulation was becoming excessive, withdrew and moved rapidly into foreign exchange, engendering heavy devaluation pressure.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} long-run impact of fiscal {{policies}} on inflation and capital formation. The analysis uses an expanded monetary growth {{model in which}} the government finances its deficit by issueing both money and <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debt.</b> One major focus of the paper is the effect of a permanent increase in the government's rea ~ defic~t in a fully employed economy. The analysis shows that a greater deficit must increase inflation, reduce capital forma-tion, or both. With U. S. tax rules and the prevailing monetary and debt-management policies, a greater deficit is likely to cause both more inflation and lower capital intensity. The second purpose of the paper is to analyze the effect of an exogenous increase in the saving rate and the possibility of "excessive saving " that arises when the yield on capital becomes so low that individuals prefer to hold government bonds rather than the more risky claims to real capital. Under some such conditions, an increase in saving could cause unemployment. The analysis shows that this problem can be avoided however by reducing the tax on capital income (or, in some cases, by an increased deficit that absorbs some but not all of the higher savings rate). In short, by using fiscal incentives as well as monetary accomodation, an increased saving rate can be converted to greater capital intensity...|$|R

40|$|Argentina has had {{a quarter}} century without growth {{at a time of}} rapid {{economic}} growth {{in the rest of the}} world. This paper looks at the role that public sector behavior, particularly government spending, taxation and deficit financing, may have had on the economic stagnation in Argentina. Government spending declined when the final crisis of the Argentine economy began in 1982, but more because of resource constraints than deliberate political action. The government ran a primary deficit every year from 1961 to 1989, so it issued money and <b>interest-bearing</b> <b>debt.</b> As a result, the economy experienced high real interest rates and inflation. Despite heavy fiscal pressure, fiscal spending has continued to grow, systematically exceeding revenues. From 1964 to 1975, the deficit was financed by creating money; with the fall of Peron and the beginning of a military regime, debt financing became significant. The regression study in this report shows that every 1 percent of primary deficit is financed with 0. 7 percent of revenue from creating money. Public debt plays a peculiar role in Argentina's finances. The central bank has become the chief borrower of about 80 percent of the private banks'lending power. In this context, a policy of tight money to reduce aggregate demand basically increases the transfers from the public to the private sector because of the higher deficit that the rise in interest rates generates.

In Australia, for example, there is currently 42. 5 billion worth of outstanding debt on credit cards, with 30 billion (over 70 per cent) bearing interest.
