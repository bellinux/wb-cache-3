50|$|Latch and Batchelor: Founded by Mr Arthur Latch, Mr Telford Clarence Batchelor and Mr Henry Herbert Horsfall {{to develop}} Mr Batchelorâ€™s patent of Locked Coil Wire Rope and Flattened Strand, it {{was formed in}} 1884 on part of the Hay Mills site owned at that time by Webster and Horsfall Ltd. Due to its smooth outer layer Locked Coil became {{increasing}} popular with its use in aerial ropeways and its unexpected yet excellent <b>non-spinning</b> <b>properties</b> and high breaking-strength-to-weight ratio were recognized by the mining industry and adopted worldwide. Locked Coil development continued {{with the advent of}} the half-lock Colliery Guide ropes and more use being made of galvanized wires. The company was one of the first to come under direct Government control in both World Wars. In the 1914-18 war they were the sole manufacturer of shell fuse spring wire, for example, producing 80,260 miles, along with anti-submarine netting, mine, aircraft and balloon cables.|$|E
