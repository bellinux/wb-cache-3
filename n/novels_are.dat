5|$|On {{the other}} hand, L. Sprague de Camp {{considered}} Morris's fantasies {{to be not}} wholly successful, partly because Morris eschewed many literary techniques from later eras. In particular, De Camp argued the plots of the <b>novels</b> <b>are</b> heavily driven by coincidence; while many things just happened in the romances, the <b>novels</b> <b>are</b> still weakened by the dependence on it. Nevertheless, large subgenres {{of the field of}} fantasy have sprung from the romance genre, but indirectly, through their writers' imitation of William Morris.|$|E
5|$|The {{reception}} {{history of}} Jane Austen follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity. Jane Austen (1775–1817), {{the author of}} such works as Pride and Prejudice (1813) and Emma (1815), {{has become one of}} the best-known and most widely read novelists in the English language.

5|$|A {{self-described}} anarchist, Baker {{has been}} categorized {{as a writer}} of transgressional fiction, in that his <b>novels</b> <b>are</b> frequently populated by sociopathic, nihilistic characters who engage in taboo behaviors such as heavy drug use, incest, necrophilia and other practices; and often commit acts of extreme, surrealistic violence. A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust to Jim Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also admired the punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E

5|$|The Miller {{brothers}} {{wrote the}} entire first novel, but were unsatisfied with the result; the Millers {{pointed out that}} writing a character for a novel is much harder than writing the characters of a game. Hyperion recruited author David Wingrove {{to assist with the}} project; the Millers ended up giving Wingrove a detailed draft, and the author rewrote the entire book. The book's design was made to fit the themes of the game; the <b>novels</b> <b>are</b> made to look like journals found in Myst, with embossed covers and pages darkened as though with time and use.|$|E

5|$|The {{video games}} provide the {{canonical}} {{story of the}} series. The manga series is adapted by Shiro Amano and the <b>novels</b> <b>are</b> written by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. The stories follow the events {{that take place in}} the video games with differences to account for the loss of interactivity that a video game provides.

The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Square's Monthly Shonen Gangan, but has since been released worldwide.

5|$|Leo {{spent three}} years in prison, until {{released}} and restored to his rank in late July 886. Here too Zaoutzes played a major role, as he personally pleaded with the Byzantine emperor to secure Leo's release. By that time, Basil was ailing, and on August 12, 886, he was gravely wounded during a hunt. Zaoutzes's participation in the hunt raised suspicions of a conspiracy, but his complicity is generally rejected, as Basil survived for nine days, during {{which he did not}} punish Zaoutzes. Upon Basil's death, Leo was crowned emperor, but Zaoutzes, who was awarded the titles of patrikios and magistros and the office of logothetes tou dromou, effectively assumed control of the government, directing state policy. One tradition, based on the Vita Euthymii (the hagiography of Patriarch Euthymios I), holds that Basil himself appointed Zaoutzes as regent (epitropos), but other sources indicate that his ascent to power was more gradual. It is indicative of his authority that most of Leo's ordinances (<b>novels)</b> <b>are</b> directed to him in person, and in 893, he succeeded in getting his protégé, Antony Kauleas, elected as Patriarch of Constantinople. In the same period (between 886 and 893), Emperor Leo VI himself delivered a homily on a church built on Zaoutzes's orders in Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Over {{a four-month}} period, Berkley Books {{published}} three young adult novels written by Kelly O'Rourke; the <b>novels</b> <b>are</b> original stories created by O'Rourke, with no direct continuity with the films.

The Old Myers Place is the second novel, released December 1, 1997, and focuses on Mary White, who moves into the Myers house with her family. Michael returns home and begins stalking and attacking Mary and her friends. O'Rourke's final novel, The Mad House, was released on February 1, 1998.

5|$|The {{two films}} most {{commonly}} compared to Greed are Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being {{lost in the}} desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. The Magnificent Ambersons and Greed both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. Ambersons was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that Greed influenced the methods in which <b>novels</b> <b>are</b> adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to {{the intentions of the}} original novels. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film Greedy pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.|$|E
