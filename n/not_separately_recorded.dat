40|$|Report of TAC 65 held at IFPRI, Washington D. C., October 17 - 22, 1995, Alex McCalla presiding. Ismail Serageldin, Chairman of the CGIAR, {{informed}} TAC about MTM 94, and {{the agenda}} for ICW 94. He said TAC would {{play a major role}} in a restructured CGIAR. TAC decided to develop a new priority report as a basis for allocating resources during 1999 - 2003, and priority considerations for 1996 - 1998. Two TAC sub-committees were asked to report at TAC 65 on the structure and composition of the proposed matrix of CGIAR programs. TAC provided guidance for the revision of a draft report on CGIAR regional commitments in West Africa. It considered a paper on CGIAR review processes which focused on the role of internal review processes at IARCs and discussed the status of a number of center and stripe reviews. A draft strategy paper prepared by a center directors committee on information in the CGIAR would, TAC concluded, require radical revision in the CGIAR mode of operation, and the creation of an inter-center working group. TAC offered an interim commentary for use by the center directors in revising the paper. In a joint session with center directors, TAC discussed issues on systemwide and ecoregional activities arising from a report prepared after a special meeting of TAC in August 1994. (This meeting was <b>not</b> <b>separately</b> <b>recorded.)</b> In addition to the general discussion, the report of TAC 65 contains exchanges between centers and TAC on seven proposed activities. TAC accepted a draft paper on the future CGIAR research agenda prepared for the ministerial level meeting, and agreed to consider post harvest technology in its next round of priority setting. It considered that the proposals of a workshop held at Zschortau, Germany, on soil, water, and nutrient management were covered by the existing list of systemwide and ecoregional initiatives...|$|E

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This report {{provides}} data {{on some of}} {{the major}} changes in, and major issues around, the Australian public housing system over recent decades. The public housing sector has gone through major transformations in recent decades. Its original broad roles encompassing working family affordability, urban renewal, economic development, and decentralisation have narrowed in focus to serve as a housing safety net for high needs households. Changes in funding levels, ineligibility and allocations policy and asset management strategies have been major contributors to the recasting of the role of public housing, along with a paradigm shift in public policy from broad universalistic models of service delivery to highly targeted welfare models. These changes have major implications for what, where, and how much social housing is built and for the socio-economic attributes of tenants. The changes have, among other things, also put on the policy agenda issues of the potential role of public housing in accentuating employment problems for tenants, accentuating social disadvantage and the viability of the public housing system. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data, notably census data and the Survey of Income and Housing (SIH) can provide rich data that can help get a better understanding of what has happened to public housing and what might be the implications of changes in this tenure. This paper uses the release of the 201 1 ABS census results and other recent ABS data sets to address the research questions of: 	What have been the major changes in public housing supply over the past 30 years (1981 – 2011), and how have these played out geographically? 	What have been the major c hanges in the attributes of tenants (income, household type, employment status, age, etc.) over the past 30 years? 	What does the census data tell us about the need for public and or social housing? The 30 -year period has been chosen as it marks the transit ion from one model of public housing, that is a more universalistic model, to a welfare delivery model. For much of the analysis census data was customised to include a number of demographic and dwelling characteristics by tenure {{for each of the three}} census years, for Australia and for the six state capitals. The paper is about public housing only. Social housing, which sweeps up all forms of not-for-profit housing, both public and community managed, is not the focus of this study as community-managed stock in earlier census periods was so small as not to need an identifier in the Census and therefore was <b>not</b> <b>separately</b> <b>recorded...</b>|$|E

Barnards Green experienced a further population boost in 1942 when the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) relocated to Malvern to occupy a site having two of its main entrances in the Barnards Green area. In the early 1950s the construction of the large Pound Bank council estate led to an increase in the population, and to the commercial activity in the shopping centre.

25|$|The {{exact number}} of Alawites in Turkey is unknown; there were 700,000 in 1970, {{suggesting}} about 1,500,000 in 2009.

In the 1965 census (the last Turkish census where informants were asked their mother tongue), 700,000 {{people in the}} three provinces declared their mother tongue as Arabic; however, Arabic-speaking Sunnis and Christians were also included in this figure. Turkish Alawites traditionally speak the same dialect of Levantine Arabic as Syrian Alawites. Arabic is preserved in rural communities and in Samandağ. Younger people in the cities of Çukurova and İskenderun tend to speak Turkish. The Turkish spoken by Alawites is distinguished by its accents and vocabulary. Knowledge of the Arabic alphabet is confined to religious leaders and men who have worked or studied in Arab countries.|$|R
5000|$|Croats {{were first}} {{noticeable}} in Australia during the gold rushes of the 1850s {{in the province}} of Victoria.

By Australian federation in 1901, there were many Croats—mainly from Dalmatia—in Australia, counted with Czechs, Hungarians, Serbs, Slovaks and others as [...] "Austro-Hungarians". The establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes from Austria-Hungary after the First World War—renamed to Yugoslavia shortly afterwards—continued to make it difficult to separate out Croats from other ethnicities in Australia. Croats were <b>not</b> <b>recorded</b> <b>separately</b> until the 1996 Census.

50|$|Inoffensive towards humans, the crested {{bullhead}} shark is {{of little}} interest to recreational or commercial fisheries. It is seldom caught on hook-and-line. Commercial bottom trawl prawn fisheries operating off Queensland and New South Wales take this species as bycatch; {{the impact of these}} activities on the population is uncertain as this species is <b>not</b> <b>recorded</b> <b>separately</b> from the Port Jackson shark. However, most bullhead sharks caught in these fisheries survive to be released alive. Crested bullhead sharks are likely also caught in mesh shark nets used to protect beaches; again, most are able to survive the experience. Because of the limited mortality suffered by this species from various human activities, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, albeit also recommending that it be carefully monitored given its restricted distribution and overall uncommonness. The range of the crested bullhead shark overlaps with several marine protected areas; additionally, it was listed as a declared animal in Schedule 3 of the 1997 Queensland Marine Parks (Moreton Bay) Zoning Plan, which regulates its collection in Moreton Bay Marine Park.|$|R

This research revealed national contrasts with coppice highly valued, commercially and for ecosystem services, in some countries {{while there is a}} policy of conversion to high forest in others.

Not all policy documents mention coppice, although it is implicit in references to sustainable forest management. Factors influencing the persistence of coppice as a viable management practice and barriers to development are explored. The perspectives of different stakeholders, owners, workforce, and end users, are considered as well as supply chain and market factors. Potential interventions are evaluated to assess effectiveness in different legislative contexts. This enables an integrated perspective to be formulated on the future ecological, economic and social challenges for the European forest sector, with recommendations for future policy...|$|R

40|$|TerraSAR-X is {{the first}} German Radar {{satellite}} for scientific and commercial applications. The project is a public-private partnership between DLR and EADS Astrium GmbH. TerraSAR-X consists of a high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar at X-Band. The radar antenna is based on active phased array technology that allows the control of many different instrument parameters and operational modes (Stripmap, ScanSAR and Spotlight) with various polarizations. The TerraSAR-X launch was the 15 June 2007. Only 4 days later the first image was delivered. The variety of TerraSAR-X polarization modes is reviewed and validation results of each mode are presented. The polarization modes include operational modes like dual-pol in Stripmap and Spotlight. Additionally there are experimental modes like twin polarization mode {{which is similar to}} the ASAR alternating polarization mode, or the full polarimetric mode which is realized in the TerraSAR-X Dual Receive Antenna configuration. The Dual Receiving Antenna Mode (DRA) of TerraSAR-X offers a high variety of interesting applications and experiments, e. g. along track interferometry, geometric resolution enhancement and especially the full polarimetric mode. In the DRA mode of TerraSAR-X, the complete antenna is used for transmission but in receive, the antenna is divided into two separate partitions in along track. The signals of both receiving antennas are <b>recorded</b> <b>separately</b> by exploiting the redundant receiver chain of the instrument. Both signals are <b>not</b> <b>recorded</b> <b>separately</b> but as sum and difference signal. This demands for special calibration in the reconstruction of fore and aft channel before SAR processing and has influence on the polarimetric performance. The paper provides a selection of TS-X images acquired in different polarization modes and thus demonstrates the polarimetric capabilities of TerraSAR-X. ...|$|R
