40|$|A Cross-National Analysis ABSTRACT. This paper {{presents}} stylized {{facts about}} the effect of children on <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and its components (the “income package”) in nine OECD countries, employing data from the Luxembourg Income Study database. We find that crossnational differences in the impact of children on <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> are substantial and systematic. Speaking generally, we find that cross-national differences in the impact of children on <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> are determined largely by the differences in the impact of children on household earnings, particularly women’s earnings. We also find that countries with a generous fiscal treatment of households with children are also countries in which the effect of children on earnings is most negative. I. Introduction. What happens to a <b>household’s</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> when a first child, or an additional child, is added? The most obvious impact is on the earnings of parents. An initial parental leave may or may not affect earnings, depending on the worker’s benefit package and the length of the leave. After that, some parents may substitute childcare for earnings b...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{household}} debt in both {{developed and developing}} countries have been increasing. With {{an increase in the}} standard of living, household debt is also bound to increase. This paper examines the cointergation and causal link among <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>household</b> savings, debt service ratio, lending interest rate, consumer price index and household debt in South Africa. An Autoregressive Distributed Lag and Granger causality techniques was used to analyse data collected from the South African Reserve Bank and Quantec from 1984 to 2014. The results of Autoregressive Distributed Lag test revealed cointegrating relationships between household debt and debt service ratio as well as household debt and lending interest rate. However, there is no long run cointegrating relationship between <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>household</b> savings and consumer price index with household debt. The Granger causality results revealed that <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> <b>household</b> savings, debt service ratio, lending interest rate, consumer price index do Granger cause household debt in South Africa. Policy makers should thus target these variables in order to reduce household debt in South Afric...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{growth in}} the {{unsecured}} lending market and the bankruptcy of African Bank Investments Limited have brought to light concerns regarding credit extension {{and the level of}} household indebtedness in South Africa. This study seeks to investigate the relevant aspects of credit extension in both the secured and unsecured lending markets by firstly analysing contemporary literature and then conducting a more formal empirical analysis. A VAR model is estimated to examine the effects <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and interest rates have on the level of household debt in South Africa for the period 1995 Q 1 - 2015 Q 3. The empirical results indicate that there is no significant deterministic relationship between <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and <b>household</b> debt. However, the results show that such a relationship does exist between interest rate and household debt. Finally, impulse response functions obtained from the VAR estimation are examined which indicate that both shocks too <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and interest rates effect the level of household debt, but that this effect returns to equilibrium within six periods...|$|R
30|$|The cross wage {{elasticity}} of married women (in the joint decision model) is negative and increasing in <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income.</b> By contrast, the cross wage {{elasticity of}} married men is positive and increasing in <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income.</b> It {{is estimated to}} be 0.134, on average, for men (about a fourth of the corresponding own wage elasticity) and - 0.055 for women. This means that a 10 percent increase in spousal wage causes a 1.34 percent increase in husband’s participation rate and a 0.55 percent decrease in wife’s participation rate. Hence, changes in wage differences in the family may lead to within-household divergence in participation.|$|R

30|$|<b>Household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> is {{affected}} by six factors: labor income, household capital income, household business operating surplus, income tax payment, net social security payment, and other transfers received by the household. From the adjusted flow of funds table, {{we find that the}} changes of these factors are all in the direction of reducing the share of <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> in GDP; that is, the shares in GDP of labor income, household capital income, household business operating surplus, and other transfers received by the household all declined, and the shares in GDP of individual income tax payment and net social security payment both increased. The most important factor is the decline of the labor income share.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the sensitivity of}} the <b>household's</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> with respect to the labour market states and the labour market transitions of unemployed workers. The paper analyses the following questions: (i) which are the determinants of starting wages? (ii) how many unemployed are in the unemployment trap? (iii) how do economic incentives affect the conditional probability of finding a job? (iv) how sensitive are answers to above questions with respect to business cycle? The empirical analysis is based on the individual panel data covering the years 1987 - 1993, when the unemployment rate rose from about 4 % to 18 %. We have estimated the starting wage equation to calculate the effects of hypothetical re-employment on the <b>household's</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> and to evaluate the frequency of the unemployment trap. To analyse factors affecting the transition out of unemployment to employment in open labour market, we estimate unemployment duration using a semi-parametric proportional risk model. The paper shows that the impact of the economic incentives, measured by the hypothetical change in <b>household's</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income,</b> on re-employment is more important in the recession than in the boom.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the saving {{mobility}} of Polish households, e. g. {{the mobility of}} households between classes of different saving rates. The analysis {{is based on the}} household budget panel data of 3001 Polish households surveyed in the same month during four consecutive years. The panel sample group was selected by authors from 30 000 households' surveyed by Polish Central Statistical Office each year. We apply the Markov mobility matrices. The long term ergodic structure of households with regard to saving rates is estimated. It illustrates the probability of a household to fall into one of the saving rates range. Our results show that during four consecutive years (1997 - 2000), one third of the households which saved less than 20 % of the <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> remained in their class. In the class of households that saved more than 20 % of the <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income</b> half of the households kept these high saving rates. In the long term, the probability of falling into a group of households with lowest saving is 0. 2. Groups falling into - 20 % to - 5 % and - 5 % to 5 % saving rates would be the least numerous. The highest probability (0. 3) was to get into a group that saved more than 20 % of the <b>household</b> <b>disposable</b> <b>income.</b> It shows the tendency towards polarization of the households with regard to saving rates. ...|$|R
