Among them, the unordered logit, ordered logit models, and their variations {{are the most}} often used models. Savolainen et al.

As presented in the paper, ordered logit and probit, multinomial logit, binary logit and binary probit, and nested logit are some of the frequently used statistical methodologies. In particular, logistic regression has been widely applied to model crash severity levels. Variables such as elements of geometric design, traffic operational measures, and environmental conditions are considered as independent variables to estimate the severity. In particular, {{it is important to note}} that modeling ordinal outcome-dependent variable using <b>nominal</b> <b>variable</b> will lead to loss of efficiency as a result of ignoring information.

40|$|Abstract. A recent {{observational}} study {{is used to}} illustrate two recent methodolog-ical proposals, namely optimal matching with 8 ̆ 5 ne balance and sensitivity analysis for uncommon but dramatic responses to treatment. 1. Matching with Fine Balance 1. 1. What is 8 ̆ 5 ne balance? Fine balance constrains an optimal match to exactly balance the marginal distributions of a <b>nominal</b> <b>variable,</b> perhaps one with many levels, placing no restrictions on who is matched to whom. The <b>nominal</b> <b>variable</b> might have many categories, like zip code, or the direct product of several nominal variables. Propensity scores balance covariates stochastically, but this may be inadequate for a <b>nominal</b> <b>variable</b> with many levels. Use in conjunction with calipers on the propensity score, a version of a Mahalanobis distance, possibly penalties for additional constraints. 1. 2. How do you construct an optimal 8 ̆ 5 nely balanced match? The assignment algorithm [2] takes a matrix of distances and 8 ̆ 5 nds the pairing of rows and columns that minimizes the total distance within pairs. The problem is not trivial because two rows may want the same column. For an nn matrix, {{it is possible to}} solve the optimal assignment problem in O n 3 arithmetic operations, which is the same order as for multiplying two n n matrices in the conventional way. In R, the pairmatch function in Ben Hansons [5] optmatch package solves the assignment problem. In SAS OR, proc assign solves the assignment problem. Hansens optmatch package calls Bertsekas [2] Fortran code. To construct a 8 ̆ 5 nely balanced match, the distance matrix is patterned {{in such a way that}} the proper numbers of controls are deleted. Proposition 1 in [12] shows that this procedure produces a minimum distance match subject to the constraint that 8 ̆ 5 ne balance is achieved. A toy example is given in the other handout.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an alternative {{view to the}} Real and New Keynesian business cycle theories. The paper focuses on the combination of both real and <b>nominal</b> <b>variables</b> in explaining the cyclical movements of business cycles. We propose using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) technique on the production function approach in order to empirically assess {{the relative importance of}} both real and <b>nominal</b> <b>variables</b> in defining the shape of a business cycle (or output gap). An economy-specific variable (inflation) is introduced in the production function and is used to control the severity, persistence and magnitude of a given real shock. The model employed is tested in four countries namely: United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany. The results show that indeed real and <b>nominal</b> <b>variables</b> play an important and major role in explaining movements in business fluctuations. The bulk of impulse responses given a real shock to the output gap may also be attributed to movements in <b>nominal</b> <b>variables</b> mainly as a result of inflationary movements. This economy specific parameter conveys the same message that Ragnar Frisch hypothesized in 1933 based on his ‘rocking-horse theory’. The paper thus provides policy makers to identify key choice variables to use when reducing the impact of shocks in a given economy within a specified period of time. ...|$|R

Variance decompositions reveal that among the real variables that determine the real exchange rate, the terms of trade and productivity explain much {{of the variation in}} the real exchange rates.

40|$|One of {{the oldest}} and most useful ideas in {{economics}} is the quantity theory of money. The quantity theory explains the determination of variables measured in dollars such as the price level. Modern expositions of the quantity theory assume that the monetary authority controls directly a reserve aggregate like the monetary base (currency plus bank deposits with the monetary authority). In actual practice, however, monetary authorities use an interest rate rather than a reserve aggregate as their policy variable. This fact poses a challenge to the quantity theorist. How does he reconcile his theory with actual policy procedures? There are no modern expositions of the quantity theory that assume interest rate targeting by the monetary authority. This article provides such an exposition. The exposition brings out the standard quantity theory distinction between the determination of the real and nominal quantity of money and explains changes in the price level as equating the nominal demand with the nominal supply of money. Modern expositions of the quantity theory assume reserve control in part because reserve control constitutes a major item on the reform agenda of quantity theorists. Control of reserves and, at one remove, a monetary aggregate constitutes control of a <b>nominal</b> <b>variable</b> and, therefore, draws attention to the responsibility of the monetary authority to control the price level, also a <b>nominal</b> <b>variable.</b> Quantity theorists dislike the interest rate as a policy variable.

The most important of these problems is the generally static nature of institutional explanations. Also, there is a nagging problem of the difficulties in measuring institutional variables in other than simplistic, nominal categories. As well as discussing these problems this paper addresses the static nature of institutional theory by examining the concept of "institutionalization", and the creation (and tearing down) of institutional structures. The paper argues that by considering institutionalization as a continuous variable rather than a <b>nominal</b> <b>variable</b> we can beginto understand better the dynamics of institutions themselves, and therefore also develop better institutional explanations for other social and political phenomena. ...|$|E
