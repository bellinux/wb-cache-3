5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission</b> while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the fisherman, in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E
25|$|The Bible {{has many}} rituals of {{purification}} relating to menstruation, childbirth, sexual relations, <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission,</b> unusual bodily fluids, skin disease, death, and animal sacrifices. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church prescribes {{several kinds of}} hand washing for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal. The women in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives.|$|E
25|$|Orgasms can be {{achieved}} by a variety of activities, including vaginal, anal or oral sex, non-penetrative sex or masturbation. Orgasm may also {{be achieved}} by the use of a sex toy, such as a sensual vibrator or an erotic electrostimulation. It can additionally be achieved by stimulation of the nipples or other erogenous zones, though this is rarer. In addition to physical stimulation, orgasm {{can be achieved}} from psychological arousal alone, such as during dreaming (<b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission</b> for males or females) or by orgasm control. Orgasm by psychological stimulation alone was first reported among people who had spinal cord injury. Although sexual function and sexuality after spinal cord injury is very often impacted, this injury does not deprive one of sexual feelings such as sexual arousal and erotic desires.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> is highly variable. Some {{reported that it}} is due to being sexually inactive {{for a period of}} 1-2 weeks, with no engagement in either intercourse or masturbation. Some males have experienced large numbers of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> as teenagers, while others have never experienced one. In the U.S., 83% of men will experience <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> at some time in their life. For males who have experienced <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> the mean frequency ranges from 0.36 times per week (about once every three weeks) for single 15-year-old males to 0.18 times per week (about once every five-and-a-half weeks) for 40-year-old single males. For married males the mean ranges from 0.23 times per week (about once per month) for 19-year-old married males to 0.15 times per week (about once every two months) for 50-year-old married males. In {{some parts of the world}} <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> are more common. For example, in Indonesia surveys have shown that 97% of men experience <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> by the age of 24.|$|R

2500|$|In men, {{the most}} common way of {{achieving}} orgasm is by physical sexual stimulation of the penis. This is usually accompanied by ejaculation, but it is possible, though also rare, for men to orgasm without ejaculation (known as a [...] "dry orgasm") or to ejaculate without reaching orgasm (which may be a case of delayed ejaculation, a <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission</b> or a case of anorgasmic ejaculation). Men may also achieve orgasm by stimulation of the prostate (see below).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that any Israelite rendered unclean by a <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission</b> had to leave the Israelites military camp, bathe in water toward evening, and reenter the camp at sundown. The Israelites were to designate an area outside the camp where they might relieve themselves, and to carry a spike to dig a hole and cover up their excrement. As God moved about in their camp to protect them, the Israelites were to keep their camp holy. A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|E
50|$|Thirteen {{percent of}} males {{experience}} their first ejaculation {{as a result}} of a <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission.</b> Kinsey found that males experiencing their first ejaculation through a <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission</b> were older than those experiencing their first ejaculation by means of masturbation. The study indicates that such a first ejaculation resulting from a <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission</b> was delayed a year or more from what would have been developmentally possible for such males through physical stimulation.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} in collecting ejaculate produced during nocturnal emissions, relatively {{few studies have examined}} its composition. In the largest study, which included <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission</b> samples from 10 men with idiopathic anejaculation, the semen concentration was equivalent to samples obtained from the same men by penile vibratory stimulation, although the percentage of sperm which were mobile and which were of normal morphology were higher in the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emission</b> specimens.|$|E

Muslim scholars consider ejaculation something that makes one temporarily ritually impure, a condition known as junub; meaning that a Muslim who has had an orgasm or ejaculated must have a ghusl, before they can read the Qur'an or perform the formal prayer known as salat.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is a {{shortage}} of scientific data on the subject of sexuality from Pakistan. We decided to document misconceptions among Pakistani young men, regarding masturbation and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> and to make a case for sex education in the country. Objective: To study the knowledge, attitude and practice of Pakistani young men as regards masturbation and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> and to see any associations with demographic factors like age, marital status, occupation, level of education and socio economic status. Method: A questionnaire was developed, based on the objectives of the study. It was administered to 188 men between the ages 18 - 30 years, who presented to the outpatient department of the Aga Khan University Hospital. There was double entry of the data from questionnaires and the demographic form into the computer program, using the Fox Pro for windows and the SPSS for windows. Results: We found a high prevalence of misconceptions and guilt associated with both these acts. Eighty percent of the respondents had masturbated while a 94 % had experienced <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions.</b> 31. 4 % and 62. 8 % of the respondents reported association of physical illness and weakness with masturbation. Responses were 14. 9 % and 42. 6 % for <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions.</b> Association of guilt with masturbation and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> was 68. 6 % and 32 % respectively. We also studied the association of demographic variables with these prevalence figures, in order to point out areas for future studies and interventions. Conclusion: We have documented the misconceptions regarding masturbation and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>emissions</b> among Pakistani young men and have made a case for sex education of our youth (JPMA 49 : 251, 1999) ...|$|R
