5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{the only}} member of the family thought to be able to beget children. His wife gave birth to a posthumous son in September, Henry, Duke of Bordeaux, nicknamed Dieudonné (God-given) by the Bourbons because he was thought to have secured the future of the dynasty. However the Bourbon {{succession}} was still in doubt. The Chamber of Deputies proposed amending Salic law to allow the Duchess of Angoulême to accede to the throne. On 12 June 1820, the Chambers ratified legislation that increased the number of deputies from 258 to 430. The extra deputies were to be elected by the wealthiest quarter of the population in each département. These individuals now effectively had two votes. Around the same time as the “law of the two votes”, Louis XVIII began to receive visits every Wednesday from a lady named Zoé Talon, and ordered that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> disturb him while he was with her. It was rumoured that he inhaled snuff from her breasts, which earned her the nickname of tabatière (snuffbox). In 1823, France embarked on a military intervention in Spain, where a revolt had occurred against the King Ferdinand VII. France succeeded in crushing the rebellion, an effort headed by the Duke of Angoulême.|$|E
25|$|In late 1965, Proudfoot {{addressed}} a public meeting at a Scarborough hotel {{in which he}} invited the public to subscribe for shares in the business. He indicated that the venture was a high risk one and that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> expect a commercial return on the money they put in. Around sixty people did subscribe with the largest single shareholding being held by Proudfoot himself. Leonard Dale became Chairman of the company while Proudfoot became its managing director.|$|E

25|$|St Paul's Anglican {{church was}} built in 1906 by Ernest Morris of Morris and Emmett. Building Inspector said {{it had to be}} demolished, because rain water had caused {{extensive}} rot and it had begun to fall sideways and <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> enter while there was any wind movement. A last service was held on Sunday 13 April 1980. Demolition was on 14 January 1981 and a memorial plaque laid in 1982 and dedicated on 20 March 1983.|$|E
25|$|Late in his life, Dönitz {{made every}} attempt to answer {{correspondence}} and autograph postcards for others. Dönitz was unrepentant regarding his role in World War II, as he firmly believed that he had acted at all times out of duty to his nation. He also maintained the belief that to betray military secrets, even when working with the enemy, is a despicable act of treachery; he was firmly convinced that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> or would respect an individual who did not share such a conviction. The West German government argued he should receive only the pension pay of a captain because all of his advances in rank after that had been because of Hitler, but he won a court case demanding the pension for his final rank.|$|E
25|$|Umar I {{had ordered}} that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> {{adulterate}} milk by mixing water into it. Once, while patrolling about {{at night to}} inquire into the condition of people, he heard a woman asker her daughter to mix water into the milk before the day-break. The girl refused by reminding her mother of the order given by the Caliph. When the mother retorted {{by saying that the}} Caliph was not present and he would not know of it, the daughter replied that God is Omniscient even if Caliph was not present. Umar I was so pleased with the reply that he asked his son Asim to marry the girl, saying that he hoped that she will give birth to a man who would rule over Arabia. Umar II was the son of Asim's daughter from this marriage (Abdul Hakam, pp 17-18).|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bell {{turned on}} her tormentor in swift anger. She might resent her husband's strange {{behavior}} herself, but <b>nobody</b> else <b>should</b> dare to criticize him to her.|$|R

25|$|Safe solo divers must be self-sufficient, well trained, {{prepared}} and practised. They {{should have a}} completely redundant set of all life support equipment (e.g. a complete, self-contained backup breathing gas supply). In addition, the responsible solo divers adhere to a very conservative dive profile, both in depth and level of difficulty. Unlike the buddy system, which encourages divers to rely on others {{in the event of}} an emergency, solo diving encourages divers to prepare themselves to overcome emergencies by their own means. The divers who engage in solo diving are typically those who are experienced and equipped enough to handle problems themselves. Solo divers must feel totally comfortable and relaxed in doing this sort of diving, and <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> ever think of doing diving solo if they are not both competent and comfortable in doing so.|$|E
500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Tubman became heavily {{involved}} with the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Auburn. In 1903, she donated a parcel of real estate she owned to the church, under the instruction that it be made into a home for [...] "aged and indigent colored people". The home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100 entrance fee. She said: [...] "hey make a rule that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> come in without they have a hundred dollars. Now I wanted to make a rule that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> come in unless they didn't have no money at all." [...] She was frustrated by the new rule but was the guest of honor nonetheless when the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged celebrated its opening on June 23, 1908.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} executive producers for The Sarah Jane Adventures were Phil Collinson, Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner. Susie Liggat {{produced the}} pilot, but Matthew Bouch worked as {{producer of the}} series. Co-writer Gareth Roberts, writing in Doctor Who Magazine, said, [...] "We're all determined {{that this will be}} a big, full-blooded drama; that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> ever think of it as 'just' a children's programme." [...] Sue Nott was the executive producer of the second series for CBBC.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{did leave}} an account--and {{you would have}} seen it in the morning. I wrote in chalk on the coach-house doors that I had come back for the horse and gig, and driven off; that I could arouse <b>nobody,</b> and <b>should</b> return soon." ...|$|R
500|$|Devon and Cornwall Police {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the accident, saying in a statement, [...] "There is absolutely no suggestion at all of wrongdoing. The police are here to fully investigate the circumstances and report them to the coroner." [...] An inquest was opened and, three weeks later, the police investigation concluded that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> face criminal charges {{as a result of the}} accident. Shaw's funeral was held in Bideford Methodist Church on 21 March 2007 and was attended by hundreds of mourners.|$|E
500|$|The Diet {{met again}} in Torda in early 1568 and {{authorized}} preachers to [...] "teach the Gospel" [...] {{according to their}} own understanding. The Diet also declared that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> [...] "suffer at the hands of others for religious reasons", stating that [...] "faith is a gift of God". The Edict of Torda expanded the limits of religious freedom far beyond the standard of 16th-century Europe. The decree did not put a complete end to discrimination, because official status was granted only to the Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist clergymen, but Unitarian, Orthodox, Armenian, Jewish, and Muslim believers could also freely practise their religions.|$|E
500|$|A police {{investigation}} concluded that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> be held criminally responsible for Shaw's death. The investigation was later criticised by the coroner, who adjourned the inquest and {{recommended that the}} Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) reconsider the possibility of criminal charges. Three months later, however, the CPS reported that there was insufficient evidence to press charges and the inquest was resumed. After hearing testimony from eyewitnesses, including other members of Shaw's group, the inquest concluded with a narrative verdict in October 2010. In addition to the verdict, the coroner gave several recommendations for future activities of a similar nature. Among the recommendations were suggestions that both participants and the adult [...] "team leaders" [...] should receive better training.|$|E

2500|$|The parapsychologist Andrija Puharich met Geller in 1971 and {{endorsed}} him as {{a genuine}} psychic. Under hypnosis, Geller claimed {{he was sent to}} earth by extraterrestrials from a spaceship fifty-three thousand light years away. Geller would later deny the space-fantasy claims, but affirmed there [...] "is a slight possibility that some of my energies do have extraterrestrial connection." [...] Puharich also stated that Geller teleported a dog through the walls of his house. However, science writer Martin Gardner wrote as [...] "no expert on fraud was there as an observer" [...] then <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> take the claim of Puharich seriously.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 March 2012 the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} Cuccinelli as Attorney General had no legal {{authority}} {{to demand the}} records from the university. Mann expressed pleasure at the outcome, but stated that [...] "It's sad that so much money and resources had to be wasted on Cuccinelli's witch hunt against me and the University of Virginia, when {{it could have been}} invested, for example, in measures to protect Virginia's coastline from the damaging effects of sea-level rise it is already seeing." [...] The Union of Concerned Scientists applauded the reconfirmation that the demands lacked legal standing, and said that [...] "Academic institutions have the responsibility to protect their faculty's ability to discover new things about our world without fearing harassment. <b>Nobody</b> <b>should</b> expect the rough drafts of their work to be subject to the same level of scrutiny as their published research." [...] The Attorney General's office put out a statement that [...] "From the beginning, we have said that we were simply trying to review documents that are unquestionably state property {{to determine whether or not}} fraud had been committed. Today, the court effectively held that state agencies do not have to provide state-owned property to state investigators looking into potential fraud involving government funds." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther. She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that <b>nobody</b> <b>should</b> follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university {{because that was the}} one thing that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother said I had to get a job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't think this would happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her." [...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer). Young described Brett's style [...] "She seemed genuinely interested in the pop stars she interviewed, but she could also be intimidating at times." ...|$|E

60|$|Store-keeping.--All stores {{should be}} packed and {{securely}} lashed, {{that it may}} be impossible to pilfer from them. The packages of those that are in use, should be carried in one pair of saddle-gabs, to be devoted to that purpose.

Lastly, it should be his duty to furnish a weekly account, specifying what stores remain in hand.|$|R
5000|$|After {{his career}} was ended by a leg injury, Pool served as a player-coach for the Fort Pierce Naval Amphibious Base during the final two years of World War II, while also working as an {{underwater}} demolition officer. His 1943 unit finished undefeated, and in 1944, he made news when he refused to wear jersey number 14 {{out of respect for}} Green Bay Packers' standout Don Hutson. [...] "No. 14 is Don Hutson's number, and <b>nobody</b> else <b>should</b> have that, certainly not me", said Pool.|$|R
