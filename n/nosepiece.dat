50|$|A hackamore, put simply, is {{headgear}} {{that controls}} a horse via pressure {{points on the}} face, usually with a <b>nosepiece</b> instead of a bit. A hackamore {{is not the same}} thing as a halter, as a halter is primarily used for leading and tying up an animal. Bitless bridles are similar to hackamores, but some designs use different leverage principles for control. Hackamores and bitless bridles use a headstall with reins attached to some type of noseband or <b>nosepiece.</b> Various designs allow control and good communication to the horse and may, in some cases, be more comfortable to the horse, particularly a young animal or one with a mouth injury.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One way {{to improve}} {{luminosity}} is to reduce transverse emittance by changing damping partitions. We consider the options {{in relation to the}} constraints. Besides modifications of the basic DR configuration the options include closed-orbit offsets in the quadruples, addition of strong multiples and replacement of existing rectangular <b>nosepieces</b> on the dipoles (shim angles 4 s 0 / 2) with rotatable inserts. Measurements indicate the possibility of dynamically tuning 4 ? 45 ° with decreases in Tz and 6 Z of> 50 ~o. We discuss damping mechanisms to motivate the desirable field characteristics as well as nonlinear contours to cancel dipole harmonic errors (B> 2 T here) or to provide chromatic corrections. Such inserts could dso be used to make cheaper, more compact rings with better impedance by reducing the number of conventional multiples without impairing the stability. Estimated hardware costs are 250 $/dipole end or multipole equivalent. 1...|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} {{repeated}} attempts to attribute {{the name to}} a real material. Because of the long-standing usage of the term [...] "unobtainium" [...] within the space elevator research community to describe a material with the necessary characteristics, LiftPort Group President Michael Laine has advocated assigning the term as the generic name for cables woven of carbon nanotube fibers, which seem {{to satisfy the requirements}} for this application. Since he claimed that sufficiently long nanotube cables will be prohibitively expensive to develop without inexpensive access to microgravity, these cables would still be close enough to unobtainable to meet the definition. However, this usage {{does not seem to have}} become widespread. The eyewear and fashion wear company Oakley, Inc. also frequently denotes the material used for many of their eyeglass <b>nosepieces</b> and earpieces, which has the unusual property of increasing tackiness and thus grip when wet, as unobtanium.|$|R

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described in}} this thesis were designed to shed some more light on the mechanisms underlying cigarette smoke-induced lung emphysema. We used elastase instillation to induce lung emphysema, and subsequently perfused the lungs ex-vivo with buffer at a range of flows to measure changes in the resulting pressure. Unfortunately there was no clear relation between morphometric measures of lung damage and the flow/pressure profiles. We investigated whether exposure of mice to cigarette smoke in our experimental set-up led to the predisposition of emphysematous lesions towards the upper parts of the lungs that is seen in smoking humans. We showed that this was indeed the case, and, therefore, concluded that exposure of mice in our experimental set-up {{could serve as a}} valid model for cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in humans, at least with regard to the distribution of damage throughout the lungs. After having shown this, we applied the model to investigate the effects of one of the less well studied components of cigarette smoke: humic acid (HA). We hypothesised that deposition of HA would potentiate smoke-induced damage to the lungs, and thus the development of emphysema. Indeed, when mice were exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 months, after HA instillation in to the lungs, they had developed emphysematous lesions, whereas {{this was not the case}} in the mice that had been exposed to smoke or HA only. Our observation that HA potentiated the lung-damaging effects of smoking provides an explanation for the fact that many pack-years of smoking are generally required for symptoms to become clearly manifest, supposedly the time needed to get sufficient HA accumulation in the airways in order to catalyse the cytotoxic effects of smoking. Based on findings that cigarette smoke acts as a double-edged sword in the lungs, both inflicting tissue damage and depleting acid retinoids (molecules implied in tissue regeneration), the following hypothesis was formulated: a low vitamin A status can increase the susceptibility to cigarette smoke-induced lung emphysema. We exposed mice with a normal and a low, but not deficient, vitamin A status to cigarette smoke to test this, and found the hypothesis to be true. Unexpectedly, levels of acid retinoids remained normal in the lungs of the smoke-exposed animals, irrespective of their vitamin A status. Levels of retinol and retinyl palmitate were decreased in the lungs of animals with the low status. This could provide a possible explanation for the increased susceptibility, given their potent anti-oxidant activity, which could protect against cigarette smoke-induced damage. Involuntarily exposure to cigarette smoke in a nose-only system causes stress in experimental animals, through a combination of factors. We speculated that stress-induced hyperthermia might explain the high levels of mortality we experienced in both controls and smoke-exposed animals during our nose-only exposure experiments. Surprisingly, we found that mice instead showed a pronounced hypothermia during their stay in the nose-only exposure tubes, which we could attribute to the massive metal <b>nosepieces.</b> Unfortunately, preventing hypothermia by heating the <b>nosepieces</b> did not decrease parameters of stress, nor did it reduce mortality...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the influence of}} methodological and chemical parameters on the detection of nasal chemesthesis (i. e., trigeminal stimulation) evoked by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). To avoid odor biases, chemesthesis was probed via nasal pungency detection in anosmics and via nasal localization (i. e., lateralization) in normosmics, in both cases using forced-choice procedures. In the experiments with anosmics, 12 neat VOCs were selected based on previous reports of lack of chemesthetic response. Although none of the VOCs reached 100 % detection, detectability and confidence of detection were higher when using a glass vessel system adapted with <b>nosepieces</b> to fit the nostrils tightly than when using wide-mouth glass jars. Half the stimuli were detected well above chance and half were not. When the latter were tested again after being heated to 37 C, that is, body temperature (from room temperature, 23 C), to increase their vapor concentration, only one, octane, significantly increased its detectability. Chemesthesis gauged with normosmics mirrored that with anosmics. Gas chromatography measurements showed that, even at 23 C, the saturated vapor concentrations of the undetected stimuli, except vanillin, were well above the respective calculated nasal pungency threshold (NPT) from an equation that, in the past, had accurately described and predicted NPTs. We conclude that, except for octane and perhaps vanillin, {{the failure of the}} other four VOCs to precipitate nasal chemesthesis rests on a chemical–structural limitation, for example, the molecules lack a key property to fit a receptor pocket, rather than o...|$|R
6000|$|But when full {{allowance}} {{has been}} made for this harmless element of poetry and pretty human perversity in the thing, I shall not hesitate to maintain here that this cult {{of the future is}} not only a weakness but a cowardice of the age. It is the peculiar evil of this epoch that even its pugnacity is fundamentally frightened; and the Jingo is contemptible not because he is impudent, but because he is timid. The reason why modern armaments do not inflame the imagination like the arms and emblazonments of the Crusades is a reason quite apart from optical ugliness or beauty. Some battleships are as beautiful as the sea; and many Norman <b>nosepieces</b> were as ugly as Norman noses. The atmospheric ugliness that surrounds our scientific war is an emanation from that evil panic which {{is at the heart of}} it. The charge of the Crusades was a charge; it was charging towards God, the wild consolation of the braver. The charge of the modern armaments is not a charge at all. It is a rout, a retreat, a flight from the devil, who will catch the hindmost. It is impossible to imagine a mediaeval knight talking of longer and longer French lances, with precisely the quivering employed about larger and larger German ships The man who called the Blue Water School the [...] "Blue Funk School" [...] uttered a psychological truth which that school itself would scarcely essentially deny. Even the two-power standard, if it be a necessity, is in a sense a degrading necessity. Nothing has more alienated many magnanimous minds from Imperial enterprises than the fact that they are always exhibited as stealthy or sudden defenses against a world of cold rapacity and fear. The Boer War, for instance, was colored not so much by the creed that we were doing something right, as by the creed that Boers and Germans were probably doing something wrong; driving us (as it was said) to the sea. Mr. Chamberlain, I think, said that the war was a feather in his cap and so it was: a white feather.|$|R

5000|$|During the Olympics, Honma {{was one of}} {{the first}} goaltenders to have worn a goaltender mask. In 1927, Elizabeth Graham, playing for the Queen's University women's ice hockey team, used a fencing mask at the insistence of her father.

5000|$|A nose whistle (also {{called a}} 'Noseflute') is a wind instrument, usually made in wood, but also {{available}} in plastic, clay and metal sheet, probably of South-American indigenous origin. In spite of its ethnic background, several models have been conceived and patented in the 19th and 20th Centuries. The nose blows air into the instrument's open <b>nosepiece,</b> from where it is channeled through an airduct, towards a rather sharp edge of a slit, positioned over the player's mouth opening. This edge helps creating a vortex that excites the acoustic field into the player's mouth cavity. Since the volume {{and shape of the}} mouth cavity can be widely and quickly controlled by the player, a wide range of playing frequencies are possible. This high playability of such sound instrument probably explains {{the fact that it is}} usually called [...] "Noseflute", rather than Nose Whistle.|$|E

50|$|The {{inflatable}} aeroshell design {{looks much}} like the aeroshell or blunt body design. The inflatable aeroshell {{is often referred to}} as a hybrid system, with a rigid <b>nosepiece</b> and an inflated, attached decelerator to increase the drag area. Just prior to entering the atmosphere, the inflatable aeroshell extends from a rigid nose-cap and provides a larger surface area to slow the spacecraft down. Made of thin-film material and reinforced with a ceramic cloth, the inflatable aeroshell design could offer many of the same advantages and functionality as trailing ballute designs. While not as large as the trailing ballute, the inflatable aeroshell is roughly three times larger than the rigid aeroshell system and performs the aerocapture maneuver higher in the atmosphere, reducing heating loads. Because the system is inflatable, the spacecraft is not enclosed during launch and cruise, which allows more flexibility during spacecraft design and operations.|$|E
50|$|The company, Nippon Kogaku KK ('Japan Optics'), {{was formed}} in 1917 with the merger of three Japanese optical {{manufacturers}} to produce precision optical glass. In 1925 the brand expanded to produce the first microscope with a revolving <b>nosepiece</b> and interchangeable objectives - the Joico microscope. Over {{the next few decades}} the microscopy division progressed considerably with the introduction of groundbreaking polarising and stereomicroscopes in addition to metrology products for measuring and inspection. Nikon launched the Optiphot and Labophot microscopes in the 1970s and established the CF Optical system. The 1980s saw more than 80 new products, including the inverted Diaphot microscope, which was at the forefront of IVF techniques. The introduction of the Eclipse range of infinity optics in the 1990s was a radical departure from traditional microscope design. This in-house expertise in optical technologies has been instrumental in differentiating Nikon from its competitors. CFI60 optics offer advantages for both industrial and biological applications as lenses generally have higher numerical apertures (N.A.s) and longer working distances than comparable lenses and provide increased resolution, greater light-gathering capability and high performance in confocal imaging. The infinity optical system also has the benefit that the distance between the objective and the eyepiece tube is not fixed, allowing a variety of imaging modules to be inserted into the light path without any compromise in optical quality. This has allowed microscopes to be transformed into versatile imaging workstations that provide users with instant access to several imaging methods. Using a Nikon Diaphot microscope, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell. Nikon's photographic capability has extended to a series of digital camera systems optimized for microscopy-based applications enabling the digital transfer of images.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA high energy laser system inflicts damage on a target by radiating {{large amounts of}} thermal energy onto a small area. Airflow about the laser turret, which is located {{on top of the}} aircraft fuselage, is unsteady and causes problems in beam control. The problems are jitter, which is vibration of the laser beam, and optical path distortions. The theory of flow around a cylinder and around a sphere was examined, and several airflow control techniques were screened in an effort to suppress the unsteadiness of the flow. A fairing and turret base suction apparatus was selected and experimentally tested in a wind tunnel. During the course of the experiments several parameters were varied as follows: blower flow rate, spacing between turret and fairing <b>nosepiece,</b> and flow rate in five separate ducts. Results of the tests indicate that the fairing and base suction technique eliminates the unsteadiness. Further research and testing are required to develop the technique for actual use on aircraft.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an automatic method to measure cell height (h) of epithelia grown as monolayers on transparent filter supports. Tissues are mounted in an Ussing-type chamber enabling solution exchange on both sides. The apical and basal {{side of the}} epithelial cells are marked with fluorescent beads. The image of the fluospheres is captured with a video camera and processed by a computer-based video imaging system. One basal reference bead in a gelatin layer on the filter support and up to three beads attached at the apical surface are used to monitor changes in cell height of three cells simultaneously. The focusing of the microbeads is done automatically by moving the objective with a piezoelectric device mounted on the <b>nosepiece</b> of the microscope. The algorithm fnr locating the bead {{is based on the}} changes in fluorescent light intensity emitted by the fluospheres. The method has an accuracy higher than 0. 1 mu m and a time resolution as low as 6 s if measurements are restricted to one bead at the apical side. The method was tested on artificial model systems and used to measure volume changes in renal cultured epithelia (A 6) after exposing the serosal surface to hypotonic solutions and replacing cell-impermeable sucrose by an organic compound (glycerol) with a smaller reflection coefficient.

40|$|A {{subsurface}} explorer (SSX) {{is being}} developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory which is suitable for exploration of the deep underground environments on Mars. The device is a self-contained piledriver which uses a novel 'spinning hammer' technology to convert a small continuous power feed from the surface over a two-wire tether into a large rotational energy of a spinning mass. The rotational energy is converted to translational energy by a novel mechanism described here. The hammer blows propagate as shock waves through a <b>nosepiece,</b> pulverizing the medium ahead of the SSX. A {{small portion of the}} pulverized medium is returned to the surface through a hole liner extending behind the SSX. This tube is 'cast in place' from two chemical feedstocks which come down from the surface through passages in the hole liner and which are reacted together to produce new material with which to produce the hole liner. The lined hole {{does not need to be}} the full diameter of the SSX: approximately 100 kilograms of liner material can create a tunnel liner with a three millimeter inside diameter and a six millimeter outside diameter with at total length of four kilometers. Thus it is expected that core samples representing an overlapping set of three-millimeter diameter cores extending the entire length of the SSX traverse could be returned to the surface. A pneumatic prototype has been built which penetrated easily to the bottom of an eight meter vertical test facility. An electric prototype is now under construction. It is expected that the SSX will be able to penetrate through sand or mixed regolith, ice, permafrost, or solid rock, such as basalt. For pure or nearly pure ice applications, the device may be augmented with hot water jets to melt the ice and stir any sediment which may build up ahead of the vehicle.

40|$|Acoustic rhinometry {{evaluates the}} {{geometry}} of the nasal cavity with acoustic reflections and provides information about nasal cross-sectional area and nasal volume within a given distance. Variations in internal nasal diameters have attracted increased interest {{since the advent of}} endoscopic surgical techniques. Race is known {{to be one of the}} most important factors affecting the nasal structure. In this study, we evaluated 106 healthy adult volun-teers with acoustic rhinometry to determine inter-nal nasal diameters and volumes and obtained normative data for four racial/ethnic groups. The data were analyzed with regard to race, sex, height, and weight. All measurements were made before and after the application of a topical nasal decongestant so that the effects of the nasal cycle were eliminated by decongestion. (Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1998; 119 : 389 - 93.) Acoustic rhinometry (AR) evaluates {{the geometry of}} the nasal cavity with acoustic reflections and provides information about nasal cross-sectional area (CSA) and nasal volume within a given distance into the nasal cav-ity. The AR device used in this study generates a sound pulse from a sound generator with a peak sound pres-sure level of 146 dB and 50 m sec duration, which prop-agates in a tube and enters the nasal cavity through a <b>nosepiece.</b> The incident and reflected signals are mea-sured by a microphone in the sound tube, and the cor-responding CSAs and volumes are calculated. Acoustic rhinometry is a noninvasive test that is easily done in a relatively short time, and minimal patient cooperation is needed.

AR is sensitive to changes in the nasal mucosa, including the phases of the nasal cycle, 3 to nasal allergen challenge, 4 and to the effects of topical decongestants. It accurately reflects area and volume changes within a given distance, and its performance is not affected by pressure and flow. AR has been validated for its accuracy in CT scan and MRI studies for examination of the nasal anatomy. 5, 6 In this study, we used AR in 106 normal adults in an attempt to define normal ranges for nasal CSAs and volumes with respect to sex and race. To our knowl-edge, this is the first study reporting AR ranges on the basis of these parameters.
