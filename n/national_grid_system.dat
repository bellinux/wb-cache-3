Businesspeople and economists in Pakistan had a mixed response to Ashraf's appointment; while some appreciated the prime minister's focus on the energy crisis and hoped for greater cooperation between key institutions and political parties as being good for economic stability, others questioned his reputation related to rental power and expressed anxiety over the government's ongoing clash with the judiciary which could cause uncertainty and scare businesses away.

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to assess}} the {{potential}} of high renewable energy (wind and solar) integration in the Greek island of Syros, following the scheduled interconnection with the <b>national</b> <b>grid</b> <b>system.</b> Currently, Syros operates an oil fired autonomous power system (APS), emitting large amounts of carbon emissions. Interconnection {{among a number of}} islands in the Cyclades and the mainland will eliminate the use of APS, will reinforce islands’ power network and will allow exploitation of high wind and solar potential. It has been concluded that following the interconnection, the installation of 33. 5 MW of wind and solar energy is feasible. The assumed capacity will cover the total energy demand by 2030 allowing also electricity exports to the Greek mainland. Transforming Syros into a regional renewable energy hub will contribute to the energy security, providing access to its own energy resources...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how {{and when}} {{transformers}} are likely to fail is of critical importance to the asset management of large networks. Ideally a reliable end-of-life model would be established based on years of previous experience over several lifecycles of equipment of a type representative of that still in service. For large power transformers however establishing such a model is not easy because {{we are still in}} the first asset lifecycle and many of the transformers installed when the <b>National</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>system</b> was first developed are still in service well beyond their original design life. Maintaining the reliability of the network is clearly a priority, but this must be done efficiently and economically. Replacement plans must therefore be properly targeted both tactically, to replace those transformers in the worst condition and at the most critical sites, and strategically to make sure the replacement numbers are sustainable in terms of available resources such as outage capacity, supplier capability and investment funding. Given the expected strongly non-linear relationship between system reliability and plant reliability and the possibility of hidden failures in the system where plant in service has aged to a condition where it cannot withstand the power flows resulting from a system failure elsewhere, the best possible understanding of ageing and failure is required. This paper gives the historical failure rate of the transformers used on the <b>National</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>system</b> in the UK and shows that failures to date are random in nature and not statistically age related. This means that traditional approaches to building a statistical end-of-life model cannot be used. Analysis of the insulation of transformers removed from service for any reason indicates a very wide range of condition, some samples show severe thermal ageing and it is clear that age-related failures can be expected if replacement is not carried out, other samples show little ageing and for these transformers it appears that very long lifetimes might be expected if other ageing mechanisms do not become apparent. Transformer condition assessment techniques are now very good and provide a sound basis for replacing transformers before failure. A condition assessment scoring system based on anticipated remaining useful lifetime has been implemented and condition based replacement has made a major contribution to maintaining system reliability. The success of the condition based replacement process however has a profound biasing effect on the failure statistics as transformers are not left in service to fail, so that these statistics cannot be used directly for lifetime modelling...|$|E
40|$|An {{adaptive}} deadbeat (ADB) controller {{was developed}} to investigate its capability in providing a fast frequency response to an electrical power system. This controller {{was developed to}} meet the requirements of the <b>National</b> <b>Grid</b> <b>System</b> Operability Framework (SOF), which requires frequency to be accelerated in line with a fast rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) when a high rate of nonsynchronous machines are presented. The controller’s parameters were optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to ensure a robust operation and to maintain the proper operation of the power system. The design of the ADB controller was then integrated with the multiarea model of the north and south zones of Scotland. This model was developed in order to conform to the future energy requirements scenario stated by National Grid whereby regional control can be provided in both the north and south of Scotland. In comparison with the standard PI and Fuzzy-PI controllers used in the four highlighted case studies, it was shown that the ADB controller was able to significantly reduce the RoCoF and deviation of frequency when a sudden loss of generation occurred in a low inertia zone. The ADB also showed high robustness against a wide range of operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores China???s recent {{surge in}} {{renewable}} energy (RE) investment and production. Utilizing Jun Zhang???s political-economic analysis of China???s rapid industrialization and recent growth, I {{argue that in}} the same way Zhang utilizes politics to better understand the country???s economic policies, the Chinese Communist Party???s (CCP) RE strategy can be best understood {{as part of a larger}} political agenda. This means that the reasons behind Chinese investment in renewables have less to do with profit-seeking and more with efforts by the CCP to curtail the social and ecological problems that threaten the country???s political stability and that stem from the country???s excessive reliance on fossil fuels. To this end, this thesis identifies various secondary drivers that trigger social turmoil, including rising carbon dioxide emissions, critical Gini income inequality levels, and severe air pollution. The picture that emerges is that RE development - along with its benefits of low emissions, low vulnerability to foreign intervention, and capacity to function outside of the <b>national</b> <b>grid</b> <b>system</b> and in remote areas of the country - is a multifaceted tool that empowers the CCP both domestically and internationally. As such, Chinese investment in RE is more of a political strategy than an exercise in environmental stewardship...|$|E
