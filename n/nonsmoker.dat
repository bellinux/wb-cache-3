40|$|OBJECTIVE—Smoking {{decreases}} insulin {{action and}} {{increases the risk of}} type 2 diabetes in humans. Mechanisms responsible for smoking-induced insulin resistance are unclear. We hypoth-esized smokers would have increased intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) concentration and decreased fractional synthesis rate (FSR) compared with <b>nonsmokers.</b> RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Nonsmokers (n 18, aged 20 0. 5 years, BMI 22 0. 4 kg/m 2, body fat 20 2 %, 0 cigarettes per day) and smokers (n 14, aged 21 0. 7 years, BMI 23 0. 4 kg/m 2, body fat 20 3 %, 18 0. 7 cigarettes per day) were studied in a fasted condition after a standardized diet. [U- 13 C]palmitate was infused during 4 h of rest followed by a skeletal muscle biopsy and intravenous glucose tolerance test. RESULTS—Smokers were less insulin sensitive (Si) compared with <b>nonsmokers</b> (Si 5. 28 0. 5 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 3. 74 0. 3 smokers 104 U 1 ml 1, P 0. 03). There were no differences in IMTG or DAG concentration (IMTG 24. 2 3. 4 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 27. 2 5. 9 smokers g/mg dry wt, DAG 0. 34 0. 02 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 0. 35 0. 02 smokers g/mg dry wt) or IMTG FSR between groups (0. 66 0. 1 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 0. 55 0. 09 smokers %/hr). Intramuscular lipid composition was different, with increased percent saturation of IMTG (32. 1 1. 2 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 35. 2 1. 0 smokers %, P 0. 05) and DAG (52. 8 1. 7 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 58. 8 2. 2 smokers %, P 0. 04) in smokers. Smokers had significantly decreased peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor- (1. 76 0. 1 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 1. 42 0. 11 smokers arbitrary units [AU], P 0. 03) and increased monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (3. 11 0. 41 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 4. 83 0. 54 smokers AU, P 0. 02) mRNA expression compared with <b>nonsmokers.</b> We also found increased insulin receptor substrate- 1 Ser 636 phosphorylation in smokers compared with <b>nonsmokers</b> (0. 73 0. 08 <b>nonsmokers</b> vs. 1. 14 0. 09 smokers AU, P 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS—These data suggest: 1) IMTG concentration and turnover are not related to alterations in insulin action in smokers compared to <b>nonsmokers,</b> 2) increased saturation of IMTG and DAG in skeletal muscle may be related to insulin action, and 3) basal inhibition of insulin receptor substrate- 1 may decrease insulin action in smokers.

40|$|Background/Purpose: High-mobility group box- 1 (HMGB 1), a pro{{inflammatory}} cytokine, {{plays a role}} in inflammatory disorders. Smoking is a well-established risk factor for periodontal disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the levels of HMGB 1 in the gingival crevicular fluid from periodontally healthy <b>nonsmokers,</b> chronic periodontitis <b>nonsmokers,</b> and chronic periodontitis smokers. Furthermore, the relationship between levels of HMGB 1 and periodontal parameters was examined. Methods: Periodontal parameters of 17 <b>nonsmokers</b> with chronic periodontitis, nine smokers with chronic periodontitis, and nine periodontally healthy <b>nonsmokers</b> were examined. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected, and the levels of HMGB 1 were analyzed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The median level of HMGB 1 was statistically significantly higher in chronic periodontitis <b>nonsmokers</b> (37. 5  ng/mL) than in chronic periodontitis smokers (9. 5  ng/mL) and periodontally healthy <b>nonsmokers</b> (3. 7  ng/mL). There was no significant difference in the levels of HMGB 1 between chronic periodontitis smokers and periodontally healthy <b>nonsmokers.</b> Levels of HMGB 1 were positively correlated with plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, and clinical attachment level of <b>nonsmokers.</b> However, no significant correlations were found between levels of HMGB 1 and all periodontal parameters examined in chronic periodontitis smokers. Conclusion: Chronic periodontitis <b>nonsmokers</b> had elevated levels of HMGB 1 in gingival crevicular fluid. Moreover, the levels of HMGB 1 were correlated with severity of periodontitis. Chronic periodontitis smokers exhibited lower levels of HMGB 1 than chronic periodontitis <b>nonsmokers.</b> Further research is needed for understanding the role of HMGB 1 in smoking and pathogenesis of periodontitis.

40|$|Background: Smoking {{cessation}} {{is often}} followed by weight gain. Eating behaviors and weight change {{have been linked}} to the brain response to food, but it is unknown whether smoking influences this response. Objective:We determined the influence of smoking status (smokers compared with <b>nonsmokers)</b> on the brain response to food in re-gions associated with weight changes in <b>nonsmokers.</b> Design: In study 1, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to identify regions of the brain associated with weight change in <b>nonsmokers.</b> BMI and the brain response to a milk shake, which is a palatable and energy-dense food, were measured in a group of 27 <b>nonsmokers</b> (5 men). Sixteen subjects (3 men) returned 1 y later for BMI re-assessment. The change in BMI was regressed against the brain response to isolate regions associated with weight change. In study 2, to determine whether smokers showed altered responses in re-gions associated with weight change, we assessed the brain re-sponse to a milk shake in 11 smokers. The brain response to a milk shake compared with a tasteless control solution was as-sessed in 11 smokers (5 men) in comparison with a group of age-, sex- and body weight–matched <b>nonsmokers</b> selected from the pool of <b>nonsmokers</b> who participated in study 1.

5000|$|Dale Miller and Rebecca Ratner {{conducted}} {{this study}} utilizing 81 {{male and female}} students at the University of Yale. In this experiment the objective was for half of the participants to show their own attitude toward smoking policies and the other half to show their thoughts on others attitudes toward smoking policies. The group with the questionnaire regarding their personal attitude about smoking were asked: 1. if they were a smoker or a <b>nonsmoker,</b> 2. how heavy or light a smoker they were, 3. whether they would support an increase on cigarette tax, 4. would they do away with smoking advertisements, and 5. their thoughts on smoking restrictions in public places. The second half of the participants were asked what percentage they thought smokers would support the previously mentioned policies for smokers or nonsmokers. They were not asked whether or not they smoked. The results of this study replicated Green and Gerkin's 1989 study that nonsmokers leaned more positively toward smoking restrictions than did smokers. These results supported the hypothesis: [...] "Smokers in this study were more opposed to policies that regulated smoking than were nonsmokers, but the effect of smoking status on expressed attitudes was significantly less than that predicted by respondents". The smokers had a higher vested interest in smoking policies because they were directly affected. This study also revealed a direct correlation between vested interest and attitudes.|$|E
5000|$|Mahatma Gandhi also {{visited the}} schools {{established}} by the Buddhist theosophical society in Ceylon and addressed the students and teachers there. During his speech at Mahinda College, Galle Gandhi stated that {{he was certain that}} the children of a nation who receive instructions in a tongue other than their own commit suicide. [...] "I am certain that the children of the nation that receive instructions in a tongue other than their own commit suicide. It robs them of their birthright. A foreign medium means an undue strain upon the youngsters, it robs them of all originality." [...] While addressing the students at Ananda College, Colombo he spoke about his love to see the school children and noted that Ceylon is a ‘beautiful island. The staff, parents and children of Ananda College raised Rs 400.86 and presented the money to Mahatma Gandhi as a donation for his ‘Khadi Collection’. On November 18, 1927 Mahatma Gandhi addressed the students of Dharmaraja College, Kandy and among others he spoke on the habit of smoking and importance of becoming a <b>nonsmoker.</b> He stated that, [...] “Why smoke, when there is no necessity for it? It is no food. There is no enjoyment in it except in the first instance through suggestion from outside. You boys if you are good boys, if you are obedient to your teachers and parents, omit smoking and whatever you save out of this, please send on to me for the famishing millions of India.” ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{examined}} whether socially stigmatized individuals (cigarette smokers) use unique person perception strategies during interaction with out-group individuals (<b>nonsmokers),</b> {{as well as}} implications for meta-accuracy. Undergraduate students (= 104) were divided into groups of four, representing one of three compositions: all smokers, all <b>nonsmokers,</b> or two smokers with two <b>nonsmokers.</b> Participants interacted with each group member, evaluated each other, and guessed partners' evaluations of themselves (metaperceptions). Contrary to past findings, smokers' metaperceptions of out-group members were not consistent across targets. Instead, smokers' metaperceptions were influenced by the smoking status of interaction partners. Moreover, smokers interacting with <b>nonsmokers</b> were least accurate in their metaperceptions, compared to other dyad combinations. Connections between metaperception and meta-accuracy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Lung cancer {{incidence}} {{is increasing}} {{in women with}} little or no tobacco exposure, and the cause of this trend is not known. One possibility is increased sensitivity to environmental tobacco smoke in women <b>nonsmokers</b> diagnosed with lung cancer. To determine whether mutations associated with tobacco exposure are found in the lung tumors of women who are lifetime <b>nonsmokers</b> or occasional smokers, we compared the p 53 and K-ras mutational spectra in lung carcinomas from 23 female <b>nonsmokers,</b> 2 female occasional smokers (< 10 pack-years), and 30 female long-term smokers (20 – 100 pack-years). We also looked for p 53 and K-ras mutations in three carcinoid lung tumors, two from female <b>nonsmokers</b> and one from a female occasional smoker...|$|R
