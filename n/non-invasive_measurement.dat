40|$|At the Department for {{comparative}} {{medicine at}} NTNU, di erent instruments from di erent vendors are providing measurements related to cardiac function for physiological research in large animals. There {{is a need}} for a centralized tool for acquisition, calibration and synchronization of the di erent measurements sources. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a system that can ful ll these requirements. Functionality for calculating and comparing di erent parameters related to cardiac function will also be included in the system. An important motivation for the development of this system is to allow for comparison of invasive and <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements.</b> Invasive measurements produces more accurate indicators of cardiac function, but is often not available in the clinical setting. <b>Non-invasive</b> <b>measurements</b> is more readily available, but is less accurate. The system will have a possibility for comparing parameters calculated from invasive and <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements,</b> and thus aiding the development of more accurate measures of cardiac function based on <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements.</b> The system will be developed in close cooperation with a team of doctors, and will be tested out during operations on living pigs...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{measurements}} of cardiac functioning allows for more accurate measures of cardiac functioning than <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements.</b> However, invasive measurements {{is often not}} available in clinical settings. By comparing invasive and <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements</b> collected in an experimental context, better relationships between <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements</b> and cardiac functioning may be found. This master thesis describes the development of two computer applications for simultaneous acquisition, calibration and synchronization of these measurements. The developed applications were tested out during operations on pigs with all measurement sources connected. The results shows that all the desired measurements were successfully acquired by the system. Calibration of the different measurement were also achieved. Different methods for synchronization were tested out during the experiments. It was possible to achieve synchronization of all clocks present in the system. Finally, all of the desired parameters were calculated. </p...|$|R

5000|$|One {{promising}} {{application is}} the <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurement</b> of flow.

The <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurement</b> of relevant physiological signals like cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, blood pressure, CO2 levels, cerebral oxygen consumption, etc. is challenging.

40|$|<b>Non-invasive</b> <b>measurements</b> of {{glucocorticoid}} (GC) concentrations, including cortisol and corticosterone, {{serve as}} reliable indicators of adrenocortical activities and physiological stress loads {{in a variety}} of species. As an alternative to invasive analyses based on plasma, GC concentrations in saliva still represent single-point-of-time measurements, suitable for studying short-term or acute stress responses, whereas fecal GC metabolites (FGMs) reflect overall stress loads and stress responses after a species-specific time frame in the long-term. In our study species, the domestic guinea pig, GC measurements are commonly used to indicate stress responses to different environmental conditions, but the biological relevance of <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements</b> is widely unknown. We therefore established an experimental protocol based on the animals’ natural stress responses to different environmental conditions and compared GC levels in plasma, saliva, and fecal samples during non-stressful social isolations and stressful two-hour social confrontations with unfamiliar individuals. Plasma and saliva cortisol concentrations were significantly increased directly after the social confrontations, and plasma and saliva cortisol levels were strongly correlated. This demonstrates a high biological relevance of GC measurements in saliva. FGM levels measured 20 h afterwards, representing the reported mean gut passage time based on physiological validations, revealed that the overall stress load was not affected by the confrontations, but also no relations to plasma cortisol levels were detected. We therefore measured FGMs in two-hour intervals for 24 h after another social confrontation and detected significantly increased levels after four to twelve hours, reaching peak concentrations already after six hours. Our findings confirm that <b>non-invasive</b> GC <b>measurements</b> in guinea pigs are highly biologically relevant in indicating physiological stress responses compared to circulating levels in plasma in the short- and long-term. Our approach also underlines the importance of detailed investigations on how to use and interpret <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements,</b> including the determination of appropriate time points for sample collections...|$|R

50|$|Measurement {{and control}} of a cell culture process using a {{single-use}} bioreactor is challenging, as the bag in which the cultivation will be performed is a closed and pre-sterilized system. Sensors for measuring the temperature, conductivity, glucose, oxygen, or pressure must be built into the bag during the manufacturing prior to sterilization. The sensors can’t be installed prior to use of the bioreactor as in the conventional case. Consequently, some challenges {{must be taken into}} consideration. The bag is assembled, delivered and stored dry, with the consequence that the usual pH-electrodes can not be used. Calibration or additional assembly is not possible. These constraints have {{led to the development of}} preconfigured bags with new types of analytical probes. The pH value can be measured using a patch that is just a few millimeters in size. This patch consists of a protecting membrane with a pH-sensitive dye behind it. Changing pH in the culture medium changes the pH, and the color, of the dye. The color change can be detected with a laser external to the bag. This and other methods of <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurement</b> have been developed for single-use bioreactors.|$|E

Currently, the oxygen content can only be measured through invasive means such as drawing blood from the patient. In this work, we attempt to perform estimation by only using other <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements</b> (e. g., fraction of oxygen in inspired air, volume of inspired air) collected during surgery. Although models mapping these measurements to blood oxygen content contain multiple parameters that vary widely across patients, the <b>non-invasive</b> <b>measurements</b> can be used to provide binary information about whether the oxygen concentration is rising or dropping. This information can then be incorporated in a context-aware filter that is used to combine regular continuous measurements with discrete detection events in order to improve estimation.
