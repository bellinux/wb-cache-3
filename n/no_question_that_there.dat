[...] The Congresswoman posed {{questions}} to the witnesses, including Oscar Munoz,, after the Committee Chairman Bill Shuster left his chair. Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an excellent question because… {{right now we have}} a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations.

5000|$|EXAMINER [...] "What makes Asphalt so {{interesting}} is that it showcases once artists amidst a post-apocalyptic culture that is firmly within the grips of a police state. The artists that (Racine) stays with are squatters living in a once-magnificent urban brownstone that has since decayed; {{people living in the}} French existentialist tradition. They can only get by, by having techno-inspired raves at night where they sell drugs and alcohol to all those who attend. All must contend with uncertain futures and a deep sense of loss, as though the world they once knew has crumbled all around them, and the only relief they can find is in each other and their commitment to whatever talents they have left. Rux's novel is written beautifully in a neo-1970s hipster style, and his writing is so effective because the attitudes, values, and mores that these artists abide by is subtly woven into his narrative and washes over us in undulating waves, constantly reminding the reader that art is indeed a state of being in many respects and not simply something that one does or is defined by the places or the conditions where one lives. Asphalt stands as a tribute to the resurgence that hit New York City's cultural hub just before the World Trade towers fell, and the result is a literary reminder of what many artists were once striving for when they first started out on their journeys, as the book takes the reader back to what had initially inspired them. But the tragedies of both poverty and exile forever remain capstones of that which once held so much promise. Even though Rux's portrait is one of decline and not of resurgence, <b>there's</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> an heroic struggle that these artists endure here that forever remains the same. The novel transcends both time and space.“ ...|$|R

While many doubt claims concerning a new paradigm — a “new public management ” — <b>no</b> one <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was an old one. An ingrained and narrowly-focused pattern of thought, a “bureaucratic paradigm”, is routinely attributed to {{public administration}}’s traditional literature. A careful reading of that literature reveals, however, that the bureaucratic paradigm is, at best, a caricature and, at worst, an demonstrable distortion of traditional thought, which exhibited far more respect for law, politics, citizens, and values than the new, customer-oriented managerialism and its variants. In failing to contest the revisionists, public administration as a profession has been unduly careless of its own traditions, deserting vital and significant insights and acquiescing in calumnies that, even if they have a grain of truth, disfigure a fine intellectual heritage. The result is an intellectual rootlessness and an analytical negligence that allow vague, anti- or pseudo-democratic ideas to flourish and basic issues of responsible management to go unaddressed...|$|R
40|$|Work {{operations}} involving high air temperatures, {{radiant heat}} sources, high humidity, direct physical contact with hot objects, or strenuous physical activities {{have a high}} potential for inducing heat stress in employees engaged in such operations. These activities are often conducted in the following locations: the steam tunnels; sections of the Central Power Plant; pipe chases; some mechanical rooms; outdoor construction activities; particularly on roofs; and outdoor construction activities that {{require the use of}} protective clothing. Although <b>no</b> one <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a relation between heat stress and occupational accidents, it is difficult to predict who will be affected and when. Two people can work at the same job, under the same conditions, and while one will be effected by the heat, the other will not. Age, weight, degree of physical fitness, degree of acclimatization, metabolism, use of alcohol or drugs and a variety of medical conditions all affect a person’s sensitivity to heat. Even the type of clothing worn must be considered. In addition, the measurement of a hot environment involves more than just measuring the ambient air temperature [...] radiant heat, air movement, and relative humidity are all factors that must be determined. The risk of heat-induced illnesses and injuries may be increased and productivity reduced in situations when the total heat load exceeds the capacities of the body to maintain normal body functions.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{history of}} the way {{schizophrenia}} has been conceptualized in American psychiatry has led us to be hesitant to explore the role of social causation in schizophrenia. But there is now good evidence for social impact on the course, outcome, and even origin of schizophrenia, most notably in the better prognosis for schizophrenia in developing countries and in the higher rates of schizophrenia for dark-skinned immigrants to England and the Netherlands. This article proposes that ‘‘social defeat’ ’ {{may be one of}} the social factors that may impact illness experience and uses original ethnographic research to argue that social defeat is a common feature of the social context in which many people diagnosed with schizophrenia in America live today. KEY WORDS: schizophrenia, social defeat, social causation, ethnography of psychosis, homelessness Schizophrenia is the most devastating of all the psychiatric illnesses. There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a real and terrible disorder that, at its most severe, has clearly recognizable features and is found in nearly every corner of th...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to sharply rising housing prices in several key urban areas, an increasingly {{large number of}} advocates have been pushing a program of housing affordability. While incomes and house prices {{are relevant to the}} affordability debate, some advocates argue that increasing shortages of land mean that America is facing a housing crunch. In response, the advocates argue, there should be a strenuous policy of building affordable housing. This paper attempts to shed some light on the actual costs of housing within the United States. There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are some places where housing is expensive and scarce. But is this true throughout the U. S. ? Is this true throughout even the expensive metropolitan areas? To help answer these questions, this paper examines the actual distribution of housing prices in American cities over the last 20 years. We then document a series of facts about American home prices. Since the cost of housing to affordability programs is the cost of construction, we particularly focus on the number of homes that are priced below construction costs. To provide insight into these and other issues, this paper examines the distributio...|$|E
40|$|More cautionary {{positions}} {{are represented in}} the editorial comments of L. L. Thurstone and W. W. Charters. In 1930, Thurstone wrote in the Journal of Higher Education that academic freedom needed to be guarded. He broadly referred to cases when he argued for a defense of academic freedom by involving the “Association of University Professors” and having the organization effectively censure colleges and universities that encroached on academic freedom. Within his article, however, he noted that his “plan involves no violence in speech or action, {{and it does not}} challenge the legal right of the trustees of a university to decide matters of public policy. ” In 1936, W. W. Charters distinguished between freedom of speech and academic freedom by claiming that academic freedom entails the right to present the truth. His point was that a professor cannot champion one position over another and expect the right of academic freedom to hold. Free speech rights might protect such “espousals,” but free speech, he warned, {{should not be confused with}} academic freedom. Importantly, however, Charters admitted that in the social sciences, controversies over the “truth” were more common and more problematic. Still, in his view, it was the responsibility of the professor to present a “balanced case” where enthusiasm for one position over another is not revealed. In the person of Joseph Hart and in the context of Vanderbilt, <b>there</b> is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> but <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a struggle over academic freedom. This essay focuses on the specific case of Hart and Vanderbilt in order to more fully investigate the competing interpretations of academic freedom and to contribute to a more complete history of the topic. While much has been written about academic freedom, a detailed account and interpretation of one case is valuable insofar as it provides a deeper understanding of academic freedom by contextualizing the theoretical understandings of academic freedom...|$|R
40|$|<b>No</b> {{one would}} <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> have been {{changes in the}} Australian federal government’s {{understanding}} of the value and function of higher education since 1943 when the Curtin government first moved to provide financial support for tertiary education {{as part of a}} comprehensive post-war reconstruction package. However, the ways in which successive governments have perceived the value of education, and then translated their values into policy, and the effects of these policy values on the attitudes and expectations of young adults approaching the transition from secondary to tertiary education, have not been examined in detail. My research is intended to remedy this omission. This paper, which provides a context for my research into student values and attitudes, outlines seven distinct phases or eras in federal government policy from 1943 {{until the end of the}} Howard government’s first term in office in 1999. Each of these originates in a clearly defined change, or turning point, in the dominant political discourse about the nature and value of university education. In summary, these are: (1) 1943 to 1949 : the Curtin and Chifley governments regard university education as crucial aspect of post-war reconstruction and national development; (2) 1949 to 1972 : the Menzies government, and subsequent Liberal governments, promote growth of the university sector as a means of personal advancement within the expanding economy; (3) 1972 to 1975 : the Whitlam government interprets university education as a force for social transformation; (4) 1975 to 1983 : a partial return to an elite view of university education and the promotion of the TAFE sector as a source of skilled workers; (5) 1983 to 1987 : the Hawke government adopts a compromise position encouraging limited growth and promoting equity while rejecting the transformative nature of Whitlam’s model; (6) 1987 to 1996 : the Hawke/Keating government embraces the view that university education is an integral part of the economy, and that a degree is a consumer benefit for which the individual should pay. The trend towards user-pays continues following the election of a Liberal government led by Prime Minister John Howard; (7) 1996 : Prime Minister Howard appoints David Kemp as Minister for Education precipitating a series of changes to higher education policy that intensify the economic rationalist approach to university education...|$|R

Seismic hazard is the basis, however. There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are seismic hazards at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant because of its proximity to several known seismic zones, particularly the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The issues in estimating seismic hazard are (1) the methods being used and (2) difficulty in characterizing the uncertainties of seismic sources, earthquake occurrence frequencies, and ground-motion attenuation relationships. This report summarizes how input data were derived, which methodologies were used, and what the hazard estimates at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant are. Three seismic sources (the New Madrid Seismic Zone, the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone, and the background seismicity) were identified and characterized. Four ground-motion attenuation relationships were used in this project. Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) and deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) were performed.

40|$|In the west, {{producers}} {{often find}} themselves working with a federal agency {{in some sort of}} partnership. In public land areas, the most common relationship revolves around United States Forest Service (USFS) or Bureau of Land Management (BLM) grazing permits. However, there are many producers, far removed from USFS or BLM lands, who are involved in some sort of relationship with governmental agencies. The Natural Resource Conservation Service springs to mind as an agency which many producers partner with. Others include Farm Service Agency, state wildlife management agencies, state lands agencies, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, to name the more prominent. There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a wide range in the quality and complexity of the relationships that producers may have with any one agency. In fact, it is quite probable that producer opinions of the various agencies they may have an arrangement with will vary across the spectrum.

Nonetheless, it should be heartening to know that thoughtful management of those relationships can yield positive results.

40|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a tight {{monetary}} {{environment for}} many health care consumer organisations. Government funding has often reduced or become tied {{with so many}} strings {{that it is difficult}} for consumer groups to advocate any policies or positions {{different from those of the}} government providing funds. Consumer organisations have therefore looked further for sources of funding and a key potential source has been the pharmaceutical industry. At first glance these “consumer/industry ” partnerships seem like a winner. There is the potential for a great deal of money to flow to consumer organisations and the voice of consumers may influence the product manufacturers to address consumer concerns. Though other articles have dealt with how such arrangements can work, this article will look at the dangers and risks in such relationships, drawing on experiences that have already occurred in this and other sectors. For me, the issue of consumers receiving funding from pharmaceutical companies brings to mind the fable about the scorpion asking the horse for a ride across the river. The horse is fearful that the scorpion will sting it, but the scorpion reassures the horse that he won’t hurt it. The horse also reasoned that the scorpion will not sting it and risk drowning.

Schools have the right and indeed the responsibility to develop safe school climates to protect the safety of students and teachers, as well as the integrity of learning Yet the data indicate that it is relatively rare for students to pose a serious danger to themselves or others. In states like Texas, serious safety concerns trigger a "non-discretionary" mandatory removal, but these represent less than 5 % of all disciplinary removals from school. While exclusion on grounds of safety is infrequent, students are routinely removed from school for minor offenses like tardiness, truancy, using foul language, disruption, and violation of the dress code. Of course, public school educators are also responsible for ensuring the integrity of the learning environment and attend to misbehavior that does not raise safety concerns. There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are circumstances where removing a student from a classroom is helpful to de-escalate a conflict, or to pursue an intervention outside the classroom with the support of an administrator, a counselor, parent(s) or community members.

There is <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a need to}} assist students who are unprepared for college-level work. Little research has been carried out on the effectiveness of programs that have been designed to help individuals enrolled in developmental education courses. This study examined one innovative approach to developing reading competency at a California community college. Data were gathered from students (N= 60). Demographic variables were hypothesized to account for differences in academic performance, and statistical tools used incorporated a variety of multivariate analysis models. Outcomes provided initial data indicating the effectiveness of this new intervention as a way of approaching developmental reading.

Change is on the horizon for HEMS and there is no better time than now to find and fix the flaws in our system. The leaders in the HEMS community are researching and investigating how and where these changes must be made, but their reviews and evaluations are being done exclusively here in the United States. In attempts to approach this issue at a different angle, a project was initiated at the University of Pittsburgh through the Center for Emergency Medicine of Western Pennsylvania (CEM) and the University of Pittsburgh Honors College (UHC). This project attempts to examine the variance in CRM methods employed by HEMS programs outside the United States, the efficacy of implementing those methods, and some of the best practices applied by these programs.

But in reality, it is not only such diabetes specialists, but also HCPs of all sorts who will come into contact with patients with diabetes or {{be in a position to}} affect the incidence of diabetes by encouraging lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of develop-ing diabetes. Evidence-based standards for dia-betes care and its associated risk fac-tors have been establish and dissemi-nated, yet limited progress has been made in reducing the risk factors asso-ciated with the complications of dia-betes. 2 Diabetes is a complex disease, and there are multiple reasons why the established patient targets for blood pressure, lipid, and glucose lev-els have not been met. These include but are not limited to medication costs, the burden of living with a chronic disease, systems issues related to the delivery of care, lack of patient education, limited provider time, and failure of providers to maximize med-ication adjustments. 3 Another factor is the question of whether HCPs have adequate knowl-edge, skills, attitudes, and value train-ing to provide optimal diabetes care. Are today’s graduates from our HCP schools adequately prepared to pro-vide patient-centered, culturally appropriate, evidence-based diabetes care? Do these students recognize the importance of the interdisciplinary team necessary to provide the long-term support needed by individuals with diabetes and their families?
