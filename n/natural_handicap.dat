The annual payment for mountain areas is maximum 250 € per hectare; higher payments may be granted in certain areas in justified cases.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{agricultural}} areas with <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps,</b> the European Commission proposed a set of biophysical criteria. In this report all criteria were applied to the Dutch agricultural areas. The application of the criteria showed that four criteria led to the delineation of areas with <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps.</b> The handicaps were soil drainage, texture, chemical properties and slope. The criteria for low temperature, heat stress, rooting depth and soil moisture balance were not applicable to the Dutch agricultural soils. All results were aggregated to LAU 2 units (municipality). An area at the scale of LAU 2 units was considered affected by significant <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps</b> if at least 66 % of the Utilised Agricultural Areas met {{at least one of}} the biophysical criteria.

40|$|The Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) Directive (75 / 268) {{which was}} {{introduced}} in 1975, was the first common European instrument of regional agricultural structural policy. LFAs are areas where agriculture is hampered by permanent <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps.</b> The major objectives were to ensure the continuation of farming, thereby maintaining a minimum population level and preserving scenic landscapes and environmentally valuable habitats. In the Netherlands, the LFA measure is used as an additional payment, to compensate farmers for negative economic effects due to the conservation of these <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps.</b> It was not implemented as a stand alone policy, but is linked to measures aiming at active nature and landscape conservation management. In this paper, the effects will be examined of the regulations aiming at the conservation of <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps</b> on farm businesses within LFAs, when comparing them to farm businesses outside LFAs, where these regulations and handicaps do not exist. The main data source that was used is the Farm Accountancy Data Network. Reference groups of farms were compiled {{with the use of}} the simple and multiple imputation approach in Stars (Statistics for Regional Studies). Both analyses were tested with the use of a parametric and a nonparametric test. When comparing the results of both analyses, it can be concluded that there is no evidence that there is a statistical difference in family farm income corrected for and not corrected for LFA payment between the LFA farm businesses and the reference groups. Based on these findings it can be concluded that the size of the compensatory allowances is small and there is no evidence that it has a significant effect on the family farm income of LFA farm businesses. The main purpose of the Dutch LFA policy is to compensate farm businesses for negative economic effects due to the conservation of <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps.</b> Although this may be true for some individual farms, based on the methods used in this paper, it appears not to be the case for the collectivity of LFA premium beneficiaries as a whole.

30|$|Since 1975, the {{designation}} of Less-Favoured Areas (LFAs) within the CAP recognises the specific features of areas presenting agro-ecological constraints (lack of water, climate, unfavourable soil and terrain characteristics, short crop season and tendencies of depopulation), including mountainous or hilly features. However, pastoralism in the EU is mostly associated with mountainous ecosystems areas which exist in southern {{as well as in}} northern Europe, where mobile livestock rearing is also practiced outside mountainous environments. LFAs benefit from different forms of compensatory allowances, i.e. the LFA payments - now called <b>Natural</b> <b>Handicap</b> Payments, and from a number of payments for structural adjustment.

30|$|Through {{the second}} axis of this pillar, farmers could receive {{compensation}} for sustainable land management, for instance, putting into practice agricultural {{activities that are}} more environmentally demanding than legally mandatory requirements. Typical instances for pastoralists include those of High Nature Value (HNV) areas, which mainly consist of semi-natural grasslands and are managed under farming systems characterised by low stocking densities, low levels of agro-chemical inputs and often labour intensive management practices such as shepherding. Examples of HNV farmland are alpine meadows and pasture. These low-intensity farming systems {{are associated with a}} high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European conservation concern (EC 2006 a).

40|$|In {{the long}} term, {{productivity}} and especially productivity growth are necessary {{conditions for the}} survival of farms and the food industry in Finland. The <b>natural</b> <b>handicap</b> and small farm size are challenges, but farmers are further challenged by the decoupling of supports and their transformation into direct income payments. Additionally, farmers actions are limited by some institutional settings that substantially reduce incentives to improve productivity. Technical progress was found to drive the increase in productivity on grain farms in Finland. The scale had only a moderate effect and for the whole study period (19762006) the effect was close to zero. Total factor productivity (TFP) increased, depending on the model, by 0. 61. 7 % per year. The results demonstrated that the increase in productivity was hindered by the policy changes introduced in 1995. The cumulative increase in TFP over the study period was at the same level as the measured yearly changes in TFP. The results highlight the nature of grain farming in Finland as well as the challenges in simultaneously taking into account the general trend and yearly variation in TFP. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the common European criteria on the Less Favoured Areas (LFA) delineation in the Czech Republic (CR) and compares it with currently used point evaluation system. Further, it compares {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} both delineation systems from various points of view and concerning the needs of common agricultural policies. In the Czech Republic, a system of point evaluation of the agricultural land productivity based on the Evaluated soil-ecological units (ESEU) is used for delineation of the other than mountain LFA since 2001. Within the programme period 2014 – 2020, the European Commission proposes to delineate the other than mountain LFA using a single set of criteria, common for all the member states. Some criteria of the <b>natural</b> <b>handicap</b> proposed by the European Commission (EC) can be derived directly from the ESEU five-cipher code and from the soil maps. The comparison clearly shows that the current Czech system of point evaluation of the productivity of agricultural land can express better the influence of worse soil and climatic conditions on the limitations of the agricultural use of the land than the system proposed by the EC. Additionally, the ESEU point evaluation can express also the effect of simultaneous influence of more factors, which may thus increase or decrease the final ESEU point values. Conversely, it is necessary to remark that the land quality evaluation based on ESEU is rather complicated and not easily understandable for the wide public. Also, it cannot be applied in all the EU countries...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWine-growing {{areas are}} agro-systems {{examples}} where the production is {{highly dependent on}} environmental constraints. Climate change is a major stress added to those that already weigh on viticulture (White et al. 2006). If climate change is not disputed, it is the vine-grower capacity {{to take advantage of}} their environment and agricultural practices that now need to be explored. A corpus of scientific studies emerged in the literature to tackle these issues with methodologies as diverse as genetics and vine phenology (Duchêne et al. 2012), social aspects (Viguié, Lecocq, et Touzard 2014), or spatial-explicit climatology (Quénol et al. 2014). Mountainous territories are particularly good examples of complex systems that present local adaptation possibilities. The mountain environment is often perceived by vine-growers, as a <b>natural</b> <b>handicap</b> which must be lived with. The Banyuls-Collioure AOC (Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée or ’controlled designation of origin’) in the Pyrénées-Orientales area of France, can be seen as one of those places where human has been able to form emblematic landscapes. The fact that the system is set in a cooperative context also brings its share of stimulation and constraints for the territory (Draperi et Touzard 2003). This area is representative of the southern part of France where most of the wine production is made by small-scale vine-growers who are mainly organized in cooperatives. Meanwhile, questions of adaptation to climate change are becoming increasingly pressing (Van Leeuwen et al. 2013), particularly in the south of France and Mediterranean Basin. What would be the future of these areas if tomorrow the mountain environment was no longer perceived as a constraint, but rather as a land of refuge to face climate change?We will explore this question via a spatially-explicit agent-based model, by focusing on the self-organization strategies implemented by agents to meet the cooperative’s quality requirements. We have created a simulation environment, built from geographic information system data, field surveys and economic values related to the Banyuls-Collioure AOC area. This work has two aims considering climate change:   1) to attempt to provide global insight into how a mountainous vine-growing area can react and adapt to new challenges, and 2) to investigate cooperative policies and their implication on the vineyard landscape stability that can be a source of local development...|$|E

Foot handicaps were relatively rare and showed no seasonal trends. There was no effect of any handicap type on body condition or return rates of male kestrels.

40|$|The new Biodiversity Strategy of the EU (European Commission, 2011) aims to {{halt the}} loss of {{biodiversity}} and also the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020. As it has been proved that focusing only at protected areas and species is not enough, semi-natural and agricultural land are also targeted in the strategy. (Maes et al., 2011) Though the effects of extensive agricultural activity are complex and local nature conservation objectives and trade-offs between different ecosystem services {{have to be taken}} into account (Fors et al., 2012), good management practices may turn trade-offs into opportunities and can maintain ecosystem functions (Power, 2010). Our aim was to compare the capacity of less favoured agricultural areas for delivering various ecosystem services to other (more productive) agricultural areas at EU level. Less favoured areas are distinguished based on an EU scheme, ‘less favoured areas’ (LFA, Articles of Council Regulation (EC) 1305 / 2013) which designates areas where agricultural production or activity is more difficult because of <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps</b> and therefore there is a significant risk of agricultural land abandonment.

40|$|Why analyse {{the spatial}} {{impacts of the}} CAP? The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the single largest policy of the EU in {{expenditure}} terms, accounting for 44 per cent of the budget in 19982. Its basic remit is for increased agricultural productivity, a fair standard of living for those engaged in agriculture, stable markets, assured supplies and reasonable prices (Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome). The redistribution of wealth from prosperous to poorer countries and regions is not overtly a CAP objective. The nearest the CAP comes to such a focus is in the LFA Directive, {{where one of the}} objectives is to “maintain a viable agricultural commu-nity and thus help develop the social fabric of rural areas by ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers and by offsetting the effects of <b>natural</b> <b>handicaps</b> in less-favoured areas;… ” (EU Regulation 950 / 97). However, whether intentional or not, all sectoral policies have significant (sometimes substantial) spa-tial impacts, which either reduce or exacerbate regional disparities in prosperity and income. This paper attempts to assess the livestock subsidy regime of the CAP in Scotland, and the proposed future reforms, in terms of their uninten-tional regional impact. The context for this analysis is the EU’s cohesion objective (a basic pillar of the Treaty of Union) together with the more recent focus on spatial plannin...|$|R

It has been compiled for decision-makers with no specialised knowledge of land evaluations and the aim is to give an overview of methods and soil and climate criteria, which are applied for classifying areas less favourable for agriculture in Europe. The report is part of the Joint Research Centre¿s technical support to DG Agriculture and Rural Development in their preparatory work to find a new definition for classifying the EU Other/intermediate Less Favoured Areas to be implemented after 2010. The report includes standardised descriptions of selected land evaluation methods known internationally, namely: The Land Capability Classification, The Framework for Land Evaluation, the Agro-ecological Zoning Methodology, the Agricultural Problem Land Approach and the Expert System for Constraints to Agricultural Production in Europe. Criteria used in these methods and examples of applications and results are included, with preferences to applications on the European level. An overview of land evaluation methods and criteria, which are currently applied for indicating low land productivity by the Member States for their classification of the Other Less Favoured Areas are included. Finally, a summary of the reviewed methods and criteria and a discussion of issues of importance in the ongoing work on identifying common biophysical criteria for the Other Less Favoured Areas are provided.

Many authorities view the disease as inexorably progressive with a high probabil-ity of advancing over time to cirrhosis and occasionally hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and, therefore, likely to be responsible for causing death. Others regard chronic hepatitis C as having a variable outcome, the majority of infected persons not dying from the disease, but more likely from the comorbid conditions that so often accompany infection by this agent, or from more common medical conditions. Disagreements probably derive from the manner of conduct of the study and the populations studied. Efforts to determine <b>natural</b> history are <b>handicapped</b> by the primary characteristics of the disease, namely that its onset rarely is recognized and its course is prolonged exceedingly. Thus, different outcomes have come from retrospective rather than from prospective studies, but both have concluded that at least 20 % of chronically infected adults develop cirrhosis within 20 years.
