The Wilts & Dorset bus company has a county wide network with frequent services linking major towns and a limited service in rural locations. The First Group operate buses in the Weymouth and Bridport area, including: a regular route along the A35 from Weymouth to Axminster, which helps {{to compensate for the}} missing rail link west of Dorchester; and the Jurassic Coast service, one of the longest bus routes in the UK, which provides through travel from Poole to Exeter, exploiting a popular tourist route. Yellow Buses are the main providers of routes within the South East Dorset Conurbation. Damory Coaches is one of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> that provide access to more rural communities.|$|E

40|$|Summary. In {{the paper}} we prove two inequalities {{involving}} Gelfand <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> with values in a Hilbert space. The first inequality is a Rade-macher {{version of the}} main result in [Pa-To- 1] which relates the Gelfand <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> an <b>operator</b> from a Banach space X into l ~ with a certain Rade-macher average for the dual operator. The second inequality states that the Gelfand <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> an <b>operator</b> u from l ~ into a Hilbert space satisfy the inequality k 1 / 2 Ck(U) ~ C H u 11 (log(1 + N/k)) 1 / 2 where C is a universal constant. Several applications of these inequalities in the geometry of Banach spaces are given. O...|$|R

25|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> each ran a {{small number}} of motor or steam buses in the area. In July 1914 the Torquay Tramways Company ordered three {{single-deck}} buses but they were diverted away from Torquay by the government before delivery because of the impending war. After the war was over, a new order was placed in July 1919. The first three started to operate between Torre (where they connected with the trams) and Newton Abbot on 3 May 1920. More buses were delivered during the month and on 20 May the route was extended from Torre down to The Strand, and new routes ran from The Strand to Shaldon and from Newton Abbot to Dawlish. In 1921 routes were added from Paignton to Brixham and from Torquay to Buckfastleigh via Newton Abbot and Ashburton.|$|E
25|$|Partly due to low {{awareness}} {{among the}} general population and prohibitive equipment costs, the number of licensed amateur radio operators did not increase significantly {{over the next two}} decades, numbering fewer than a thousand by 1970. CW (Morse code) and AM were the predominant modes at that time. The electronic equipment was mostly valve-based, obtained from Indian army surpluses. During the mid-1960s, the modes of operation saw a change from Amplitude Modulation to Single Side Band (SSB) as the preferred communication mode. By 1980, the number of amateur radio operators had risen to 1,500. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, waived the import duty for wireless equipment. After this, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> rose steadily, and by 2000 there were 10,000 licensed ham operators. As of 2007, there are more than 17,000 licensed users in India.|$|E

25|$|The {{outdated}} {{layout of}} the half-cab single deck and its low seating capacity exercised the minds of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> from the mid-1950s. Barton Transport converted PS1s to 27ft 6in long double-deckers and Tiger PS2s, including the former City coach to 30ft double deckers, the later ones carrying fully fronted Northern Counties double-deck bodies. Yorkshire Traction, in the BET group did systematic conversions of most of their fleet of Tigers from about 1955-63, using Charles H. Roe or Northern Counties bodies, Yorkshire Woollen District later following suit. Yorkshire Traction also oversaw the rebodying of five PS2s for Stratford Blue Motors, costed refurbishing the chassis at £500 and purchasing the bodies at £3,000 per bus {{at a time when}} a complete PD2 would cost over £5,000. Alexander took the running units from its 17 OPS2s in 1961 and fitted them into new Titan PD3 frames, then fitted units from scrapped PS1s into the former OPS2s. When fitted with new Alexander bodies the recycled double-deckers could only be distinguished from similar new deliveries in that they retained the traditional radiator and bonnet from the Tigers whilst the new buses had full-width bonnets. Ulster Transport Authority also rebodied many of its Tigers in the 1950s, using new Leyland Titan PD2 chassis frames and Metro-Cammell bodyframes completed at UTA's Belfast coachworks. CIÉ stripped a late batch of OPS3s of their units and purchased new Titan PD3 frames and St Helens Style glassfibre bonnets, and had the vehicles assembled in 1961-62 complete with Park Royal body frames by a company called Commercial Road Vehicles who were renting part of the former Great Northern Railway (Ireland) central works in Dundalk. These 'R900' Titans were CIÉ's last front-engine double-deckers, again the R series had started in 1934 with Dublin United Transport.|$|E

500|$|The {{stranding}} of Symphony Angel in {{the desert}} and the Mysteron assault on Cloudbase posed several technical challenges to the special effects department, {{under the supervision of}} Derek Meddings. A shot depicting the jet of Destiny Angel shooting past the grounded Symphony required close collaboration between the puppet operators and the effects technicians (the former controlling the wired Symphony marionette, the latter staging the flyby of the scale model interceptor). The Mysteron spacecraft design was based on the appearance of conventional, [...] "saucer-shaped" [...] UFOs as reported during the 1960s. To make it appear that the objects are spinning in mid-air, Meddings added [...] "veins" [...] to each model to reflect light directed onto the set. Only the foreground of the high-altitude attack sequence was populated by scale models; since the department lacked the necessary <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators,</b> small light bulbs were fitted to the backdrop to give the impression of a larger fleet.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} {{was widely}} praised by critics. Chris Carter from Destructoid praised the game's open-ended nature, which made each match unpredictable {{and helped the}} experience to stay fresh even after {{an extended period of}} playing. GameSpot's Scott Butterworth appreciated the title for allowing players to make use of their creativity in approaching a mission. James Davenport from PC Gamer echoed this thought, and he described Siege as a [...] "psychological race" [...] in which players are constantly trying to outwit their opponents. Ryan McCaffery from IGN also praised the tactical possibilities, which make the game [...] "tense and riveting". The large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> available for players to choose were praised by both Carter and Matt Bertz from Game Informer, who commented that they added depths and variety to the game and that players could experiment to see which pairs of operators can complement each other. However, McCaffery was disappointed by the lack of variety of game modes, and commented that most players usually neglect the mode's objectives and opted to simply eliminate their opponents. Terrorist Hunt received divisive opinions from critics. Carter thought that it was more relaxing, and Butterworth thought it was exhilarating. However, Bertz criticized its lack of variety, weak artificial intelligence, and its less-intense nature when compared with the player-versus-player modes. Martin Robinson from Eurogamer also noted that the mode only ran at 30 frames per second, which limited its appeal.|$|E

It was painted in a Brunswick green livery, matching the ex-South Australian Railways carriages also restored for these services. After Australian Vintage Travel folded in 1986, R 766 was acquired by a syndicate of shareholders ("766 Syndicate") and leased to Steamrail Victoria. In 1994, Steamrail volunteers re-painted R 766 in a maroon livery based on that of the London Midland and Scottish Railway, before the locomotive was leased to West Coast Railway (and repainted in the WCR corporate livery) in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|Records exist of a ferry service {{across the}} River Mersey between Birkenhead {{on the west}} bank and Liverpool on the east since the middle ages. In 1332 the monks of Birkenhead Priory were granted {{exclusive}} rights to operate a ferry; following the dissolution of the monasteries these rights passed through a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> eventually to the township of Birkenhead. It is recorded that Marc Isambard Brunel suggested a road tunnel when designing the Birkenhead docks and from the 1850s a railway tunnel under the Mersey was proposed several times. The Mersey Pneumatic Railway received Royal Assent for a single line pneumatic railway in 1866 but failed to raise the necessary capital. In 1871 the Mersey Railway was given the necessary permissions for an orthodox two track railway connecting the Birkenhead Railway near their [...] station through a tunnel under the Mersey to an underground station serving Liverpool. However the company found it difficult to raise the necessary funds until Major Samuel Isaac undertook to build the railway in 1881.
