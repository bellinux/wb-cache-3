500|$|After she {{was awarded}} the Nobel Peace Prize, there was praise, but also some disapproval of the {{decision}} to award it to her. A Norwegian jurist, Fredrik Heffermehl, commented on being awarded the Nobel Prize: [...] "This is not for fine people who have done <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> and are glad to receive it. All of that is irrelevant. What Nobel wanted was a prize that promoted global disarmament." ...|$|E
500|$|James Robinson, {{the script}} editor for Planet B {{said that one}} of the main {{advantages}} of a series such as this is that it can be set anywhere saying, [...] "One week it's westerns, one week it's full-on sci-fi space operas, and that's one of the <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> about the best sci-fi concepts. I think, you know, the Doctor Who's and the Quantum Leap's, you kind of get a different show each week." ...|$|E
500|$|Geoff Johns {{confirmed}} on his Twitter {{account that}} the film had ended principal photography on August 6, 2010 and entered post-production. In an interview with MTV News, director Martin Campbell {{was asked about the}} film's effects-heavy epic scale and commented [...] "It's daunting, just the process, (there are) something like 1,300 visual shots, it's mind-blowing, quite honestly". When asked about the constructs created from the power rings, Campbell stated [...] "One of the <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> is, we'll all sit down and say, 'Well, {{what are we going to}} do here?' Really, it's as much as your imagination can go to make the constructs". The studio also confirmed to MTV News {{that the film}} would have a 3-D release.|$|E

500|$|Among {{these was}} Bette Davis, {{one of the}} studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: [...] "No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. [...] The power. The glory. And he was in {{business}} to make money." [...] Davis revealed that, {{after the birth of}} her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. [...] "We became father and child, no question about it." [...] she said. [...] "He told me I didn't have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> were said about him." [...] Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of Errol Flynn. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of Captain Blood, even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, The Charge of the Light Brigade, Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.|$|E
500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair {{of us want to}} get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot would have got over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

[...] The A.V.

[...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Emily Exton gave the episode a positive review, writing that {{it was fun to}} see [...] "the resemblances between all the moms and their kids" [...] and enjoyed Will Ferrell's cameo here. At the beginning of his review, Adam Mersel of TV Guide said that this episode was not funny and was [...] "amused, a bit confused, and left wanting more." [...] After recapping the episode he said that he took his comments back, explaining that the episode [...] "did have laughs." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepiwall for HitFix wrote this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't a very funny episode of the show... yet it did some <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> in trying to pull Liz {{and some of the other}} characters back into reality." [...] Sepinwall commented that Tracy and Jenna's stories with their mothers were [...] "nice grounded moments for the show's two broadest main characters, and the sort of thing 30 Rock needs to do with them a few times a season." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad liked this episode better than the previous episode [...] "Argus", enjoyed Elaine Stritch's return as Jack's mother, and that Tracy's story with Novella Nelson was [...] "actually well done", explaining that his situation makes sense in the TGS world. The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that [...] "The Moms" [...] was [...] "fun but lighter than air, content to string together a mild plot with a series of good jokes and callbacks." [...] Nick Catucci for New York magazine was positive about the episode, and reported that Tracy and Novella Nelson had the best chemistry of the night.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{while he}} was {{traveling}} to Philadelphia from Pakistan, Gilani was arrested by police in Frankfurt, West Germany after two kilos of heroin were found hidden in a false bottom in his suitcase. Gilani quickly made a plea deal when his case was {{handed over to the}} U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, agreeing to surrender his partners in Philadelphia in exchange for a lighter sentence. Gilani's cooperation earned him four years in prison while his two associates were sentenced to eight and ten years. At his sentencing hearing, the judge made the following statement: [...] "It's up to you, Mr. Gilani, to do what you can with the rest of your life. You are still a young man. You can either take advantage of this opportunity. Your mother, your lawyer, people said some <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> about you, but what you did, not only to yourself, but to perhaps thousands, hundreds of victims, heroin users in this country is a terrible thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} the fourth Test of the series against India in 1962 that Nurse was given another {{opportunity}} at Test level. Nurse was made only one run in the first innings and in the secon innings was 46 not {{out at the end of}} the matchthe West Indies won by 7 wickets. Nurse's next opportunity was with the West Indies team to England in 1963 but again he was affected by an injury that kept him lame for the greater part of the tour. He did not play a Test match but there was some qualified praise for his efforts in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: [...] "Nurse took a long time to justify the <b>nice</b> <b>things</b> claimed for him. He got himself out far too often through always being in too big a hurry to get on with the scoring, but in August he looked a very fine player." [...] He was given another opportunity to succeed in the sub-continent with a Commonwealth XI tour of Pakistan in 1963. Nurse scored 369 runs in six matches on tour including 126 not out in the final match against Pakistan at Dacca Stadium.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, a Tumblr post from user virjn {{generated}} media controversy, as it claimed Green is [...] "a creep who panders to {{teenage girls}} {{so that he}} can amass some weird cult-like following." [...] Other users commented on the post, criticizing his writing and tagging Green to bring the post to his attention. Green responded to the post, defending himself, stating, [...] "Throwing that kind of accusation around is sick and libelous and most importantly damages the discourse around the actual sexual abuse of children." [...] Green added that he would use the social media website less often, stating, [...] "I'm not angry or anything like that. I just need some distance for my well-being." [...] Fellow young-adult authors, Rainbow Rowell and Maggie Stiefvater came to Green's defense. Stiefvater wrote on Tumblr, [...] "You can have your own opinions on Green's books and Internet presence, {{but the fact remains that}} he is a very real positive influence on thousands of teens. You're not just making sure you can't have <b>nice</b> <b>things.</b> You're taking away other people's nice things." [...] In a subsequent email to USA Today, Stiefvater stated, [...] "I had to say something. Not because of the nature of the posts, although they were distasteful and borderline libel. But because the grotesquerie was being force-fed to the author." ...|$|E

He added: [...] "Sadly, this sentiment has been plaguing Thailand for at least a decade — the belief that those {{on the other side of}} the political divide are not just wrong, but are enemies that need to be 'removed'". He pointed out that under the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, [...] "some 2 million of the 8-million population were killed for the sake of a political ideology that saw 'the other' as an enemy that had to be eradicated". Although [...] "Thailand is far from becoming another killing field of that scale," [...] stated Pravit, [...] "the seeds of mutual destruction are quite visible as they continue being nurtured by hate speech on social media and watered by remarks from people like Prayuth".
