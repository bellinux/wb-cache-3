We show that the approach of not requiring non-Bt cotton as a refuge is defensible given initial conditions and parameters calibrated to China's cotton production environment. Of special importance is the existence of natural refuge crops. The <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> costs associated with implementing a refuge policy is also considered.

40|$|This {{working paper}} aims {{to justify the}} need to {{research}} into the operations, supervision and monitoring mechanisms of facilities management outsourcing. From the findings, the research proposes to develop a contractual framework for managing the facilities outsourcing contract. The objective is to help ensure that the services provided meet the requirement of the users and customers. The framework will be developed based on the best practice in international environment. Outsourcing is an organizational agenda. Its performance will strategically affect {{the business of the}} organization. Outsourcing involves a number of parties namely the client, service provider, users and customers of the client organization. This <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> requires for suitable operational, supervisory and monitoring mechanisms to succeed. It has to fulfill the benefits expected by the client. This <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> also has certain risks and has the potential to fail the outsourcing venture. The management of outsourcing of facilities management comes with pressures from the above transacting parties including the technologies and business of the client organization. Researches in the practice of outsourcing have also focused on the factors to ensure successful facilities management outsourcing. However, there is still the need to investigate further the issue to help the client and service provider to achieve the benefits of outsourcing especially in the health industry. None of the researches were conducted from the combined perspectives of the client, service provider, users and users. In fact there were also no researches conducted with the client, service provider and users as respondents. Only one research took the view of both the client and service provider. The rest of the researches focused on the view of the client or users separately. In Malaysia, the researches conducted were in logistics and facilities management (i. e. building cleaning). Therefore, there is so much opportunity for researches into outsourcing practice including in facilities management. At the same time there are many big outsourcing projects implemented in the public as well as private sectors. The government hospitals support services privatization project is an outsourcing project that is into its second-half of the 15 years concession period; the concession may be negotiable for further extension. There is the need to re-assess and re-evaluate the performance of the whole outsourcing contract to ensure it really meets the requirements and benefits expected by the users. The operations, supervision and monitoring mechanisms need to be re-looked to identify the weaknesses and to come-up with the solutions so that the users (doctors, medical assistants, nurses, attendants and other health workers) are satisfied with services that meet their requirement which is necessary for them to provide quality health care to the patients...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{availability}} of large data sets covering single transactions on financial markets {{has created a}} new branch of econometrics which has opened up a new door of looking at the microstructure of financial markets and its dynamics. The specific <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> data such as the randomness of arrival times of trades, the discreteness of price jumps and significant intraday seasonalities, call for specific econometric tools combining both time series techniques as well as microeconomtric techniques arising from discrete choice analysis. This paper serves as an introduction to the econometrics of transaction data. We survey {{the state of the art}} and discuss its pitfalls and opportunities. Special emphasis is given to the analysis of the properties of data from various assets and trading mechanisms. We show that some characteristics of the transaction price process such as the dynamics of intertrade durations are quite similar across various assets with different liquidity and regardless whether an asset is traded electronically or on the floor. However, the analysis of other characteristics of transaction prices process such as volatility requires a careful choice of the appropriate econometric tool. Empirical evidence is presented using examples from stocks traded electronically and on the floor at the German Stock exchange and from BUND future trading at the LIFFE and the EUREX. ...|$|E
40|$|Policy (CAP) has {{introduced}} several new policy tools, among which cross-compliance. The introduction {{of this new}} policy entails production costs, along {{with other types of}} costs arising at the farm level: administrative, information, organisational costs, called transaction costs. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and to assess them. The literature on transaction costs in agriculture has, until now, mainly been devoted to the voluntary measures implemented within the framework of the European agri-environmental policy. The first part of the paper intends to use this literature to apply the private transaction costs analysis to the issue of cross compliance. The second part attempts to assess these costs. On the basis of a survey conducted in 2006 among a sample of 39 farmers from the Midi Pyrenees French region, a descriptive statistical analysis (Multiple Classification Analysis- MCA) permits to associate farmer profiles with different levels of incurred transaction costs. These profiles reveal the impact which the farmers ’ responsibilities (professional networks) and the role of voluntary commitments previously undertaken may have on the nature and importance of transaction costs. This paper opens up new perspectives on the adoption criteria that should be taken into account in the evolution of agri-environmental regulations. It appears that growing administrative requirements could prompt farmers to outsource tasks which most of them carry out on their own today...|$|E
40|$|In {{large-scale}} fundraising campaigns {{based on}} direct mailings, typically less than 5 % of individuals donate to the charitable cause. We present evidence from two field experiments {{designed to measure}} the existence of transaction costs that inhibit charitable giving in such fundraising campaigns, and {{shed light on the}} nature of such transaction costs. The experiments are designed in conjunction with the Bavarian State Opera House. The first mail-out experiment was implemented over two stages using a within-subject design. We develop a theoretical framework that makes precise the identifying assumptions under which we can exploit this two-stage design to measure the following structural parameters among potential donors: (i) the share of donors who would make a strictly positive donation in the complete absence of transaction costs and (ii) the probability that a potential donor has sufficiently low transactions costs to make a strictly positive donation. Our results imply response rates to mail-out solicitations would almost double in the complete absence of transaction costs. The second field experiment provides more evidence on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>transaction</b> costs. We distinguish between ex ante transaction costs, which prevent the choice problem from being considered and ex post transaction costs, which prevent choices being implemented. We find that the likelihood of a donation being made increases by 26 % in response to even a small reduction in ex post transaction costs. ...|$|E
