5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{child in}} the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner {{described}} the man as white, dark-haired, 5ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, {{but they did not}} pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is required to produce it.|$|E

5|$|Spielberg wanted Donovan's death {{shown in}} one shot, {{so it would}} <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an actor having makeup applied between takes. Inflatable pads were applied to Julian Glover's {{forehead}} and cheeks that made his eyes seem to recede during the character's initial decomposition, {{as well as a}} mechanical wig that grew his hair. The shot of Donovan's death was created over three months by morphing together three puppets of Donovan in separate stages of decay, a technique ILM mastered on Willow (1988). A fourth puppet was used for the decaying clothes, because the puppet's torso mechanics had been exposed. Complications arose because Alison Doody's double had not been filmed for the scene's latter two elements, so the background and hair from the first shot had to be used throughout, with the other faces mapped over it. Donovan's skeleton was hung on wires like a marionette; it required several takes to film it crashing against the wall because not all the pieces released upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed that he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a military man, they felt he had the quality {{they were looking for}} in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E

50|$|The {{easiest way}} to achieve this {{animation}} is by drawing the selection using a pen pattern that contains diagonal lines. If the selection outline is only one pixel thick, the slices out of the pattern will then <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a dashed line, and the animation can easily be achieved by simply shifting the pattern one pixel sideways and redrawing the outline. The method has the disadvantage of <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> marching ants with selection borders that aren't parallel to the coordinate axes.|$|R
25|$|An {{improved}} {{knowledge of}} the action of reverse transcriptase has led to better nucleoside analogues to treat HIV infections. One of these drugs, lamivudine, has been approved to treat hepatitis B, which uses reverse transcriptase {{as part of its}} replication process. Researchers have gone further and developed inhibitors that do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> nucleosides, but can still block reverse transcriptase.|$|E

After a while Raphael Manfredi took over as the main software architect, and the client has been in active development ever since. Versions released after July 2002 do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the original Nullsoft client.|$|E

A hydrophobicity plot lacking any patterns which are common to possible membrane-spanning domains. The structures of other multimeric membrane proteins (such as diphtheria toxin) provide the answer to how PA manages to span the membrane. It is thought that PA acts like these multimeric membrane proteins that form β-barrels made from stretchs of both polar and non-polar amino acids from each monomer.|$|E

25|$|Round 5 was the Spanish Grand Prix and Montoya {{needed a}} good result but did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> getting it, so, after another poor qualifying, Montoya found himself down in 12th place. He {{made up for}} it by making a quick start by gaining five places and was up to sixth in the first corner (David Coulthard was {{starting}} {{from the back of}} the grid after stalling on the formation lap). He got ahead of Jacques Villeneuve in the second round of pit stops. He stayed on the track and climbed up to second due to a high attrition rate.|$|E
25|$|Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid or Negroid {{features}} may not {{be recognized}} as such in the United States {{in spite of the}} ethnic and racial diversity of most Hispanic American populations. Hispanics who do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the stereotypical Hispanic may have their ancestral status questioned or even challenged by others. Actors Martin Sheen, Alexis Bledel and Cameron Diaz, for example, are Hispanic even though they may be presumed not to be so because, being white, they do not fit the stereotype. If Hispanics with mostly Caucasoid features are to be considered Hispanic, they have stereotypical Mediterranean/Southern European appearance - olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes.|$|E
25|$|A pottery {{inscription}} of the Longshan culture {{discovered in}} Dinggong Village, Zouping County, Shandong contains eleven symbols that do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the direct ancestor of Chinese characters. Chinese scholar Feng Shi (馮時) argued in 1994 that this inscription {{can be interpreted}} as written by the Longshan people. Other scholars, like Ming Ru, are doubtful about attributing a Neolithic date to the inscription. The authenticity of these inscriptions is hotly disputed due to their appearance on a broken ceramic ware, an unusual feature among prehistorical text, as well as its unexpected relation to the Yi script, a modern writing system associated with an ethnic group in the southwestern China, thousands of miles and thousands of years apart from the Longshan culture in northern China.|$|E

25|$|The two McLaren {{drivers were}} the first two drivers out on the track for the initial fuel burning phase, and initially, Alonso was the fastest on the track. After {{the first set of}} pit stops it looked like Alonso was going to take the pole. On the last set of laps, Alonso was on a faster time than he was before, but Räikkönen was on a faster. Both of them {{completed}} their laps and Räikkönen came out on top, despite an error coming out of the final corner. Hamilton who had been sitting in fourth did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> he was very competitive during qualifying. In the last few seconds of the session he set the fastest lap and put himself on pole position, and {{he was the only one}} to break into the 1 minute 19 second margin.|$|E
25|$|Sullivan {{recalled}} {{that he had}} always been fascinated by the unlicensed traders who sold goods from suitcases in markets, and he based Del Boy on them. David Jason added other elements to the part, including Del's cheap gold jewellery and his camel-hair coat. The inspiration was taken from a similar man he had known when working as an electrician. Jason was a relatively late candidate for the part: Jim Broadbent (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as DCI Roy Slater) and Enn Reitel were earlier preferences. Broadbent turned down the role, due to the play he was acting in had moved. It was only when producer Ray Butt saw a repeat of Open All Hours that Jason was considered and, despite concerns that Jason had not previously had a leading television role, and that he and Lyndhurst did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> brothers, he was cast.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Dr Xun Zhou, a {{research}} fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, published doubts regarding the authenticity of the Kaifeng community. Zhou asserts that the apparent presence of the Jews was largely a Western cultural construct, which grew following the publication by James Finn of The Jews in China (1840) and The Orphan Colony of Jews in China (1874) whose initial research was based upon the accounts of the 17th century Jesuit missionaries. She maintains that the community had no Torah scrolls until 1851, when they suddenly appeared to be sold to eager Western collectors. She also states that drawings of the synagogue were doctored in the West because the original did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> one, and that the Kaifeng community claimed to have kept some Jewish practices since before they are known to have begun. Xun Zhou's conclusion is that the Kaifeng community was not Jewish in any meaningful sense.|$|E

500|$|The scenes {{featuring}} boar {{were originally}} {{planned to use}} actual, domesticated animals. Since bringing domesticated boar from continental United States was expensive, and the animals available in Hawaii did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> wild boar and rarely moved (the script required them to run in most scenes), the producers decided to use computer-generated boar instead, along with reaction shots from the actors and first-person sequences from the animals' point of view.|$|E
