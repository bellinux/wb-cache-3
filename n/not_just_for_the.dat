5|$|Buffalo {{inherited}} {{not only}} the status afforded his family, but also had skills praised in his grandfather Andaigweos. Noted for his abilities in hunting and battle, Buffalo was recognized as chief by his people because of his speaking and oratorical skills, which were highly valued in his culture. By the time the Ojibwa of Wisconsin and Minnesota started treaty negotiations with the US Government, Buffalo was {{recognized as one of}} the primary spokesmen for all the bands, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ojibwa from La Pointe.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{wrote the}} Dialogus ecclesiasticae institutionis, {{which was a}} legal code for the clergy, setting forth the proper {{procedures}} for many clerical and ecclesiastical issues including weregild for clerics, entrance to clerical orders, deposition from the clergy, criminal monks, clerics in court, and other matters. It survives as one complete manuscript, with a few excerpts in other manuscripts. Because Ecgbert was the senior archbishop in England {{after the death of}} Nothhelm in 739, {{it is possible that the}} Dialogus was intended <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Northumbrian church but for the entire church in England. The Dialogus details a code of conduct for the clergy and how the clergy was to behave in society. The exact date it was composed is unclear, but it was probably after 735, based on the mention of the archiepiscopal status of Ecgbert in one title as well as the internal evidence of the work. The historian Simon Coates saw the Dialogus as not especially exalting monks above the laity.|$|E

5|$|In eastern Europe, Romania built {{what were}} termed heroes' war grave cemeteries, either in {{existing}} heroes' cemeteries, on {{the sites of}} the World War I battles, or in new cemeteries symbolically placed {{on the edges of}} towns. The situation was somewhat different in Russia, however, where the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was used <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> war dead of World War I, but also for the casualties of the Civil War, and then the victims of the secret police. It was finally closed by the Bolsheviks in 1925 and turned into a park; subsequently, possibly on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the Eastern Orthodox church and the headstones were systematically destroyed until almost no trace of the cemetery remained.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2008 the Cubs {{won for the}} 10,000th time in {{the history}} of the {{franchise}} on the road against the Colorado Rockies. Like the 9,000th win, the 10,000th win came in a 76 victory at Coors Field. The Cubs were the second franchise to achieve 10,000 regular season wins; the San Francisco Giants/New York Giants were the first. The franchise flew a special 10,000th win flag along with a Cubs Win flag to commemorate the landmark achievement for the franchise. This was unusual <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 10,000th win, but also for flying the flag in reference to a road game. The special flag flew from the afternoon of April 24, 2008 until immediately prior to the next home game on April 29, 2008 at 7:05pm against the Milwaukee Brewers. After the flag was taken down, it was autographed by all members of the 2008 Chicago Cubs and auctioned off for charity.|$|E

The PKK demanded {{that it should}} be recognized as a legitimate entity and not as a terrorist organization. The PKK had been banned in Germany in 1993. If the PKK's demand had passed, {{it would be a big}} step for Damascus, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> water issues and Hatay demands, but also because a Western country was negotiating with a banned organization. It would be a big blow to Turkey as the inability to stop terrorism in the country could end with balkanization of the region.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Utensils (เครื่องราชูปโภค) is a {{separate}} category of items. The four items are made of gold: the Betel Nut Set (พานพระขันหมาก), the Water Urn (พระมณฑปรัตนกรัณฑ์), the Libation vessel (พระสุพรรณราช), and the Spittoon (พระสุพรรณศรี). By possessing such mundane items, which were all made from precious materials, the king can show off his wealth and status to his subjects. The utensils are always placed at {{either side of the}} king's throne during royal ceremonies. These items are of a personal natur, and are regarded as insignia of rank, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> king, but for his officials as well.

25|$|During {{two years}} of construction, the Basilica of the Holy Trinity was {{designated}} GECA, for Grande Espaço Coberto para Assembleias (Great Covered Space for Assemblies), owing to its relative importance. Due to its importance, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary, {{the church and the}} town, the architects' planners started a dialog with the local authority to study the best urban solution for its location. The area of Avenida D. José A. C. Silva was lowered in front the sanctuary, and a competition introduced into the urban area a pedestrian zone from Rua S. Vicente de Paulo and Avenida João XXIII, transforming this area into a boulevard, reducing transit and providing an artistic touch to the subterranean landscape. These change would result in the transformation of Fátima into a destination for pilgrims.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{there are}} Dhakis like Dhaki Gokul Chandra Das,of Maslondopur and Ashutosh Colony Habra, North 24 parganas,believs that the Dhak {{is similar to}} any other {{percussion}} instrument played in a concert or a stage performance, such as the Tabla,Pakhwaj,or Mridangam. If a Tabalchi can show case his talent on stage {{in front of a}} large audience, so can a Dhaki....He believes that the dhak can be played in accompaniment to any kind of music,including songs (Rabindra Sangeet), similar to the Tabla,and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Durga Puja or any other puja; and he has proved it. He now participates in stage performances with Pandit Tanmoy Bose and his group of talented musicians. Recently he also performed in a reality TV show,(Sa re Ga Ma Pa,) on Z Bangla, in accompaniment to songs.So it is hard time the Dhakis learnt to use their inheritant music in other ways, to make a living {{and at the same time}} to keep the art of playing the Dhak alive and enchant the world with their magical rhythms at times other than the Durga Puja. People need to recognise the Dhak as a percussion instrument no different than any other percussion instrument that can be seen on stage.|$|E
25|$|The first World Series {{game was}} a highly {{anticipated}} matchup between 2-time National League Cy Young Award winner (2008,2009) Tim Lincecum, against the 2008 American League Cy Young Award winner and heretofore undefeated in postseason play Cliff Lee. The pitching matchup {{turned out to be}} a sideline, as the Giants won the first game of the World Series by 11–7 over the Rangers, backed by Freddy Sanchez's three doubles, setting a World Series record for being the first player to hit three consecutive doubles in their first three at bats. The game also saw the Giants set the record for the most runs (6) scored in a single half-inning in a World Series since 1933. The next day, the Giants won game 2 of the World Series, crushing the Rangers 9–0 after the Rangers walked 4 in a row and allowed 7 runs to the Giants in the 8th inning. Matt Cain also had a dominant game, pitching 7 innings without giving up a run. The Giants went on to lose Game 3 in Arlington, Texas 4–2 after a 3-run home run from Ranger's rookie Mitch Moreland in the second inning, and a solo home run by Josh Hamilton in the fifth. Game 4 belonged to the Giants, as rookie left-handed starting pitcher Madison Bumgarner shut out the Rangers over eight innings with home runs by Aubrey Huff and Buster Posey propelling the team to a 4–0 victory. The Giants, along with Tim Lincecum, won Game 5 by a score of 3–1. Lincecum outdueled Cliff Lee in an every-pitch-matters matchup that was scoreless until Édgar Rentería hit a stunning three-run homer with two outs in the seventh inning. Nelson Cruz homered in the bottom half, but Lincecum returned to his wicked self and preserved the lead. Brian Wilson was brought in to pitch the 9th and produced a scoreless inning, allowing San Francisco to bring out a series of firsts, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Giants, but also for the city of San Francisco and the San Francisco Bay Area. Édgar Rentería was named World Series Most Valuable Player.|$|E

[...] He suggests that the poem acts to correct the views put forward in fragment 5: in that poem, Sappho prays to the Nereids, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> safe return of her brother but that [...] "whatever his heart desires be fulfilled"; in the Brothers Poem she recognises that such a broad request is out of the competence of the Nereids, and should more properly be addressed to the goddess Hera.|$|E
