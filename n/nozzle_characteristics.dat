At high flight speeds, the ram pressure ratio factors up the cold nozzle pressure ratio, causing the nozzle to choke.

40|$|Jet {{spreading}} enhancement with {{a certain}} coannular nozzle configuration has been explored. When the outer nozzle is flaired (i. e., made convergent-divergent) the ensuing jet spreads faster than the case where the outer nozzle is convergent. The spreading enhancement is most pronounced when the outer flow is run near 'transonic' condition, in an overexpanded state. Under this condition, the increased spreading takes place regardless of the operating conditions of the inner jet. This observation, first made in a small scale facility, has been confirmed and studied in some detail in a larger-scale facility. Results of the latter experiment are presented in this paper. The spreading increase is shown to be substantial and comparable to or better than that achieved by a lobed nozzle. Estimates based on idealized flow indicate {{that there is an}} accompanying thrust penalty - the actual penalty is expected to be less than the estimate but remains undetermined at this time. In both the earlier and the present experiments, the spreading increase has often been found to accompany a flow resonance. The nature of this resonance is addressed in this paper. It is shown that the spreading increase takes place even if the resonance is absent. Thus, flow excitation due to the resonance is ruled out as the underlying mechanism.

The experiments were conducted using two nozzles with different orifice diameters 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 mm and injection pressures (0. 3 - 4 MPa) which correspond to Rep = 7000 - 26 000. Two types of laser diagnostic techniques were utilized: shadowgraph and phase Doppler particle anemometry for a complete study of the atomization process. Measurements that {{were made in the}} spray in both axial and radial directions indicate that both velocity and average droplet diameter profiles are highly dependent on the <b>nozzle</b> <b>characteristics,</b> Weber number and Reynolds number. The spatial variation of diameter and velocity arises principally due to primary breakup of liquid films and subsequent secondary breakup of large droplets due to aerodynamic shear. Downstream of the nozzle, coalescence of droplets due to collision was also found to be significant. Different types of liquid film breakup were considered and found to match well with the theory. Secondary breakup due to shear was also studied theoretically and compared to the experimental data. Coalescence probability at different axial and radial locations was computed to explain the experimental results. The spray is subdivided into three zones: near the nozzle, a zone consisting of film and ligament regime, where primary breakup and some secondary breakup take place; a second zone where the secondary breakup process continues, but weakens, and the centrifugal dispersion becomes dominant; and a third zone away from the spray where coalescence is dominant. Each regime has been analyzed in detail, characterized by timescale and Weber number and validated using experimental data. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [URL]...|$|E

A Spraying System nozzle, AAASSTC 8 - 8, produced the optimum spray distribution with the detergent slurry at a temperature of 60 °C whilst operating at 1200 psi. With other fluids the Delevan 2. 2 SJ nozzle produced the optimum spray distribution operating at 1200 psi but with the Spraying Systems nozzles there was no clear-cut optimum set of conditions, ie. the nozzle and pressure varied depending upon the fluid being sprayed.

The model predictions for volumetric fiowrate, liquid sheet length and air core diameter showed good agreement with the experimentally determined results. However, the model predicted smaller droplet sizes than were produced experimentally due to inaccuracies identified in the initial assumptions...|$|E
40|$|O desgaste dos bicos de pulverização afeta, entre outras características, principalmente a vazão. Ensaio realizado com bicos de cone vazio tipo disco mostrou, em certos casos, aumentos superiores a 100 % sobre a vazão inicial, já nas primeiras 50 horas de operação. Evidentemente, isto também conduz a um aumento de mais de 100 % na quantidade de defensivos aplicados, caso o usuário não se aperceba do problema. Observou-se menor influência do aumento do orifício do disco sobre a vazão. Por outro lado, os helicóides apresentaram pronunciado desgaste, afetando diretamente a vazão. Esse desgaste ainda alterou a característica do cone de pulverização do bico, preenchendo o seu centro. Foi notada também redução do ângulo do cone, bem como aumento do tamanho das gotículas. In {{this paper}} it was studied the {{abrasive}} action of a copper oxichloride spray mixture on some disc type hollow cone spray nozzles under usual pressures. Changes in spray <b>nozzles</b> <b>characteristics</b> were noticed during {{the work as}} increasing in the flow-rate, decreasing in the spraying angle, and filling of the hollow cone with high density of spray droplets. The flow rate change is of main importance because if neglected it may contribute to excessive deposition of pesticides on the plants. Beyond the pesticides wastage it implies in great hazzard to environmental contamination and phyto-toxicity. Among the nozzles components tested the core showed higher wearing. The one made of brass was more sensitive to abrasive action of spray mixture than nylon ones, while that of stainless steel showed to be the strengthest. The influence of the nozzles wearing on the flow-rate, angle cone, and cone spray pattern was analyzed in function {{of the time of}} operation. To determine the droplet parameters, droplet analyses of new spray nozzles and after 100 hours of use were made...|$|R
40|$|An Axisymmetric Rocket Ejector Simulation (ARES) was {{developed}} to numerically analyze various configurations of an air augmented rocket. Primary and secondary flow field visualizations are presented and performance predictions are tabulated. A parametric study on ejector geometry is obtained following a validation of the flow fields and performance values. The primary flow is calculated using a quasi- 2 D, irrotational Method of Characteristics and the secondary flow is found using isentropic relations. Primary calculations begin at the throat and extend through the nozzle {{to the location of}} the first Mach Disk. Combustion properties are tabulated before analysis to allow for propellant property selection. Secondary flow calculations employ the previously calculated plume boundary and ejector geometry to form an isentropic solution. Primary and secondary flow computations are iterated along the new pressure distributions established by the 1 D analysis until a convergence tolerance is met. Thrust augmentation and Specific Impulse values are predicted using a control volume approach. For the validation test cases, the <b>nozzle</b> <b>characteristic</b> net is very similar to that of previous research. Plume characteristics are in good agreement but fluctuate in accuracy due to flow structure formulation. The individual unit processes utilized by the Method of Characteristics are found to vary their outputs by up to 0. 025 % when compared to existing sources. Rocket thrust and specific impulse are increased by up to 22 % for a static system and 15 % for an ejector flow at Mach 0. 5. Evidence of Fabri conditions were observed in the flow visualization and graphically through the performance predictions. It was determined that the optimum ejector divergence angle for an air augmented rocket greatly depends on the stagnation pressure ratio between the primary and secondary flows...|$|R
40|$|Two-dimensional wedge <b>nozzle</b> {{performance}} <b>characteristics</b> {{were investigated}} {{in a series}} of wind-tunnel tests. An isolated single-engine/nozzle model was used to study the effects of internal expansion area ratio, aftbody cowl boattail angle, and wedge length. An integrated twin-engine/nozzle model, tested with and without empenage surfaces, included cruise, acceleration, thrust vectoring and thrust reversing nozzle operating modes. Results indicate that the thrust-minus-aftbody drag performance of the twin two-dimensional nozzle integration is significantly higher, for speeds greater than Mach 0. 8, than the performance achieved with twin axisymmetric nozzle installations. Significant jet-induced lift was obtained on an aft-mounted lifting surface using a cambered wedge center body to vector thrust. The thrust reversing capabilities of reverser panels installed on the two-dimensional wedge center body were very effective for static or in-flight operation...|$|R
