From Glenridding a track known as The Rake leads to the eastern col, or the track past the former Greenside Mine leads to Nick Head, the western col.

500|$|The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were novel {{features}} for an American movie at the time. Stephen Holden from The New York Times {{commented that the}} film's editing had [...] "a jazzy, improvisational quality, and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback's alienation." [...] In The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African-American Talent, Determination, and Creativity, author S. Torriano Berry writes that the film's [...] "odd camera angles, superimpositions, reverse-key effects, box and matting effects, rack-focus shots, extreme zooms, stop-motion and step-printing, and an abundance of jittery handheld camera work all helped to express the paranoid <b>nightmare</b> <b>that</b> [...] life had become." ...|$|E
500|$|Media {{reaction}} to Social Credit's 1935 victory, {{in which it}} won 56 of 63 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, was almost uniformly negative. The Herald opined that [...] "the people of Alberta have made a most unfortunate decision and may soon see the folly of it." [...] Even the Albertan expressed its wish that social credit be first tried in [...] "Scotland, or Ethiopia or anywhere but Alberta." [...] Reaction across Canada was also negative; the St. Catharines Standard called the results [...] "a <b>nightmare</b> <b>that</b> passeth all understanding" [...] and the Montreal Star accused Albertans of voting for [...] "an untried man and a policy whose workings he ostentatiously refused to explain before polling day." [...] American newspapers were less restrained: the Chicago Tribune asked [...] "Greetings to the Canadians. Who's loony now?" [...] and the Boston Heralds headline screamed [...] "Alberta goes crazy".|$|E

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent <b>nightmare</b> <b>that</b> is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E
500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen {{who were killed}} in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. [...] "I can't regret the decision to go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic <b>nightmare</b> <b>that</b> unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," [...] he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile tears from Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{commercial}} {{performance of the}} album, Pornography was not well received by most music critics upon its release. NME reviewer Dave Hill was ambivalent towards the album, writing that it [...] "portrays and parades its currency of exposed futility and utterly naked fear with so few distractions or adornments, and so little sense of shame. It really piles it on. The Cure have applied themselves to catching a related collection of the very purest feelings endemeic to their age, and holding them right on the spot in their intangible, unspecified, unmanageable and most unpleasantly real form." [...] Adam Sweeting of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "It's downhill all the way, into ever-darkening shadows... passing through chilly marbled archways to the final rendezvous with the cold comfort of the slab". Dave McCullough of Sounds felt that despite a [...] "genuine talent still at work", Pornography [...] "has too much music too cluttered a backing for Smith's well-intended observance [...] Robert Smith seems locked in himself, a spiralling <b>nightmare</b> <b>that</b> leaves The Cure making a pompous sounding music that is, when all's said and done, dryly meaningless". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, derided Smith's [...] "glum" [...] lyrics and felt that he should [...] "cheer up". Rolling Stone critic J. D. Considine commented that the lyrics seem [...] "stuck in the terminal malaise of adolescent existentialism", concluding, [...] "Pornography comes off as the aural equivalent of a bad toothache. It isn't the pain that irks, it's the persistent dullness". Trouser Press Charles McCardell, on the other hand, found that the Cure [...] "imposes an order that at first seems contrary to the basic preconceptions of rock 'n' roll" [...] – noting that [...] "for them, lyrics are everything" [...] and that instruments had been relegated to [...] "merely creating atmosphere" [...] – and hailed Pornography as an [...] "uncompromising and challenging" [...] work." ...|$|E

2500|$|This second {{project was}} to be a choral symphony {{entitled}} Espace. In its original conception the text for the chorus was to be written by André Malraux. Later Varèse settled on a multi-lingual text of hieratic phrases to be sung by choirs situated in Paris, Moscow, Peking and New York City, synchronized to create a global radiophonic event. Varèse sought input on the text from Henry Miller, who suggests in The Air-Conditioned <b>Nightmare</b> <b>that</b> this grandiose conception—also ultimately unrealized—eventually metamorphosed into Déserts. With both these huge projects Varèse felt ultimately frustrated by the lack of electronic instruments to realize his aural visions. Nevertheless, he used some of the material from Espace in his short Étude pour espace, virtually the only work that had appeared from his pen for over ten years when it was premiered in 1947. According to Chou Wen-chung, Varèse made various contradictory revisions to ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite Thompson's {{revealing}} information, Colonel Henderson {{issued a}} Letter of Commendation to Captain Medina on March 27, 1968.

The Americal Division commander, Major General S. W. Koster, sent a congratulatory message to Company C. General William C. Westmoreland, the head of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), also congratulated Company C, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry for [...] "outstanding action", saying that they had [...] "dealt [...] enemy [...] heavy blow".

2500|$|Robert Englund {{continued}} {{his role as}} Krueger on October 9, 1988, in the television anthology series, Freddy's Nightmares. The show was hosted by Freddy, who did not take direct part {{in most of the}} episodes, but he did show up occasionally to influence the plot of particular episodes. Further, a consistent theme in each episode was characters having disturbing dreams. The series ran for two seasons, 44 episodes, ending March 10, 1990. Although most of the episodes did not feature Freddy taking {{a major role in the}} plot, the pilot episode, [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy", depicts the events of his trial, and his subsequent death at the hands of the parents of Elm Street after his acquittal. In [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy", though Freddy's case seems open and shut, a mistrial is declared based on the arresting officer, Lt. Tim Blocker, not reading Krueger his Miranda rights, which is different from the original <b>Nightmare</b> <b>that</b> stated he was released because someone forgot to sign a search warrant in the right place. The episode also reveals that Krueger used an ice cream van to lure children close enough so that he could kidnap and kill them. After the town's parents burn Freddy to death he returns to haunt Blocker in his dreams. Freddy gets his revenge when Blocker is put to sleep at the dentist's office, and Freddy shows up and kills him. The episode [...] "Sister's Keeper" [...] was a [...] "sequel" [...] to this episode, even though it was the seventh episode of the series. The episode follows Krueger as he terrorizes the Blocker twins, the identical twin daughters of Lt. Tim Blocker, and frames one sister for the other's murder. Season two's [...] "It's My Party And You'll Die If I Want You To" [...] featured Freddy attacking a high school prom date who stood him up twenty years earlier. He got his revenge with his desire being fulfilled in the process.|$|E
