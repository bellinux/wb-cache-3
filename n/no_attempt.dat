5|$|The {{wreck of}} Rusalka was {{claimed to have}} been found by divers of the Soviet EPRON salvage agency in 1932, but they made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to salvage it. EPRON's {{location}} does not match that of the ship as discovered in 2003.|$|E
5|$|A midget or fleet {{submarine}} attack. Extensive searches {{immediately following}} the sinking had failed to detect any enemy submarine, and the Allies had made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> at claiming the enormous propaganda value of sinking a capital ship in her home anchorage; consequently, this possibility was quickly discounted. Eyewitnesses also spoke of a reddish-brown fireball, which indicated a magazine explosion; this was confirmed during exploration of the wreck by divers.|$|E

5|$|After {{separating}} {{from the}} Atlas booster, Schirra stabilized the spacecraft and slowly cartwheeled into the correct attitude; he deliberately kept the motion slow to conserve fuel, {{and was able}} to position the capsule using half a percent of his fuel reserves. He briefly tracked the spent booster, which was rotating slowly past, but made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to move towards it. As the spacecraft moved across the Atlantic, he turned his attention to testing manual control of the spacecraft, which he found sloppy compared to the fly-by-wire system.|$|E
5|$|Douglas called Downey's {{departure}} {{in favor}} of the publisher a cheap gimmick and made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to reach a rapprochement with the senator, who entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for treatment in early April, and was on sick leave from Congress for several months. The change in opponents was a mixed blessing for Douglas; it removed the incumbent from the field, but deprived her of the endorsement of the Daily News—one of the few big city papers to consistently support her.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{had been}} {{listening}} to music from other cultures, particularly Eastern Europe since the mid-1970s. He made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to notate what he heard, but absorbed it and let it find its way later into his own music. On Gravity Frith mixed up all these different musical styles to make new songs out of them.|$|E

The British government made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to stop publication, and in 1958 the book was adapted into a film of the same name. James starred, both as himself and Montgomery, alongside John Mills as an intelligence agent.|$|E
5|$|Little or <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> {{was made}} to recruit African-American or other women {{minorities}} until October 1944, when President Roosevelt approved of accepting African-American women into the women's reserve, under pressure {{to do so by}} African-American organizations. Harriet Ida Pickens and Frances Wills were the first African-American women to become WAVE officers. By September 1945, there were 72 African-American women in the WAVES and integrated.|$|E
5|$|Many in Rome {{still thought}} {{reconciliation}} with England was possible, and Paul III elevated two English cardinals, John Fisher (at the time imprisoned {{and sentenced to}} death by Henry VIII) and Girolamo Ghinucci. The execution of Fisher prompted Paul III to excommunicate and purportedly depose Henry VIII. While Campeggio lived, <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> was made in Rome to fill any of the thirteen episcopal vacancies in England.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Israeli Southern Command {{attempted}} {{to pinpoint the}} main Egyptian effort to launch a counterattack with Dan Shomron's reserve armored brigade, when, in fact, there was no main effort. As a result, Southern Command wasted several critical hours without taking decisive action. Tactical errors also showcased themselves when Reshef moved his tank brigade forward; Israeli commanders neglected to conduct reconnaissance beforehand, causing their units to fall into Egyptian ambushes. In the confusion ensuing the surprise assault, <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> was made at evacuating the Bar Lev garrison.|$|E
5|$|One B-26, {{after being}} seriously damaged by {{anti-aircraft}} fire, made a suicide run on Akagi. Making <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> {{to pull out}} of its run, the aircraft narrowly missed crashing directly into the carrier's bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff. This experience may well have contributed to Nagumo's determination to launch another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the points}} of {{interest}} of the English cathedrals {{is the way in}} which much of the history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, which typically has important parts constructed in several different centuries with <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|Already on its last-legs, the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939 led to {{the closing of the}} Concilium in 1940. There were <b>no</b> <b>attempts</b> to revive it when peace returned.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the days}} of the stage road {{avalanches}} and rockfalls often forced closures of the highway, partly due to the massive disturbance of the land during the road's construction. <b>No</b> <b>attempt</b> was made to remedy this until shortly after the automobile road was built. In the 1930s, as a relief project during the Great Depression, a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps replanted the slopes around Independence, by then abandoned for two decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals were}} {{restored}} between 1975 and 1977 by Bill and Caroline Von Stein of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Von Steins were experienced with {{other types of}} museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> was made to restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} the funeral of Angela, who {{departed}} the show during the second series, after being killed by a moose, {{at least according to}} Guy. Mac, after a month's leave, discovers what has happened between Caroline and Guy, and although hurt, makes <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to interfere. Guy, on learning of Mac's terminal illness, tells Caroline to marry Mac instead of him.|$|E

5|$|The soldiers, most {{of their}} {{equipment}} missing, made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> at further delaying actions, and were unable to communicate with other units because their radio equipment had been lost. As they were retreating, an American aircraft accidentally strafed the column, injuring one South Korean soldier moving with them, further demoralizing the soldiers. The 34th Infantry Regiment began {{to set up a}} new line south of Chonan by nightfall, even though many of its men no longer had equipment to fight with.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} sailed on to Euboea, {{and to the}} first major target, Eretria. The Eretrians made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> to stop the Persians from landing or {{advancing}} and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days, the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed {{the city to the}} Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin {{ultimately}} {{put into}} Leyte Gulf and dropped anchor there on 13 June for repairs and replenishment. Three weeks later, on 1 July, the battleship and her escorts sailed once more for Japanese home waters for carrier air strikes on the enemy's heartland. Nine days later, carrier planes from TF 38 destroyed 72 enemy aircraft {{on the ground}} and smashed industrial sites in the Tokyo area. Wisconsin and the other ships made <b>no</b> <b>attempt</b> whatsoever to conceal the location of their armada, {{due in large part to}} a weak Japanese response to their presence.|$|E
