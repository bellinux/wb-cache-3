60|$|I agree most whole-heartedly {{with those}} who say that in {{attempting}} to relieve distress or to regulate the general levels of employment, we must be most careful not to facilitate the very disorganisation of industry which causes distress. But I do not agree {{with those who}} say that every man must look after himself, and that the intervention by the State in such matters as I have referred to will be fatal to his self-reliance, his foresight, and his thrift. We are told that our <b>non-contributory</b> <b>scheme</b> of old-age pensions, for instance, will be fatal to thrift, and we are warned that the great mass of the working classes will be discouraged thereby from making any effective provision for their old age. But what effective provision have they made against old age in the past? If terror be an incentive to thrift, surely the penalties of the system which we have abandoned ought to have stimulated thrift as much as anything could have been stimulated in this world. The mass of the labouring poor have known that unless they made provision for their old age betimes they would perish miserably in the workhouse. Yet they have made no provision; and when I am told that the institution of old-age pensions will prevent the working classes from making provision for their old age, I say that cannot be, for they {{have never been able to}} make such provision. And I believe our scheme, so far from preventing thrift, will encourage it to an extent never before known.|$|E

30|$|It is {{expected}} that the recent emergence of <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>schemes</b> aimed at alleviating poverty in old age will induce {{a significant number of}} elderly individuals to enter into retirement. De Carvalho-Filho (2008) estimates that about 40 % of recipients retired completely on receiving a non-contributory pension in rural Brazil, {{with the rest of the}} recipients drastically reducing their working hours. Latin America in particular has experienced a boom in new <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>schemes</b> during the last decade (Olivera and Zuluaga 2014). Nowadays, about 19 million individuals are recipients of a non-contributory pension in Latin America, which represents 32 % of the population aged 60 and over in this region.

40|$|The end of {{the twentieth}} and {{beginning}} of the twenty-ﬁrst centuries have seen an unprecedented growth in social assistance in countries as diverse as Brazil and Mexico, Namibia and Botswana, South Korea, India and Nepal. The extension of cash transfers to the poor through <b>non-contributory</b> <b>schemes</b> represents a fundamental transformation {{in the role of the}} state relative to markets and communities (or kin). Until the {{end of the}} twentieth century, the predominant welfare regimes in the South were either ‘workerist’, based on social or private insurance linked to formal employment, or ‘agrarian’, with a ‘safety-net’ based in subsistence agriculture and the responsibilities of kin. The rise of ‘redistributive’ welfare regimes focussed on citizens, rather than on workers or peasants, results from a combination of social and economic changes, new ideas and ideologies, and the political changes associated especially with democratisation. Whilst neither a necessary nor a suﬃcient condition, increased political competition for the votes of poor citizens is an especially important factor in the diverse pathways towards redistributive, pro-poor welfare regimes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{starts from}} the {{assumption}} that the prevailing discourse on social security needs reconsideration. The selection of the discourse is always crucial, as it has important implications for the social policy pursued, including its institutional arrangements. The paper advocates that social policy, as a whole, can fundamentally be based on a general insurance discourse, thus providing an understanding of social security that differs from approaches based on social assistance and mere income redistribution. It is also claimed that this approach, emphasizing a risk-centred concept of social security and a well-established legal, actuarial and institutional framework, is capable of dealing with the various pressures on social security created by globalization. The issues of the insurance principle in social security were discussed in this journal, but at a more practical level and from a different perspective, in the paper by Kessler (1999). The features of the approach suggested are discussed {{from the point of view}} of contributory and <b>non-contributory</b> <b>schemes,</b> civil society, commercial and mutual insurance, individual and social risks, public goods theory and the concept of civil liability.

40|$|The {{creation}} of <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>schemes</b> {{is becoming increasingly}} common as countries struggle to reduce poverty. Drawing on data from Mexico's Adultos Mayores Program (Older Adults Program) [...] a cash transfer scheme aimed at rural adults over 70 years of age [...] we evaluate {{the effects of this}} program on the well-being of the beneficiary population. Exploiting a quasi-experimental design whereby the program relies on exogenous geographical and age cutoffs to identify its target group, we find that the mental health of elderly adults in the program is significantly improved, as their score on the Geriatric Depression Scale decreases by 12 %. We also find that the proportion of treated individuals doing paid work is reduced by 20 %, with most of these people switching from their former activities to work in family businesses; treated households show higher levels of consumption expenditures (on average, an increase of 23 %). Very importantly, we also rule out significant anticipation effects that might have been associated with the program transfers. Thus, overall, we find that <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>schemes</b> target to the poor in developing countries can improve the well-being of poor older adults without having any indirect impact (through potential anticipation effects) on the earnings or savings of future program participants. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{recent and}} growing {{popularity}} of <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>schemes</b> targeting the elderly poor in low and middle-income countries, prominently Latin America, represents {{a shift in the}} strategy to deal with social protection and poverty in old age. However, not much is known about the most salient characteristics of the elderly poor persons, in particular about their cognitive functioning and other health outcomes. Our study provides evidence about this. Recall that cognitive impairment or dementia is associated with a lower quality of life, more disability and higher health expenditure and can compromise the resources for other family members.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{generally}} lower participation {{in social security}} and larger credit constraints in developing countries, elderly individuals may face a larger burden than individuals living in developed economies. Elderly individuals in developing countries also tend to keep working at an advanced age or even never retire. To deal with this, many developing countries have implemented <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>schemes</b> targeted to the elderly poor. 1 However, not much {{is known about the}} relationship between cognitive functioning and retirement and other socioeconomic characteristics for this particular population. In this paper, we aim to improve the understanding of the relationship between individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics and cognitive functioning among the elderly poor.|$|R

50|$|Between 1950 {{and early}} 1952, SOBSI {{attempted}} to mobilize militant actions, raising {{issues such as}} wages, social security and workplace conditions. SOBSI launched a wave of strikes in late 1950. In September 1950 Sarbupri launched a nationwide strike, which paralyzed most estates. The Sarbupri strike resulted in the first major victory for SOBSI, having forced the government to significantly increase the estate workers' minimum wage. Strikes by oil workers {{in the same year}} blocked plans for lay-offs and forces the government to institute a <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>scheme</b> instead. In response to the SOBSI strike wave several regional commanders of the army outlawed strikes in essential industries. The policy was by the Natsir cabinet in February 1951. Following the issue of the ban, SOBSI turned to sporadic strikes and sabotage actions (such as destroying cargo at ports or crops at plantations).|$|R
40|$|The annual {{amount of}} the state subsidy to {{occupational}} and private pensions in Ireland is double that previously believed and is of the same order as the total annual payments under the state flat-rate contributory and <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>schemes.</b> We ask: does the state get value-for-money from these subsidies? To answer the question we introduce the fair value approach to value pension entitlements. The current regulatory regime is shown to be very weak, with the security of pension entitlements of those in private sector employment below that of investment grade debt (so the pension promise if tradeable would have junk status). We suggest and analyse measures to improve members` security. We recommend that an explicit percentage of the fair value of pension entitlements be made a debt on the sponsoring employer and {{that there should be}} regular disclosure to members of the level of security backing their pension entitlement. The former only gives a minor increase in security in an Irish context but the latter incentivises members to make other provision for their retirement. We conclude by suggesting that the state has a larger role to play in pension provision in Ireland in the 21 st century than it played in the last century...|$|R
30|$|The {{data was}} {{gathered}} in 12 departments 2 (half {{of the total}} in Peru), where the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS) had already completed the census of socioeconomic variables intended to update its household targeting score system Sistema de Focalización de Hogares (SISFOH). The goal of ESBAM is {{to serve as a}} baseline for the programme Pension 65, which is the <b>non-contributory</b> pension <b>scheme</b> implemented in Peru at the end of 2011. The population of the survey are 65 – 80 -year-old individuals living in households classified as poor. 3 The sampling selection was probabilistic, independent in each department, stratified in rural/urban areas and carried out in two steps. In the first step, the primary sampling units (PSU) were census units in urban areas and villages in rural areas with at least four households living in poverty and with elderly members. The selection of PSU was made by probability proportional to size (PPS) according to the total number of households. In the second step, four households were randomly drawn from each PSU for interview and two for replacements. The initial sample size comprises 4151 individuals who completed the survey questionnaire themselves. This was reduced to 3884 individuals for our purposes. We dropped 194 individuals with missing information for some variables, 20 individuals whose mother tongue is a foreign language or an unspecified indigenous language and 53 unemployed people.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{benefits}} of, and necessity for social pensions are clearly established, {{it is also}} apparent that, as currently constituted, they do little to redress profound socioeconomic inequalities and unfairness arising from an unequal distribution of pension entitlements to privileged groups, stratified by labour market status. Embedding social protection within a formal labour market has been a failed strategy, to which non-contributory social pensions are a partial solution. Further efforts to integrate the working population within a properly regulated and taxed formal labour market are urgently required, particularly in the Latin American region (Bosch et al. 2013; Cecchini and Martinez 2012; Economic Commission For Latin America and the Caribbean and Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 2012). Current policy recommendations emphasise the need to couple incentives for firms to join the formal sector (reducing the regulatory burden, entry costs, and marginal taxation rates, and increasing {{the benefits}} of formal status) with legislation, enforcement and anti-corruption drives (Bacchetta et al. 2009). Workers can be encouraged and enabled to enter the formal labour market through better education, and portable skills training. Market reforms need to be introduced sensitively, since, although free trade and export-driven economies promote the development of large enterprises in the formal sector, there can be short term negative effects on both formal and informal sectors (Bacchetta et al. 2009). Future fiscal sustainability also depends upon transition towards properly funded “pay-as-you-go” contributory pension schemes, meaning that contributions from current members need to be protected against unfunded legacy commitments (Pozen 2013). Fortunately, current and future levels of economic growth, boosted by the demographic dividend, should be sufficient for countries such as Peru, Mexico and China to complete these transitions, whilst incrementally boosting investment in <b>non-contributory</b> <b>schemes,</b> both to extend coverage, and raise the basic minimum income level for older citizens (Cecchini and Martinez 2012; Gan 2013; Pozen 2013; Wang et al. 2014). Such policies would {{have a profound effect}} on reducing inequalities; for example, in China, where the Gini coefficient has recently been re-estimated at 0.61 (compared with a global average of 0.44), the difference in coverage and security level provided by retirement insurance and pension accounts accounted for a remarkable 25  % of the gap between rural and urban household incomes (Gan 2013). Social investment in Latin American countries increased by five percentage points to 18  % of GDP from 1990 to 2008, with positive impacts on income inequality in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Uruguay (Cecchini and Martinez 2012; Gasparini et al. 2010). Nevertheless this lags behind the norm for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries (25  % of GDP), and Peru and Mexico stand out as countries whose social investment is much less than would be expected from their development status (Cecchini and Martinez 2012). Underinvestment in government transfers is even more marked in China, where just 12.3  % of public fiscal expenditure is on social welfare (Gan 2013).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of empirical research methods to different economic topics. The first chapter examines production effects of subsidies with different characteristics. The second chapter evaluates the impact of an oldage pension program on {{the welfare of the}} recipient’s family members. The third chapter applies an income inequality model to study the influence of differences in citation practices across scientific fields on the overall citation inequality. Chapter 1, “Differential Effects on Output Levels of Binding and non-Binding Subsidies under Capitalization”. Subsidies on outputs or inputs are usually production-promoting by lowering the marginal cost. However, if subsidies are binding, i. e. outputs or inputs are partially subsidized, subsidies don’t affect the output level. If subsidies capitalize into input prices, i. e. subsidies benefit both the recipients and input providers, outputs will be negatively affected. My paper contributes by empirically assessing production effects of subsidies taking into account both bindingness and capitalization. I study cattle payments under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) implemented in the European Union (EU). I set up a simple model to analyze production effects of these payments. I also estimate the effects with Spanish farm-level data. CAP 1992 and Agenda 2000 are two policy programs of the CAP. Both are designed to reduce over-production in agriculture. Estimation results suggest that cattle payments have negative impacts on outputs when they are binding under CAP 1992, and positive impacts when they are non-binding under Agenda 2000. Chapter 2, “Reassessing the Differential Impact of Grandmothers and Grandfathers: The Old Age Program in Nepal” (co-authored with Ricardo Mora). We study the effects on infant mortality of the introduction in 1995 of a <b>non-contributory</b> universal pension <b>scheme</b> in Nepal known as the Old age Allowance Program. We use cross-sectional data from the 1996 and 2001 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys. Following a standard diff-in-diffs approach, we find positive and significant effects on survival rates for the presence in the same household of a female beneficiary while negative and sometimes significant effects for the presence of a male beneficiary. When we conduct pre-treatment common trend tests, we find that we cannot reject it for the case of the female beneficiaries but we strongly reject it for the case of male beneficiaries. Following Mora and Reggio (2012), we then propose a more flexible model and identification strategy and find that there are no differences in the female and the male beneficiary effects. We interpret these results as suggestive that cross-sectional analysis may bias downwards the estimates of the effect of grandfathers because of gender differences in endogenous household formation. Chapter 3 is a combination of two closely related papers, namely “The Measurement of the Effect on Citation Inequality of Differences in Citation Practices across Scientific Fields” (co-authored with Juan A. Crespo and Javier Ruiz-Castillo, published in PLoS ONE 8 (3) : e 58727 (2013)), and “The Effect on Citation Inequality of Differences in Citation Practices at the Web of Science Subject Category Level” (co-authored with Juan A. Crespoa, Neus Herranz and Javier Ruiz-Castillo, published in Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 65 : 1244 - 1256, (June 2014)). We introduce a novel method for measuring which part of overall citation inequality can be attributed to differences in citation practices across scientific fields. In addition, we implement an empirical strategy for making meaningful comparisons between the numbers of citations received by articles in different scientific fields. Using a dataset of 4. 4 million articles published in 1998 - 2003 with a five-year citation window, we find that differences in citation practices between the 22 fields account for about 14 % of overall citation inequality. When the classification system goes from 22 fields to 219 sub-fields, the effect on citation inequality increases to about 18 %. For comparisons of citation counts across fields, we provide a set of exchange rates (ERs) to express citations in any field into citations in the all-fields case. When the raw citation data are normalized with our ERs, the effect of differences in citation practices is reduced to around 2 % of overall citation inequality in the case of 22 fields. In the case of 219 sub-fields with the fractional strategy, the normalization of the raw data using the ERs (or sub-field mean citations) as normalization factors reduces the effect to 3. 8 % (3. 4 %) of overall citation inequality. The results with the fractional strategy are essentially replicated when we adopt a multiplicative approach.
