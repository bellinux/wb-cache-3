25|$|John Donne {{was under}} the matronage of Lucy Russell {{during the time that}} Boulstred fell ill and died. As {{previously}} mentioned, he visited her when she was sick and concluded that she was suffering from hysteria. After she died, he wrote two poems in her honor, “Elegy on Mistress Boulstred” and “Elegy Upon the Death of Mistress Boulstred.” The former poem characterizes Death as an “all-consuming glutton who swallows the good” and argues that Boulstred was one of the good ones. The latter poem says that Death is no longer needed because Boulstred was the epitome of virtue, and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is dead, it is like the entire world is dead. Donne most likely wrote these elegies in the hopes of getting a reward from his literary matron Lucy Russell.|$|E

25|$|Codreanu {{clashed with}} Cuza over the League's structure: he demanded that it develop a {{paramilitary}} and revolutionary character, while Cuza was {{hostile to the}} idea.

This was said to be in honor of an Orthodox icon that adorned the walls of the prison church, or, more specifically, linked to Codreanu's reported claim of having been visited by the Archangel himself.

Though the scandal was hushed up, the fact that his sister was having an illegitimate child was deeply humiliating for Codreanu as he liked to present his family as model members of the Orthodox church and he sought unsuccessfully to have Cuza pressure his son to marry his sister.|$|E
