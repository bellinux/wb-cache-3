25|$|A small {{subset of}} high school debaters, mostly from elite public and private schools, travel {{around the country to}} tournaments in what is called the 'national circuit.' The {{championship}} of the <b>national</b> <b>circuit</b> is usually considered to be the Tournament of Champions, also called the T.O.C, at the University of Kentucky, which requires formal qualification in the form of two or more bids to the tournament. Bids are achieved by reaching a certain level of elimination rounds (for example, quarter-finals) at select, highly competitive, and carefully chosen tournaments across the country based upon the quality of debaters they attract and the diversity of locations from across the United States they represent.|$|E

25|$|As he {{was racing}} in the Midwest, he kept {{hearing about the}} great racing and the big purses in NASCAR, so he moved south and started on the Grand <b>National</b> <b>circuit,</b> the earlier name of today's Sprint Cup Series. He won 14 NASCAR races in 103 starts in the #29 Holman Moody car from 1965 to 1967. Dick was the hands-down {{favorite}} to win {{rookie of the year}} in 1965, but was ruled ineligible for the award because he was a past champion in IMCA. He was part of the Ford factory team that dominated the season, including the impressive feat of winning the pole position in back to back events at Myrtle Beach and Valdosta, and he nearly won the NASCAR championship in his first full season, settling for second.|$|E

She also held the regional UBR Number one girl racer title in 1982.

25|$|In {{order to}} compete in the Supercars Championship, drivers are {{required}} to hold a CAMS <b>National</b> <b>Circuit</b> Competition Licence, or a licence of an equivalent or higher level.

RECs may be leased by their owners to another party for a maximum of two years, after which the owner must either use it themselves or sell it. A racing number is tied to each REC, with teams able to apply for a REC number to be changed. The defending series champion is entitled to use the number 1, with the original REC number of that car reserved and not able to be used by another team without the agreement of its owner.|$|E

This did not translate into success outdoors, however, as he failed to make the final at the Olympic trials and his season's best time of 13.33 left him out of the global top ten for the first time in six years. He moved back inside the top ten in the 1997 and 1998 seasons, including a lifetime best of 13.17 seconds in Ingolstadt in 1998, but a sixth place at the 1997 USA Outdoor Championships was his best performance on the <b>national</b> <b>circuit.</b> He was last at the 1997 IAAF Grand Prix Final.

25|$|Rajp's {{first major}} test {{came in the}} form of the 2006 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka, in which he was {{promoted}} to be the vice-captain of the United States Under-19 cricket team due to his performances at the ICC Americas Under-19 Championship and National Under-19 Tournaments. He had a successful World Cup campaign and finished the tournament as one of the leading wicket takers for the US and also landed himself in the top 10 wicket takers for the entire tournament, in number of wickets taken. His most notable performance came against an ICC full-member nation, New Zealand, when he took the first (and the only till date) five-wicket haul for the USA against a full member nation. United States of America Cricket Association's administration problems soon after the 2006 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup resulted in a two-year ban imposed by cricket's governing body, International Cricket Council.

2500|$|Brazilian [...] "rodeios" [...] can {{be traced}} to the town of Barretos where the primary {{economic}} activities involved livestock and the transporting the livestock to other locations, where one of the ways the cowboys found to get some entertainment was riding the animals.

However, rodeos are very common in inner state towns in Brazil, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso do Sul and São Paulo state. Bull riding has become a significant niche sport in the country in recent years; PBR now runs a <b>national</b> <b>circuit</b> in Brazil, and Brazilian riders are a major presence on the main PBR circuit in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|When Griffin drew up {{his plans}} in 1912, {{there was still}} some {{optimism}} that New Zealand might join the Federation of Australia. [...] Griffin's plans included eight avenues radiating out from Capital Hill named after the capitals of the six states, {{the capital of the}} Northern Territory and the capital of New Zealand. [...] Before the name Wellington Avenue was gazetted it was realised that New Zealand was not going to become part of a federation of Australasia and the name was replaced by Canberra Avenue. [...] Griffin planned that the state capital city avenues were terminated with a park named after the generic botanical name for a native plant from that particular site; for example, Telopea Park is named after the waratah, the floral emblem of New South Wales, and {{is at the end of}} Sydney Avenue, named after the capital of New South Wales. [...] Another remnant of Griffin's nomenclature was the Wellington Hotel, formerly on the corner of Canberra Avenue and <b>National</b> <b>Circuit</b> which was demolished and replaced by the hotel known in 2005 as [...] "Rydges Capital Hill Canberra".|$|E
60|$|The National tribunals are of two classes. First, {{there is}} the Supreme Court {{specially}} ordained by the Constitution. And then there are such inferior courts as Congress may {{from time to time}} see fit to establish. Congress has no power to abolish the Supreme Court, or to erect another tribunal superior to it. This court sits at Washington, and is a final court of appeal from the inferior national courts of the Federal empire. A system of inferior courts, inaugurated by Congress, has existed for about sixty years. Each State for purposes of national jurisprudence is constituted as a district; some few large States, such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, being divided into two districts. Each district has one district court, presided over by one judge. National causes in general, both civil and criminal, are commenced in these district courts, and those involving only small amounts are ended there. Above these district courts are the <b>National</b> <b>circuit</b> courts, the districts or States having been grouped into circuits as the counties are grouped with us. To each of these circuits is assigned one of the judges of the Supreme Court of Washington, who is the ex- officio judge of that circuit, and who therefore travels as do our common law judges. In each district he sits with the judge of that district, and they two together form the circuit court. Appeals from the district court lie to the circuit court in cases over a certain amount, and also in certain criminal cases. It follows therefore that appeals lie from one judge to the same judge when sitting with another--an arrangement which would seem to be fraught with some inconvenience. Certain causes, both civil and criminal, are commenced in the circuit courts. From the circuit courts the appeal lies to the Supreme Court at Washington; but such appeal beyond the circuit court is not allowed in cases which are of small magnitude or which do not involve principles of importance. If there be a division of opinion in the circuit court the case goes to the Supreme Court; from whence it might be inferred that all cases brought from the district court to the circuit court would be sent on to the Supreme Court, unless the circuit judge agreed with the district judge; for the district judge having given his judgment in the inferior court, would probably adhere to it in the superior court. No appeal lies to the Supreme Court at Washington in criminal cases.|$|E
