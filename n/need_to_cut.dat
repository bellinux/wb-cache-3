5|$|There was a {{call for}} {{automated}} transponders after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; no changes were made, as aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies. In the wake of Flight 370, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs. Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting on the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> power to equipment {{in the event of}} a fire. Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof circuit breakers were being considered.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the film}} was first {{screened}} by the BBC on 25 December 1978 and, as of December 2016, fifteen times since, mostly around Christmas time.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study {{was to assess the}} cutting {{efficiency}} of diamond burs on Y-TZP Zirconia as measured by heat generation during cutting; time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> 4 mm of an ingot shaped specimen; and material lost after cutting compared to a Lithium Disilicate control. Forty six cuts of each material were made in a custom test device that held the handpiece in a fixed position and moved the sample toward the cutting bur. Measurement of time, temperature change and weight loss were made to describe the cutting efficiency of a diamond bur. The amount of time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Zirconia was almost three times longer than the time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Lithium Disilicate and was found statistically significant (P < 0. 001) in an Independent Sample Test. The temperature decreased during the cut, but this change was not significant, suggesting that using water coolant would control temperature change. A Pearson Correlation test demonstrated the duration of the <b>cut</b> was related <b>to</b> both temperature and change of temperature for Zirconia but not for Lithium Disilicate, suggesting that the longer the cut for Zirconia the lower the temperature and the larger the change in temperature. There was a significant difference (P < 0. 001) for material loss for each group and also in the comparison of material loss between the two groups, Zirconia losing double of the weight than Lithium lost. This should be described as a proportional loss, as Zirconia is heavier than Lithium Disilicate, therefore the weight of material loss for Zirconia is greater than for Lithium Disilicate Within the limitations of this study it can be concluded that the amount of time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Zirconia was almost three times longer than the time <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Lithium Disilicate. There was no significant heat generation when water spray was used. The material loss for Zirconia was double that for Lithium Disilicate...|$|R

25|$|The {{public is}} also quite clear on its {{priorities}} {{when it comes}} to promoting energy conservation versus increasing the supply of oil, coal, and natural gas. When asked which of these should be the higher priority, the public chooses energy conservation by a very wide 68 percent-to-21 percent margin. The public also predominantly believes that the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> down on energy consumption and protect the environment means increased energy efficiency should be mandated for certain products. Ninety-two percent of Americans now support such requirements.|$|E

25|$|The knife also {{features}} a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip {{is part of the}} blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a lanyard pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> and retie if the owner has multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.|$|E

25|$|Johnson's defense cuts, {{which began}} on April 23, 1949, were {{accelerated}} after he announced {{the cancellation of}} the 65,000-ton flushdeck aircraft carrier USS United States. The United States Navy had been planning this ship {{for several years and}} construction had already begun. Johnson, supported by a slim majority of the JCS and by President Truman, stressed the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> costs. At least by implication, Johnson had scuttled the Navy's hope to participate in strategic nuclear air operations through use of the carrier. Neither the Department of the Navy nor Congress had been consulted in the termination of United States. Abruptly resigning, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan expressed concern {{about the future of the}} United States Marine Corps and both Marine and Naval Aviation, and Johnson's determination to eliminate those services through progressive program cuts.|$|E
25|$|Central was unopposed in {{retaining}} its {{franchise in}} 1993, which allowed {{the company to}} only bid a tiny sum of £2000 a year – though the company stressed the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> more jobs to become more cost efficient, as the company had agreed to pay 11% of their annual advertising revenue {{on top of their}} winning bid. The station's workforce was reduced to 1500 by 1990 and then to 900 by the start of 1992 – {{less than half of the}} payroll Central had employed in 1987. Central also profited from the auction after Meridian, a consortium in which Central held a 20% stake, won the franchise to serve the South and South East of England. By April 1993, with the added increase of 8.8% in advertising revenues to £250 million and its income from programme sales rising to £83.4 million, Central became the most successful ITV company after the start of the new franchises.|$|E
25|$|Most hysterectomies in the United States {{are done}} via {{laparotomy}} (abdominal incision, {{not to be}} confused with laparoscopy). A transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision is made through the abdominal wall, usually above the pubic bone, as close to the upper hair line of the individual's lower pelvis as possible, similar to the incision made for a caesarean section. This technique allows physicians the greatest access to the reproductive structures and is normally done for removal of the entire reproductive complex. The recovery time for an open hysterectomy is 4–6 weeks and sometimes longer due to the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> through the abdominal wall. Historically, the biggest problem with this technique was infections, but infection rates are well-controlled and not a major concern in modern medical practice. An open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to explore the abdominal cavity and perform complicated surgeries. Before the refinement of the vaginal and laparoscopic vaginal techniques it was also the only possibility to achieve subtotal hysterectomy, meanwhile vaginal route is the preferable technique in most circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Many {{leaders of}} the G20 {{disagreed}} about which issues should be discussed at the summit. The prime focus of the summit discussions was the recovery from the ongoing global recession and the European debt crisis. Summit leaders were divided over which strategies {{would be best for}} tackling these problems. The European Union emphasized the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> their deficits by focusing on austerity measures. [...] In contrast, the United States emphasized the importance of maintaining economic stimulus spending in order to encourage growth. In summit discussions, the countries of the European Union explained projected reductions in spending and balanced budgets. [...] Alternatively, China, India, and the United States argued in favor of increased stimulus funding to mitigate the effects of recession. Among the specifics proposed by the European Union were a global bank tax and a Robin Hood tax, but the United States and Canada opposed these plans. Other topics of concern were international development and continuing international aid to Africa and other developing nations. [...] Some invitees expressed criticism of Israel's Gaza strip blockade and of the nuclear programs of North Korea and the United States raised issues of corruption and security in Afghanistan.|$|E
500|$|In December 2012, it was {{reported}} that the Army may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> $150 million from the GCV program in 2014, with deeper cuts between $600 million-$700 million between 2014 and 2018. [...] This put the program, one of the Army's highest priorities, at serious risk. [...] With the drawdown of the War in Afghanistan and budgetary concerns, the expensive development of a new combat vehicle was not seen as feasible. [...] BAE Systems and General Dynamics were each awarded engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase contracts in August 2011. [...] The EMD phase was to last 48 months for both contractors, but there were arguments for only one to proceed as a cost-saving measure. [...] This would present the problem of selecting a vehicle based on design outlines, rather than on real prototypes. [...] Another suggestion was to lengthen the EMD period to allow for smaller contract awards over time. [...] This might delay the operational deadline beyond the planned 2018 date. [...] The underlying concern {{is the fact that the}} Army plans to spend 80 percent of its ground combat vehicle budget on GCV development from 2013-2018. [...] With 1,847 GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicles expected to be acquired, they would make up only 10 percent of the Army combat vehicle fleet. [...] Redirected funds could be shifted to modernization efforts for the combat-proven Stryker, M1 Abrams, and Bradley families of vehicles.|$|E
500|$|In February {{the three}} biggest parties partook {{in a debate}} {{organised}} by the Finnish Business and Policy Forum {{in front of an}} audience consisting of people from the field of business. The National Coalition's Katainen said that as a result of February polling there were now four prime ministerial candidates from the four largest parties. However, the True Finns' chairman and MEP Timo Soini was excluded because the various pollings presented at the time were different. All parties insisted that the retirement age must not be lowered from 63. The SDP's Urpilainen said that the party would continue with what they said was a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> pensions and that increasing the retirement age is a form of cutting pensions; to support this she pointed out an earlier retirement age law of 65 years and that the age had been lowered. She also added that because of a large proportion of disabled pensioners, younger people should join the workforce quickly after graduation. Katainen and the Centre Party's Kiviniemi said they would consider raising the retirement age to lengthen work careers. Kiviniemi said that [...] "some of the directors of our large corporations are retiring at the age of 59–60" [...] and that, at the same time, [...] "demands are being presented that people should work longer." [...] Urpilainen also said that lowering the value added tax on food was mistake, though she said that it should not be raised either.|$|E

500|$|UNITA {{carried out}} several attacks against civilians in May 2001 {{in a show}} of strength. UNITA militants {{attacked}} Caxito on 7 May, killing 100 people and kidnapping 60 children and two adults. UNITA then attacked Baia-do-Cuio, followed by an attack on Golungo Alto, a city [...] east of Luanda, a few days later. The militants advanced on Golungo Alto at 2:00pm on 21 May, staying until 9:00pm on 22 May when the Angolan military retook the town. They looted local businesses, taking food and alcoholic beverages before singing drunkenly in the streets. More than 700 villagers trekked [...] from Golungo Alto to Ndalatando, the provincial capital of Cuanza Norte, without injury. According to an aid official in Ndalatando, the Angolan military prohibited media coverage of the incident, so the details of the attack are unknown. Joffre Justino, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said UNITA only attacked Gungo Alto to demonstrate the government's military inferiority and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a deal. Four days later UNITA released the children to a Catholic mission in Camabatela, a city [...] from where UNITA kidnapped them. The national organization said the abduction violated their policy towards the treatment of civilians. In a letter to the bishops of Angola, Jonas Savimbi asked the Catholic Church to act as an intermediary between UNITA and the government in negotiations. The attacks took their toll on Angola's economy. At the end of May 2001, De Beers, the international diamond mining company, suspended its operations in Angola, ostensibly on the grounds that negotiations with the national government reached an impasse.|$|E
