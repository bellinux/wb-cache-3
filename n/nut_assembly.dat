50|$|The rollers {{act as the}} “threads” of the <b>nut</b> <b>assembly,</b> causing axial {{movement}} of the rotating screw due to their orbital restraint. Screw rotation spins the rollers, which spin the bearing ring, dissipating the load-induced friction along the way.|$|E
50|$|A split <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is often}} used in {{positioning}} systems, for example in the leadscrew of a lathe. It {{is one of the}} machine elements that makes single-point threading practical on manual (non-CNC) lathes. The very earliest screw-cutting lathes (in the late 18th and early 19th centuries) did not have them, but within a few decades, split nuts were common on lathes.|$|E
50|$|The {{screw and nut}} {{may have}} very fine {{identical}} single- or two-start threads. Recirculating rollers are grooved (instead of threaded) so they move axially during spinning engagement with the threads of the nut and screw, shifting up or down by one lead of thread after completing an orbit around the screw. The <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> typically includes a slotted cage and cam rings. The cage captivates the rollers in elongated slots, equally spacing the rollers while permitting rotation and axial motion of the rollers. The cam rings have opposing cams aligned with an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. After a roller completes an orbit about the nut it is released into the groove, disengages from nut and screw, and is pushed between the cams to the axial midpoint of the <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> (shifting by a distance equal to the lead of the screw). Returned to its starting position, and reengaged to nut and screw, the roller may then orbit the screw once again.|$|E
50|$|The {{cutting ring}} fitting {{consists}} of the body, the cutting ring and the <b>nut.</b> On <b>assembly,</b> the two cutting edges of the cutting ring carves into the outer surface of the tube hence ensuring the necessary holding power and sealing for high operating pressures. The tubes have usually metric dimensions.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a single 7 / 8 ” nominal diameter stud bolt and <b>nuts</b> <b>assembly</b> would fail to perform its required function in a flange <b>assembly</b> when the <b>nut</b> was corroded. This work was undertaken to form a basis for further work in development of a Fitness-For-Service (FFS) assessment for corroded nuts. No current quantitative assessments exist for this area. A failure criterion was defined as a minimum 206. 8 MPa stress in the stud, based on the bolting requirements stated in ASME B 16. 5 - 2003 Pipe Flanges and Flanges Fittings. A simple test rig was manufactured for testing the compliance of the corroded nuts subjected to the 206. 8 MPa stress level and the corrosion was simulated by removing uniform layers of material from the surface of the nut. Finite Element Analysis (ANSYS 12. 0) was also performed to evaluate the test rig and to consider the interaction between the nut and stud at the thread roots. It was found that no failure occurred in the threading and that failure of the assembly only occurred when there was a > 60 % material loss from the nut. The failure mode experienced was deformation of the flange plate. This analysis proved that a nut can experience significant effective material loss without damaging the flange integrity...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The primary aim of {{the study}} was to explore the current {{practice}} of occupational therapists when assessing standing performance during Functional Capacity Evaluations (FCEs). Methods: A semi-structured interview was conducted with occupational therapists and the participants were interviewed using both open and closed questions. Participants: A sample of occupational therapists (n= 20) from Queensland, Australia were involved in a survey. They were all experienced in conducting FCEs. Results: Ninety percent of the respondents used a distracting task during the assessment of standing with standardised and non-standardised <b>nuts</b> and bolts <b>assembly</b> tasks the most commonly used. Respondents reported using a mix of biophysical, physiological and psychophysical clinical observations to assess standing. The <b>nuts</b> and bolts <b>assembly</b> activities used by the respondents were rated to be of low interest in terms of engaging the client. Conclusions: It was identified there are minimal guidelines in the literature which focuses on assessment of standing in FCEs. Questions were raised regarding the adequacy of the use of nuts and bolts activities as a suitably distracting task in FCEs and further research is required on assessing standing in functional capacity evaluation including the use of suitably distracting activities...|$|R
5000|$|In 1986 Oliver Saari {{was awarded}} a patent for a bearing ring roller screw, {{commonly}} referred to by its trademark, Spiracon. [...] This type matches the orbit of the rollers to {{the rotation of the}} <b>nut</b> <b>assembly.</b> The actuator contains more load transfer elements than the other types, a bearing ring and thrust bearings, but manufacture of component parts is relatively simple (e.g. gearing teeth may be eliminated).|$|E

50|$|The screw has a multi-start thread. The rollers and {{encapsulating}} {{rotating ring}} are identically grooved, not threaded, {{so there is}} no axial movement between the two. The <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings. The spacer rings have equidistant holes that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. Roller-type thrust bearings between the spacer rings and bearing ring permit free rotation of the bearing ring while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a series of tests performed using in. diameter A 325 and A 490 bolts. The resulting relationship between torque – tension for the bolt – <b>nut</b> – washer <b>assembly</b> is used to explain its behavior as the length and location of treatment surface are varied. Tests were performed upon one hundred sixty four bolts; eighty A 325 of three inches in length, fifty-two A 325 of six inches in length, twenty A 490 of three inches in length, and twelve A 490 of six inches in length. One hundred sixty four nuts and washers were tested, one hundred nuts type 2 H, and fifty six nuts type C and eight nuts type D to determine the effect of the variables (nut type, bolt length, bolt type and Control Fluid) on the torque-tension relationship of the bolt-nut-washer assembly. Hundreds of experiments using replicate samples for statistical reli-ability were conducted to establish the effect of the variables on the tension-torque relationship of the bolt-nut-washer assemblage. The principal relationship in turn-of-nut installation is that between elongation and bolt pretension, the tension-torque relationship is the factor that reflects the bolt pretension in an installation to be expected in a properly tightened connection. Control Fluid was found to decrease the coefficient of friction on coated parts and to control the tension obtained with a given torque upon assembly...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{modelling}} polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) locally and on a cell scale. The modelling was done using software based on the finite element method and focused on mass transfer issues and compression pressure distribution {{and its effects on}} local phenomena. Mass transfer, more specifically the flow distribution in the flow field system, was studied on the cathode. The velocity distribution was improved by changing the geometry of the channel system. This improvement was also observed experimentally. Mass transport problems of free-breathing fuel cells were also studied. These cells rely on free convection to provide reactants and remove reaction products. In this thesis, the aim was to develop an accurate model that is also computationally light. The compression distribution in a stack was modelled based on an existing stack design. The results showed poor internal pressure distribution, with most of the cell experiencing insufficient compression. The modelling was then used to find a better end plate structure and suitable torques for the <b>nut</b> and bolt <b>assemblies.</b> The results were validated experimentally. The effect of compression was studied on a local scale on which compression variations caused by the channel structure had been seen to affect the gas diffusion layer properties and contact resistances between components. According to the modelling results, there are strong local transversal electric currents in the cell. This phenomenon can affect the cell performance and lifetime negatively...|$|R
50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> includes spacer rings and ring gears that position and guide the rollers. The spacer rings, which rotate within the ring gears, have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. The ring gears time the spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. The spacer rings rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. The spacer rings float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|E

40|$|Multidisciplinary design {{optimization}} {{has been widely}} applied in the optimization of large-scale complex system {{and also in the}} design and optimization of components, which are involved in multidisciplinary behaviors. The wear and fatigue life of lead screw actuators is a typical multidisciplinary problem. The wear behaviors of actuators closely relate to many factors such as loads, lubrications, materials properties, surface properties, pressures, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. In this paper, the wear and fatigue life of a lead screw actuator is modeled and validated. Firstly, the theory of asperity contact and Archard’s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under certain circumstances. Secondly, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol, and the wear phenomenon at the ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model. Thirdly, finite element analysis is conducted using Nastran to assess the contact stresses in the lead screw and <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> model. The estimated data from the three sources are finally merged to formulate a mathematical model in predicting the wear and fatigue life for the optimization of lead screw actuators...|$|E
40|$|The {{wear and}} fatigue life of {{lead-screw}} actuators {{is a topic}} of great interest {{in the field of}} Industrial Automation. The friction, wear and resulting fatigue life behaviors in this type of actuators closely relates to many factors such as load, velocity, lubrication, material properties, surface properties, pressure, and temperature. Therefore, the wear and fatigue life of lead screw actuators cannot be modeled without a simultaneous consideration of solid mechanics, fluid dynamics, contact mechanics, and thermal dynamics. ^ A great deal of research has been conducted in the past fifty years in the estimation of sliding wear involving metal and polymer interfaces. In this thesis, the wear and fatigue life of a lead screw actuator are modeled and validated. ^ First, the asperity contact theory and Archard 2 ̆ 7 s model of sliding wear are applied to estimate the amount of wear under given conditions. Then, a test platform is developed based on a standard ASTM test protocol and the wear in ball-on-flat sliding is measured to validate the developed wear model. Simultaneously, fatigue life testing of the lead screw actuators is performed in order to verify the experimental life against the theoretical life. Next, finite element analysis is carried out using Nei-Nastran Software in order to assess the contact stresses in the lead screw and <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> model. Finally, the data generated from the three sources is merged to formulate a mathematical model that can predict the wear and fatigue life of a lead-screw actuator. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully threaded bolts have been considered. It was found that partially threaded bolts with three threads between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially threaded bolts all failed due to thread stripping. The fully threaded bolts experienced both thread stripping and bolt failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model. Acceptable accuracy up to maximum force was possible to achieve for the smallest bolt center distance. The response of the finite element model was very mesh sensitive, and difficult to recreate with limited computational capacity when applying an explicit solution algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} {{of the connection between}} the guardrail and post in a steel road safety barrier subject to tensile, shear and combined loading conditions. This is accomplished by performing laboratory tests on a special-built test rig. Finite element models of the connection are created and validated in order to form a basis for large scale numerical simulations of road safety barriers. The laboratory tests all failed by thread stripping of the bolt in the connection. The ultimate failure load decreased by 15. 9 and 17. 3 percent when loading in 15 and 30 from pure tension respectively. A two-step finite element model was created to simulate the behaviour of the threaded bolt and <b>nut</b> <b>assembly</b> in question. The relative displacement between the bolt and the nut in an initial model of the guard rail and post with an unthreaded connection was enforced on a separate model of the bolt and nut with threads. A full model including the threaded connection was created and compared to the two-step model. The results indicate that the behaviour prior to failure is controlled by deformations in the guardrail, post and washers. Failure is controlled by the threaded bolt, and the ultimate load is highly dependent on the bolt material. It is possible to model the bolted connection, subject to combined tension and shear loading conditions, with an acceptable degree of accuracy. A consistent failure mode can be achieved with both the two-step model and the full model. The ultimate loads experienced in the two-step model were in close proximity to the experimental results in some load combinations. The full model was close to the laboratory results in most load combinations, where the deviation from the average failure load in pure tension was 1. 1 - 2. 7 percent. </p...|$|E
