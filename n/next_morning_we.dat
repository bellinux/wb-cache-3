60|$|At {{four o'clock}} on the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> started on our journey.|$|E
60|$|Night passed; and <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> made {{preparations}} for leaving Mondoldo that day.|$|E
60|$|<b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{started out}} with a high {{northeast}} trade-wind blowing. Nothing could dampen our ardor.|$|E
6000|$|... "None whatever. He was {{perfectly}} satisfied. He stayed until the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> and <b>we</b> parted friends. A {{few days ago}} I had his wedding cards. You know whom he married?" ...|$|R
60|$|My heart {{warmed to}} Captain Colenso; and <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> as <b>we</b> bowled {{forward with a}} {{temperate}} breeze on our quarter, I took occasion to compliment him on the Lady Nepean's behaviour.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to work the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>we</b> both dropt into the old groove; and nothing more was said until yesterday, when he {{informed}} me that you would come, today." ...|$|R
60|$|We camped {{outside the}} {{fortified}} town that night. <b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> essayed {{to make our}} entry.|$|E
60|$|<b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> rose at daybreak, relighted {{the fire}} and had breakfast, after which we resumed our search, but still--without success.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> {{came to a}} deep, green wood, slowly nodding {{over the}} waves; its margin frothy-white with foam. A charming sight! ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> before <b>we</b> had {{finished}} our breakfast, a messenger from the Agency {{came in to}} say that a carryall was at the door, and soon {{we were on our way}} toward the Fort.|$|R
60|$|We[55] {{came here}} last night after a very long journey over very bad roads, from Geneva, and leave here (for Montigny, by the Tête Noire) at 6 to-morrow <b>morning.</b> <b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> early <b>we</b> mean to try the Simplon.|$|R
60|$|DOZING in our canoe the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> about daybreak, <b>we</b> were {{awakened by}} Zeke's hailing us loudly from the beach.|$|R
60|$|<b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{sent back}} to the livery-stable {{what was left of the}} yellow horse. It seemed tired, but anxious to go.|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> {{were all}} envying his fortune; when, of a sudden, he bolted in upon us, looking decidedly out of humour.|$|E
60|$|Here {{then was}} the key to the mystery! The Captain was {{throwing}} the crew overboard. <b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> met at breakfast as usual.|$|E
60|$|However, his {{warning was}} so short, {{that he could}} not reach to Stony-Stratford time enough to be with me at night, but he met me at a place called Brickhill the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> as <b>we</b> were just coming in to tow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bullen," [...] Hallett said, the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> [...] "here <b>we</b> are again. I {{wonder how}} long we shall get to rest our wearied bodies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> when <b>we</b> came to {{pull out}} for Quito with a dozen flat cars loaded with rails, there {{she was in the}} cab waiting for us; and in the {{daylight}} I could see how much better a looker she was than the night before.|$|R
60|$|It was half-past five when we boys got up the <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>We</b> {{were joined}} {{on the stairs}} by Felicity, yawning and rosy.|$|E
60|$|<b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> started, a {{party of}} seven, {{including}} the interpreter, to ride over the Loolu Berg to Secocoeni's, {{a distance of about}} thirty-eight miles.|$|E
60|$|<b>Next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{left with}} a family of English friends and went by train to Brevet, and thence by boat across the lake to Ouchy (Lausanne).|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> as <b>we</b> {{were sitting}} down to breakfast, our friends of the other house sent in to me a plate of the largest, finest {{strawberries}} I have ever seen, which, considering {{that it was only}} the latter part of April, seemed to me quite an astonishing luxury.|$|R
60|$|My little Dora {{being in}} good spirits, and very desirous that I should go--as I found on talking {{it over with}} her--I readily pledged myself to {{accompany}} him in accordance with his wish. <b>Next</b> <b>morning,</b> consequently, <b>we</b> were on the Yarmouth coach, and again travelling over the old ground.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. We may {{not come}} early, for we have to {{purchase}} two pack horses to carry them, and three tats for ourselves and our man. This may take us some time, and it will be, perhaps, better {{for us to come}} to you early the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>we</b> can then start away direct." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{our last}} {{excursion}} at Looe. The <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> were {{again on the}} road, walking inland {{on our way to}} the town of Liskeard.|$|E
60|$|At sunrise <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{were all}} on deck. Sam sauntered aft to the binnacle, cast his eye {{carelessly}} upon the compass, and uttered an ejaculation of astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Early the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> reached Nassau, {{the largest}} {{town in the}} Bahamas, {{on one of the}} {{smallest}} islands, and found it semi-tropical enough to suit even Mr. Chipperton.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{end of it}} was we all {{slept in}} the tap-room that night. It seemed strange at first, but {{anything}} was better than going ’ome in the dark, and we all slept till about four <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>we</b> woke up and found the tramp ’ad gone and left the front door standing wide open.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who all was doin' the talkin' last night?" [...] asked Frank <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>we</b> {{were having}} a late breakfast. [...] "Cause I've a joke on somebody. Jim he talks in his sleep often, an' last night after you did finally get settled down, Jim he up in his sleep an' says: 'Shore he's windy as hell! Shore he's windy as hell'!" ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} after seven o'clock the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> when <b>we</b> turned into the {{courtyard}} of the County Hotel in Newcastle. Immediately in front of us was the car in which we had seen Delora on the previous afternoon. The chauffeur was at work upon it, and although he looked up at our entrance, he paid no particular attention to us.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>we</b> had a {{note from}} Miss Smith, recounting shortly and {{accurately}} the very incidents which I had seen, but the pith of the letter lay in the postscript: ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> {{started for}} Fin-ma-Coul's Crossing. When I reached the shooting-box, where Guy was {{entertaining}} a select company of friends, Flora Billingsgate greeted {{me with a}} saucy smile.|$|E
60|$|THE <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>we</b> were {{startled by}} an {{extraordinary}} proceeding {{on the part}} of one of the guests. Mr. Sax had left Carsham Hall by the first train--nobody knew why.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought so}} too, and I {{took him out}} for a walk <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>we</b> talked immensely, {{understanding}} one another to perfection. And I took him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there, and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above.|$|R
60|$|We had deceived the boatman at Pangbourne. We {{had not had}} {{the face}} {{to tell him that}} we were running away from the rain. We had left the boat, and all it contained, in his charge, with {{instructions}} that it was to be ready for us at nine the <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> If, <b>we</b> said—if anything unforeseen should happen, preventing our return, we would write to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "The preacher had a {{small house}} {{on the side of}} the street that he'd fixed up to rent; and he allowed me and Mrs. Hicks to occupy it till the ten-forty train the <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>we</b> was going on a bridal tour to El Paso. His wife had {{decorated}} it all up with hollyhocks and poison ivy, and it looked real festal and bowery.|$|R
