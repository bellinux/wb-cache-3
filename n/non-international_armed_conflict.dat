This thesis {{examines}} {{the prohibition of}} indiscriminate attacks in <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The world has seen {{an increase in the}} number of <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> that are not of an international character. Most of these conflicts have proven to be very destructive and detrimental to persons not taking part in the hostilities.

40|$|Abstract. One of the {{cardinal}} principles in International Humanitarian Law (or Law of <b>Armed</b> <b>Conflict)</b> is {{the distinction between}} combatants and civilians. This principle states that in international <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> some persons are combatants, {{with the right to}} participate in hostilities as well as being liable for attack, whereas others are civilians and shall be protected against the effects of military operations. In <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> there is no legal combatant status for persons engaged in hostilities. In fact, all states have laws that make armed opposition against the Government a serious criminal offense. This paper explores the question of individual legal status of direct participants in <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> based on International Humanitarian Law as it is, not as it ought to be. Even without formal legal status, direct participants in <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> have certain legal rights. International treaties provide minimum rights that secure human treatment and indispensable judicial guarantees for all participants. And more important is the development of international customary law to govern internal strife. <b>Non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> are no longer the lawless area that they used to be. But individual legal status is, and will continue to be, a disputed area of International Humanitarian Law as it challenges state sovereignty...|$|R

5000|$|According to a United States Government {{document}} from 2010, {{the rule}} governing targeting in a <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> {{is the international}} humanitarian law which {{is commonly known as}} the laws of war.

40|$|In {{a debate}} with Prof. Yuval Shany, the author {{argues that the}} {{equality}} of belligerents in international humanitarian law of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> should be abandoned, because it either subjects many armed groups to unrealistic requirements they cannot comply with or it limits the obligations of governmental forces to minimal obligations. The author provides examples of fields in which IHL of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> which becomes increasingly similar to IHL of international <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> is unrealistic for most armed groups. The author suggest rather a sliding-scale of obligations for armed groups, that will increase according to the intensity of violence {{and the degree of}} organization of the group...|$|R

5000|$|The first (GCI), second (GCII), third (GCIII), {{and fourth}} (GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the four most {{relevant}} {{for the treatment}} of the victims of conflicts.

5000|$|The {{text of the}} {{declaration}} states that [...] "The present Declaration is only binding for the Contracting Powers {{in the case of}} a war between two or more of them". Until relatively recently, the prohibition on the use of expanding bullets was only applicable to international armed conflicts between the countries that have signed it. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross's customary international law study, customary international law now prohibits their use in any armed conflicts. This has been disputed by the United States that maintains that the use of expanding bullets can be legal when there is a clear military necessity.The adoption of an amendment to Article 8 at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala makes the use of expanding bullets in <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> a war crime.|$|E
40|$|This article puts forward an {{argument}} for a particular approach to {{the interpretation of the}} definition of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

In supporting this position, {{the first half of the}} article analyses the travaux preparatoires of the Rome Statute. Here relevant clauses relating to <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> are analysed in order to highlight the threshold of application intended by their drafters.

Drawing, among other things, on the conventional usage of the term ‘armed conflict not of an international character’ and the customary status of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> provisions in the Rome Statute, {{an argument}} is advanced for an understanding of the threshold contained in Article 8 (2) (f) as the one identical to that of common Article 3...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Norwegian Armed Forces {{are today}} {{organized}} mainly {{as a response}} force, and used as a political tool in <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> operating under mandate of the UN Security Council. The enemy we are facing in these conflicts {{is not necessarily the}} traditional army of another state, but often non-state actors organized as armed groups. International Humanitarian Law (IHL) has traditionally focused on <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> between states. <b>Non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> are {{for a number of reasons}} less developed as treaty law. As a consequence several aspects of IHL regarded as customary law in international <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> are put to the test in <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> such as in Afghanistan. One of the debated issues regarding IHL in <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> is the status of fighters, especially those belonging to a non-state party to the conflict. Are they civilians that must be protected unless and fore such time they directly participate in hostilities, or do they by virtue of their membership in an organized armed group qualify as lawful targets? This study aims to identify applicable law regarding to what extent members of non-state armed groups are lawful targets in <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> The study will hopefully contribute to increased focus on a part of humanitarian law which, especially in non-international conflicts, appears to be unclear...|$|R

40|$|Anthony Cullen {{advances}} {{an argument}} for a particular approach to the interpretation of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> in international humanitarian law. The first part examines {{the origins of the}} 'armed conflict' concept and its development as the lower threshold for the application of international humanitarian law. Here the meaning of the term is traced from its use in the Hague Regulations of 1899 until the present day. The second part focuses on a number of contemporary developments which have affected the scope of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict.</b> The case law of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia has been especially influential and the definition of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> provided by this institution is examined in detail.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the threaties and customs governing armed {{conflict in the}} context of the long standing insurgency in southeast Turkey. The first part of the article analyzes the existing treaty and customary law concerning the threshold of an armed conflict and concludes that the insurgency in Southeast Turkey existing since 1984 rises to the level of an armed conflict based on criteria identified both in treaty and customary international law. The next consideration is the classification of this conflict and this part concludes that this situation is a <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> due to lack of involvement of forces of another country. Finally, this article considers international humanitarian law applicable to this <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> and reveals that as a result of the monumental International Committee of the Red Cross customary humanitarian law study, particularly with respect to the law of targeting, that the rules applicable to international and <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> have never been closer...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether there}} is any lawful authority for foreign armed forces assisting a territorial State during a <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> to arrest and detain civilians.

In respect of Afghanistan, a number of resolutions authorized the International Assistance Stabilisation Force (ISAF) to ‘take all necessary measures’. It challenges {{the notion that the}} positive rights under international humanitarian law applicable to an international armed conflict apply, mutatis mutandis, to a <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict,</b> where national law (including human rights law having extraterritorial effect) is of primary (although not of exclusive) significance. It also considers which body of national law, that of the sending or that of the receiving State, applies to determine the lawfulness of detention of foreign civilians.

40|$|Situations of {{humanitarian}} crisis are often caused by armed conflicts. Given {{the prevalence of}} non-international armed conflicts today, ways of ameliorating these situations are {{at the forefront of}} concerns. The international humanitarian law rules governing <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> remain much less developed than those for international armed conflicts. This is exacerbated by the lack of direct human rights obligations for non-state armed groups, which makes governing the behaviour of non-state parties to non-international armed conflicts (non-state armed groups) even more challenging. Although several initiatives have been taken to encourage non-state actors to mitigate situations {{of humanitarian}} crisis, the role of human rights law is in need of further clarification. The paper aims to assess what role human rights may have in improving humanitarian crises, suggesting one specific way: The paper will first discuss the international laws applicable to situations of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict,</b> before critically analysing some of the initiatives that have already been taken to govern the behaviour of non-state armed groups. Part 3 will assess the possibility of using cease-fire agreements to impose specific human rights obligations on all parties to a <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict.</b> Finally, a conclusion will be drawn in Part 4 as to the role that human rights and ceasefire agreements could have during humanitarian crises...|$|E

30|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} methods used to reduce the human cost of <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> many of which also aim to more effectively govern the actions of NSAGs.

The scope of the measures’ contents is also variable, seemingly rendering specific examples more or less relevant to the issue of improving the fulfilment of subsistence rights during <b>non-international</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> However, the common aims of each measure (being to engage with NSAGs and bring their conduct into compliance with particular legal standards) make each example discussed below relevant in the present context.
