40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} calculations for a resized nozzle on the D-Zero test cryostat. The <b>nozzle</b> <b>neck</b> in the inner vessel with be 6 -inch schedule 10 S pipe and 8 -inch 10 S {{will be used for}} the outer vessel. On top of the nozzle will be placed the D-Zero Endcap Calorimeter signal board feedthru dewar box. This box weighs approximately 250 lbs but the weight was conservatively taken to be 500 lbs. The allowable pressure from above does not exceed 15 psig per ASME, but it does exceed 7. 5 psig required by CGA- 341 therefore reinforcement is not required. Note that the reinforcement provided by the <b>nozzle</b> <b>neck</b> in combination with the excess shell thickness is probably sufficient to satisfy the ASME requirements...|$|E

Nuzzles on fatigue or high {{pressure}} container are all combined with saddle pad, the joint between the shell and the <b>nozzle</b> is welding <b>neck,</b> {{which is better}} than any other kind joint, but the interface of nozzle and the shell is a 3 D face, which is impossible to be formed by ordinary machine tools. In this paper, established mathematics model, analyzed the relation of mathematics, compiled NC program, and realized the numerical controlled processing on machining center, the error of process are also considered...|$|R
