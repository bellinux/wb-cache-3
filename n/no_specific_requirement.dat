50|$|Because Readers in Christian Science {{churches are}} not clergy, {{they are not}} {{authorized}} to officiate over weddings. Church members ask another denomination's clergyman to perform this need. The Christian Science faith has <b>no</b> <b>specific</b> <b>requirement</b> to have funeral services or about how such services might be conducted, therefore Readers have no specific funeral duties. However, if a memorial service is desired by someone, a Reader or other Christian Scientist may select some brief passages from the Bible and Eddy's writings for such purposes.|$|E

Although some withdrawal would be useful evidence to prove that the defendant did not want to fight, not every defendant is able to escape. In R v Bird the defendant was physically attacked, and reacted instinctively and immediately without having the opportunity to retreat. Had there been a delay in the response, the reaction might have appeared more revenge than self-defense.|$|E

Laidlaw chose to submit a bid that included continuation of the blue box service while their competitors, mainly large US-based firms, did not. One such competitor submitted a bid that was about $400,000 lower than the one from Laidlaw.

Goals can be expressed as response times, a relative speed (termed velocity) or as discretionary if <b>no</b> <b>specific</b> <b>requirement</b> exists. The response time describes the duration for the work requests after they entered the system and until the application signals to WLM that the execution is completed.

5000|$|Although {{nothing has}} been officially stated, the Royal Navy may have {{declared}} interest in the potential procurement of the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft, for operation {{in a number of}} different roles. At the 2016 Farnborough Airshow, Bell Helicopter stated that although there was <b>no</b> <b>specific</b> <b>requirement</b> from the 2015 SDSR, the company was [...] "keeping the Royal Navy informed". The V-22 has been procured as a COD aircraft for the US Navy, with one of its major requirements for the role being the capability of transporting a whole F-35 engine, something that the US Marine Corps also may be doing, and this has been suggested as being attractive for the UK, in addition to other potential requirements (aerial refueling, special forces operations, heavy lift capability). A parliamentary written answer specifically stated that the V-22 is not part of immediate UK future military procurement, therefore, all of this is pure speculation.|$|E

50|$|Sibford Gower had {{a school}} by 1612 and its first schoolroom {{was built in}} 1623. A new cottage for the {{schoolmaster}} was built in 1818. In 1825 the school had 59 pupils, but this declined to 40 in 1833. The vicar of Swalcliffe complained in 1837 that the charity was mismanaged, its buildings were ruinous and the master {{and his wife were}} not competent. In 1866 the buildings were replaced with a new school and master's house. Pupil numbers recovered to 56 in 1871 and 68 in 1890. Quakers and Wesleyans in the parish held a public meeting in 1891 at which they objected to the school being classified as Church of England. The Charity Commissioners agreed that there was <b>no</b> <b>specific</b> <b>requirement</b> for its pupils to be taught in accordance with the Church of England.

5000|$|Livestock include beef cattle, dairy cattle, horses, goats, {{sheep and}} llamas. There is <b>no</b> <b>specific</b> <b>requirement</b> of feed intake for each {{livestock}} because their feed continuously varies {{based on the}} animals’ age, sex, breed, environment, etc. However basic nutrient requirement of a livestock’s feed must consist of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Dairy cattle need more energy in their feed than other type of cattle. Studies have shown that energy supplied by feed is provided by various carbohydrate sources include non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC) such as fermentable feeds or neutral detergent fiber (NDF) such as forage. Feeds with high NDF is good for rumen health, however provides less energy and vice versa. Fats are added in the livestock feed to increase energy concentration, especially when the NFC content is already too high since excessive NFC lessens the NDF fraction, affecting the rumen digestion. In ruminants, most proteins consumed are breakdown by microorganisms and the microorganism later get digested by the small intestine. The [...] suggested that the crude protein required in livestock feed should be less than 7%. Lactating ruminant especially dairy cattle require highest amount of protein, especially for milk synthesis. Minerals including calcium, phosphorus and selenium are required by livestock for maintaining growth, reproduction and bone health.|$|E

30|$|First, authors did {{not provide}} the positions of patient’s head during {{laryngoscopy}} and intubation. Because the use of DL to obtain the laryngeal visualization requires alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and laryngeal axes, a sniffing position is often recommended for intubation with DL. In contrast, the use of VL to visualize the larynx does not require alignment of three airway axes. Thus, intubation with VL has <b>no</b> <b>specific</b> <b>requirement</b> of patients’ head position [2].
