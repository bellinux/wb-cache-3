25|$|However, {{during the}} course of cultivation, the land was {{stripped}} of its natural vegetation where shrubs were usually processed into charcoal, and the soil disc-ploughed and seeded. Although yields were initially high, exposure of the topsoil to deflation and erosion, combined with <b>nutrient</b> <b>depletion</b> in the absence of crop rotation schemes, led to drastic declines within just a few years and rapid deforestation. The cultivators then were forced to relocate to virgin plots and the process was repeated. The abandoned land- meanwhile became useless not only for cultivation, but also as grazing ground because of the destruction of the native vegetation. By the end of the 1970s, eight million feddans (34,000km2) had already come under cultivation (Shepherd, 1983). The attendant processes of desertification have been well documented and shown to have led to a significant expansion of the desert to the south (Ibrahim, 1978)..|$|E
25|$|The {{planting}} of Eucalyptus sp. has been criticised {{because of concerns}} that soil would be degraded by <b>nutrient</b> <b>depletion</b> and other biological changes. During the last ten years, in the northwestern regions of Uruguay the Eucalyptus sp. plantations have reached annual forestation rates of 300%. That zone has a potential forested area of 1,000,000 hectares, approximately 29% of the national territory dedicated to forestry, of which approximately 800,000 hectares are currently forested by monoculture of Eucalyptus spp. It is expected that the radical and durable substitution of vegetation cover leads {{to changes in the}} quantity and quality of soil organic matter. Such changes may also influence soil fertility and soil physical and chemical properties. The soil quality effects associated with Eucalyptus sp. plantations could have negative effects on soil chemistry; for example: soil acidification, iron leaching, allelopathic activities and a high C:N ratio of litter. Additionally, as most scientific understanding of land cover change effects is related to ecosystems where forests were replaced by grasslands or crops, or grassland was replaced by crops, the environmental effects of the current Uruguayan land cover changes are not well understood. The first scientific publication on soil studies in western zone tree plantations (focused on pulp production) appeared in 2004 and described soil acidification and soil carbon changes, similar to a podzolisation process, and destruction of clay (illite-like minerals), which is the main reservoir of potassium in the soil. Although these studies were carried out in an important zone for forest cultivation, they cannot define the current situation in the rest of the land area under eucalyptus cultivation. Moreover, recently Jackson and Jobbagy have proposed another adverse environmental impact that may result from Eucalyptus culture on prairie soils: stream acidification.|$|E

After its introduction into the zone of West Africa in 1890, the area planted to cocoa increased rapidly to its present 1. 5 million hectares and yield increased to peak of 310, 000 tons in 1965. However, as early as 1940 manifestation of deficiency symptoms necessitated the need for research to balance soil nutrients, and from 1966, yield declined gradually to its present 155, 000 tons, and many workers have attributed this yield decline essentially to soil nutrients imbalance.

30|$|Autophagy is a conserved catabolic {{process that}} {{delivers}} damaged organelles or long-lived proteins to lysosomes for bulk degradation (Kroemer and Levine, 2008; Rubinsztein et al., 2011), {{which is considered}} as a mechanism that protects cells against accumulation of damaged organelles and DNA, misfolded proteins, and allows cells to mobilize their energy reserves in response to <b>nutrients</b> <b>depletion,</b> hypoxia, and ER stress (Gonzalez-Polo et al., 2005; Kouroku et al., 2007; Galluzzi et al., 2008; Morselli et al., 2010). During the autophagic process, pre-autophagosome elongates and fuses to form double-membrane vesicle autophagosomes within the cytoplasm. The autophagosomes fuse with acidic lysosomes where the entrapped contents are degraded by proteases. The ER, mitochondria as well as plasma membrane are the major membrane sources contributing to the maturation of pre- or autophagosomal structures (Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009; Hailey et al., 2010; Ravikumar et al., 2010).

40|$|During the {{austral summer}} of 2002, {{a large and}} {{persistent}} phytoplankton bloom was detected with SeaWiFS imagery in the Georgia Basin to the north-west of South Georgia, while waters {{to the east of}} the island were relatively unproductive. A British Antarctic Survey research cruise in January 2002 confirmed this west/east difference with production values of up to 2. 5 g C m(- 2) d(- 1) and chlorophyll a (chl a) values up to 15 mg m(- 3) at stations to the northwest of the island and 0. 17 g C m(- 2) d(- 1) and 1. 3 mg chl a m(- 3) to the northeast. These differences were not attributable to light limitation as mixed layer depth never exceeded critical depth. Instead, substantial <b>nutrient</b> <b>depletions</b> to the northwest of the island compared with the northeast suggested a difference in nutrient use between the two regions. The exceedingly high <b>nutrient</b> <b>depletions</b> (to < 6. 0 and 0. 3 mmol m(- 3) for NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P, respectively) measured to the northwest were associated with an anticyclonic eddy situated over the Northwest Georgia Rise. Furthermore, differences in NO 3 -N:PO 4 -P depletion ratios suggested a greater ability in the northwest phytoplankton to utilise NO 3 -N, and a greater dependence on NH 4 -N at the northeast stations. Three distinct station groups were identified around the island based on watermass and size-fractionated chlorophyll. To the east, waters were characterised by a high proportion of microplankton and low NO 3 -N:PO 4 -P depletion ratios, to the west, by either a high proportion of microplankton and high NO 3 -N:PO 4 -P depletion ratios, or a high proportion of nanoplankton and moderate NO 3 -N:PO 4 -P depletion ratios. We consider this to be indicative of greater Fe availability, promoting NO 3 -N use, to the northwest of South Georgia. However, an absence of microplankton over the western shelf regions may be due to size selective grazing by krill. Our field data, in conjunction with SeaWiFS imagery, indicated that the Georgia Basin phytoplankton most likely originated upstream of South Georgia.

40|$|Abstract: Production of {{agricultural}} products has lagged behind {{population growth in}} most parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The problem is associated to a decline in soil productivity that is a consequence of continuous cultivation with no or inadequate external soil fertility enhancement inputs. This is a common situation in central highlands of Kenya where over 90 % of farmers are resource poor smallholders and the soils are characterised by low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. The situation is worsened by cultivation methods, which are more of nutrients mining rather than nutrient conservation. The whole scenario contributes to inadequate food production leading to hunger and poverty among the farming communities. In seeking for an environmentally viable and economically feasible technology(ies) for combating soil <b>nutrients</b> <b>depletion,</b> farmer-managed on-farm trials using readily available inorganic and organic resources were conducted within the main maize/coffee/dairy land use systems of central Kenya.

Enzyme activities indicated that the contamination of the OM with the CM was less than 5 %. The OM protein profile of magnesiumdepleted cells was much simpler than that of the iron-depleted and nutrient broth grown cells. The apparent molecular weights of the OM proteins of magnesium-depleted cells were: 40000, 36000, 24500 and 14500. Iron depletion induced the synthesis of an OM protein with apparent molecular weight of 66000. The OM proteins with apparent molecular weights of 40000, 36000 and 24500 were heat-modifiable and the 24500 dalton protein was found also to be affected by the presence of 2 -mercaptoethanol. The OM consisted of 50 % protein and 20 % phospholipid and the rest was probably LPS while the CM consisted of 80 % phospholipid and 20 % protein.

Similar responses to <b>nutrient</b> <b>depletions</b> and discontinuous feed additions were monitored in different cultivation phases and experimental setups. Sudden increases in permittivity and fC occurred when feed additions were conducted.

Young rootstock trees were grown in hydroponics with half-strength Hoagland's solution (control) or without N, P, Mg, Ca and Fe (treatments N 0, P 0, Mg 0, Ca 0 and Fe 0).

However, land degradation and soil <b>nutrients</b> <b>depletion</b> have forced farmers to clear up formerly forested areas in order to keep up with production. A counter-hypothesis speculates that biodiversity was sacrificed because traditional systems of agriculture that were displaced sometimes incorporated practices to preserve wild biodiversity, and because the Green Revolution expanded agricultural development into new areas where it was once unprofitable or too arid. For example, the development of wheat varieties tolerant to acid soil conditions with high aluminium content, permitted the introduction of agriculture in sensitive Brazilian ecosystems such as Cerrado semi-humid tropical savanna and Amazon rainforest in the geoeconomic macroregions of Centro-Sul and Amazônia. Before the Green Revolution, other Brazilian ecosystems were also significantly damaged by human activity, such as the once 1st or 2nd main contributor to Brazilian megadiversity Atlantic Rainforest (above 85% of deforestation in the 1980s, about 95% after the 2010s) and the important xeric shrublands called Caatinga mainly in Northeastern Brazil (about 40% in the 1980s, about 50% after the 2010s — deforestation of the Caatinga biome is generally associated with greater risks of desertification).

50|$|Hypoxylon canker greatly {{depends on}} dying tree matter, {{which is why}} it {{generally}} attacks only damaged and stressed trees. Normal, healthy trees are able to fend of infection with their natural defense mechanisms such as basal defense and hypersensitive response (2). Furthermore, it is known that the Hypoxylon fungi already exist on the majority of trees and are only waiting for a possible infection route to be created. When damage or stress occurs, the fungi will further colonize, infect, and begin living off the nutrients of the tree, flourishing in the bark and vascular system (2). Natural stresses such as defoliation by insects, animal damage, soil <b>nutrient</b> <b>depletions,</b> drought, overcrowding, and other disease can weaken trees, enabling Hypoxylon to infect (9). Human-caused problems can also lead to infection; soil compaction and excavation, construction, and physical injuries are known stresses to trees (9).

Droughts account for a large majority of tree-related problems as the water deficit has a negative effect on the tree’s natural developments (9). Symptoms usually develop within a year after a drought, but with extreme conditions can develop in a matter of months. (4). A major factor in the survival of Hypoxylon canker is the moisture content within the tree wood. When the stresses mentioned above begin to weaken the tree, moisture content of the wood decreases. As the wood further dries, the Hypoxylon fungi will feed and further white rot and decay of the tree will occur, potentially causing death (9).|$|R
