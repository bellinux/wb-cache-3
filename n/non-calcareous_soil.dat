40|$|The {{common white}} snail (Cernuella virgata) (da Costa) is an exotic pest of grain crops in {{southern}} Australia. In {{order to better}} control these snails and develop optimal management strategies, {{it is important to}} understand how their breeding behavior is influenced by soil moisture and soil type. Pairs of adult snails were placed into vials containing either a calcareous or a <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soil</b> at five moisture levels along their soil moisture retention curves: no-water; permanent wilting-point; mid-point; field-capacity; and saturation. Survival analysis was used to estimate the tendency of C. virgata to lay an egg cluster. ANOVA showed that there was no two-way interaction between soil moisture and soil type, however, one-way ANOVA showed that the tendency of C. virgata to deposit the first egg cluster was greater in the <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soil</b> and increased as soil moisture increased. There was a higher total number of egg clusters laid in the <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soil.</b> The total number of egg clusters laid in the two soil types increased as soil moisture content increased. No eggs were laid in the no-water treatment. C. virgata breed more frequently in moist soils, and egg laying is greater in wet seasons.

The easily soluble (NH 4 NO 3 -extraction) and the oxidisable fraction (H 2 O 2 /HNO 3 -extraction) were analysed in samples of two calcareous and two <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils.</b> Correlations between soil properties and heavy metal concentrations were tested with special respect to depth distribution. The spatial distributions of the easily soluble and the oxidisable fraction were highly skewed in both examined depths (0 – 20 and 20 – 40 cm). Easily soluble heavy metal concentrations of a high percentage of samples exceeded thresholds that have been given in the German soil protection law particularly in the <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils.</b> Within the soil layers of the <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils,</b> the pH seems to control the easily soluble concentrations. However no relation between the pH and depth distribution of heavy metals within the profiles could be found. Physical properties, which determine partly penetration depth of the sludge and soil mixing caused by the removal may be the more important factors. Accordingly, high heavy metal concentrations are to be expected even in the subsoils of clayey sites. As heavy metal concentrations in the oxidisable fraction are still high, further oxidation accompanied by pH lowering has to be expected.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comDespite a long history of application of phosphorus fertilisers, P deficiency is still a major limitation to crop production on calcareous soils. Recent field research conducted in highly calcareous soils in southern Australia has demonstrated that both grain yield and P uptake of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is greater when fluid forms of P are used compared to granular forms. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this response to P in the field, we compared the lability, solubility and mobility of P applied as either a fluid (3 products) or granular (3 products) form to two calcareous and one alkaline non-calcareous soils in the laboratory. Over a five-week period, between 9. 5 and 18 % of the P initially present in the fertiliser granules did not diffuse into the surrounding soil. The degree of granule dissolution was independent of the soil type. In contrast, P solubility, lability and diffusion were significantly greater when fluid products were applied to the calcareous soils, but not to the alkaline <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soil.</b> These findings are discussed in relation to field trials results where fluid products outperformed granular fertilisers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Straw {{returning}} is {{an effective}} way to improve soil quality. Whether the bacterial community development has been changed by long-term straw returning in <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soil</b> is not clear. In this study, the following five treatments were administered: soil without fertilizer (CK); wheat and corn straw returning (WC); wheat straw returning with 276 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 (WN); manure, 60, 000 kg ha− 1 pig manure compost (M) and wheat and corn straw returning with 276 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 (WCN). The high-throughput 16 S rRNA sequencing technology was used to evaluate the bacterial communities. The results showed that the community was composed mostly of two dominant groups (Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria). Bacterial diversity increased after the application of straw and manure. Principal component analyses revealed that the soil bacterial community differed significantly between treatments. The WCN treatment showed relatively higher total soil N, available P, available K, and organic carbon and invertase, urease, cellulase activities and yield than the WC treatment. Our results suggested that application of N fertilizer to straw returning soil had significantly higher soil fertility and enzyme activity than straw returning alone, which resulted in a different bacterial community composition, Stenotrophomonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, and Acinetobacter which were the dominant genera in the WC treatment while Candidatus, Koribacter and Granulicella were the dominant genera in the WCN treatment. To summarize, wheat and maize straw returning with N fertilizer would be the optimum proposal for improving soil quality and yield in the future in non-calcareous fluro-acquic-wheat and maize cultivated soils in the North China Plain in China...|$|E
40|$|The grain yield {{benefits}} of applying micronutrient fluid fertilisers over conventional granular products in calcareous sandy loam soils have been agronomically demonstrated. An {{understanding of the}} fundamental mechanisms and reactions occurring following application of these products to soils is critical to improve fertiliser management. We therefore examined the diffusion, solubility, and potential availability of manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) from both granular and fluid forms of Mn and Zn fertiliser in an alkaline calcareous and alkaline <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soil</b> using laboratory incubation experiments in conjunction with an isotopic dilution technique with ⁵⁴Mn and ⁶⁵Zn. Enhanced mobility, solubility, and/or potential availability of Mn and Zn from fluid fertilisers were observed in comparison to Mn or Zn from granular fertilisers in both soils after 5 weeks of incubation. Differential behaviour of fluid and granular fertilisers for Mn and Zn appeared to be independent of their effects on soil pH. Most (~ 90 %) of the Mn in granular fertiliser dissolved and diffused out of the granule but was retained within 4 mm of the point of granular placement, whereas most (~ 85 %) of the Zn in the granular Zn fertiliser source remained in the granule.

40|$|The {{absence of}} iron (Fe) in the {{nutrient}} solution induces several physiological and morphological adaptations in {{the roots of}} Poncirus trifoliata, a citrus rootstock, thereby modifying its overall nutritional status. Whether these changes are advantageous when plants are transplanted to calcareous soils needs to be assessed. To achieve this objective a two-phase experiment was established, first in nutrient solution (phase I) then in pots containing different soils (phase II). In phase I, P. trifoliata L. Raf. plants were grown in Hoagland’s solution with 120 M of Fe (Fe 120 treatment) or without (Fe 0 treatment). At the end of phase I (87 days), Fe-chlorotic plants had less chlorophyll in apical younger leaves, root tips were swollen and their FC-R activity was enhanced, typical responses to Fe-stress. Chlorotic plants had less Fe compared to control plants, but accumulated more Cu and Zn. In contrast the root to shoot ratio (dry weight) and the amounts of macronutrients were not affected by Fe chlorosis. In phase II, plants of both treatments were transplanted to pots containing a calcareous (C) or a non-calcareous (nC) soil resulting in four treatments: Fe 0 nC, Fe 120 nC, Fe 0 C and Fe 120 C. From the end of phase I {{until the end of}} the experiment (353 days), the calcareous soil negatively affected the overall nutritional balance in both Fe 0 and Fe 120 treatments.

40|$|A soil {{acidification}} {{model has been}} developed to estimate long-term chemical changes in soil and soil water in response to changes in atmospheric deposition. Its major outputs include base saturation, pH and the molar Al/BC ratio, where BC stands for divalent base cations. Apart from net uptake and net immobilization of N, the processes accounted for are restricted to geochemical interactions, including weathering of carbonates, silicates and Al oxides and hydroxides, cation exchange and CO 2 equilibriums. First, the model's behavior in the different buffer ranges between pH 7 and pH 3 is evaluated by analyzing the response of an initially calcareous soil of 50 cm depth to a constant high acid load (5000 molc ha- 1 yr- 1) {{over a period of}} 500 yr. In calcareous soils weathering is fast and the pH remains high (near 7) until the carbonates are exhausted. Results indicate a time lag of about 100 yr for each percent CaCO 3 before the pH starts to drop. In <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> the response in the range between pH 7 and 4 mainly depends on the initial amount of exchangeable base cations. A decrease in base saturation by H/BC exchange and Al/BC exchange following dissolution of Al 3 + leads to a strong increase in the Al/BC ratio near pH 4. A further decrease in pH to values near 3. 0 does occur when the A 1 oxides and/or hydroxides are exhausted. The analyses show that this could occur in acid soils within several decades. The buffer mechanisms in the various pH ranges are discussed in relation to Ulrich's concept of buffer ranges. Secondly, the impact of various deposition scenarios on <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> is analyzed for a time period of 100 yr. The results indicate that the time lag between reductions in deposition and a decrease in the Al/BC ratio is short. However, substantial reductions up to a final deposition level of 1000 molc ha- 1 yr- 1 are needed to get Al/BC ratios below a critical value of 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Greater than {{expected}} injury by {{western corn rootworm}} (WCR) (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) to Cry 3 Bb 1 expressing maize hybrids (Zea mays L.) {{has been reported in}} southwestern Nebraska. Affected areas of some fields are often associated with high pH calcareous soils where maize growth is poor and iron chlorosis is common. As part of a comprehensive study to understand potential causes of unexpected injury, experiments were conducted during 2013 and 2014 to ascertain whether the calcareous soil conditions and associated poor maize growth negatively affect the expression of Cry 3 Bb 1. Quantitative determination of Cry 3 Bb 1 protein expression levels in root tissues was carried out on plants at V 5 –V 6 growth stage using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cry 3 Bb 1 and non-Bt near isoline maize hybrids were artificially infested with Cry 3 Bb 1 -susceptible WCR eggs to measure survival and efficacy of Cry 3 Bb 1 maize in calcareous and noncalcareous soils. Results showed that there was not a significant difference in expression of Cry 3 Bb 1 protein between plants from calcareous and <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> (18. 9 – 21. 2 μg/g fresh weight). Western corn rootworm survival was about sevenfold greater from the non-Bt isoline than Cry 3 Bb 1 maize indicating that Cry 3 Bb 1 performed as expected when infested with a Cry 3 Bb 1 susceptible rootworm population. When survival from calcareous and <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> was compared, no significant differences were observed in each soil. A significant positive correlation between soil pH and expression of Cry 3 Bb 1 protein in roots was detected from samples collected in 2014 but not in 2013.

Results suggest that Cry 3 Bb 1 expression levels were sufficient to provide adequate root protection against WCR regardless of soil environment, indicating that lowered Cry 3 Bb 1 expression is not a contributing factor to the greater {{than expected}} WCR injury observed in some southwestern Nebraska maize fields.

40|$|A full {{understanding}} of the processes controlling the movement of pesticides within the soil 1 water regime {{is critical to the}} successful reduction of losses of these substances to surface waters. Until recent years the importance of absorbed phase transport of pesticides has largely been ignored with respect to drainflow and the appearance of strongly absorbed hydrophobic compounds in riverine sediments has hitherto been largely attributed to surface runoff 1 erosion. Field studies were setup for the 1994 / 5 winter season to investigate the hydrology and chemistry associated with drainflow from the lighter clay soils of Boarded Barns Farm, with two calcareous (Hanslope and Stretham) and two non-calcareous (Melford and Ludford) soils being chosen for study. Instrumented study plot areas were established in each field, with drainflow measurement and water sampling being automated. Laboratory based investigations (including rainfall simulation and desorption) were carried out to support, extend and clarify the field data, in particular the processes involved in the transport of isoproturon and sediment. A striking feature seen in the field studies was the appearance of large amounts of suspended sediment in drainflow from the Melford soil, in contrast to the clear drainflow from the calcareous soils. The sediments in drain flow were identified as being of surface origin, generated by rainfall impact and transported via preferential by-pass flow. Laboratory investigations have indicated that the chemical nature of the topsoil is a dominant factor controlling the transport of sediments and clay flocculation due to the presence of calcium carbonate is proposed as a mechanism for preventing sediment transport in the calcareous soils. Where sediment was found in drainflow, it was shown to be responsible for the transport and losses in the absorbed phase of not only diflufenican, a strongly absorbed pesticide, but also isoproturon, a weakly absorbed pesticide. The laboratory studies indicate that isoproturon is transported predominantly absorbed to sediment and later desorbs 1 diffuses slowly into the aqueous phase of the receiving waters. The results of the field experiments were confirmed by the rainfall simulation studies on 20 cm deep (20 cm diameter) topsoil cores taken from the field, which showed sediment transport only in the <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soil.</b> The extent of this phenomena of sediment transport in the UK is not well defined, due to the historical lack of research, however soils known to show the effect have a land coverage of 6 % of England and Wales.

Addition of 50 % chemical fertilizers to 40 g sewage sludge per kg of soil did not significantly affect tiller and leaf number per plant, stem length, volume of roots, shoot dry matter and WUE of rice. The highest tiller number per plant, stem diameter, root length and the ratio of shoot dry matter to that of root were observed in continuous submergence treatment. The highest WUE of rice plant was in alternate saturation treatment. The effect of soil water conditions on plant height, leaf number per plant and shoot dry matter was not significant. In general, alternate saturation with application of 40 g sewage sludge per kg of soil could be recommended to achieve optimum growth of rice plant and increase of WUE...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to characterise nutritional-I status in Malawi. Dietary-I intakes were {{assessed}} using new datasets of crop, fish, salt and water-I concentrations, while I status was assessed for 60 women living on each of calcareous and <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> as defined by urinary iodine concentration (UIC).

40|$|Salinity and {{sodicity}} {{are major}} constraints for crop production in arid and semi-arid {{regions of the}} world. Salt-affected soils cover 6. 5 % of the total land area of the world. Since the global soil carbon (C) pool {{is greater than the}} atmospheric and biotic pool combined, changes in soil organic matter content will affect atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentration. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Soil organic carbon models, which have been successfully validated for non-saline soils, are important for estimation of past and future SOC contents and for evaluating management effects on SOC. However, it was unclear if they accurately predict CO₂ emission/SOC stocks in salt-affected soils. In this work, an integrated approach using remote sensing, incubation experiments, modelling and geographical information system was used to simulate SOC dynamics in salt-affected soils at field and regional scale in the past, present and the future. Satellite imagery was used to map soil salinity and select soil sampling sites in two climatically distinct regions which also differ in cause of salinity: Kadina, South Australia and Muktsar district (Punjab), India. High resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Quick bird, spatial resolution 0. 6 m) was used to map salinity (~ 1 : 10000 scale) in an agricultural area around Kadina, South Australia where salinity associated with ground water or an impermeable subsoil is wide-spread. Resourcesat-I (spatial resolution 23. 5 m) was used for mapping salinity on a 1 : 50000 scale in Muktsar (Punjab), India where salinity is induced by irrigation. Unsupervised classification of the Quick bird imagery (September, 2008) covering the study area in South Australia (hereafter called Australia) allowed differentiation of severity levels of salt-affected soils, but these levels did not match those based on electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) measurements of the soil samples, primarily because the expression of salinity was strongly influenced by paddock-level variations in crop type, growth and prior land management. Segmentation of the whole image into 450 paddocks and unsupervised classification using a paddock-by-paddock-approach resulted in a more accurate discrimination of salinity with image derived salinity classes correlated with EC but not with SAR. For the Indian site (hereafter called India), Resourcesat-I LISS-III data of April 2005, October 2005 and February 2006 was visually interpreted for variation in spectral properties. The map of salt-affected soils was generated after integration of ground and laboratory data with delineated land use units from the satellite data. On the basis of land use and soil types, 120 (59 saltaffected and 61 non-salt-affected) and 160 (70 -salt-affected and 90 -non-salt-affected) soils were collected from 0 - 0. 30 m depth from the Indian and Australian sites, respectively. Salt-affected soils occur in dry climates and often contain calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) particularly at pH > 7. 5. Therefore, using CO₂ emission as a measure of microbial activity and SOC decomposition in these soils is problematic, but an experiment involving addition of 2 % wheat residues and varying the rate of calcium carbonate added to a <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soil</b> showed that CO₂ emission from salt-affected soils was not affected by CaCO₃ addition in the presence of residues. It has been suggested that the salt concentration in the soil solution (osmotic potential) is a better parameter than the EC of a soil suspension to estimate the salinity effect on plant growth. Therefore, an incubation experiment with four soils differing in texture and amended with sodium chloride (NaCl) was conducted to assess the effect of soil texture and osmotic potential (O[subscript]s, calculated from EC and water content) on CO₂ release. The results of this study showed that, compared to saline soils from the field, the decrease in CO₂ release was greater in these soils suggesting that the sudden increase in salinity leads to overestimation of the salinity effect compared to saline soils in the field where salinity increases gradually. The relative decrease in respiration was less when plotted against O[subscript]s than if plotted against EC. To investigate the importance of salinity compared to other soil properties in soils from a salt-affected landscape, CO₂ emission from the soils of India and Australia with a wide range of EC and SAR with 2 % (w/w) mature wheat residue was measured over 120 days at constant temperature and soil water content. Cumulative CO₂ emission from unamended and amended soils was related to soil properties by stepwise regression models. Carbon dioxide release in salt-affected landscapes is affected by EC, C availability (size of C pools) and clay content. Electrical conductivity had a negative impact on CO₂ release in soils of India and Australia, which shows the universal effect of salinity on CO₂ release, irrespective of climate and origin of salinity. Therefore, there is a need to add a decomposition rate modifier for salinity in the SOC models for accurate prediction of SOC dynamics and CO₂ release from salt-affected soils. The Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC) was modified to take into account the reduced plant inputs into salt-affected soils. Plant inputs were calculated based on a generalised equation from the literature. The decomposition rate modifier for saltaffected soils was based on the comparison of measured and modelled CO₂ emissions from wheat residue amended soils of India and Australia. The modelled CO₂ emissions were higher than measured CO₂ emissions. In order to match the measured and modelled CO₂ emissions, rate modifiers ranging from 0. 2 - 1 were introduced in the model. After accounting for the laboratory effect due to soil disturbance, the impact of salinity (calculated using O[subscript]s) or sodicity (measured as SAR) on the rate of decomposition was calculated. A significant positive relationship was found between decomposition rate modifier and O[subdcript]s whereas SAR had no effect. Therefore, a decomposition rate modifier due to salinity (as a function of O[subscript]s) was introduced into RothC. The RothC with the plant input modifier and decomposition rate modifier was used to estimate past SOC content when saline soils were non-saline and future SOC content. These simulations were performed for the Indian and Australian sites. The results showed that the modelled past SOC when the soils were non-saline was higher than measured SOC of saline soils; thus these soils have lost SOC (31 t ha⁻¹ for India and 55 t ha⁻¹ for Australia). On the other hand, simulations with the decomposition rate modifier only, without taking into account the reduced plant input, suggest that SOC of saline soils has increased since they became saline. Since SOC in saline soils is lower than in non-saline soils, this shows that in order to accurately model SOC stocks in saline soils, both reduced plant inputs and reduced decomposition rate have to be taken into account. Overall SOC content was more strongly affected by reduced plant inputs than by reduced decomposition rates. In addition, future SOC stocks of India and Australia were simulated with and without modifiers from 2009 - 2100. In saline soils of both regions, the simulation of SOC without modifiers showed that, compared to the present SOC content, SOC would decrease by ≤ 15 % by the year 2100, whereas simulations with decomposition rate modifier and plant input modifier indicate that SOC would decrease by 39 % for the Indian site and by 29 % for the Australian site. The key findings from the research are: I. High resolution multispectral imagery with paddock-by-paddock approach allowed accurate mapping of different levels of salinity severity. II. In saline soils, osmotic potential is a better measure to assess the impact of salt on microbial activity than EC, particularly when comparing soils of different texture. III. In soils from salt-affected landscapes, salinity and reduced carbon availability determine CO₂ emission. IV. Two novel approaches were developed: (a) calculation of a decomposition rate modifier from incubation experiments after taking into account the laboratory effect and (b) calculation of past SOC content when saline soils were nonsaline. V. The predictions of SOC stocks from saline soils have been overestimated by not taking into account the negative effect of salt on decomposition rate and plant inputs. VI. For realistic modelling of SOC stocks and turnover in saline soils, both reduced decomposition rate and reduced plant inputs need to be considered. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{number of}} {{previous}} studies have reported {{the existence of a}} minimum in phosphate solubility between pH 5. 5 and 7 in <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils.</b> Different hypotheses have been forwarded to explain this phenomenon. In this study, ten soil samples with varying textures and phosphorus status were subjected to batch experiments in which dissolved phosphate was measured as a function of pH and phosphate load. Soil samples with more than 20 % clay all had a minimum phosphate solubility between pH 6 and 7, whereas for samples with < 10 % clay, no such minimum was observed. Further experiments involving additions of phosphate and arsenate showed an increasing adsorption of these anions with decreasing pH also below pH 6 in clay soils, suggesting that the pH dependence on adsorption and desorption in short-term experiments was not the same. Kinetic experiments showed that the increased phosphate desorption at lower pH values in <b>non-calcareous</b> clay <b>soils</b> was a quick process, which is consistent with adsorption/desorption being the most important mechanism governing the retention and release of inorganic P. Moreover, by comparing extraction results with batch experiment results for samples from a long-term fertility experiment, it was concluded that more than 60 % of the accumulated phosphate was occluded, i. e. not reactive within 6 days. Additional evidence for an important role of occluded phosphate comes from an analysis of the Freundlich sorption isotherms for the studied soils. It is hypothesized that interlayered hydroxy-Al and hydroxy-Fe polymers in clay minerals may be important for P dynamics in clay soils by trapping some of the P in an occluded form. The results also suggest that improved knowledge on the speciation and dynamics of phosphorus in soils is required for consistent mechanistically based modeling of phosphate sorption/desorption reactions.

These estimates can be improved by using local crop composition data that can capture environmental influences including soil type. This study aimed to provide spatially resolved crop composition data for Malawi, where information is currently limited. Six hundred and fifty-two plant samples, representing 97 edible food items, were sampled from > 150 sites in Malawi between 2011 and 2013. Samples were analysed by ICP-MS for up to 58 elements, including the essential minerals calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn). Maize grain Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Se and Zn concentrations were greater from plants grown on calcareous soils than those from the more widespread low-pH soils. Leafy vegetables from calcareous soils had elevated leaf Ca, Cu, Fe and Se concentrations, but lower Zn concentrations. Several foods were found to accumulate high levels of Se, including the leaves of Moringa, a crop not previously been reported in East African food composition data sets.

Experimental evidence indicates that {{the great majority of}} the seeds exhibit vernal germination which, in favourable conditions, is quasi-simultaneous in character. However, there is a variable proportion, usually small, of autumnal germinations resulting in a degree of seasonal dimorphism.

An understanding of the behaviour of organic acids in these soils {{is crucial to the}} critical assessment of their potential capacity for nutrient mobilization. The aim of this study was therefore to study the sorption reactions and mineralization potentials of three organic acids commonly found in root exudates of calcicole plants (citrate, malate and oxalate). Using maize as a model plant, we studied the root exudation of organic acids into a calcareous soil and assessed the organic acid biodegradation rate in rhizosphere and bulk soil. Our results indicate that malate and citrate are rapidly biodegraded in this calcareous soil, in agreement with previous studies presented for <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils.</b> In contrast, oxalate appears to be resistant to microbial degradation possibly due to substrate protection by the formation and precipitation of Ca-oxalate. The rate of malate biodegradation was significantly enhanced in rhizosphere soil relative to that in bulk soil possibly reflecting the high degree of efflux of this organic acid from maize roots.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The goal of {{this study}} was to gather {{information}} on the autecology, reproductive ecology, and population dynamics of Astragalus australis var. olympicus as a baseline for conservation strategies and to help explain its restricted range. Approximately four thousand individuals occurred in four known population centers in the Olympic Mountains, Olympic National Park, Clallam County, Washington. The populations were restricted to plant communities on calcareous substrates largely on southeast to southwest slopes above 1450 m. A. australis var. olympicus was absent from surrounding <b>non-calcareous</b> <b>soils.</b> Several characteristics of the physical environment and competition with associated plants influenced its distribution within calcareous sites. The relative importance of the physical environment and competition differed between plant community-types. Most plants produced a large number of flowers and ovules, but relatively few of these formed fruits and seeds. In decreasing importance, ovules in fruits were lost to predation, seed abortion, and lack of fertilization. The absolute percentages of these fates differed from site to site and year to year. Excluding insects by bagging flowers significantly reduced fruit set, but seed set per fruit was unaffected. After seeds were scarified to relieve dormancy, germination was sensitive to temperature and moisture availability, but some seeds germinated at environmental extremes. About 11...|$|R
