40|$|The {{observation}} of heterogeneous protein folding kinetics {{has been widely}} interpreted in terms of multiple independent unrelated pathways (IUP model), both experimentally and in theoretical calculations.

It is essential to decide between these fundamentally different folding mechanisms. This article shows, contrary to previous supposition, that the heterogeneous folding kinetics observed for the staphylococcal nuclease protein (SNase) does not require alternative parallel pathways. SNase folding kinetics can be fit equally well by a single predetermined pathway that allows for optional misfolding errors, which are known to occur ubiquitously in protein folding. Structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic information for the folding intermediates and pathways of many proteins is consistent with the predetermined pathway–optional error (PPOE) model but contrary to the properties implied in IUP models...|$|R

40|$|We’ve {{known for}} over 50 years that {{reproductive}} ageing results in <b>a</b> gradual loss <b>of</b> fertility until about age 37, when {{the rate of}} decline accelerates dramatically. The loss of fertility is accompanied by increased risks of miscarriage and of conceiving babies with Down syndrome. But {{we have not been}} clear on the precise mechanism by which this occurs – until <b>now.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> woman’s eggs are produced before she is born and remain in a preserved state within structures called primordial follicles for several decades. Follicles are gradually recruited to grow; this process begins soon after they are formed and continues throughout the woman’s reproductive life. Once a follicle is triggered to re-initiate development, it enters into the pool of growing follicles, most of which will disintegrate along the way. Hundreds of thousands of follicles are lost before puberty but once puberty occurs, follicles go through <b>an</b> extra phase <b>of</b> maturation so that each month, one follicle (usually) is ovulated and a single egg released. The majority of follicles are still lost along the way. The last three months of growth and maturation of recruited follicles are critical for normal development and this is when the ageing environment causes problems. Strangely enough, having <b>a</b> low number <b>of</b> remaining follicles causes the problem. Such <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> follicles have been wasted during the woman’s life that as she ages there just isn’t the critical mass remaining to give out the correct hormonal signals. The size of the pool can be measured by the AMH (anti-muellarian hormone) test or slightly less accurately by the FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) test. A low AMH or a high FSH result is a sign that the pool is near or at a critically low level. Some younger women have a condition known as reduced ovarian reserve, which has similar outcomes to ageing. This is caused by several different genes, the best known of which is the Fragile X gene, which causes learning difficulties in affected males. Women carrying this gene have low ovarian reserves and higher risks of having Down syndrome babies, as well as of sons with fragile X. Anyone who is experiencing reduced fertility, however young, would be wise to have FSH or AMH testing before undertaking any fertility treatment. When the follicle number is below the critical mass, the levels <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hormone inhibin B become very low. This in turn reduces the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hormone called DHEA dehydroepiandrosterone, which is produced both by the ovarian theca cells and the adrenal gland. DHEA controls critical elements of the ovarian environment at the earliest stage of maturation of the follicles, some 70 days before ovulation. DHEA is the precursor of hormones (both androgens and oestrogens) that are necessary for many aspects of follicle development. However, normal levels of DHEA are also required for the activation of another hormone called PPAR alpha which controls over 200 genes, especially those regulating mitochondria (the powerhouse of the cell) and fat metabolism. Oddly enough, the reduced fat metabolism caused by low follicle number not only changes the metabolism of the developing follicle but causes more follicles to self-destruct. So as well as improving egg quality, DHEA also stops the rapid loss of follicles and reduces the rate of ageing. Many clinics in Europe and the United States now are treating women with DHEA supplementation and clinics report that taking pharmaceutical DHEA for about three months may restore the quality of the eggs so that women can conceive normally. Age of about 40 may be the upper limit. But to date, the published results on DHEA treatment have been mixed, possibly because IVF clinics have treated women who have <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> different reasons for their infertility. As such it’s not routinely prescribed in Australia. DHEA supplementation may also be dangerous for some women, especially those with polycystic ovarian syndrome where there is often already excess DHEA. It is vital that DHEA levels are measured before any supplements are taken.

60|$|Joan {{crashed into}} the Burgundians at Marguy and was repulsed. Then she saw the other Burgundians moving down from Clairoix. Joan rallied her men and charged again, and was again rolled back. Two assaults occupy {{a good deal of}} time--and time was {{precious}} here. The English were approaching the road now from Venette, but the boulevard opened fire on them and they were checked. Joan heartened her men with inspiring words and led them to the charge again in great style. This time she carried Marguy with a hurrah. Then she turned at once to the right and plunged into the plan and struck the Clairoix force, which was just arriving; then there was heavy work, and plenty of it, the two armies hurling each other backward turn about and about, and victory inclining first to the one, then to the other. <b>Now</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> there was a panic on our side. Some say one thing caused it, some another. Some say the cannonade made our front ranks think retreat was being cut off by the English, some say the rear ranks got the idea that Joan was killed. Anyway our men broke, and went flying in a wild rout for the causeway. Joan tried to rally them and face them around, crying to them that victory was sure, but it did no good, they divided and swept by her like a wave. Old D'Aulon begged her to retreat while there was yet a chance for safety, but she refused; so he seized her horse's bridle and bore her along with the wreck and ruin in spite of herself. And so along the causeway they came swarming, that wild confusion of frenzied men and horses--and the artillery had to stop firing, of course; consequently the English and Burgundians closed in in safety, the former in front, the latter behind their prey. Clear to the boulevard the French were washed in this enveloping inundation; and there, cornered in an angle formed by the flank of the boulevard and the slope of the causeway, they bravely fought a hopeless fight, and sank down one by one.|$|E
