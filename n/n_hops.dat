40|$|This work {{introduces}} decentralized query processing techniques {{based on}} MIDAS, a novel distributed multidimensional index. In particular, MIDAS implements a distributed k-d tree, where leaves correspond to peers, and internal nodes dictate message routing. MIDAS requires that peers maintain little network information, and features mechanisms that support fault tolerance and load balancing. The proposed algorithms process point and range queries over the multidimensional indexed space in only O(log <b>n)</b> <b>hops</b> in expectance, where n is the network size. For nearest neighbor queries, two processing alternatives are discussed. The first, termed eager processing, has low latency (expected value of O(log <b>n)</b> <b>hops)</b> but may involve {{a large number}} of peers. The second, termed iterative processing, has higher latency (expected value of O(log 2 <b>n)</b> <b>hops)</b> but involves far fewer peers. A detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates that our query processing techniques outperform existing methods for settings involving real spatial data {{as well as in the}} case of high dimensional synthetic data. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|E

40|$|Several {{peer-to-peer}} {{networks are}} based upon randomized graph topologies that permit ef-ficient greedy routing, e. g., randomized hypercubes, randomized Chord, skip-graphs and con-structions based upon small-world networks. In each of these networks, a node has out-degree O(log n), where n denotes {{the total number of}} nodes, and greedy routing is known to take O(log <b>n)</b> <b>hops</b> on average. Our contribution in this paper is twofold. First we investigate the lim-itations of greedy routing and establish lower-bounds for greedy routing for these networks. The main contribution of the paper is the analysis of the Neighbor-of-Neighbor (NoN) -greedy routing. The idea behind NoN, as the name suggests, is to take a neighbor’s neighbors into ac-count for making better routing decisions. The following picture emerges: Deterministic routing networks such as hypercubes and Chord have diameter Θ(log n). This means that greedy routing is optimal in the sense that its routing distance is at most (approximately) the diameter, yet networks with average degree of O(log n) may have diameter O (lognlog logn). Randomized routing networks such as skip-graphs, randomized hypercubes, randomized Chord, and constructions based upon small-world percolation networks, have diameter Θ(log n / log log n) with high probability. In all of these networks, greedy routing fails to find short routes, requiring Ω(log <b>n)</b> <b>hops</b> with high probability. Surprisingly, the NoN-greedy routing algorithm is able to diminish route-lengths to Θ(log n / log log <b>n)</b> <b>hops,</b> which is asymptotically optimal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Structured Peer to Peer (P 2 P) overlay {{networks}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular. Multi-hop systems achieve a successful lookup in O(log <b>N)</b> <b>hops,</b> whereas one-hop systems approach O(1) hops. Both approaches, but especially one-hop overlays suffer from {{a high number of}} identical messages being sent to a number of nodes on the overlay. Previous work showed that P 2 P networks benefit from the integration of the overlay network with the underlay network in which multi-destination multicast routing is available. This allows combining identical messages from the same source into joint multi-destination multicast messages to significantly reduce the number of messages. Our experimentation has centered around the one-hop EpiChord overlay. Here the problem is described using a Markov Model for more advanced analysis. The Markov Model is believed to be novel in two aspects: it is the first to investigate one-hop overlays and it is the first to study the performance of multi-destination multicast including the consideration of retransmissions of requests.
