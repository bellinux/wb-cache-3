5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of an atom {{is the amount}} of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so {{they may or may not}} have slightly <b>negative</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
25|$|Important {{cases where}} the {{computational}} definition of R2 can yield <b>negative</b> <b>values,</b> depending on the definition used, arise where the predictions that are being compared to the corresponding outcomes have not been derived from a model-fitting procedure using those data, and where linear regression is conducted without including an intercept. Additionally, <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> of R2 may occur when fitting non-linear functions to data. In cases where <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> arise, {{the mean of the}} data provides a better fit to the outcomes than do the fitted function values, according to this particular criterion.|$|E

30|$|Although {{problems}} of waste disposal or recycling {{have not been}} taken up by Sraffian economists until quite recently, rudimentary works {{can be found in}} the rather early stages of the research. Steedman (1975, 1977) shows that <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> plays a crucial role in the analysis of positive profits with <b>negative</b> surplus <b>value.</b> Certainly, he does not explicitly deal with waste problems in his works, but his anatomy of <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> potentially has the seed of the study of waste problems: The idea of <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> can naturally be developed to that of negative prices, and those prices can be interpreted as a scarcity index of bads or dis-commodities.|$|R
25|$|The {{log-normal}} distribution has no <b>negative</b> <b>values,</b> can cover {{a wide range}} of values, and fits many observed size distributions reasonably well.|$|E
25|$|However, {{compensated}} {{flow cytometry}} data frequently contains <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> due to compensation, and cell populations do occur which have low means and normal distributions.|$|E

25|$|The {{adjusted}} Rand {{index is}} the corrected-for-chance {{version of the}} Rand index. Though the Rand Index may only yield a value between 0 and +1, the adjusted Rand index can yield <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> if the index {{is less than the}} expected index.|$|E
25|$|Angles are {{commonly}} defined {{according to the}} right-hand rule. Namely, they have positive values when they represent a rotation that appears clockwise when looking in the positive direction of the axis, and <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> when the rotation appears counter-clockwise. The opposite convention (left hand rule) is less frequently adopted.|$|E

5|$|The {{latitude}} and longitude are expressed in , in which a positive latitude value refers to the northern hemisphere, and a <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> refers to the southern hemisphere. Similarly, a positive longitude value refers to the eastern hemisphere, and a <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> refers to the western hemisphere. The coordinates used {{in this article are}} sourced from Google Earth, which makes use of the WGS84 geodetic reference system. Additionally, a <b>negative</b> altitude <b>value</b> refers to land below sea level.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the complex}} numbers the {{definite}} integral (for <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> of n and x) {{can be defined}} via contour integration, but then depends on choice of path, specifically winding number – the geometric issue is that the function defines a covering space with a singularity at0.|$|E
25|$|For example, in {{probability}} theory, integrals {{are used}} to determine the probability of some random variable falling within a certain range. Moreover, the integral under an entire probability density function must equal 1, which provides a test of whether a function with no <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> could be a density function or not.|$|E
25|$|The {{spontaneous}} magnetization H grows near the critical point as the square {{root of the}} change in temperature. This is true whenever H can be calculated from the solution of an analytic equation which is symmetric between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>values,</b> which led Landau to suspect that all Ising type phase transitions in all dimensions should follow this law.|$|E

Public health efforts are focusing on replacing the passive barrier of tradition with an active barrier, such as awareness of negative health effects. <b>Negative</b> <b>values</b> of smoking {{have yet to be}} dissociated from the positive values of increasing economic and social freedoms for women.|$|E
25|$|More generally, the {{definition}} of sine (and other trigonometric functions) can be extended to any real value {{in terms of the}} length of a certain line segment in a unit circle. More modern definitions express the sine as an infinite series or as the solution of certain differential equations, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> and even to complex numbers.|$|E
25|$|A diode {{clamp circuit}} {{can take a}} {{periodic}} alternating current signal that oscillates between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>values,</b> and vertically displace it such that either the positive, or the negative peaks occur at a prescribed level. The clamper does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal, it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level.|$|E
30|$|A <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> of the {{variable}} poff(in dB) {{corresponds to the}} reduction of the power radiated at the pilot symbols and increasing power radiated at the data symbols. Such <b>negative</b> <b>value</b> is optimal in case of four transmit antennas applying an LMMSE estimator. This kind of channel estimator is of superb performance and therefore requires less power to obtain a high-quality channel estimate.|$|R

There are two requirements to achieve a negative value for refraction. First, is to fabricate a material which can produce negative permeability μeff < 0. Second, <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> for both permittivity and permeability must occur simultaneously over a common range of frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Several {{authors in}} the last 300 years have noted a {{facility}} of positional notation that amounts to a modified decimal representation. Some advantages are cited for use of numerical digits that represent <b>negative</b> <b>values.</b> In 1840 Augustin-Louis Cauchy advocated use of signed-digit representation of numbers, and in 1928 Florian Cajori presented his collection of references for negative numerals. The concept of signed-digit representation has also been taken up in computer design.|$|E
25|$|Numerically, {{the highest}} {{possible}} CIE Ra value is 100 and would only be given to a source identical to standardized daylight or a black body (incandescent lamps are effectively black bodies), dropping to <b>negative</b> <b>values</b> for some light sources. Low-pressure sodium lighting has negative CRI; fluorescent lights range from about 50 for the basic types, up to about 98 for the best multi-phosphor type. Typical LEDs have about 80+ CRI, while some manufacturers claim that their LEDs have achieved up to 98 CRI.|$|E
