Stewart found his footing in Hollywood {{thanks largely to}} Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her leading man in the 1936 romantic comedy <b>Next</b> <b>Time</b> <b>We</b> Love. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked {{six days a week}} in the MGM factory. In 1936, he acquired big-time agent Leland Hayward, who would eventually marry Sullavan. Hayward started to chart Stewart's career, deciding that the best path for him was through loan-outs to other studios.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{described}} the episode as [...] "a nasty episode that doesn't quite cohere into the level of nasty it could", but that the series [...] "doesn't do horror/action all that often, and it serves as a good change of pace if nothing else". He gave [...] "Conspiracy" [...] a score of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, who reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that while [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was a [...] "hard episode to forget", it was not quite as good as he remembered and did not quite [...] "fit" [...] with the rest of the season. He thought that certain parts of the plot were [...] "idiotic", and the Admirals reminded him of a [...] "Bond villain convention". He gave the episode an overall grade of B, writing, [...] "fingers crossed that <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> encounter a danger this sinister, the writers know how to handle it".|$|E

40|$|International audienceContrary to the {{classical}} (time-triggered) principle that samples the system states and calculates the control signal in a periodic fashion, a self-triggered control predicts the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> at which the states must be sampled and the control signal updated and applied. The main advantage of self-triggered control implementation is that it eliminates the resource utilization for continuously monitoring the states. In this paper, a new self-triggered control strategy is proposed. We propose to emulate the universal event-based formula - developed in previous work - to calculate the feedback law and the <b>next</b> activation <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> claim that our proposal behaves better than the existing self-triggered approaches due to the universal formula properties. The study is restricted to the stabilization of linear systems. Some simulations are presented comparing the proposal with existing techniques...|$|R
