500|$|To {{alleviate}} financial {{pressure on}} the band, Lambert arranged a song-writing deal which required each member to write two songs for the next album. Entwistle contributed [...] "Boris the Spider" [...] and [...] "Whiskey Man" [...] and found a <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> as second songwriter. The band found they needed to fill an extra ten minutes, and Lambert encouraged Townshend to write a longer piece, [...] "A Quick One, While He's Away". The suite of song fragments is about a girl who has an affair while her lover is away, but is ultimately forgiven.

2500|$|Revolver {{technology}} {{lives on}} in other weapons used by the military. Some autocannons and grenade launchers use mechanisms similar to revolvers, and some riot shotguns use spring-loaded cylinders holding up to 12 rounds. In addition to serving as backup guns, revolvers still fill the specialized <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> as a shield gun; law enforcement personnel using a [...] "bulletproof" [...] gun shield sometimes opt for a revolver instead of a self-loading pistol, because the slide of a pistol may strike {{the front of the}} shield when fired. Revolvers do not suffer from this disadvantage. A second revolver may be secured behind the shield to provide a quick means of continuity of fire. Many police also still use revolvers as their duty weapon due to their relative mechanical simplicity and user friendliness.|$|E
2500|$|During late 1976, AÃ©rospatiale {{decided to}} cease {{manufacture}} of the Corvette {{as a consequence}} of the company having only received orders for 27 production models during the two-and-a-half years following the aircraft's receipt of type certification against hopes that it would be able to sell six Corvettes per month. A report produced by the French government's Court of Audit found that losses accumulated by the Corvette programme amounted to roughly $190 million, or 66 per cent of Aerospatiale's fiscal deficits from 1972 to 1975. The same report noted that the company's management had lacked real appreciation of the risks involved in such a hotly competed <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> from existing British, American and French (the latter being in the form of Dassault Aviation's Falcon 20), and stated that: [...] "It is certain that the Corvette programme is, and will remain, a major commercial and financial disaster".|$|E
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{production of}} these designs led to most others being {{pushed out of}} service or into <b>niche</b> <b>roles,</b> often competing on numbers rather than armour.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] {{cantilever}} monoplane quickly proved {{its worth}} {{in almost every}} role, although a few older biplanes and other obsolescent types remained in <b>niche</b> <b>roles</b> {{for much of the}} war. Key design features during this period included: ...|$|R
2500|$|In October 2008, {{the company}} {{announced}} its intentions to produce the Seastar in the US, {{in part due to}} favourable currency exchange rates. Fabrication was to be outsourced to other companies, and was intended to use mainly American suppliers. The firm viewed the aircraft as having a <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> among private owners, airlines, and search and rescue operators. Dornier Seawings stated that it was seeking an additional $150 million to bring the type into mass production; it was also said that, in the event of 25 or more sales being secured, the Seastart could be in production as early as March 2009. In March 2009, the firm stated that it was pushing back its planned launch to the third quarter of that year, attributing this to the effects of the Great Recession, but remained optimistic about market demand for the type; it was also said that Dornier [...] required only an additional $65 million, rather than the $150 million figure given in an earlier business plan, to establish full production status and to begin manufacturing work.|$|E

50|$|Government {{was heavily}} {{dominated}} by men, {{but there were}} a few <b>niche</b> <b>roles</b> for women. For example, Nellie Newmark (1888-1978) was the clerk of the District Court at Lincoln for a half-century, 1907-56. She gained a reputation for assisting judges and new attorneys assigned to the court.|$|R
50|$|As a {{consumer}} system it was enormous, expensive, impractical, and dropped {{as soon as}} the shadow mask system was successful. However, the Triniscope idea was used commercially in several <b>niche</b> <b>roles</b> for years, notably as a color replacement for the kinescope, from which it took its name.|$|R
50|$|Considering {{its highly}} adapted folivorous jaw and tooth structure, Phosphatherium {{provides}} {{evidence of the}} high age of African endemism. The dental structure of Phosphatherium suggests its diet to consisted mainly of leaves, which indicates it may have fulfilled a <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> in its environment, although diet can only be inferred through speculation. The discovery of this animal has ultimately helped reinforce the African origin of proboscideans, and {{provide insight into the}} radiation of modern orders of placental mammals.|$|E
50|$|Magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) is a {{non-volatile}} random-access memory technology {{under development}} since the 1990s. Continued increases in density of existing memory technologies - notably flash RAM and DRAM - {{kept it in}} a <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> in the market, but its proponents believe that the advantages are so overwhelming that magnetoresistive RAM will eventually become a dominant type of memory, potentially even becoming a universal memory. It is currently in production by Everspin, and other companies including GlobalFoundries and Samsung have announced product plans.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, FIFA {{recruited}} {{him as one}} {{of their}} commentators for the World Cup in Korea/Japan. Mainly from the comfort of the International Broadcasting Centre he covered 39 of the 64 matches. It is a role he has reprised at the tournament in Germany in 2006 and several other FIFA events. In addition to this, Helm cultivated a <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> for himself as five's chief football commentator. Their [...] "ad hoc" [...] coverage of UEFA Cup ties and the occasional international ensured that Helm had clocked up {{a quarter of a century}} of national TV broadcasting in Britain.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the basic concept had been well developed, and the {{hovercraft}} {{had found a}} number of <b>niche</b> <b>roles</b> where its combination of features were advantageous.

50|$|Carter-Williams had a subdued {{freshman}} {{season at}} Syracuse in 2011-12 as he played behind Scoop Jardine, Brandon Triche and Dion Waiters. The season began about how Carter-Williams envisioned with him {{coming off the}} bench but solidly in Jim Boeheim's rotation. That <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> gradually eroded, however, as Jardine and Triche solidified their starting roles and Waiters emerged as the best sixth man in the nation. It was a difficult first season for him in {{which he did not}} play in 11 games and received sporadic minutes in others. He finished the season averaging 2.7 points, 2.1 rebounds and 10.3 minutes in 26 total games (no starts).|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{the limited}} {{frequency}} {{range of a}} 14 mm connector and its high manufacturing cost overcame its ease of assembly and the GR-874 was supplanted generally by the 7 mm type N connector and its variants, the BNC connector and the TNC connector, and the later higher frequency 3.5 mm SMA connectors. General Radio, then still {{a major source of}} RF test equipment, designed the incompatible GR-900 as a 14 mm successor to the GR-874, filling the industry's need for a higher performance sexless connector for fully reversible lab standards and related test equipment. The GR-900 was in turn succeeded in this essential <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> by the completely sexless APC-7 connector.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an incremental {{design for the}} creche scenario, focussing on a more elaborate set of architectures {{for a number of}} agents. 1 Introduction The creche, nursemaid or minder simulation has been described in [20, 4, 3, 29, 6, 7]. Here number of issues not addressed in earlier designs are tackled. A more explicit design and specification of the various agents, their states and processing capabilities is presented. There is also a need for deeper and more generic processes and architectures, tied to a richer simulation environment. Further development of our architecture will also need to address the nature of the higher (metamanagement) reflective processes. This may include features such as evaluation of behaviour and longterm goals with regard to <b>niche</b> <b>roles,</b> what <b>niche</b> <b>roles</b> are and how they develop and influence cognitive behaviour. 2 A Design For A Richer Simulation The creche scenario can be enriched in a number of ways: allowing replenishment goals for self a [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Most modern vessels {{have largely}} {{done away with}} {{conventional}} artillery, instead using cruise and guided missiles for most offensive and defensive purposes, respectively. Guns are retained for <b>niche</b> <b>roles,</b> such as the Phalanx CIWS, a multi-barrel rotary cannon used for point defense, the Mark 45 5 in, or the Otobreda 76 mm, which is used for close defense against surface combatants and shore bombardment.|$|R
50|$|Modern biplane designs {{still exist}} in {{specialist}} <b>niche</b> <b>roles</b> such as aerobatics and agricultural aircraft with the competition aerobatics role and format {{for such a}} biplane well-defined in the mid-1930s by the Udet U 12 Flamingo. The Pitts Special dominated aerobatics for many years after World War II and is still in production, while the WACO Classic YMF is a reproduction of the original Waco design.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{licensing}} another design, Pfalz instead licensed {{the previously}} patented Roland firm's Wickelrumpf (wrapped-fuselage) plywood strip-covered semi-monocoque fuselage design and combined {{it with the}} new 160 hp Mercedes D.III engine to create the Pfalz D.III. The D.III entered service in August 1917, but was not considered a match for contemporary designs like the Albatros D.V, and instead found a <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> in attacking observation balloons where its high diving speed was a major advantage. About 600 D.IIIs and slightly modified D.IIIas were built between its introduction in August and its replacement a year later. Many were still in service at that time, about 450.|$|E
5000|$|The carronade was {{designed}} as a short-range naval weapon with a low muzzle velocity for merchant ships, but it also found a <b>niche</b> <b>role</b> on warships. It was produced by the Carron ironworks and was at first sold as a system with the gun, mounting, and shot all together. The standard package of shot per gun was 25 roundshot, 15 barshot, 15 double-headed shot, 10 [...] "single" [...] grapeshot, and 10 [...] "single" [...] canister shot. [...] "Single" [...] meant that the shot weighed the same as the roundshot, while some other canister and grapeshot were also included which weighed one and a half times the roundshot.|$|E
50|$|Kaleida Labs {{formed in}} 1991 {{to produce the}} {{multimedia}} cross-platform Kaleida Media Player and the object oriented scripting language ScriptX {{that was used to}} program its behaviour. The system was aimed at the production of interactive CD ROM titles, an area of major effort in the early 1990s. When the system was delivered in 1994, it had relatively high system requirements and memory footprint, and lacked a native PowerPC version on the Mac platform. Around the same time, rapid changes in the market, especially the expansion of the World Wide Web and the Java programming language, pushed the interactive CD market into a <b>niche</b> <b>role.</b> The Kaleida platform failed to gain significant traction and the company was closed in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Tandem {{fabrication}} {{techniques have}} been used to improve the performance of existing designs. In particular, the technique can be applied to lower cost thin-film solar cells using amorphous silicon, as opposed to conventional crystalline silicon, to produce a cell with about 10% efficiency that is lightweight and flexible. This approach has been used by several commercial vendors, but these products are currently limited to certain <b>niche</b> <b>roles,</b> like roofing materials.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s the {{jet engine}} was almost {{universal}} in combat aircraft, {{with the exception}} of cargo, liaison and other specialty types. By this point some of the British designs were already cleared for civilian use, and had appeared on early models like the de Havilland Comet and Avro Canada Jetliner. By the 1960s all large civilian aircraft were also jet powered, leaving the piston engine in low-cost <b>niche</b> <b>roles</b> such as cargo flights.|$|R
50|$|While the DC-3 {{was soon}} made {{redundant}} on main routes by more advanced types {{such as the}} Douglas DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation, the design continued to prove exceptionally adaptable and useful. Large numbers continue to see service {{in a wide variety}} of <b>niche</b> <b>roles</b> well into the 21st century. In 2013 it was estimated that approximately 2,000 DC-3s and military derivatives were still flying, a testament to the durability of the design.|$|R
