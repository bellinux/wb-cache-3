2500|$|New {{processes}} that sped {{the production of}} chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness. A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the <b>natural</b> <b>fat</b> (cocoa butter or cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate. Known as [...] "Dutch cocoa", this machine-pressed chocolate {{was instrumental in the}} transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, Joseph Fry learned to make chocolate moldable by adding back melted cacao butter. Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestlé with the liquor. In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the later}} {{part of the}} 2000s and up through about 2012-2013, partial tin-cure latex or tin-cure {{silicone}} spread over a neoprene or neoprin base became popular, due to the increased realism of the tails and the relatively low cost of materials (tin-cure tails generally retail around $300-$600 USD). This proved problematic, however, as tin-cure silicones and latexes are not skin-safe materials. Effects over overexposure include [...] "skin, respiratory, kidney and liver damage. Repeated or prolonged contact with the preparation may cause removal of <b>natural</b> <b>fat</b> from the skin resulting in non-allergic contact dermatitis and absorption through the skin. Prolonged and repeated skin contact may cause irritation and possibly dermatitis. Prolonged, repeated, or high exposures may cause weakness and depression of the central nervous system." [...] Some of these ailments have been recorded by mermaids who have tails containing tin-cure materials, although this evidence is anecdotal. Tin-cure tails also degrade with prolonged exposure to water; the silicone becomes soft and white while peeling away from the neoprene on which it rests. It is currently advised {{that those who are}} considering making or purchasing tin-cure tails do so with extreme caution and at their own risk. Tin-cure tails have historically not been allowed in aquariums featuring live fish or other sea life, due to the chemicals leaching from the tail into the water and causing potential harm to the aquarium's ecosystem.|$|E

5000|$|Simplesse {{began in}} 1979 as [...] "a {{substance}} that gelled like egg white but crumbled like Styrofoam." [...] At that time, Shoji Yamamoto, {{an associate of}} Norman S. Singer at Canadian beer company John Labatt Ltd. in London, Ontario, brought Singer the whey protein substance. After sensing that it gave the taste texture of cream cheese, another scientist put a sample under a powerful microscope and saw [...] "tiny spheres of protein rolling over each other" [...] about a tenth the size of particles of powdered sugar. It was this particle rolling action that gave a smooth creaminess sensation. Another associate of Singer, scientist Nina Davis, worked for three years with Simplesse (then called microcurd) to adapt it to and incorporate it into many different food products. After Singer's boss observed that the product tasted like cheesecake, Singer filed for and received a United States patent for his efforts with the product. Labatt licensed the product to NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Creve Coeur, Missouri, United States chemical conglomerate Monsanto, in 1984. The product was given the trademark [...] "Simplesse" [...] in January 1988.

50|$|Once {{an ideal}} cooking heat is reached on the disk (usually medium to low heat works best) the first meat to be {{introduced}} is the bacon. This is placed {{at the center of}} the concave disk where the heat is concentrated. The <b>natural</b> <b>fat</b> from the bacon will prevent the meats from sticking. Beer or dark cola is added to create a broth for simmering the meats which also acts as a non stick agent. The bacon is placed away from direct heat onto the side of the disk once its cooked, and the sausage links are introduced to the remaining broth. As each piece of meat is removed from the direct heat, the meat's natural juices and the beer or cola create a broth for the next meat piece {{to be introduced}} to. Once cooked, the sausage is also set aside and the ham is added. The ham is set aside, and the chorizo is added next. The beef as well as the cook's choice of seasoning is finally added to the collective broth. Each meat is cooked for about 10 to 15 minutes. The beef is covered with a lid during the cooking process to contain its natural flavor and juices. The lid is then removed to allow the broth to reduce, and the meats can now be combined with the beef and the collective broth from the different meats. The onions, peppers, and tomatoes are chopped and added to the mix providing the dish with color and the meats with flavor.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} diet enriched with a {{monounsaturated}} fatty acid (olive oil) on serum lipoproteins, biliary cholesterol saturation index, and gallbladder motility compared with a standard low-fat diet was evaluated in 11 young volunteers admitted to a metabolic ward.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Crystal Growth and the definitive published version is available at [URL] image processing algorithm previously used to analyse the crystallisation of a pure fat (tripalmitin) {{has been applied to}} the crystallisation of a multicomponent <b>natural</b> <b>fat</b> (palm oil). In contrast to tripalmitin, which produced circular crystals with a constant growth rate, palm oil produced speckled crystals caused by the inclusion of entrapped liquid, and growth rates gradually decreased with time. This {{can be explained by the}} depletion of crystallisable material in the liquid phase, whereas direct impingement of crystals (the basis of the Avrami equation) was less common. A theoretical analysis combining this depletion with assuming that the growth rate is proportional to the supersaturation of a crystallisable pseudo-component predicted a tanh function variation of radius with time. This was generally able to provide good fits to the growth curves. It was found that growth rate was a relatively mild function of temperature but also varied from crystal to crystal and even between different sides of the same crystal, which may be due to variations in composition within the liquid phase. Nucleation rates were confirmed to vary approximately exponentially with decreasing temperature, resulting in much greater numbers of crystals and a smaller final average crystal size at lower temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Under general anesthesia, fat {{transfer}} is accomplished with {{a type of}} liposuction where fat is harvested from the patient’s own <b>natural</b> <b>fat</b> deposits, such as the thigh, but-tock, or abdomen. The harvested fat is centrifuged to purify the fat. Using special syringes, the fat is injected meticu-lously into the fatty tissue of the breast through a cannula. The plastic surgeon may use a number of cannulas at dif-ferent vantage points to evenly distribute the fat for a more natural look. It must be injected very slowly to decrease the amount of damage to the donor fat. 1, 2 Normal Breast Tissue Breast sonography is a very useful tool that supplies information about the mass or lesion found on a mam-mogram. The breast tissue is imaged differently in each modality. The layers of tissue can be distinguished by comparing the shades of gray. Mammographically, breast tissue is described as either radiolucent or radiopaque. Fatty tissue in the breast is a medium gray and more radiolucent. The parenchyma is a brighter white or radiopaque. Whether a mass is cystic or solid, it {{will appear on the}} mammogram as radiopaque and usually blends in with the parenchyma (Figure 1). Sonographically, breast tissue is described as hypoechoic or hyperechoic when compared to the gray scale. Fatty subcutaneous tissue should be medium gray. Tissue toward the darker end of the scale from the medium gray tissue is hypoechoic. Hyperechoic tissue is brighter when com-pared to the fatty tissue (Figure 2). ...|$|E
40|$|Background:. The {{latissimus dorsi}} (LD) flap remains {{a good option}} for {{immediate}} or delayed breast reconstruction. The main limitation of this flap is the small volume provided. To improve the reconstructed breast volume, the LD flap is usually combined with a breast implant. Recently, fat grafting to the LD flap was described to maximize flap volume and obtain a totally autologous breast reconstruction. We report our experience with hybrid breast reconstruction using both breast implants and fat-enriched latissimus dorsi (FELD) flaps. Methods:. Between 2013 and 2016, 74 patients underwent breast reconstruction with FELD flaps only or FELD flaps combined with a breast implant. The LD flap was harvested as previously described. Donor sites for fat harvesting were chosen according to each patient’s <b>natural</b> <b>fat</b> distribution. Fat was harvested, centrifuged, and injected into the LD flap. After fat grafting, breast sizers were employed to determine the final breast volume when the addition of an implant was indicated. Results:. Good cosmetic outcomes were achieved in all cases, with a mean follow-up of 2. 1 years. No patients had cancer reoccurrences. Four patients experienced a seroma of the LD donor site, 1 had a breast hematoma, and 1 developed Baker grade III capsular contracture. One year postoperatively, a clinically relevant area of fat necrosis was observed in 1 patient and was surgically treated. Additional fat grafting sessions were required in 3 cases. Conclusion:. In elected cases, a FELD flap alone or in combination with a small implant is a valuable technique for breast reconstruction surgery...|$|E
50|$|In organic chemistry, the Ziegler process (also {{called the}} Ziegler-Alfol synthesis) {{is a method}} for {{producing}} fatty alcohols from ethylene using a organoaluminium catalyst.
