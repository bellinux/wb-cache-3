Depending on the quench rate, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), 0. 2 % proof stress (PS), percentage of elongation and Charpy U <b>notch</b> <b>impact</b> <b>energy</b> values of the steel in the as cast condition after heat treatment varied at ranges of 1550 - 1560 MPa, 1500 - 1520 MPa, 8 - 12. 5 % and 370 - 790 kJ m 22 respectively. The microstructure of the 0. 3 C-CrMoV steel is reported to consist of martensite and bainite. In the present investigation, the UTS and 0. 2 % PS have been further increasd to 1740 - 1760 and 1570 1610 MPa respectively by increasing the chromium content of the 0. 3 C-CrMoV steel to 4 % and by subjecting the steel to ESR with inoculation by titanium.

40|$|The fibre flow in steels plays, beside other factors, an {{essential}} role {{for the evaluation of}} the performance of forged parts. Due {{to the fact that the}} fibre flow in literature is merely rudimental defined; one part of this work attends to clarify the origin of the fibre flow. Experimental technologies exhibit that stretched MnS, which rise from the hot rolling process of steels are mainly responsible for this structure. Additionally the conditions for the development of the fibre flow in steel are also shown. By means of scanning electron microscopy the morphologies and orientations of MnS are analysed in continuous casted and hot rolled steel. Moreover the changing of the shape of MnS and other types of inclusions caused by a forging operation e. g. cylindrical upsetting in rolling direction and vertically oriented is observed in 4 different kinds of steels. Hot upsetting at 1250 ° C and vertically oriented to the rolling direction enables by way of the index of relative plasticity the construction of a flow curve of MnS, which is necessary for a FEM forging simulation. Additionally, the changing of the MnS morphology in dependence from the temperature is observed. Stretched MnS in hot rolled steel are influencing some characteristic mechanical properties, leading to longitudinal and transversal anisotropy of e. g. the <b>notch</b> <b>impact</b> <b>energy</b> in dependency from sulphur level and rolling degree. The analysis of the fracture surface of notched specimen shows the influence of the MnS morphology and orientation on the <b>notch</b> <b>impact</b> <b>energy.</b> Because of the changed shape of MnS, caused by hot upsetting in rolling direction, an initially present anisotropy develops to a more isotropic behaviour particularly in the core region of the upset samples. The changed morphology of MnS caused by an upsetting at room temperature does not influence significantly the changing of the anisotropy. A FEM forging simulation of the cylindrical upsetting in rolling direction of MnS in steel shows a partial accordance of the changing of the MnS morphology between the observation and simulated results. Considerations about the stress ratio around MnS at adequate loadings of parts show the detrimental impact of the MnS morphology and orientation on the mechanical properties of steels. Examples of use illustrate the influence of flattened and accordingly to the part loading oriented MnS...|$|E

40|$|Commercial wood flour, {{the most}} common wood-derived filler for thermoplastics, is {{produced}} {{in a mixture of}} particle sizes and generally has a lower aspect ratio than wood and other natural fibers. To understand how wood flour and fiber characteristics influence the mechanical properties of polypro-pylene composites, we first investigated the effect of different sizes of wood flour particles on the mechanical properties of wood-flour-filled polypropylene composites. We then compared the properties of wood-flour-filled composites to those of composites reinforced with refined wood fiber. We also studied the effect of a maleated polypropylene coupling agent on composite properties. Wood flour particles (35, 70, 120, and 235 mesh) were compounded at 40 % by weight with polypropylene. Increases in tensile and flexural strength and modulus of the wood flour composites were found to correspond with increases in aspect ratio. <b>Notched</b> <b>impact</b> <b>energy</b> increased with increasing particle size, whereas unnotched <b>impact</b> <b>energy</b> decreased with increasing particle size. Refined wood fiber and 40 -mesh wood flour was compounded at 20 % and 40 % by weight with polypropylene.

On increasing phosphorus content from 0. 25 wt. % to 0. 42 wt. %, the morphology of grain changed from equiaxed shape to pan-cake shape and grain size also increased.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{residual}} lignin content on the mechanical strength and water absorption of kraft pulp/ polypropylene composites was studied. To meet this objective, hornbeam wood chips {{were converted to}} kraft pulp at three different alkalinities (15, 20, and 25 %) and three different cooking times (60, 90, and 120 min). The residual lignin contents of these pulps were determined according to the TAPPI standard. Kraft pulp was mixed with polypropylene (PP) at 50 % weight ratios. The amount of maleic anhydride (MAPP) coupling agent was fixed at 4 per hundred compounds (phc) for all formulations. The {{results indicated that the}} lignin residual content decreased with increasing cooking time and alkalinity in kraft pulp. Also, it was found that tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, and flexural modulus were increased by increasing the alkalinity and cooking time; however, the <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> strength and water absorption decreased. Overall, decreasing the lignin content had a positive impact on the flexural and tensile properties and had a negative effect on the <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> strength...|$|R
