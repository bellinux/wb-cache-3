25|$|During {{the night}} before Morgestraich 2006, about 50cm of snow fell within {{only a couple of}} hours and blocked the inner city of Basel. It took great effort to free the city from the snow and enable the Fasnacht to take place. <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> a Fasnacht been celebrated with more snow, and {{especially}} not fresh-fallen snow. This 50cm of snow was the third-highest snow level ever recorded in Basel and the highest level of fresh-fallen snow within 24 hours for the city.|$|E
25|$|While the SPD {{was founded}} in the 19th century to defend the {{interests}} of the working class, its commitment to these goals has been disputed by some since 1918, when its leaders supported the suppression of more radical socialist and communist factions during the Spartacist Uprising. But <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> the party moved so far away from its traditional socialist stance as it did under the Schröder government. Its ever-increasing tendency towards liberal economic policies and cutbacks in government spending on social welfare programs led to a dramatic decline in voter support. The Schroeder Administration presided over a significant rise in poverty and inequality, with the percentage of Germans living in poverty, according to one measure, rising from 12% in 2000 to 16.5% in 2006.|$|E
25|$|On November 17, 1975, {{the police}} began to set forth action {{in order to}} bring down the {{powerful}} Dubois Brothers; they established police task forces and began pressuring the Brothers. After some time the pressure began to deteriorate the Dubois Brothers organization through undercover operations and some of the organizations most notorious and loyal associates began to slip away, become informants or had met violent deaths. The papers and police began stating that <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> the criminal underworld’s law of silence been broken by so many criminals, especially those who were so loyal to the organizations core. Among these numerous informants was Donald Lavoie {{who was one of the}} Dubois Brothers most trusted hitman whose previous occupation had been to eliminate anyone suspected of snitching as well as anyone who they told him to eliminate. It was Donald Lavoie who played the biggest part in the fall of the Dubois Brothers power, when Claude Dubois who had put a bounty on Lavoie’s head, which he just nearly escaped, forcing Lavoie to testify for protection.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and you really {{feel like you have}} a voice that resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E

To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;...

500|$|Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the series [...] "created a whole new sort of {{television}} show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise." [...] She stated that the Captain America: The Winter Soldier crossover [...] "infused S.H.I.E.L.D. with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show {{took so long to}} find its footing—in the writers' room at least ... That Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous." [...] She concluded that the series [...] "is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers were {{impressed}} with the way Lessing tackled the subject of sexual politics in the book. Paul Gray remarked in a review in Time magazine, that contrary to appearances, The Marriages is not a feminist parable, but added that while Lessing often wrote about gender conflict, she has never done it [...] "with more sweetness, compassion and wisdom" [...] as she has in this novel. Leonard commended Lessing for considering boths sides of the gender divide, for being both critical and forgiving of Ben Ata and Al•Ith. Leonard said that <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> Lessing written [...] "a gentler book", adding that her 1973 novel, Summer Before the Dark comes a close second. A reviewer in Kirkus Reviews also complemented Lessing on her handling of sexual conflict. While the review was critical of Lessing's prose style, and called her descriptions of the Zone Four war economy [...] "a silly cartoon sketch", it said that [...] "there is a... generosity about this work not quite like anything she has done".|$|E

2500|$|The new-found {{popularity}} of Internet chat rooms has contributed largely to infidelity. [...] <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> it been {{so easy to}} engage in the dating scene and meet people while maintaining the stability of marriage. Chat rooms provide a dilemma because some view them as a forum for fantasies and illusions that are simply just communication rather than physical acts. [...] In a sense, they are a place where married individuals can engage in guilt-free excitement. [...] However, everyone feels differently, leading to extreme gray areas. What might start off as meaningless entertainment obtained by communicating with a stranger in a chat room could eventually lead to the establishment of an actual online or cyber relationship. [...] This type of relationship typically contains the same elements that are found in a traditional relationship such as attraction, flirtation, and support.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, Black said, the majority's {{decision}} {{does not}} prevent the government from [...] "barring Communists and their suspected sympathizers from election to political office, mere membership in unions, and, in fact, from getting or holding any jobs whereby they could earn a living." [...] He also found offensive the majority's belief that the Supreme Court exists to protect individual liberty. That claim [...] "springs from the assumption that individual mental freedom can be constitutionally abridged whenever any majority of this Court finds a satisfactory legislative reason. <b>Never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> this Court held that the Government could for any reason attaint persons for their political beliefs or affiliations. It does so today." [...] That Congress had concluded from testimony that the Communist Party {{was a threat to}} national security was irrelevant, he said, for Democrats could testify the same thing about Republicans and thus ban Republicans from union office just as effectively. Such reasoning was offensive to the idea of constitutionally protected liberties, Black said: ...|$|E

[...] The Alumnus also praised the effort of quarterback William Wasmund: [...] "For the first time in his three years of playing on the Michigan team Wasmund ran the team in a manner worthy a Michigan quarterback.

2500|$|... "Christianity – {{and that}} is its {{greatest}} merit – has somewhat mitigated that brutal Germanic love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then the ancient stony gods will rise from the forgotten debris and rub the dust of a thousand years from their eyes, and finally Thor with his giant hammer will jump up and smash the Gothic cathedrals. (...)"Do not smile at my advice – {{the advice of a}} dreamer who warns you against Kantians, Fichteans, and philosophers of nature. Do not smile at the visionary who anticipates the same revolution {{in the realm of the}} visible as has taken place in the spiritual. Thought precedes action as lightning precedes thunder. German thunder is of true Germanic character; it is not very nimble, but rumbles along ponderously. Yet, it will come and when you hear a crashing such as <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> been heard in the world's history, then you know that the German thunderbolt has fallen at last. At that uproar the eagles of the air will drop dead, and lions in the remotest deserts of Africa will hide in their royal dens.

2500|$|The series finale {{received}} generally {{positive reactions}} from critics. Susie Boniface of the Daily Mirror called the finale [...] "worth tuning in," [...] stating the series [...] "played a blinder with their swan song." [...] She said that [...] "there's everything you'd expect - terrorist threats, Harry being quietly furious, Ruth being loyal and a Home Secretary who makes you shout at the telly as Britain {{comes close to}} annihilation again," [...] though [...] "sadly it's also got the things I've come to hate in Spooks," [...] citing the [...] "duller-than-a-day-old-sandwich" [...] Dimitri, and [...] "ridiculous lady spook Erin Watts in her four-inch heels." [...] Despite this, Firth's acting was praised, and she stated that the finale was [...] "brilliant because {{it goes back to}} what it was always best at... looking at {{the lives of the people}} who became spooks." [...] Jonathan Angwin of CultBox rated the finale five stars out of five, calling it a [...] "spectacular tour de force of an episode, <b>never</b> <b>before</b> <b>has</b> the ending of a British television programme been so perfectly executed." [...] Angwin however noted that Elena's false confession was a [...] "terrible move" [...] and did not get the point of Sasha's role despite the actor's strong performance, as he was [...] "impossible to sympathise with" [...] and was [...] "a little irritating." [...] Despite this the reviewer believed that the terror plot, Elena's interrogation, and the realisation Harry and Ruth would not have a happy ending proved [...] "the final hour of Spooks is easily one of its finest." ...|$|E
