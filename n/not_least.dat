5|$|A {{full-time}} etiquette {{coach was}} hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912. Despite this, several critics picked up on anachronisms in the film, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> involving the two main stars.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{served as}} an {{important}} minister of state to several English kings. He {{was the most popular}} saint in England for nearly two centuries, having gained fame for the many stories of his greatness, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> among which were those concerning his famed cunning in defeating the devil.|$|E
5|$|However most, if not all, {{characteristics}} of the current centralized state of the Kingdom of the Netherlands were foreshadowed by {{the accomplishments of the}} Batavian Republic, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> the liberal 1848 Constitution. That constitution restored the central tenets of the democratic Staatsregeling of 1798, under the guise of a Constitutional monarchy, as its author Johan Rudolf Thorbecke acknowledged.|$|E

50|$|Integer {{addition}} and subtraction are computable in AC0, but multiplication is <b>not</b> (at <b>least,</b> <b>not</b> {{under the}} usual binary or base-10 representations of integers).|$|R
6000|$|... "Waverley" [...] ends like a fairy-tale, while {{real life}} ever ends like a Northern saga. But among {{the good things}} that make life bearable, such fairy-tales are <b>not</b> the <b>least</b> precious, and <b>not</b> the <b>least</b> enduring.|$|R
5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was in awe of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, <b>not</b> <b>least,</b> as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{unless a}} new bishop {{has a family}} coat of arms, he {{typically}} adopts within his shield symbols that indicate his interests or past service. Devotion to a particular saint is represented by symbols established in iconography and heraldic tradition. In the Church of England, new bishops typically choose a coat that looks entirely non-clerical, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> because their descendants may seek reassignment of the arms, and few of them {{are likely to be}} clerics.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{mercury is}} a part of popular {{secondary}} reference electrode (called the calomel electrode) in electrochemistry {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode. The calomel electrode is used to work out the electrode potential of half cells. Last, but <b>not</b> <b>least,</b> the triple point of mercury, −38.8344°C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale (ITS-90).|$|E
6000|$|... "You are right. She must <b>not</b> know--at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> now. It will be {{the first}} time in my life I have had a secret from my mother; but she must not know till--till we return." ...|$|R

We have been walking for two days, and have not found a soul who could speak English until now, {{so that we have}} <b>not</b> the <b>least</b> idea where we are." ...|$|R
5|$|Liver {{function}} {{tests can}} show {{a combination of}} results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Woodfull {{was being}} {{encouraged}} to retaliate to the short-pitched English attack, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> {{by members of}} his own side such as Vic Richardson, or to include pace bowlers such as Eddie Gilbert or Laurie Nash to match the aggression of the opposition. But Woodfull refused to consider doing so. He had to wait until minutes before the game before he was confirmed as captain by the selectors.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} widely used in non-industrialized societies, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> because they are far cheaper than modern medicines. The annual global export value of {{pharmaceutical}} plants in 2012 was over US$2.2 billion. In many countries there is little regulation of traditional medicine, but the World Health Organization is coordinating a network to encourage safe and rational usage. Medicinal plants face both general threats such as climate change and habitat loss, and the specific threat of over-collection to meet market demand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maggie, faintly. [...] "There is Tom's feeling. He said I {{must give}} him up if I married Philip. And I know he will <b>not</b> change--at <b>least</b> <b>not</b> {{for a long}} while--unless {{something}} happened to soften him." ...|$|R

5|$|On Bates's {{return to}} England, he was {{encouraged}} by Charles Darwin to write up his eleven-year stay in the Amazon as a book. The result was widely admired, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> by Darwin; other reviewers sometimes disagreed with the book's support for evolution, but generally enjoyed {{his account of the}} journey, scenery, people, and natural history. The book has been reprinted many times, mostly in Bates's own effective abridgement for the second edition, which omitted the more technical descriptions.|$|E
5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified. This may be publicized to improve a firm’s image. Furthermore, {{the fact that a}} company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised. Third, sponsoring the natural environment is also very important. And last but <b>not</b> <b>least,</b> ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} war saw the end {{for many}} of the older vessels, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> the two {{remaining}} Invincible-class ships. Inflexible was paid off to the Reserve Fleet in January 1919 before being decommissioned on 31 March 1920. Chile briefly considered purchasing the ship in 1920, however the sale did not materialise. She was sold for scrap on 1 December 1921, and scrapped in Germany the following year. Mount Inflexible in the Canadian Rockies was named after the battlecruiser in 1917.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} war saw the end {{for many}} of the older vessels, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> the two {{remaining}} Invincibles. Both were sent to the Reserve Fleet in 1919, and were paid off in March 1920, before being sold for scrap on 1 December 1921.|$|E
5|$|The parapet {{has three}} {{horizontal}} rows of inscriptions; {{on the upper}} and lower rows is smaller lettering that is often not visible in reproductions. In places, the Greek characters are unclear and have been subject to much speculation by art historians, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> due to vanEyck's sometimes erratic spelling and unusual spacing.|$|E
5|$|The {{performers}} {{were allowed}} to improvise provided that they maintained factual accuracy. Howick said that improvisation was actually often necessary due to the rapid-fire pace of filming, which left very little {{time to prepare for}} individual roles. On the other hand, both Rickard and Baynton suggest this enforced spontaneity may have ultimately worked to enhance the comedy, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> by preventing the jokes from becoming over-rehearsed.|$|E
6000|$|... [77] Compare Lay of the Last Minstrel, canto i. stanza 15, and [...] canto v. stanza 2.

[Ruskin.] ...|$|R

5|$|The {{resultant}} public mockery created panic {{within the}} medical profession and ruined the careers of several prominent surgeons. The affair was satirised on many occasions, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> by the pictorial satirist and social critic William Hogarth, who was notably critical of {{the medical profession}}'s gullibility. Toft was eventually released without charge and returned home.|$|E
5|$|The three vinyl LPs and booklet were housed {{inside a}} deep orange-coloured box. The 1991 CD release placed the cover photo {{on a white}} background, however, replicating {{the front of the}} {{original}} album booklet. As commentators noted in 1991, the necessary downsizing to CD dimensions meant that much of the effectiveness of the booklet photography was lost, <b>not</b> <b>least</b> because the contents had also been trimmed down to just 36 pages.|$|E
5|$|Vauxhall Gardens is peculiarly {{adapted to}} {{the taste of the}} English nation; there being a mixture of curious show, — gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; — for all of which only a {{shilling}} is paid; and, though last, <b>not</b> <b>least,</b> good eating and drinking for those who choose to purchase that regale.|$|E
