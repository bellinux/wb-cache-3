5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that sperm whales sleep in {{vertical}} postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales do <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to passing vessels unless they are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E
5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people do <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to the SSRI, {{even though this is}} not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
5|$|Between 20% and 50% of high-risk cases do <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> {{adequately}} to induction high-dose {{chemotherapy and}} are progressive or refractory. Relapse {{after completion of}} frontline therapy is also common. Further treatment is available in phase I and phase II clinical trials that test new agents and combinations of agents against neuroblastoma, but the outcome remains very poor for relapsed high-risk disease.|$|E

5|$|Heterozygous FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, bile acid sequestrants, or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often does <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option for those who do <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane did <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to}} the left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did <b>not</b> <b>respond.</b> Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> {{by further}} building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already {{a heavy burden}} for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E

Operant-based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in those who do <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to medications. Psychological methods should not, however, be used to replace medications. Some dogs, {{commonly referred to as}} seizure dogs, may help during or after a seizure. It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E

The consequences of severe attacks that do <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
