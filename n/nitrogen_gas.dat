40|$|Current {{theoretical}} models of solar nebula chemistry which {{take into account}} the interplay between chemistry and dynamics are presented for the abundant reactive volatile elements including hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Results of these models indicate that, in the solar nebula, the dominant carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gases</b> were CO and NO, whereas, in giant planet subnebulae, the dominant carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gases</b> were CH 4 and NH 3; in the solar nebula, the Fe metal grains catalyzed the formation of organic compounds from CO and H 2 via the Fischer-Tropsch-type reaction. It was also found that, in solar nebula, bulk FeS formation was kinetically favorable, while FeO incorporation into silicates and bulk Fe 3 O 4 formation were kinetically inhibited. Furthermore, clathrate formation was kinetically inhibited in the solar nebula, while it was kinetically favorable in giant planet subnebulae...|$|R

5|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen is {{commonly}} used during sample preparation in chemical analysis. It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples. Directing a pressurised stream of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute(s) and un-evaporated solvent behind.|$|E

5|$|In 1917 Rutherford bombarded <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> with alpha {{particles}} and observed hydrogen nuclei being emitted {{from the gas}} (Rutherford recognized these, because he had previously obtained them bombarding hydrogen with alpha particles, and observing hydrogen nuclei in the products). Rutherford concluded that the hydrogen nuclei emerged from the nuclei of the nitrogen atoms themselves (in effect, he had split a nitrogen).|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E

5|$|The Voyager 2 probe {{observed}} in 1989 {{a handful of}} geyser-like eruptions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> and entrained dust from {{beneath the surface of}} Triton in plumes up to 8km high. Triton is thus, along with Earth, Io, and Enceladus, one of the few bodies in the Solar System on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed. The best-observed examples are named Hili and Mahilani (after a Zulu water sprite and a Tongan sea spirit, respectively).|$|E
5|$|Triton {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} be geologically active (the others being Jupiter's Io and Saturn's Enceladus). As a consequence, its surface is {{relatively}} young with few obvious impact craters, and a complex geological history revealed in intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains. Part of its surface has geysers erupting sublimated <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas,</b> contributing to a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere less than 1/70,000 the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level.|$|E
5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
40|$|The pore {{formation}} in CYTOP polymer under high pressure of argon or <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gases</b> was investigated by positron annihilation spectroscopy.

The structure of CYTOP can be restored by applying the temperature over 470 K at normal pressure. DOI: 10. 12693 /APhysPolA. 125. 782 PACS: 78. 70. Bj, 74. 62. F...|$|R

Oxygen is produced by plants and some bacteria in photosynthesis, while CO2 is a waste product of all animals and plants. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>gases</b> are produced by denitrifying bacteria and as a waste product, and bacteria for decaying yield ammonia, as do most invertebrates and vertebrates.

60|$|He then {{prepared}} some pure {{oxygen and}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gases,</b> and passed them {{by means of}} a tube going from the outside of the vessel, up through the mercury into the infusion; so that he thus had it exposed to a perfectly pure atmosphere of the same constituents as the external air. Of course, he expected he would get no infusorial animalcules at all in that infusion; but, to his great dismay and discomfiture, he found he almost always did get them.|$|R
5|$|Experiments {{are usually}} {{conducted}} using only small quantities {{of a few}} grams in a fume hood. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol. The alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere. The inert atmosphere used may be argon or <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas,</b> except for lithium, which reacts with nitrogen. Rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air, even under oil, because even {{a small amount of}} air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide; for the same reason, potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen-containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months.|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is very weak and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that adheres to the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E

25|$|Another way to {{increase}} the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. ammonia gas) from the system. In practice, gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself, since the temperature is too high; it {{is removed from the}} equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the reaction vessel. The hot gases are cooled enough, whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid. Unreacted hydrogen and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gases</b> are then returned to the reaction vessel to undergo further reaction.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} growth of highly carbon doped GaAsSb on InP {{substrate}} with LP-MOVPE and <b>nitrogen</b> carrier <b>gas.</b> Carbon doped GaAsSb lattice matched on InP are of pronounced interest for high speed double heterostructure bipolar transistors (DHBTs). We observed a significant effect of the <b>nitrogen</b> carrier <b>gas</b> on the growth behaviour which results in lower distribution coefficients. A linear doping behaviour with small CBr 4 flows up to p= 4 x 10 19 cm- 3 can be observed and first realized DHBT structures shown fT and fmax values of 100 GHz and 60 GHz, respectively...|$|R
5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>gas</b> purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
