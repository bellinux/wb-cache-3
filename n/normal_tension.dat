5000|$|Medical {{treatment}} is necessary when <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma is present. In these cases, {{in addition to}} the ophthalmologic treatment of glaucoma, the patient's usually low blood pressure should be addressed. With dietary measures such as salt intake and sometimes with low-dose steroids a drop in blood pressure - especially during sleep - can often be prevented. These nightly [...] "dips" [...] of blood pressure in <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma patients with Flammer syndrome can damage the sensory cells of the retina significantly.|$|E
5000|$|In many patients, <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> {{glaucoma}} {{is common}} in individuals with a generalized reduced perfusion of organs and certain body tissues.

50|$|To have Flammer {{syndrome}} {{does not}} necessarily mean that this individual is sick. On the contrary: most of those affected are and remain healthy. Certain diseases such as arteriosclerosis and its consequences are probably even rarer. Best known is the higher risk of <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma, a disease with an impaired regulation of blood flow in a large number of patients. If glaucomatous damage occurs despite normal eye pressure or if glaucomatous damage is progressive despite normalized intraocular pressure, frequently a Flammer syndrome is the cause. In these eyes, an elevated pressure in the retinal veins has been observed. Glaucoma patients with Flammer syndrome show some specific clinical signs like an increased frequency of the following: optic disc haemorrhages, activated retinal astrocytes, elevated retinal venous pressure, optic nerve compartmentalization and fluctuating diffuse visual field defects. The association of <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma with the syndrome has recently been confirmed by a group of Chinese researchers. In a 2016 review on the risk factors for <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma by ophthalmologists from Asia (where this form of glaucoma is much more prevalent than in Europe or North America), Flammer syndrome has been attributed to increase the likelihood of ganglion cell damage in these patients with disc hemorrhages as a characteristic clinical sign. Migraine attacks, a common feature of Flammer syndrome, have been described as a risk factor for glaucoma progression, in open-angle glaucoma as well as in <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma. Flammer syndrome may also predispose to other eye diseases such as vascular occlusion (especially retinal vein occlusion) in relatively young people or central serous retinopathy. Muscle spasms and tension are common among individuals with Flammer syndrome. Tinnitus and sometimes even acute hearing loss can occur. There is currently insufficient data available on cases where Flammer syndrome is suspected like in the sudden, unexpected deaths of young athletes. People suffering from retinitis pigmentosa seem to have Flammer syndrome quite frequently, possible associations with the vascular factor endothelin-1 are under investigation.|$|E
5000|$|Scientific {{studies have}} shown that in many {{patients}} with glaucoma the cause of the disease are perfusion issues of the optic nerve and retina while intraocular pressure is normal. Many patients with <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma have a basic constitution, which corresponds to the Flammer syndrome. Some of its features were formerly summarized under the term [...] "primary vascular dysregulation syndrome".|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a contact problem is {{considered}} for a piecewise homogeneous infinite elastic plate consisted of two semi-infinite plates with different elastic characteristics and strengthened with two infinite elastic stringers, having different elastic properties. The stringers are parallel to the straight line between the two semi-infinite plates (the contact pair) and have different distances from the straight line, {{as well as they}} are on different sides of the straight line. The contact pair is deformed by two forces applied to the stringers having the same direction. The problem is formulated as a system of singular integral equations with a kerrnel consisted of singular and regular parts. The solution of the above-mentioned system is based on the generalized Fourier integral transformation, which is reduced to a system of functional equations, which makes possible to construct a closed solution in an integral form. The behavior of contact tangent tensions, as well as of stringer <b>normal</b> <b>tensions</b> at the infinite point and at the points of the forces applications are investigated, by means of the asymptotic formulae obtained in the present work...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{monitoring}} operations, divided into several measurement sessions, were planned {{and carried out}} to assess the state of degradation and to quantify the instability and structural failures: - Analysis of the cracks and mapping of the degradation; - Crack measurements; - Failures in the crown sections; - Failures {{at the base of}} the piers; - Thrust measurements of the tie; - Measurement of water table variation. The observation period lasted three years, up to June 2011. The structural analysis was based on the discrete element algebraic model proposed by Heyman, translated into code developed in a Visual Basic environment in Windows XP. The assessment was conducted only for one of the arches, dividing it into 8 discrete elements (9 sections) of 1. 80 m width. The first calculation was based on the null hypothesis of impost failures. In this case, the arch was stable in terms of geometry and load conditions; the <b>normal</b> <b>tensions</b> on the extrados and intrados were all of compression, except that on the crown intrados, where the formation of a hinge occurred. Subsequently, the value of the failure measured in the basal section of the pier during the measurement sessions was applied...|$|R
5000|$|While tonometry, the {{measuring}} of IOP {{and thus a}} classical instrument in the diagnosis of glaucoma, is not helpful, ophthalmoscopy leads to the diagnosis by showing typical glaucomatous damage, primarily at the optic nerve head, {{in the absence of}} elevated IOP. While the excavation of the optic nerve head and the thinning of its rim appear in all kinds of glaucoma (with high tension and with normal tension,in Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and in secondary glaucoma), small hemorrhages close to the optic disc have been identified as a characteristic clinical sign of <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma. Visual field is very important to detect NTG. It shows a defect that typically appear deeper, steeper and closer to fixation comparing to patients with POAG.Since NTG is closely linked to vascular irregularities, a medical check-up by a general practitioner or a specialist in internal medicine is widely recommended in cases of newly diagnosed <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma. An examination that is considered to be of particular importance is a 24-hour monitoring of the blood pressure. NTG patients tend to suffer [...] "dips", sudden and unnoticed drops in blood pressure during sleep.|$|E

In Ontario, optometrists are able to prescribe drugs to treat <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma (a type of primary glaucoma), transient intraocular pressure elevations, an acute glaucoma crisis, and dacryocystitis.

40|$|The {{measurement}} principle behind Surface Stress Sensitive Films (S 3 F) {{is based on}} the transformation of the measured deformation of an elastic media into surface loads (pressure and shear stresses). According to Gook’s Law, the 3 D deformation of the surface of an elastic film {{is a function of the}} applied tangential and <b>normal</b> <b>tensions.</b> Such displacements can be measured using several different 3 D displacement techniques. The results presented in the paper demonstrate that a stable S 3 F can be created having a shift modulus between 30 - 50 Pa. Such highly sensitive elastic films provide the possibility of conducting surface stress field visualization with a resolution up to 0. 1 Pa. S 3 F’s are chemically inert and have small dielectric and optical losses. These features permit their use in liquid and various gaseous environments. Their properties are linear over a wide range of deformation (up to 10 %- 15 % of the film thickness) and can be adjusted by changing the chemical composition. This paper describes the measurement methodology and data-reduction algorithms currently used with the S 3 F technique. Experimental results obtained with an S 3 F optimized for low speed measurements, i. e., 5 - 50 m/s (air flow) and 0. 1 - 0. 5 m/s (wate...|$|R
25|$|The loss of {{red blood}} cell {{elasticity}} {{is central to the}} pathophysiology of sickle-cell disease. Normal {{red blood cell}}s are quite elastic, which allows the cells to deform to pass through capillaries. In sickle-cell disease, low oxygen tension promotes red blood cell sickling and repeated episodes of sickling damage the cell membrane and decrease the cell's elasticity. These cells fail to return to normal shape when <b>normal</b> oxygen <b>tension</b> is restored. As a consequence, these rigid blood cells are unable to deform as they pass through narrow capillaries, leading to vessel occlusion and ischaemia.|$|R
50|$|Tuning the violin, {{especially}} with the pegs, can cause the bridge to lean, usually toward the fingerboard. If left that way, it will warp. After tuning, experienced players typically check that the bridge is standing straight and centered between the inner nicks of the f holes, since bridges are free to move about, being held in place only by friction and the tension of the strings. Capable violinists know how to straighten and center a bridge; this can easily be done under <b>normal</b> string <b>tension</b> without damage to the instrument.|$|R
5000|$|Over many years, {{glaucoma}} {{has been}} defined by an intraocular pressure of more than 20 or 20 mm Hg. Incompatible with this (now obsolete) definition of glaucoma was the ever larger number of cases that {{have been reported in}} medical literature in the 1980s and 1990s who had the typical signs of glaucomatous damage, like optic nerve head excavation and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, while these patients had an IOP that would generally have been regarded as [...] "normal". It is now widely estimated that a larger percentage of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are suffering from <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma: probably half of all POAG patients in Europe and the majority of POAG patients in East Asia. Among Americans of Japanese descent, for instance, the prevalence of NTG is about four times as high as the prevalence of the [...] "classical glaucoma" [...] with an IOP of 22 mm Hg and higher. The pillar of the current understanding of <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma is a reduced IOP tolerance of the retinal ganglion cells and the cells in the optic nerve head - an IOP of, for example, 17 or 19 mm Hg that would not affect a healthy eye leads to damage in the eye of an NTG patient.|$|E
50|$|Although not as sceptical or rigorously investigative as Brunel, Stephenson {{had a deep}} {{understanding}} of the different strengths of wrought- and cast-iron. Both girders are formed of wrought iron tubes, 6 cm in diameter. The unusual feature of this bridge is that because the deck is above the truss, the vertical members are placed in compression, rather than the more <b>normal</b> <b>tension.</b> This allowed Stephenson to use cast iron for the vertical members, rather than the more expensive wrought iron needed for bridges in tension. The truss achieves an efficient symmetry of the load distribution between the two members, giving an economical and balanced appearance that is in great contrast to Brunel's heavily unbalanced designs that (for Chepstow at least) are barely recognisable as lenticular.|$|E
5000|$|Acoustic {{baritone}} guitars {{typically have}} larger bodies than standard guitars, and—like electric baritones—have longer scale lengths so the strings can be tuned lower while remaining at <b>normal</b> <b>tension.</b> On a standard, steel-string, acoustic guitar, the scale length (the {{distance from the}} nut or string guide to the saddle on the bridge) is typically 24.9" [...] to 25.7", and the strings range in diameter from [...]012" [...] to [...]054". The scale lengths of various baritone designs range from 27" [...] to 30.5", and the string gauges range from the normal [...]012 - [...]054" [...] set to sets as thick as [...]017 - [...]095". Shorter-scale baritone guitars are more like long-scale guitars, having more midrange volume, whereas the longer scale lengths and heavier string sets give more bass to the instrument's timbre. Shorter scale baritones tend to be tuned C-C or B-B, whereas longer ones are typically tuned A-A.|$|E

40|$|We aim at {{testing the}} {{possibility}} to build patientspecific structural finite element models (FEMs) of the mitral valve (MV) from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and {{to use them to}} predict the outcome of mitral annuloplasty procedures. MV FEMs were built for one healthy subject and for one patient with ischemic mitral regurgitation. On both subjects, CMR imaging of 18 longaxis planes was performed with a temporal resolution of 55 time-frames per cardiac cycle. Three-dimensional MV annulus geometry, leaflets surface and PM position were manually obtained using custom software. Hyperelastic anisotropic mechanical properties were assigned to MV tissues. A physiological pressure load was applied to the leaflets to simulate valve closure until peak systole. For the pathological model only, a further simulation was run, simulating undersized rigid annuloplasty before valve closure. Closure dynamics, leaflets stresses and tensions in the subvalvular apparatus in the healthy MV were consistent with previous computational and experimental data. The regurgitant valve model captured with good approximation the real size and position of regurgitant areas at peak systole, and highlighted abnormal tensions in the annular region and sub-valvular apparatus. The simulation of undersized rigid annuloplasty showed the restoration of MV continence and <b>normal</b> <b>tensions</b> in the subvalvular apparatus and at the annulus. Our method seems suitable for implementing detailed patient-specific MV FEMs to simulate different scenarios of clinical interest. Further work is mandatory to test the method more deeply, to reduce its computational time and to expand the range of modeled surgical procedures...|$|R
5000|$|Nabarro-Herring creep is {{a mode of}} {{deformation}} of crystalline materials that occurs at low stresses and held at elevated temperatures in fine-grained materials. In Nabarro-Herring creep, atoms diffuse through the crystals, and the creep rate varies inversely with {{the square of the}} grain size so fine-grained materials creep faster than coarser-grained ones. [...] This type of creep results from the diffusion of vacancies from regions of high chemical potential at grain boundaries subjected to normal tensile stresses to regions of lower chemical potential where the average tensile stresses across the grain boundaries are zero. Self-diffusion within the grains of a polycrystalline solid can cause the solid to yield to an applied shearing stress, the yielding being caused by a diffusional flow of matter within each crystal grain away from boundaries where there is a normal pressure and toward those where there is a <b>normal</b> <b>tension.</b> Atoms migrating in the opposite direction accounting for the creep strain.

5000|$|In 1989, Novak {{patented}} a {{new type}} of fret arrangement that he called the “fanned fret”. The patent has expired, but Novak holds a trademark over the term [...] "fanned-fret". The fanned frets create a different shape to the guitar and may allow a different performance. The slanted frets lengthen the low strings and shorten the high-pitched strings. This is achieved by placing the bridge at an angle to the nut such that the distance between the nut and bridge {{on the side of the}} fretboard for the low E string is longer than it is on the side of the high E string. There is uniform string tension across the neck of the guitar, easier adaptability to altered tuning, such as DADGAD, dropped C and dropped D, enhanced definition of harmonics, and the elimination of non-harmonic overtones and unwanted noise. The B string, in particular, sounds lighter and more distinct than it does on non-fanned models. On a traditional guitar, the G string sometimes feels like it has a higher tension than the other strings; on fanned-fret guitars, the G string retains <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> and has a somewhat warmer tone.|$|E
50|$|Flammer's {{scientific}} and medical endeavors were generally interdisciplinary. His first research focus was automatic perimetry {{for which he}} established normal values; he studied short term and long term fluctuations of the human visual field and described influencing factors. Together with Hans Bebie he developed the so-called Bebie curve, which {{plays a major role}} in the diagnosis of visual field loss due to glaucoma. Flammer was onr of the first researchers to demonstrate systemic side effects of locally administered beta blockers (i.e. eye drops) in ophthalmology. Flammer and his collaborators found that intraocular pressure variation is as important for the development of glaucoma, one of the main causes of blindness worldwide, as a constantly elevated intraocular pressure, long considered the main, if not the only, cause of glaucoma. In numerous research projects he demonstrated that glaucoma could be caused by a dysregulation of ocular blood flow, even at normal levels of intraocular pressure. Flammer discovered that vasospasms in the eye are a manifestation of a general vasospastic syndrome. Later, he noted that such spasms are only the tip of the iceberg and an indication of a much more generalized vascular dysregulation in the human body. This increases the risk of eye disease, in particular of <b>normal</b> <b>tension</b> glaucoma. Flammer noted that people with a primary vascular dysregulation have other symptoms and signs; this led to the establishment of the term Flammer syndrome. Flammer also demonstrated the relationship between eye disease and heart disease. In numerous laboratory studies, he contributed to the understanding of the role of endothelin and nitric oxide in ocular perfusion.|$|E

Considering the possibility of non vanishing vacuum energy inside the bubble leads, when gravitational effects are considered, to the possibility of a quantum decay of such "elementary particle" into an infinite universe.

40|$|The {{anatomical}} femoral {{insertion of}} the normal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) lies on the deep portion of the lateral wall of the intercondylar fossa. Following the deep bone-cartilage border, it stretches from 11 o'clock high in the notch {{all the way down}} to its lowest border at 8 o'clock. The tension curve {{of the normal}} ACL during passive flexion-extension shows a characteristic pattern with two tension peaks, one in full extension and the other in deep flexion. Low tension in mid-flexion is measured between those two peaks. Standard ACL reconstructions use a femoral insertion at 11 o'clock, which results in non-physiological tension curves with one peak in full extension only. The hypothesis was that it is possible to reproduce the typical tension curve of the normal ACL by placing the femoral tunnel into the low part of the normal ACL footprint. In a controlled laboratory study, three different femoral tunnel positions at 9, 10 and 11 o'clock were tested in four cadaver knees while using the identical standard tibial tunnel each time. The tension curve was measured during passive flexion-extension with a custom-made tension measurement device, using an artificial Dacron graft. The tension curve of grafts in the 9 o'clock tunnels showed the characteristic pattern of the <b>normal</b> ACL's <b>tension</b> curve with tension peaks in extension as well as in deep flexion. The tunnels in the 10 and 11 o'clock positions failed to reproduce the <b>normal</b> ACL's <b>tension</b> curve with high-tension values in extension only.
