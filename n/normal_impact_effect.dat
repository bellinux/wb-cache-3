We characterise the spacecraft impact damage for the normal sporadic {{background and the}} annual meteoroid showers, and, especially consider the quantitative effects which would occur should the 1999 apparition of the Leonids reach 'storm conditions'. In this case, the meteoroid shower has the damage potential which could exceed the sporadic meteoroid background by several orders of magnitude at peak. Impact velocities are considered and formulae for penetration, or, plasma charge production are presented. It is found that the Leonids exceed any other stream in terms of plasma current generation even under normal 'quiescent' conditions. Due to the flux enhancement associated with a storm condition, spacecraft could suffer up to one year's worth of <b>normal</b> <b>impact</b> damage, with a few spacecraft suffering potentially catastrophic plasma discharge events, and with the largest likely impact being able to penetrate of order 1 cm of solid aluminium...|$|R

40|$|Hypervelocity impact {{properties}} {{of two different}} graphene armor systems are investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. One system is the so-called spaced armor which consists {{of a number of}} graphene plates spaced certain distance apart. Its response under <b>normal</b> <b>impact</b> of a spherical projectile is studied, focusing on the effect of the number of graphene monolayers per plate (denoted by n) on the penetration resistance of the armor. We find that under <b>normal</b> <b>impact</b> by a spherical projectile the penetration resistance increases with decreasing number of monolayers per plate (n), and the best penetration resistance is achieved in the system with one graphene layer for each plate. Note that the monolayers in all the simulated multilayer graphene plates were AB-stacked. The second system being studied is the laminated copper/graphene composites with the graphene layers inside copper, on impact or back surface, or on both the impact and back surfaces. The simulation results show that under <b>normal</b> <b>impact</b> by a spherical projectile the laminated copper/graphene composite has much higher penetration resistance than the monolithic copper plate.

40|$|Analytical {{models have}} been used here to conduct {{detailed}} studies on the elastoplastic response of rectangular plates subjected to <b>normal</b> <b>impact</b> of a rigid sphere. Analytical {{models have been}} derived using a complete modelling approach in which the equations of motion of the contacting bodies (i. e. the plate and spherical impactor) and a compliance law for the local contact mechanics are used to formulate the impact model. To account for the local contact mechanics, a novel Meyer-type compliance model based on elastic-elastoplastic-fully plastic material behaviour has been formulated and validated using published experimental results. This compliance model was used to investigate the elastoplastic impact response of both transversely inflexible and transversely flexible rectangular plates. Particular {{attention has been given}} to solving the nonlinear impact models, leading {{to the development of a}} new algorithm to solve the nonlinear models of a half-space impact. The algorithm is simple, inherently stable and converges very quickly. For transversely flexible plate impact, investigations were centred on the elastoplastic impact response of a three-layer laminated plate structure called a trimorph plate. The understanding gained from investigating the elastoplastic impact response of an Al/PVDF/PZT trimorph plate was applied to study a newly proposed strategy for active mitigation of elastoplastic <b>impact</b> <b>effects</b> i. e. plastic deformation and/or damage. The idea behind the strategy was to use bonded piezoactuators to actively induce a state of pre-stress in the host layer, which in turn influenced the impact response of the plate. A preliminary qualitative analysis of the proposed strategy was conducted using analytically derived models for a PZT/Al/PZT trimorph plate and the results obtained showed that the proposed strategy can be used to achieve significant levels of mitigation against elastoplastic <b>impact</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|Comets {{have long}} been {{proposed}} as a potential means for the transport of complex organic compounds to early Earth. For {{this to be a}} viable mechanism, a significant fraction of organic compounds must survive the high temperatures due to impact. We have undertaken three-dimensional numerical simulations to track the thermodynamic state of a comet during oblique impacts. The comet was modeled as a 1 -km water-ice sphere impacting a basalt plane at 11. 2 km/s; impact angles of 15 {sup o} (from horizontal), 30 {sup o}, 45 {sup o}, 65 {sup o}, and 90 {sup o} (<b>normal</b> <b>impact)</b> were examined. The survival of organic cometary material, modeled as water ice for simplicity, was calculated using three criteria: (1) peak temperatures, (2) the thermodynamic phase of H{sub 2 }O, and (3) final temperature upon isentropic unloading. For impact angles {{greater than or equal to}} 30 {sup o}, no organic material is expected to survive the impact. For the 15 {sup o} impact, most of the material survives the initial impact and significant fractions (55 %, 25 %, and 44 %, respectively) satisfy each survival criterion at 1 second. Heating due to deceleration, in addition to shock heating, plays a role in the heating of the cometary material for nonnormal <b>impacts.</b> This <b>effect</b> is more noticeable for more oblique impacts, resulting in significant deviations from estimates using scaling of <b>normal</b> <b>impacts.</b> The deceleration heating of the material at late times requires further modeling of breakup and mixing...|$|R

40|$|The {{collision}} of an asteroid with Earth can potentially have significant {{consequences for the}} human population. The European and United States space agencies (ESA and NASA) maintain asteroid hazard lists that contain all known asteroids with a non-zero chance of colliding with the Earth in the future. Some software tools exist that are, either, capable of calculating the impact points of those asteroids, or that can estimate the <b>impact</b> <b>effects</b> of a given impact incident. However, no single tool is available that combines both aspects and enables a comprehensive risk analysis. The question is, thus, whether tools that can calculate impact location {{may be used to}} obtain a qualitative understanding of the asteroid impact risk distribution. To answer this question, two impact risk distributions that control for <b>impact</b> <b>effect</b> modelling were generated and compared. The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR) tool, in conjunction with the freely available software OrbFit, was used to project the impact probabilities of listed asteroids with a minimum diameter of 30 m onto the surface of the Earth representing a random sample (15 % of all objects) of the hazard list. The resulting 261 impact corridors were visualized on a global map. Furthermore, the impact corridors were combined with Earth population data to estimate the “simplified” risk (without <b>impact</b> <b>effects)</b> and “advanced” risk (with <b>impact</b> <b>effects)</b> associated with the direct asteroid impacts that each nation faces from present to 2100 based on this sample.

40|$|AbstractAlong with comfort, {{the speed}} {{is a key}} metric used to qualify the {{performance}} of a table tennis racket. The restitution coefficient which corresponds to the ratio between the velocities of the ball right before and after normally impacting the racket relates to the speed performance: the higher the restitution coefficient, the greater the speed. Thus, understanding the <b>normal</b> <b>impact</b> problem is key and suggests investigating the effects of the intrinsic properties and architectures of the constituents of the racket. In this work, both experimental and numerical studies were pursued. Experimentally, <b>normal</b> <b>impact</b> tests were performed for varying launching velocities on samples made of isolated or associated constituents of a table tennis racket and the restitution coefficients calculated. Numerically, 3 D finite elements simulations were conducted to replicate the <b>normal</b> <b>impact</b> conditions while incorporating the time-dependent constitutive behavior of the polymeric elements contributing during the impact: the racket constituents (the foam and the compact) and the ball. The restitution coefficients are seen to decrease with increasing launching velocity, while being minimum when the two racket polymeric constituents are associated. A fair agreement is obtained with the FE simulations in which the sample/ball contact zone is identified as a ring with its mean radius increasing till the maximum crushing. Ultimately, additional FE calculations confirm that the friction {{plays a key role in}} the energy dissipation process, alongside with the rate-dependent behavior and architecture of the polymeric constituents...|$|R

Improved composite transverse tensile strength, use of dispersed ply lay-ups, and inclusion of PRD- 49 - 1 or S-glass fibers correlated with improved resistance of composite materials to transverse damage.
