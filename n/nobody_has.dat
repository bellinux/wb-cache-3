5|$|Mr. Nobody had {{its world}} premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival where it {{received}} the Golden Osella and the Biografilm Lancia Award. Critical response was generally strong {{and the film}} was nominated for seven Magritte Awards, winning six, including Best Film and Best Director for Van Dormael. The film was mostly funded through European financiers and was released in Belgium on 13 January 2010. Since its original release, Mr. <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> become a cult film, noted for its philosophy and cinematography, personal characters and Pierre Van Dormael's soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Mr. <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> {{received}} accolades in categories {{ranging from}} {{recognition of the}} film itself, to its cinematography, direction and editing, to the cast's performance, particularly Jared Leto's portrayal of the film's protagonist, Nemo Nobody. The film was submitted for consideration for the Golden Lion at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, but lost to Lebanon (2009). Sylvie Olivé was later given the Golden Osella for Outstanding Technical Contribution for the production design while the film received the Biografilm Lancia Award. Jared Leto earned a nomination for the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. He was also awarded at the 14th Puchon Film Awards.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Nobody is a 2009 {{science fiction}} drama film written and {{directed}} by Jaco Van Dormael. It premiered on September 12, 2009 at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, before being released in theaters in Belgium and France in January 2010 by Belga Films and Pathé. Since its original release, Mr. <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> become a cult film, noted for its philosophy and cinematography, personal characters and Pierre Van Dormael's soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E

Mr. <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> appeared on many critics top ten lists of 2010 and is frequently considered {{to be one of}} the greatest films of the year. Kurt Halfyard, a film critic for Twitch Film, listed Van Dormael's film among the best science fiction films of the 21st century.

5|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> ever cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

In the report Judge Peter Smithwick stated that ‘on balance of probability’, somebody inside the Dundalk Garda station had passed on information to the IRA regarding the presence of Breen and Buchanan.|$|E
