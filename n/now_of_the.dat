5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monastic complex is a water well.|$|E
5|$|In 1914–15, both Ottawa and the Wanderers {{bounced back}} to the top of league, tying each other for the NHA season title. This was also the season that future Hall of Famer Clint Benedict became the Senators' top goaltender, taking over from Percy LeSueur. Former Wanderer Art Ross joined the Senators and helped Ottawa win in a two-game playoff, 4–1. The Senators then played in the first inter-league Stanley Cup final playoff series with the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast (PCHA) league. Cyclone Taylor, <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Millionaires, haunted his old team, scoring six goals in three games as Ottawa lost three {{straight}} in Vancouver. Future Senator centreman Frank Nighbor played in this series for Vancouver and scored five goals.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mercury {{refused to}} let the band record, {{and at the same}} time Stratton-Smith {{refused to let}} the other members of the band sign to Mercury too, as he did not think the deal was fair to the band (only Hammill {{remained}} <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original three who had signed with Mercury). On top of that in late January 1969 the band's van and equipment were stolen. The theft aggravated their financial difficulties. Although the band was touring successfully, which included a concert in February at the Royal Albert Hall in support of Jimi Hendrix, it broke up in June after playing a final gig at Nottingham's Pop & Blues Festival on 10 May entirely with borrowed equipment. John Peel, who was compering the show, announced their break-up to the audience.|$|E
50|$|The Wŏnsan−Kowŏn {{section was}} built as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hamgyŏng Line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chosen Government Railway (Sentetsu); this line ran on <b>the</b> routing <b>of</b> Wŏnsan−Kowŏn (<b>now</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kangwŏn Line), Kowŏn−Ch'ŏngjin (<b>now</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P'yŏngra Line), and Ch'ŏngjin−Sangsambong (<b>now</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hambuk Line). The Wŏnsan−Kowŏn section was {{completed}} in two parts: Wŏnsan−Okp'yŏng (at the time called Munch'ŏn Station) on 1 August 1915, and Munch'ŏn−Kowŏn−Kŭmya on 21 July 1916; the Kowŏn−Kŭmya section is <b>now</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P'yŏngra Line.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} opened on 15 May 1878 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways as a through station {{along with the}} Schnabelwaid-Marktredwitz line (<b>now</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nuremberg-Cheb line) and the Marktredwitz-Holenbrunn line (<b>now</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Regensburg-Hof line). The station became a {{junction}} with <b>the</b> commissioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> branch to Schirnding (later extended to Cheb, then called Eger; the whole line is <b>now</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nuremberg-Cheb line) on 20 November 1879 and the link from Wiesau (<b>now</b> a section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Regensburg-Hof line) on 1 June 1882.|$|R
5|$|The {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn was completed as far as Sale by 1765, and transformed the town's economy by providing a quick and cheap route into Manchester for fresh produce. Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back night soil to fertilise the fields. Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct. A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street, {{on the site of}} the road <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey. The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time. The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road. Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded.|$|E
5|$|The overall Persian {{strategy}} for the invasion of 480 BC was to overwhelm the Greeks with a massive invasion force, and complete the conquest of Greece in a single campaigning season. Conversely, the Greeks sought {{to make the best}} use of their numbers by defending restricted locations and to keep the Persians in the field for as long as possible. Xerxes had obviously not anticipated such resistance, or he would have arrived earlier in the campaigning season (and not waited 4 days at Thermopylae for the Greeks to disperse). Time was <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essence for the Persians – the huge invasion force could not be reasonably supported indefinitely, nor probably did Xerxes wish to be at the fringe of his empire for so long. Thermopylae had shown that a frontal assault against a well defended Greek position was useless; with the Allies now dug in across the narrow Isthmus, there was little chance of conquering the rest of Greece by land. However, as equally demonstrated by Thermopylae, if the Greeks could be outflanked, their smaller numbers of troops could be destroyed. Such an outflanking of the Isthmus required the use of the Persian navy, and thus the destruction of the Allied navy. Therefore, if Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy, he would be in a strong position to force a Greek surrender; this seemed the only hope of concluding the campaign in that season. Conversely by avoiding destruction, or as Themistocles hoped, by crippling the Persian fleet, the Greeks could effectively thwart the invasion.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in 1816 {{under the}} Restoration, the town {{returned}} to its coat of arms from 1697, unable to pay the registration fee {{to return to the}} original coat of arms.

25|$|By 1459 the Sultan {{dedicated}} a lot {{of energy}} to bringing prosperity to Constantinople. In several quarters of the city pious foundations were created; these areas consisted of a theological college, a school (or a Madrasa, usually connected to the mosque), a public kitchen, and a mosque. In the same year Mehmed sent out orders that any Greeks who had left Constantinople as slaves or refugees should be allowed to return. These actions led it to become a once again thriving capital city, <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Stella Browne has set {{the stage}} for many {{arguments}} surrounding women’s rights to sexuality {{and is one of the}} few women in history to have written works left behind that help historians to understand the interaction of socialism and feminism.

25|$|In 1775, {{in a final}} {{territorial}} reorganization, {{the colony}} was once again reunified: the State of Maranhão and Piauí and the State of Grão-Pará and Rio Negro were both abolished, and their territories were incorporated into {{the territory of the}} State of Brazil. The State of Brazil was thus expanded; it became the sole Portuguese State in South America; and it now included in its territory the whole of the Portuguese possessions in the American Continent. Indeed, with the reorganization of 1775, {{for the first time since}} 1654, all the Portuguese territories in the New World were once again united under a single colonial government. Rio de Janeiro, that had become the capital of the State of Brazil in 1763, continued to be the capital, <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unified colony.|$|E

25|$|The PLA Navy {{was ranked}} in 1987 {{as the third}} largest navy in the world, {{although}} naval personnel had comprised only 12 percent of PLA strength. In 1987 the Navy consisted (as it does <b>now)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naval headquarters in Beijing; three fleet commands – the North Sea Fleet, based at Qingdao, Shandong; the East Sea Fleet, based at Ningbo; and the South Sea Fleet, based at Zhanjiang, Guangdong – and about 2,000 ships. The 350,000-person Navy included Naval Air Force units of 34,000 men, the Coastal Defense Forces of 38,000, and the Marine Corps of 56,500. Navy Headquarters, which controlled the three fleet commands, was subordinate to the PLA General Staff Department. In 1987, China's 1,500km coastline was protected by more than 100 diesel-powered Romeo- and Whiskey-class submarines, which could remain at sea only a limited time. Inside this protective ring and within range of shore-based aircraft were destroyers and frigates mounting Styx anti-ship missiles, depth-charge projectors, and guns up to 130mm. Any invader penetrating the destroyer and frigate protection would have been swarmed by almost 900 fast-attack craft. Stormy weather limited the range of these small boats, however, and curtailed air support. Behind the inner ring were Coastal Defense Force personnel operating naval shore batteries of Styx missiles and guns, backed by ground force units deployed in depth.|$|E
500|$|Coenwulf's kin {{may have}} been {{connected}} to the royal family of the Hwicce, a subkingdom of Mercia around the lower river Severn. It appears that Coenwulf's family were powerful, {{but they were not}} of recent Mercian royal lineage. A letter written by Alcuin to the people of Kent in 797 laments that [...] "scarcely anyone is found <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old stock of kings". Eardwulf of Northumbria had, like Coenwulf, gained his throne in 796, so Alcuin's meaning is not clear, but it may be that he intended it as a slur on Eardwulf or Coenwulf or on both. Alcuin certainly held negative views of Coenwulf, regarding him as a tyrant and criticizing him for putting aside one wife and taking another. Alcuin wrote to a Mercian nobleman to ask him to greet Coenwulf peaceably [...] "if it is possible to do so", implying uncertainty about Coenwulf's policy towards the Carolingians.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the speech's poor reception, Pitt effectively promised Cornwallis carte blanche to build support for union. [...] Portland wrote to Cornwallis, [...] "I hope it is unnecessary to assure your excellency that whatever your decisions may be you may depend upon their receiving the unreserved sanction and support of His Majesty's servants." [...] On the basis of these assurances, Cornwallis and Castlereagh developed a plan to coopt or convince enough of the propertied interests that controlled the parliament to support the union. [...] Cornwallis found this task, which occupied much of the next year, to be extremely distasteful: [...] "My occupation is <b>now</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most unpleasant nature, negotiating and jobbing with the most corrupt people under heaven. [...] I despise and hate myself every hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am supported only by the reflection that without an Union the British Empire must be dissolved." [...] The task was made somewhat more pleasant by the arrival of his son for a short visit in July 1799.|$|E
