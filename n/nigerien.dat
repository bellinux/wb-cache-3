5|$|Through French {{pressure}} on Libya and {{the mediation of}} <b>Nigerien</b> President Hamani Diori, the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972. Shortly after, Tombalbaye broke diplomatic relations with Israel and {{is said to have}} secretly agreed on 28 November to cede the Aouzou Strip to Libya. In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million pounds to the Chadian President and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew official support to the FROLINAT and forced its leader Abba Siddick to move his headquarters from Tripoli to Algiers. Good relations were confirmed in the following years, with Gaddafi visiting the Chadian capital N'Djamena in March 1974; in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds.|$|E
25|$|In Niger, {{fighting}} flared after a Ramadan truce in 2007, with land-mine {{attacks and}} incursions reaching {{areas in the}} south and center of the nation previously unaffected. The <b>Nigerien</b> government, rejecting any negotiations, pursued a crackdown on rebel forces and {{declared a state of emergency}} in the north which by December 2007 threatened to spark a humanitarian crisis. High-profile arrests of domestic and foreign media, the expulsion of European NGOs from the area, and the reported human rights practices of the <b>Nigerien</b> Armed Forces in the Agadez Region have led to criticism of the <b>Nigerien</b> government abroad, and continued fighting in the north. Despite government military victories in early 2008, and condemnation for a hostage seizure and land-mine attacks (for which the rebels deny responsibility), the MNJ appeared no closer to either defeat or overthrow of the <b>Nigerien</b> government as the rainy season approached in August 2008.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 {{peace in}} Mali {{was seen as}} a model for a February civil society conference in Niamey. In March 2009 a {{dramatic}} split of much of the MNJ leadership resulted in the former MNJ head fleeing to Libya, who aided delivering <b>Nigerien</b> Armed Forces prisoners home. The new <b>Nigerien</b> Patriotic Front (FPN), which contained much of the MNJ's fighters and leadership, called for a negotiated peace. They, along with an earlier splinter, entered into four-party talks with the <b>Nigerien</b> government under Libyan auspices from March to June 2009. All sides pledged an immediate ceasefire in May 2009, while pursuing talks for a permanent peace and an amnesty for all former rebels.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday 14 December 2008, a Canadian UN {{official}} was kidnapped while traveling {{on a highway}} just 40km north of Niamey, well away from any previous rebel attacks. The MNJ denied involvement, but a statement attributed to Ag Boula took responsibility for the kidnapping {{in the name of}} the FFR. Mohamed Awtchiki Kriska, on the other hand, denied that the FFR was responsible. Previous kidnappings acknowledged by the MNJ in the conflict—those of a Chinese mining executive in 2007, a <b>Nigerien</b> parliamentarian and Red Cross head, a <b>Nigerien</b> Prefect, and four Areva officials, all in 2008—were all quickly resolved.|$|E

Although educated <b>Nigeriens</b> still constitute a relatively small percentage of the population, the French language is the language used by the official administration (courts, government, etc.), the media and the business community.

25|$|In April 2008, The {{government}} of Niger requested that Ag Boula be extradited by the French government; however, by this time, {{he was no}} longer in France. The <b>Nigerien</b> courts convicted him of planning the murder of a ruling party activist, for which he had been arrested in 2004, but released without charge in 2005. His supporters believed {{at the time that the}} 2004 arrest was planned to induce a rebellion among Ag Boula's supporters. Ag Boula's brother subsequently led a 2005 raid on a <b>Nigerien</b> military patrol which killed ten. The conviction took place in absentia in a trial on 12–13 July 2008.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Nigerien</b> rebels {{pursued a}} {{strategy}} of expanding the ethnic makeup of their forces, and attempted—with little success in the south—to broaden the insurgency into a social movement to replace the current government and provide the population with a share in Niger's growing mining sector. By the beginning of 2009, rebel attempts to impinge upon <b>Nigerien</b> uranium production had, according to mining officials, little effect. The effects on {{the population of the}} north has been pronounced, with the regional capitol of Agadez hosting thousands of refugees, economic activity outside the towns grinding to a halt, and the destruction of a burgeoning foreign tourist industry in the north of the country.|$|E

25|$|On 19 August 2008, it was {{announced}} by the <b>Nigerien</b> television broadcast someone they claimed to be rebel leader Aghaly ag Alambo, announcing that the Tuareg would lay down arms in both Mali and Niger following a peace brokered by Libya. The MNJ later discounted this as a hoax. This was likely a film of Malian rebel leader Ibrahim Ag Bahanga discussing the April peace talks with the Malian government in Libya, hence the reference to Malian leadership and Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The current peace deal in the Malian conflict took place in July {{under the auspices of}} Libya's regional rival Algeria. Aghaly ag Alambo released a statement saying that although they were willing to engage in peace negotiations, they would not lay down their arms unilaterally, and the Malian and <b>Nigerien</b> rebels cannot speak for one another.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of the conflict in Niger {{was a series of}} arrests of domestic journalists, and expulsions or closings of foreign press and aid groups. The state of emergency in the Agadez Region, re-authorised every six months since November 2007, has barred foreign press or aid from the area. In mid-2008, the French charity Doctors without borders (MSF) was forced to close a childhood malnutrition treatment program in Maradi Region which had been operating since 2005. MSF was subsequently ejected from the country by the <b>Nigerien</b> government. The rebroadcasting of foreign radio broadcasts in Niger has been interupped several times since mid-2007 by government order. <b>Nigerien</b> journalists say they are often pressured by local authorities. The north, under a state of emergency, has become off-limits to both domestic and foreign press, and the independent Radio Agadez in the north has been closed by the government.|$|E
25|$|Since mid-2007, {{there have}} been a number of arrests of foreign and local journalists. Two local journalists were imprisoned in 2007 under charge of aiding the Tuareg {{insurgency}} in the north, and several radio stations have been closed. The journalist Moussa Kaka was held over a year on charges stemming from a radio interview of Rebel leaders, before being provisionally released. Kaka has been at the center of a campaign in France and elsewhere demanding his freedom, spearheaded by Radio France International and its CEO Alain de Pouzilhac, Reporters Without Borders (both organisations for which Kaka is Niger Correspondent) and Amnesty International, as well as <b>Nigerien</b> press groups including The <b>Nigerien</b> National Union of Press Workers (SYNATIC) and Le Republicain newspaper. Despite his release, several journalists remain jailed for alleged contact with the rebels, and at least three radio stations (Nigeriens main source of news) have been closed by the authorities.|$|E
50|$|The Nigerien's Movement for Justice (in French Mouvement des <b>Nigériens</b> pour la justice, MNJ) is {{a largely}} Tuareg ethnic, {{northern}} Niger based militant group.

50|$|The 171 {{members of}} the National Assembly were elected by two methods; 158 members were elected from eight multi-member {{constituencies}} based on the seven regions and Niamey by party-list proportional representation.

25|$|In November, {{a convoy}} loaded with heavy {{weaponry}} was intercepted {{when trying to}} cross from Libya into neighboring Niger, according to <b>Nigerien</b> security officials.

25|$|As Niger edged {{towards the}} 2008 rainy season, the MNJ rebels {{discounted}} reports {{that they had}} begun a ceasefire, but fighting was sporadic, occurring around the rebel strongholds of the Tamgak Plateau near Iferaouane.

5000|$|On 27 June, President Tandja {{announced}} he was suspending the government and would rule by decree.
