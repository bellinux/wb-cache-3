We investigated the role of <b>NEP</b> expression in the clinical progression of cutaneous melanoma. Methods We screened 7 melanoma cell lines for <b>NEP</b> protein expression. NEP-specific siRNA was transfected into the lines to examine the role of gene transcription in <b>NEP</b> expression. Immunohistochemistry was done for 93 specimens and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. Thirty-seven metastatic melanoma specimens were examined for <b>NEP</b> transcript expression using Affymetrix GeneChips. In a subset of 25 specimens for which both transcript and protein expression was available, expression ratios were used to identify genes that co-express with <b>NEP</b> in GeneChip analysis. Results <b>NEP</b> was overexpressed in 4 / 7 human melanoma cell lines, and siRNA knock-down of <b>NEP</b> transcripts led to downregulation of its protein expression. <b>NEP</b> protein overexpression was significantly more common in metastatic versus primary tumors (P = 0. 002). Twelve of 37 (32 %) metastatic tumors had increased <b>NEP</b> transcript expression, and an association was observed between <b>NEP</b> transcript upregulation and protein overexpression (P Conclusion <b>NEP</b> overexpression, which seems to be largely driven by increased transcription, is rare in primary melanoma and occurs late in melanoma progression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neutral Endopeptidase (<b>NEP)</b> is a cell surface {{enzyme that}} cleaves and inactivates neuropeptides. When present on androgen-dependent {{prostate}} cancer (PC) cells, <b>NEP</b> inactivates growth stimulatory neuropeptides. After androgen ablation <b>NEP</b> expression decreases and neuropeptides can enhance cell growth, {{leading to the}} development of androgen-independent, neuropeptide stimulated PC. Aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the expression, localisation and distribution of <b>NEP</b> in benign and malignant prostatic tissues and its relation to the cytoskeleton. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to localise <b>NEP</b> in fixed specimens from normal prostatic tissue, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and PC of Gleason grade 2 - 5. In situ hybridisation and Western blotting experiments were carried out to confirm <b>NEP</b> gene expression and translation to mature protein in BPH and PC tissue. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was utilised to investigate whether development of high grade prostate tumours was accompanied by changes in intracellular actin/NEP colocalisation patterns. Finally, the proliferative activity in relation to loss of <b>NEP</b> expression was investigated by dual staining of <b>NEP</b> and Ki- 67 in prostatic tumours. RESULTS: In situ hybridisation studies revealed preserved expression of <b>NEP</b> mRNA in epithelial cells of PC. <b>NEP</b> was by IHC shown to be located in the apical plasma membrane of normal epithelial cells and BPH tissue. In PC a Gleason grade dependent shift of the <b>NEP</b> distribution pattern towards a heterogeneous, partly cytoplasmic allocation of the protein was found. Compared to BPH tissue, specimens derived from PC showed very low IHC-staining intensity for <b>NEP</b> protein. In high grade PC the typical apical colocalisation of actin and <b>NEP</b> was lost and a strong granular cytoplasmic <b>NEP</b> staining was found. PC areas with a high expression of <b>NEP</b> displayed diminished proliferative activity i. e. low staining intensity for Ki- 67. CONCLUSIONS: <b>NEP</b> is differentially expressed in the normal and the pathologically altered prostate with a clear shift from a membrane bound to a cytoplasmic distribution pattern in high-grade tumours and loss of <b>NEP</b> expression in areas of high proliferative activity. The data presented support an active involvement of <b>NEP</b> in the progression of androgen-independent PC. Further studies are needed to unravel the mechanisms underlying the cytoplasmic <b>NEP</b> distribution in PC...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe show in {{this study}} that {{endogenous}} <b>NEP</b> and PTEN associate in cells directly through electrostatic interactions between a highly basic residue stretch in the intracellular domain of <b>NEP</b> and the major phosphorylation site in PTEN's tail. <b>NEP</b> binds and engages in higher order complexes both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PTEN. <b>NEP</b> recruits PTEN to the plasma membrane and enhances its stability and phosphatase activity. As a result, an enzymatically inactive <b>NEP</b> mutant preserves the ability to bind PTEN, inactivates the Akt/PKB kinase, and partially suppresses the growth of PC cells.

40|$|The amyloid-β 42 (Aβ 42) peptide {{has been}} {{suggested}} to play a causative role in Alzheimer disease (AD). Neprilysin (<b>NEP)</b> {{is one of the}} rate-limiting Aβ-degrading enzymes, and its enhancement ameliorates extracellular amyloid pathology, synaptic dysfunction, and memory defects in mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis. In addition to the extracellular Aβ, intraneuronal Aβ 42 may contribute to AD pathogenesis. However, the protective effects of neuronal <b>NEP</b> expression on intraneuronal Aβ 42 accumulation and neurodegeneration remain elusive. In contrast, sustained <b>NEP</b> activation may be detrimental because <b>NEP</b> can degrade many physiological peptides, but its consequences in the brain are not fully understood. Using transgenic Drosophila expressing human <b>NEP</b> and Aβ 42, we demonstrated that <b>NEP</b> efficiently suppressed the formation of intraneuronal Aβ 42 deposits and Aβ 42 -induced neuron loss. However, neuronal <b>NEP</b> overexpression reduced cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-mediated transcription, caused age-dependent axon degeneration, and shortened the life span of the flies. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of endogenous fly <b>NEP</b> genes and phosphoramidon-sensitive <b>NEP</b> activity declined during aging in fly brains, as observed in mammals. Taken together, these data suggest both the protective and detrimental effects of chronically high <b>NEP</b> activity in the brain.

Western analyses and cell migration assays revealed an inverse correlation between <b>NEP</b> expression and the levels of FAK phosphorylation and cell migration in PC cell lines. Constitutively expressed <b>NEP,</b> recombinant <b>NEP,</b> and induced <b>NEP</b> expression using a tetracycline-repressive expression system inhibited bombesin- and endothelin- 1 –stimulated FAK phosphorylation and cell migration.

An imbalance between Ab production and clearance from the brain may contribute to accumulation of neurotoxic Ab and subsequent synaptic loss, which is the strongest correlate of the extent of memory loss in AD. The activity of neprilysin (<b>NEP),</b> a potent Ab-degrading enzyme, is decreased in the AD brain. Expression of HuD, an mRNA-binding protein important for synaptogenesis and neuronal plasticity, is also decreased in the AD brain.

We hypothesized that PKCe acts through HuD to stabilize <b>NEP</b> mRNA, modulate its localization, and support <b>NEP</b> activity. Conversely, loss of PKCe-activated HuD in AD leads to decreased <b>NEP</b> activity and accumulation of Ab.

Male BALB/c mice (20 – 25 g) subjected to 3 – 10 hourly injections of caerulein (50 mg/kg) exhibited reduced <b>NEP</b> activity and protein expression in the pancreas and lungs. Additionally, caerulein (1027 M) also downregulated <b>NEP</b> activity and mRNA expression in isolated pancreatic acinar cells. The role of <b>NEP</b> in AP was examined in two opposite ways: inhibition of <b>NEP</b> (phosphoramidon [5 mg/kg] or thiorphan [10 mg/kg]) followed by 6 hourly caerulein injections) or supplementation with exog-enous <b>NEP</b> (10 hourly caerulein injections, treatment of recombinant mouse <b>NEP</b> [1 mg/kg] during second caerulein injection).

Immunohistochemical staining was used to localise the <b>NEP</b> enzyme protein and its neuropeptide substrates and fluorophotometry to measure the corresponding enzyme activities in saliva. RESULTS: <b>NEP</b> was found in nerve fibres and in perivascular, periductal, and periacinar axon terminal varicosities. Double labelling of PGP 9. 5 and <b>NEP</b> confirmed this neuronal localisation of <b>NEP.</b> Although some fibroblast-like cells and occasional intravascular neutrophils were <b>NEP</b> positive, <b>NEP</b> mRNA was not found in labial salivary glands.

We show that <b>Nep</b> 1 can deneddylate the Pcu 1, Pcu 3 and Pcu 4 cullins in vitro and that its activity is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, consistent with the idea that it is a member of the cysteine protease family. <b>nep</b> 1. d cells accumulate Nedd 8 -modified proteins, although these do not correspond to modified forms of the cullins, suggesting that, although <b>Nep</b> 1 can deneddylate cullins in vitro, this is not its main function in vivo. <b>Nep</b> 1 can be co-precipitated with the signalosome subunit Csn 5. <b>Nep</b> 1 itself is present in a high-molecular-mass complex, but the presence of this complex is not dependent on the production of intact signalosomes. Our results suggest that, in vivo, <b>Nep</b> 1 may be responsible for deneddylating proteins other than cullins...|$|R
40|$|<b>Nep</b> 1 (Emg 1) is {{a highly}} conserved {{nucleolar}} protein with an essential function in ribosome biogenesis. A mutation in the human <b>Nep</b> 1 homolog causes Bowen–Conradi syndrome—a severe developmental disorder. Structures of <b>Nep</b> 1 revealed a dimer with a fold similar to the SPOUT-class of RNA-methyltransferases suggesting that <b>Nep</b> 1 acts as a methyltransferase in ribosome biogenesis. The target for this putative methyltransferase activity has not been identified yet. We characterized the RNA-binding specificity of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii <b>Nep</b> 1 by fluorescence- and NMR-spectroscopy {{as well as by}} yeast three-hybrid screening. <b>Nep</b> 1 binds with high affinity to short RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to nt 910 – 921 of M. jannaschii 16 S rRNA through a highly conserved basic surface cleft along the dimer interface. <b>Nep</b> 1 only methylates RNAs containing a pseudouridine at a position corresponding to a previously identified hypermodified N 1 -methyl-N 3 -(3 -amino- 3 -carboxypropyl) pseudouridine (m 1 acp 3 -Psi) in eukaryotic 18 S rRNAs. Analysis of the methylated nucleoside by MALDI-mass spectrometry, HPLC and NMR shows that the methyl group is transferred to the N 1 of the pseudouridine. Thus, <b>Nep</b> 1 is the first identified example of an N 1 -specific pseudouridine methyltransferase. This enzymatic activity is also conserved in human <b>Nep</b> 1 suggesting that <b>Nep</b> 1 is the methyltransferase in the biosynthesis of m 1 acp 3 -Psi in eukaryotic 18 S rRNAs...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: We {{aimed to}} analyze {{substance}} P (SP) and neprilysin (<b>NEP),</b> the membrane metallopeptidase that degrades SP, in chronic pancreatitis (CP). Methods: SP and <b>NEP</b> mRNA levels {{were analyzed by}} qRT-PCR in tissue samples from 30 patients with CP and 8 organ donors. In addition, SP serum levels were determined before and after surgery in the same patients, {{by means of a}} competitive ELISA assay. Genetic and epigenetic analyses of the <b>NEP</b> gene were also performed. Results: SP mRNA expression levels were higher in CP tissues compared to controls (p = 0. 0152), while <b>NEP</b> mRNA showed no significant differences between CP and healthy subjects (p = 0. 2102). In CP patients, SP serum levels correlated with those in tissue, and after surgical resection SP serum levels were reduced compared to the preoperative values. Failure of <b>NEP</b> to overexpress in CP tissues was associated with significant miR- 128 a overexpression (p = 0. 02), rather than with mutations in the <b>NEP</b> coding region or the presence of hypermethylation sites in the <b>NEP</b> promoter region. Conclusion: Tissue and serum levels of SP were increased in CP, while <b>NEP</b> levels remained unaltered. In an SP/NEP-mediated pathway, it would appear that <b>NEP</b> fails to provide adequate surveillance of SP levels. Failure of <b>NEP</b> to overexpress could be associated with miRNA regulation.

5|$|Claims {{that the}} <b>NEP</b> had retarded {{economic}} growth were dismissed; it was posited that the <b>NEP</b> {{had managed to}} avert further racial rioting, which would have hurt economic growth more than the <b>NEP.</b> The <b>NEP</b> was also defended as having created a Malay middle class and improving standards of living without compromising the non-Bumiputra share {{of the economy in}} absolute terms; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the <b>NEP,</b> albeit not as much as the Malays'. The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50% at independence to 7%. It was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to the <b>NEP's</b> success in creating a Malay upper class. Although many of the <b>NEP's</b> goals were restated by the NDP, the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation, as opposed to simple redistribution. Nevertheless, many of the policies from the <b>NEP</b> era were retained under the NDP, which was set to expire in 2020.|$|R
