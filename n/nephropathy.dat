5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA <b>nephropathy,</b> serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA <b>nephropathy</b> has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA <b>nephropathy</b> typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of patients with}} chronic <b>nephropathies</b> leading to the end stage of renal failure (ESRF) is increased. The conservative therapy of patients in the phase of ESRF {{as well as the}} performance of hemodialysis represent an extensive burden on health care budgets. Aim: The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the financial expenses for medications in group of conser-vatively treated patients with <b>nephropathies.</b> Patients and method: One hundred and two patients (56 females, 46 males) aged 2184 years with <b>nephropathies</b> collected from three out-patient departments of nephrology in the regions of Bratislava and Nitra (Western Slovakia) were enrolled into the study. Results: The total financial expenses represented 2, 889, 778 Sk The average expense per 1 patient/ 1 year was 28, 331 Sk and that of 1 patient/ 1 day was 77. 6 Sk, respectively. Antihypertensive therapy represented 1 st position (29. 4 %) of the total financial cost followed by keto-analogs (27. 5 %), hypolipideamics (14. 8 %), drugs for disorders of calcium metabolism (14. 4 %) and antianaemics (6. 2 %), respectively. The group of other drugs represented 7. 7 % of total costs. Conclusions: Results show that the financial expenses for pharmacotherapy in conservatively treated patients with <b>nephropathies</b> are high, but significantly less expensive in comparison with hemodialysis (700 0001 000 000 Sk/year/patient). The prevention and the slowing down of the progression of renal disease seem to be crucial in the management of <b>nephropathies.</b> The therapeutic approach in conser-vatively treated patients with renal diseases was rational and up to date.

40|$|Toxic <b>nephropathies</b> cause {{acute and}} chronic renal failure, {{primarily}} {{as a result of}} injury to renal tubular epithelium. There is a well-known capacity in the renal nephron for the synchronous occurrence of both apoptosis and necrosis in toxic <b>nephropathies.</b> This has engendered interest in the differing or complementary roles of these modes of cell death. Once thought to be mutually exclusive in incidence and morphologic and biochemical features, recent evidence in renal and other diseases indicates some blurring in the features of apoptosis and necrosis, particularly in the situations in which they are identified, in their molecular pathways, and in the role of inflammation in the processes. Definition of the heterogenic pathophysiologic response of the nephron should provide information useful for promoting the health of the kidney after injury, particularly in relation to controlling the extent and modalities of cell death via the associated renal-specific molecular features.

5|$|The {{first report}} of {{nephrotoxicity}} appeared in 1964, when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency, {{two of whom}} {{were found to have}} calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy. In 1966, Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17/95 (18%) of patients developed an unusual type of <b>nephropathy</b> after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic. This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin-resistant high-output renal failure (production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine) with a negative fluid balance, pronounced weight loss, elevation of serum sodium, chloride, osmolality and blood urea nitrogen. The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very {{similar to that of the}} serum. Furthermore, the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation.

40|$|Prevention of {{progression}} and remission/regression {{strategies for}} chronic renal diseases: Can we do {{better now than}} five years ago? The prevalence of chronic renal diseases is increasing worldwide. There is a great need to identify therapies that arrest disease progression to end-stage renal failure. Inhibition of renin-angiotensin system both by ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists {{is probably the best}} therapeutic option available. Several large, multicenter studies have indeed shown a significant reduction in the risk of doubling baseline serum creatinine or progression toward end-stage renal failure in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with chronic <b>nephropathies</b> treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. However, the number of patients that reach end-stage renal failure is still considerably high. Significant reduction of the incidence of end-stage renal disease is likely to be achieved in the next future for chronic <b>nephropathies,</b> provided that we can improve the degree of renoprotection. This goal may be attainable with a more complex strategy than with a single or dual pharmacologic intervention on the renin-angiotensin system. Strict control of blood pressure and protein excretion rate, lowering of blood lipids, tight glucose control for diabetics, and lifestyle changes form part of the future multimodal protocol for management of patients with chronic <b>nephropathies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Matricellular {{proteins}} {{participate in}} the pathogenesis of chronic kidney diseases. We analyzed glomerular gene expression profiles from patients with proteinuric diseases to identify matricellular proteins contributing to the progression of human <b>nephropathies.</b> Several genes encoding matricellular proteins, such as SPARC, THBS 1, and CTGF, were induced in progressive <b>nephropathies,</b> but not in nonprogressive minimal-change disease. Periostin showed the highest induction, and its transcript levels correlated negatively with glomerular filtration rate in both glomerular and tubulointerstitial specimen. In well-preserved renal tissue, periostin localized to the glomerular tuft, the vascular pole, and along Bowman's capsule; no signal was detected in the tubulointerstitial compartment. Biopsies from patients with glomerulopathies and renal dysfunction showed enhanced periostin expression in the mesangium, tubular interstitium, and sites of fibrosis. Periostin staining correlated negatively with renal function. α-smooth muscle actin-positive mesangial and interstitial cells localized close to periostin-positive sites, as indicated by co-immunofluorescence. In vitro stimulation of mesangial cells by external addition of TGF-β 1 resulted in robust induction of periostin. Addition of periostin to mesangial cells induced cell proliferation and decreased the number of cells expressing activated caspase- 3, a marker of apoptosis. These human data indicate {{for the first time}} a role of periostin in glomerular and interstitial injury in acquired <b>nephropathies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Although several {{registries}} {{collecting data}} {{of patients with}} kidney diseases exist, only a few specifically collect data relating to renal biopsy. Kidney biopsy has been performed routinely in Pisa since 1977; {{the aim of this}} study was to report the relative frequency of hephropathies according to gender, age at,time of biopsy, clinical presentation and renal function, based on histological diagnoses during the years 1977 through 2005. During this time, 3, 810 kidney biopsies were performed, of which 89. 3 % were from native (n= 3, 446) and 10. 7 % from transplant kidneys. Throughout this period, 5 % of renal biopsies were not diagnostic, so in this paper we report data regarding 3, 269 native kidney <b>nephropathies.</b> Methods: During the years 1977 through 2005, data for renal biopsies were collected on specific registers filled but by clinicians. Information collected in the database included a variety of indicators, such as clinical anamnesis, creatinine clearance, daily proteinuria, hemoglobin levels, blood pressure, height and weight, clinical presentation, and current medications. Clinical presentation was defined as urinary abnormalities (UA), nephrotic syndrome (NS) and acute nephritic syndrome (ANS). Renal diseases were divided into 4 major categories: primary glomerulonephritis (GN), secondary GN, tubulointerstitial <b>nephropathies</b> (TIN) and vascular <b>nephropathies</b> (VN). Results: From 1977 up to 1987, a mean of 95 +/- 18 renal biopsies/year were performed; this number significantly increased to 185 +/- 22 renal biopsies/year (range 138 - 200) (p 60 ml/min at the time of biopsy. The main clinical reason for performing renal biopsy was UA, in all the types of <b>nephropathies.</b> Conclusions: We confirm data that renal diseases are more frequent in men, with the exception of secondary GN. The mean age at diagnosis was 42 years resulting from the tendency not to perform renal biopsies in children and in elderly patients. Renal biopsy was mainly performed in patients with GFR > 60 ml/min and asymptomatic urinary abnormalities suggesting concern on the part of clinicians regarding glomerular diseases. The tendency to perform renal biopsies has been significantly increasing throughout our follow-up period...|$|R
25|$|The term {{analgesic}} <b>nephropathy</b> usually {{refers to}} damage induced by {{excessive use of}} combinations of these medications, specifically combinations that include phenacetin.

25|$|While {{these data}} {{demonstrate}} that analgesic <b>nephropathy</b> {{has been all}} but eliminated in some regions, in other regions the condition persists.

Similarly, immunoadsorption can be employed successfully in the treatment of different <b>nephropathies,</b> of both immunological and non-immunological pathogenesis. This method may also be effective as rescue treatment in some cases of acute rejection and recurrence of certain <b>nephropathies</b> after renal transplantation.
