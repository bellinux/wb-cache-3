The five questions tested the sensitivity of <b>net</b> present <b>value</b> to <b>changes</b> in skid trail spacing, to avoiding compaction altogether by the use of aerial yarding systems, to different assumptions about growth losses adjacent to the skid trails, to initial site quality (high vs. low), and to different discount rates used in the <b>net</b> present <b>value</b> calculations.

40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{analysis was conducted}} of the National Fire Management Analysis System (NFMAS) {{to better understand the}} relationship between data input and model output. After consultations with fire managers and researchers, five input variables were selected for sensitization: unit mission costs, average acre costs, <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>change,</b> production rates, and escaped fire limits. A random sample of 23 National Forests was selected, according to the distribution of forests within regions and fire frequency classes, on the basis of historical fire data. Database tables were manipulated, with each variable increased and decreased at six levels (± 25, ± 50, and + 100 percent). The Interagency Initial Attack Assessment (IIAA) model was run at each successive level, generating a new set of output, cost plus <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>change</b> (C+NVC), for each sensitized variable. Results were analyzed statistically, and production rates and average acre costs were found to be the most influential, while unit mission costs was least influential.

The National Fire Management Analysis System (NFMAS) was designed in the late 1970 's by Richard Chase, for use by the USDA Forest Service in strategic fire management and budget planning.

We use the Theil Measure of Inequality (TMI) to compare and explain changes in 1) the between and within-region distribution of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added, and 2) changes {{in the distribution of}} factor shares of <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added in Canada and in the U.

Results show that in Canada (1960 - 2000), <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added has become somewhat more equally distributed relative to the number of farms per province, but has varied widely from 1972 - 1988. Between-region inequality in <b>net</b> <b>value</b> added accounted for from 0. 5 to 85. 5 percent of this inequality from 1960 - 2000. In the U. S.

30|$|Information {{regarding}} wildfire likelihood can {{be gleaned}} from Monte-Carlo wildfire simulation models. Such models {{have been used to}} quantify burn probability or wildfire threat at a variety of spatial scales, including local projects (Ager et al. 2007, Collins et al. 2011), regional assessments (Parisien et al. 2011, Parks et al. 2011), and continental assessments (Calkin et al. 2010, Finney et al. 2011). Until now, wildfire threat assessments have followed an approach that relies on gridded burn probability results, which are derived by simulating the ignition and spread of {{a very large number of}} wildfires (Miller et al. 2008), to quantify expected <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>change</b> (Finney 2005, Scott 2006). Historically, these models only generated gridded probabilities of fire likelihood, with little to no information on individual simulated wildfires (Parisien et al. 2005, Finney 2006, Miller et al. 2008). However, some wildfire simulation models now produce vector format results that identify the final perimeter and associated characteristics of each simulated wildfire. This information allows an approach to assessing burn probability and wildfire threat that incorporates the ignition location and date, as well as the area of an HVRA burned by each individual fire.|$|E
30|$|However, {{prescriptive}} {{models of}} large-fire management pose significant challenges {{and in general}} fail to meet the criteria we have put forth as follows: 1) Under many situations a clear spatially and temporally defined objective is not broadly accepted. Broadly speaking {{the objective is to}} minimize the cost of management plus <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>change</b> to affected resources. However, many of the primary resource values affected by fire are non-market in nature and relative value is not well understood (Venn and Calkin 2011) and tradeoffs between competing resource objectives are not consistently interpreted. 2) There are complex interactions between fire behavior and wildfire suppression actions. For example Finney et al. (2009) demonstrated that the primary factor leading to containment of large wildfires was the number of quiescent fire growth periods, and that the quantity of suppression resources could not be demonstrated to have any effect on likelihood of containment. 3) There is high parameter uncertainty around system components including longer term fire weather predictions, extreme fire behavior, and suppression effectiveness (Holmes and Calkin 2013). 4) Large wildfires are highly heterogeneous events in terms of weather, fire behavior, and management approach. Further, the events that result in highest loss have few historical precedents for comparison. 5) The conditions that lead the system to dramatic fire behavior transitions such as blow-ups and crown fire are poorly understood and extremely hard to predict.|$|E

Such activities include the airing of public service announcements, visiting with homeowners in at-risk areas, distributing informative brochures and flyers, hosting of public forums (with presentations), and facilitating community sponsored neighborhood hazard assessments. By limiting the number of ignitions, prevention entirely avoids costs and losses related to fire suppression (initial attack) and property damage. In this paper, we show that the benefits of wildfire prevention education activities carried out in the State of Florida, USA, far outweigh their costs. We also report how the return on wildfire prevention education investment in that State varies-i. e., the effectiveness of these programs varies-with many exogenous factors, including weather, season, and recent wildfrre history and fuels management activities. To illustrate how this effectiveness variation could be exploited to increase returns to money spent on prevention, we explore the optimal timing of wildfrre prevention activities. Optimal timing of wildfrre prevention education spending is defmed as the spending allocation over time that yields the lowest wildfire-induced cost plus <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>change</b> to society.

40|$|Allocating scare {{resources}} for fire management strategies requires {{information on the}} extent of economic losses from bushfires and the efficiency of alternatives. Despite the severity of bushfires, there is no agreed approach in Australia for estimating economic losses from fires nor for evaluating the economic efficiency of alternative suppression strategies. The poster proposes approaches to assess the economic effects of bushfires on local and state economies and sets out models to evaluate the economic efficiency of two key bushfire management strategies: presuppression and suppression. The first model arises from questions concerning the value of pre-suppression (before the fire) fuel reduction activities, and the estimation of an economically optimal fire management budget. The fuel reduction burning aims to reduce losses from a major fire event. To determine how the budget should be allocated, a modification of the Cost plus <b>Net</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Change</b> model is being used. This model has the advantage that each of the influencing parameters is easy to adjust or even change for different areas in Australia. The second model allows straightforward comparisons of approaches to bushfire suppression, through a fire simulation model. The simulation allows comparisons of alternative strategies under similar fire conditions. The economic utility in suppression of fire engines, dozers and aircraft is evaluated using Cost Benefit Analysis and a Cost plus Loss framework. The paper presents useful tools for decision makers to make damage assessment from fire, resource allocation on pre-suppression and guidelines for operational decision making on suppression approaches.

40|$|For the {{purposes}} of this discussion we use the general term ‘insect ’ to imply both sub-cortical (bark beetles) and defoliators (e. g., spruce budworm); we differentiate between the two when important differences exist in potential fire behavior succeeding outbreaks. The primary focus of the discussion concerns the western U. S. We also consider the following definitions: Severity- A qualitative assessment of the heat pulse directed toward the ground during a fire. Burn severity relates to soil heating, large fuel and duff consumption, consumption of the litter and organic layer beneath trees and isolated shrubs, and mortality of buried plant parts (Hardy 2005). Fuel Hazard- A fuel complex, defined by volume, type, condition, arrangement, and location that determines the degree of ease of ignition and the resistance to control. Fire hazard expresses the potential fire behavior for a fuel type, regardless of the fuel type’s weather-influenced fuel moisture content (Hardy 2005). Fire risk- The chance that a fire might start, as affected by the nature and incidence of causative agents. In the ‘fire ’ rubric, the term “fire risk ” refers exclusively to the probability of a fire ignition. However, there are also dozens, if not hundreds, of other risks associated with fire for which assessments and management strategies might be applied. These risks incorporate not only the chance of fire, but also the expected value changes (damages), given a fire event (Hardy 2005). The technical risk management definition integrates both probability and <b>net</b> <b>value</b> <b>change.</b> Consistent use of this terminology is important in regards to the discussion of insect outbreaks and potential fire behavior.
