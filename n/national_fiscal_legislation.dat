40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interactions between}} multiple <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy- makers and a single monetary policy maker in response to shocks to govern- ment debt in {{some or all of}} the countries of a monetary union. We assume that national governments respond to excess debt in an optimal manner, but that they do not have access to a commitment technology. This implies that <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy gradually reduces debt: the lack of a commitment technology pre- cludes a random walk in steady state debt, but the need to maintain national competitiveness avoids excessively rapid debt reduction. If the central bank can commit, it adjusts its policies only slightly in response to higher debt, allowing <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy to undertake most of the adjustment. However if it cannot commit, then optimal monetary policy involves using interest rates to rapidly reduce debt, with significant welfare costs. We show that in these circumstances the central bank would do better to ignore <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies in formulating its policy. ...|$|R

This paper analyzes the stabilization of output fluctuations induced by symmetric and asymmetric macroeconomic shocks in the EMU. It is shown how <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> flexibility and flexibility of the monetary policy of the ECB can stabilize fluctuations of the average EU business cycle that are generated by symmetric shocks.

40|$|We {{assess the}} role of <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies, as {{automatic}} stabilizers, within a monetary union. We use a two-country New Keynesian DGE model which incorporates non-Ricardian consumers (as in Gal? et al. 2004) and a home bias {{in the composition of}} national consumption bundles. We find that fiscal policies stabilize the aggregate economy but, in some cases, generate conflicting views among national policymakers. Finally, model determinacy requires that <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> feedbacks on debt accumulation be designed with reference to the debt dynamics of the entire monetary union. This is in sharp contrast with the "Brussels consensus" based on the view that the ECB alone should stabilize the union-wide economy and <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies should react to idiosyncratic shocks and to national debt levels...|$|R

30|$|The main {{rationale}} {{for setting up}} such a stabilisation function for EMU is that sound fiscal policies {{at the national level}} can allow the automatic stabilisers to work more freely; however, these <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> stabilisers might not be sufficient to smooth the cycle within individual countries, maintain economic convergence and deliver the optimal fiscal stance for the euro area as a whole (Italianer & Pisani-Ferry 1994).

Moreover, the economic rationale for fiscal policy coordination (beyond the strict enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact – SGP) seems to be weak during normal times.

40|$|In this paper, {{we set out}} {{to examine}} an {{efficient}} fiscal policy framework for a monetary union. We find that a monetary union can survive with diverging fiscal policies and that the financial markets are efficient enough to separate between “good” and “bad” fiscal policies and punish the latter with higher costs of borrowing. Therefore, there is only limited spill over effect of “bad” fiscal policy within a monetary union if financial markets work efficiently. We argue, consequently, that fiscal rules in a monetary union are still important as they allow to overcome incentive incompatibility of <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> rules and as they may guide financial markets in assessing sustainability of <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies. Finally, we argue for adoption of an institutional rule, Fiscal Sustainability Council for enlarged European Union. The Council would periodically assess fiscal policies and set guidelines for annual deficits. We argue that {{in order to make the}} FSC relevant, governments would be obliged to deposit with the Council a substantial amount of bonds that would be regularly rolled over by the Council. By doing so, the Council would connect fiscal policy sustainability principle with financial markets and would guide financial markets evaluation of <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policies. fiscal policy; European Union; sustainability...|$|R

We use a microfounded New Keynesian model of a monetary union, which incorporates persistence in inflation and non-Ricardian consumers, and derive optimal simple rules for fiscal authorities. We find that fiscal policy {{can play an important}} role in reacting to inflation, output, and the terms of trade, but that not much is lost if <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy is restricted to react, on the one hand, to "national differences" in inflation and, on the other hand, to either national differences in output or changes in the terms of trade.

40|$|The {{strengthening}} of <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> frameworks, including numerical fiscal rules, {{has recently been}} proposed as {{an important part of}} the economic governance reform package for the EU. The strength of numerical fiscal rules can be described along the dimensions of their statutory base, the room to revise budgetary objectives, provisions for their monitoring and enforcement, and their media visibility. With a unique data set summarizing the quality of <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> rules along these dimensions, we show that stronger fiscal rules in euro area member states reduce sovereign risk. According to our estimates, yield spreads against Germany of countries with relatively weak fiscal rules could be up to 100 basis points lower if they upgraded their numerical fiscal rules. The legal base turns out to be the most important dimension for the perceived effectiveness of the rules. The effectiveness of the correction and enforcement mechanisms turns out to be very important as well, while the role of the bodies in charge of monitoring and enforcing compliance is somewhat smaller. Overall, <b>national</b> <b>fiscal</b> rules are found to be beneficial for market assessments of governments' ability and willingness to timely service debt: they could thus provide an effective way to implement fiscal discipline. ...|$|R
