The results suggest that increased uncertainty is associated with a deviation of the federal funds rate from the FOMC’s target rate, the magnitude depending on the severity of the difficulty, the payment volume of the affected participant, and the time of day. Moreover, discount window borrowing picks up on days with operational difficulties.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} rainy <b>day</b> <b>funds</b> on state savings behavior. We find that states with rainy <b>day</b> <b>funds</b> have higher total balances than states without such funds and also have higher balances after adoption than before adoption. Furthermore, rainy <b>day</b> <b>fund</b> deposits increase total balances dollar-for-dollar. While we cannot rule out that states planning future savings may adopt rainy <b>day</b> <b>funds,</b> our findings are robust to the inclusion of measures of savings preferences. In sum, these funds appear {{to belong to the}} growing set of fiscal institutions with real fiscal and economic consequences. 1 Introduction During the last two decades, virtually all of the U. S. states have adopted budget stabilization funds, often called "rainy <b>day</b> <b>funds,</b> " that allow them to save for unexpected revenue shortfalls. Prior to 1981, few states had such funds (Gold, 1981). By 1984, 18 states had enacted rainy <b>day</b> <b>funds,</b> and by 1994, 45 states had them (ACIR, 1995). These accounts are designed to help state governments stabilize public spending over time by saving during booms and using the balances to cover revenue shortfalls during recessions. In 1996, rainy day fun...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} provides {{three distinct}} perspectives on state rainy <b>day</b> <b>funds.</b> The first empirical chapter explores {{the factors that}} influence a state to access their rainy <b>day</b> <b>fund,</b> and a variety of economic, institutional, and political factors to be important. The influence and effects of these factors, however, are contextual, and vary depending on the economic environment and political control. The most important influences on accessing the rainy <b>day</b> <b>fund,</b> however, are economic indicators that are in line with the purpose of state rainy <b>day</b> <b>funds.</b> The second empirical chapter investigates the influence of state rainy <b>day</b> <b>fund</b> deposit and withdrawal rules on where lawmakers place savings. The findings reveal that when states have strict rule configurations that limit legislative discretion, lawmakers avoid placing savings in the formal rainy <b>day</b> <b>funds</b> and opt for informal savings that allow for easier access. The final empirical chapter examines if states save enough to handle their unique economic environments. This chapter replicates Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) study with longitudinal data {{to gain a better understanding}} of state savings behavior and economic environments. Additionally, this chapter posits that informal and formal rainy <b>day</b> <b>fund</b> savings are closely linked, and, therefore, scholars need to consider both accounts when determining if states save enough their unique economic environment. Results indicate that under a broader view of state savings behavior and volatility, states are in a much better position than Joyce originally reported. What is more, when we consider both formal and informal savings, states are in a very good position to handle average volatility...|$|R
