We examined whether specific skills—visual word recognition, receptive vocabulary, phonological awareness, phonological memory, and speech discrimination—in the 1 st and 2 <b>nd</b> <b>languages</b> have distinct or overlapping genetic and environmental origins. A sample of 279 Chinese twin pairs {{with a mean age}} of 6 years was tested. Univariate twin analyses were used to identify sources of individual variations in reading abilities and related cognitive– linguistic skills in Chinese and English, respectively. They were used to show both similar and distinctive patterns in these skills across Chinese and English. Bivariate Cholesky decomposition analyses indicated genetic overlaps between all parallel Chinese and English variables, as well as shared environmental overlaps in receptive vocabulary and phonological awareness. The phenotypic correlations between 1 st and 2 <b>nd</b> <b>language</b> skills previously observed in cross-linguistic studies could be explained by the shared genetic and environmental influences found in this twin study...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{evaluated}} a {{newly developed}} quasi-universal nonword repetition task (Q-U NWRT) as a diagnostic tool for bilingual children with language impairment (LI) who have Dutch as a 2 <b>nd</b> <b>language.</b> The Q-U NWRT {{was designed to}} be minimally influenced by knowledge of 1 specific language in contrast to a language-specific NWRT with which it was compared. METHOD: One hundred twenty monolingual and bilingual children with and without LI participated (30 per group). A mixed-design analysis of variance was used to investigate the effects of LI and bilingualism on the NWRTs. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to evaluate the instruments' diagnostic value. RESULTS: Large negative effects of LI were found on both NWRTs, whereas negative effects of bilingualism only occurred on the language-specific NWRT. Both instruments had high clinical accuracy in the monolingual group, but only the Q-U NWRT had high clinical accuracy in the bilingual group. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the Q-U NWRT is a promising diagnostic tool to help identify LI in bilingual children learning Dutch as a 2 <b>nd</b> <b>language.</b> The instrument was clinically accurate in both a monolingual and bilingual group of children and seems better able to disentangle LI from language disadvantage than more language-specific measures...|$|R

Results from 3 age groups of Chinese-English bilingual children showed that speech perception was more predictive of reading and vocabulary in the L 1 than L 2. While morphological awareness uniquely predicted reading and vocabulary in both languages, phonological awareness played such a role after we controlled for morphological awareness only in the L 2, which was alphabetic. L 1 speech perception and metalinguistic awareness predicted L 2 word reading but not vocabulary, after we controlled for the corresponding L 2 variables.

Even more challenging is the tension between regional and “world ” languages – that economic opportunities are often closed to those who are literate only in a regional language. India for instance is a country with 22 regional and two “national languages ” Hindi and English. But for most practical purposes, English is the language of economic opportunity. It is the language of instruction in private schools and all universities, a large fraction of business and government, and the language which is driving India’s service economy – the fastest growing in the world. Fluency in English can almost be equated with membership in the middle and upper classes [6]. The value of English is widely recognized by ordinary Indians [15], and it is the poorest citizens who are lobbying most strongly to expand English teaching. A recent article states that mastery of English is the “single most influential factor that determines access to elite educational institutions, and hence to important avenues of economic and social advancement ” [9].

40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU vir CHO, 1988 MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY: In a young growing country {{such as the}} Republic {{of south}} Africa {{there is a growing}} need for higher productivity. The gifted person does not always perform {{according}} to his abilities, because he is not identified at an early age and is therefore not completely understood. Previously, gifted persons were only identified by their mental abilities, whereas it is known that there are more factors involved, such as personality, interests, study methods and attitudes. etc. Psychological aspects that {{play an important role in}} the better understanding of the gifted person are the following :- - academic performance, - influence of the gifted person on the family, - the influence of inheritance and environment on giftedness, - education of the gifted, - sex differences with the gifted. AIM OF THE RESEARCH: The general aim of this study was to compare the gifted and average groups of students according to their abilities, scholastic achievement, interests, personalities and study-orientation. This was done through the following specific aims to determine if:- i) the gifted and average groups (both sexes included) differed in their profiles of the cognitive variables (SAT and standard ten results). ii) the mean profiles of the gifted and average groups (both sexes included) comparing non-cognitive variables (19 FII, PHSF, SSHA), differed. iii) the mean profiles of the gifted male and average male groups comparing the cognitive variables differed. iv) the mean profiles of the gifted male and average male groups comparing the non-cognitive variables proved to be significantly different. v) the mean profiles of the gifted female and average female groups comparing cognitive variables were significantly different. vi) the mean profiles of the gifted female and average female groups comparing non-cognitive variables were different. The second aim of this study was to determine by t-tests whether there is a statistically meaningful difference between the different groups on the various fields or components of the psychometric instruments. METHOD OF INVESTIGATION: In the first place, a study of the relevant literature was undertaken, concerning the concepts of average, gifted, interest, aptitude, personality and study methods and attitudes. The psychometric instruments used in this research are discussed thoroughly according to their development, contents, reliability and validity. The sample used in this research consisted of one hundred and forty average students (seventy male and seventy female) and seventy gifted students (thirty five male and thirty five female) which were selected after the 1984 mass testing of first year students of the PU for CHE. Statistical operations were done for these groups with the aid of a computer. This work included the drawing-up of mean profiles on each variable (cognitive and non-cognitive) for each group (i. e. the gifted and average groups, the gifted and average male groups; and the gifted and average female groups) as well as the statistical comparison of these profiles with each other. In the second place t-tests were completed to detect differences between these groups on different fields of interest, personality, abilities, etc. CONCLUSIONS With regard to the first aim of this study, the following can be concluded: i) The gifted and average groups' mean cognitive profiles (both sexes included) were not parallel. ii) The gifted and average groups' mean non-cognitive profiles were not parallel. iii) The gifted and average male groups' mean cognitive profiles were not parallel. iv) The gifted and average male groups' mean non-cognitive profiles were parallel. v) The gifted and average female groups' mean cognitive profile were not parallel. vi) The gifted and average female groups' mean non-cognitive profile were not parallel. With regard to the t-tests, the following can be concluded:- The gifted group (both sexes included) showed statistically better performance on the following fields or components compared to the average group. a) Subjects: Afrikaans (1 st <b>language),</b> English (2 <b>nd</b> <b>language),</b> German higher grade, Latin higher grade, Mathematics higher grade, Science higher grade, Biology higher grade, History higher grade, Geography higher grade & standard grade, Accountancy higher grade & standard grade, Domestic Science higher grade and standard grade, Wood & Metal work standard grade, Technical Drawings higher grade and Typing standard grade. b) Interests (19 FII) :- Fine Arts, Performing Arts, Creative Thought and Numerical. c) Personality: (PHSF) :- Desirability scale. d) Study Methods and attitudes (SSHA) - The average students (both sexes included) showed a statistically higher performance on clerical interest and sociability (Groups). The gifted male group performed statistically better on the following fields:- a) Subjects:- Afrikaans (1 st <b>language),</b> English (2 <b>nd</b> <b>language),</b> Latin higher grade, Mathematics higher grade, Science higher & standard grade, Accountancy higher grade, Technical Drawings higher grade and Wood & Metal work standard grade. b) Interests:- Creative thought. c) Personality:- Desirability Scale. - The average male students performed higher on the following:- a) Interests:- Clerical b) Personality:- Sociability (G) The gifted female group showed the following statistically higher performances:- a) Subjects:- Afrikaans (1 st <b>language),</b> English (2 <b>nd</b> <b>language),</b> German higher grade, Mathematics higher grade, Science higher grade, History higher grade, Geography higher grade. Accountancy higher and standard grade. Biology higher grade, Domestic Science standard grade and Typing standard grade. b) Interests:- Fine arts, Creative Thought, Practical - Male, and Numerical. c) Personality:- None. It was also found that the gifted group as a whole, as well as the gifted female group, tend to be more actively inclined towards interests. RECOMMENDATIONS The results of this study show that the gifted student does differ in many ways from the average student. There is thus a need for early identification of the gifted person so that he could be understood and so that there could be catered for this student at school level. The following recommendations can be made in connection with future research studies:- a) More meaningful findings may be gathered on the personality of the average student by including a second personality questionnaire such as the Jung Personality Questionnaire. The results of this questionnaire could lead to better understanding of the PHSF results of this study. b) More instruments can be used to evaluate study orientation, such as personal questionnaires and interviews. c) It is also recommended that the size of the groups be increased in order to increase the reliability of such findings.

40|$|When {{motivation}} {{has been}} discussed in relation to autonomy in language learning, {{it has often been}} put forward as a product of autonomy. This paper suggests a more complex relationship in which motivation in many cases precedes autonomy. It discusses some of the relevant literature and presents results from a large-scale study of Hong Kong tertiary students. The study aimed to assess students’ readiness for learner autonomy in language learning by examining their views of their responsibilities and those of their teachers’, their {{confidence in their ability to}} operate autonomously and their assessment of their level of motivation to learn English. It also investigated their actual practice of autonomous learning in the form of both outside and inside class activities. Results indicated that motivation played a key role in this readiness, and this led the authors to look at the relationship between autonomy and motivation as revealed in the study and in the literature. The findings lead the authors to conclude that motivation is a key factor that influences the extent to which learners are ready to learn autonomously, and that teachers might therefore endeavour to ensure motivation before they train students to become autonomous.
