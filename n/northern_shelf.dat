Geochronological scale of the core is established using the acceleration mass-spectrometry method for radiocarbon dating of benthic Foraminifera tests. The first insignificant warming in the northern part of the sea after glaciation occurred in the mid-Boreal time (9. 6 ka ago) but not at the onset of the Holocene.

40|$|San Nicolas Island is an anticline, {{modified}} by folding, faulting and marine terrace cutting. Terracing {{is believed to}} have taken place during the Pleistocene. Total submergence of the island is considered probable. Wave erosion along the present coastline has developed a series of sandy pocket beaches separated by rocky promontories. East flowing longshore currents, particularly along the northern coast, have deposited a large, pointed sand spit at the southeastern end of the island. The shape of the spit was found to have changed considerably during historic time. The shelf north of the island is broad and flat and is mostly rocky, being covered locally with patches of shelly sand and gravel. This <b>northern</b> <b>shelf</b> is very similar in character to the shelf north of Santa Catalina Island, although the San Nicolas shelf is larger. The shelf south of San Nicolas is narrow and sloping and is covered for the most part by terrigenous sand and sandy mud.

40|$|Lithofacies {{distribution}} {{indicates that}} the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation of England and South Wales was desposited on a shelf which was flat and gently subsiding in the north, but topographically variable in the south. Limestone deposition in the north began with 12 m of alga-rich limestone, which formed an upward shoaling sequence. Deepening then led to deposition of calcareous silty mudstones on the <b>northern</b> <b>shelf.</b> The remainder of the formation in this area formed during a shelf-wide regression, culminating {{in the production of}} an E to W younging sandbody. Lithofacies distribution on the southern shelf was primarily controlled by local subsidence. Six bedded lithofacies are recognised which contain 14 brachiopod/bryozoan dominated assemblages, of which 11 are in situ and three consist of reworked fossils. Microfacies analysis is necessary to distinguish assemblages which reflect original communities from those which reflect sedimentary processes. Turbulence, substrate-type, ease of feeding and other organisms in the environment controlled faunal distribution. Reefs were built dominantly by corals, stromatoporoids, algae and crinoids. Coral/stromatoporoid (Type A) reefs are common, particularly on the <b>northern</b> <b>shelf,</b> where they formed in response to shallowing, ultimately growing in front of the advancing carbonate sandbody. Algae dominate Type B and Type C reefs, reflecting growth in areas of poor water circulation. Lithification of the formation began in the marine-phreatic environment with precipitation of aragonite and high Mg calcite, which was subsequently altered to turbid low Mg calcite. Younger clear spars post-date secondary void formation. The pre-compactional clear spars have features which resemble the products of meteoric water diagenesis, but freshwater did not enter the formation at this time. The pre-compactional spars were precipitated by waters forced from the surrounding silty mudstones at shallow burial depths. Late diagenetic products are stylolites, compaction fractures and burial cements...|$|E

40|$|Velocity {{time series}} {{are used to}} study cross-shelf {{circulation}} on the <b>northern</b> California <b>shelf</b> and to examine classical ideas of locally wind-forced cross-shelf circulation. A simple linear two-dimensional model of cross-shelf transport is compared to estimates of cross-shelf transport in the near surface, interior, and near bottom. In winter, when wind forcing is brief and episodic, model transports are highly correlated to the total surface flow and show some skill in predicting subsurface cross-shelf flow. The same model does not work well below the surface in summer when persistent upwelling is observed. This suggests a two-dimensional wind-forced model of cross-shelf circulation may have more applicability to the brief wind events observed in winter than to the persistent wind events observed in summer. The {{reason for this is}} unclear. Numerous factors not included in the simple linear wind-forced model such as mesoscale features, upwelling fronts, the interaction of flow with topography, baroclinic pressure gradients, remote forcing, and small-scale wind stress all affect cross-shelf circulation.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of dissolved Si and its isotope composition are {{measured in the}} Bay of Bengal (BoB) region of the northern Indian Ocean; the isotope data are the first data set from the northern Indian Ocean. The measurements are made in eight depth profiles closely along the 87 degrees E transect (GIO 1 section of the international GEOTRACES program) {{and in a few}} samples from the <b>northern</b> <b>shelf</b> of the bay. Dissolved Si in the water column varies from similar to 0. 6 to similar to 152. 5 mu mol/kg, whereas the delta Si- 30 data cover a range + 1. 2 parts per thousand to + 3. 6 parts per thousand. The depth profiles of dissolved Si show generally lower values in the surface increasing with depth, whereas the pattern reverses in the case of delta Si- 30. These vertical distribution patterns of Si and d 30 Si are similar to those reported in other oceanic regions and suggestive of the significant role of biological processes in governing Si biogeochemistry in the upper layers (top similar to 1500 m). In contrast, dissolved Si in near surface waters of the <b>northern</b> <b>shelf</b> and the southernmost station is exceptionally high. These results indicate a continental supply of dissolved Si from the Ganga-Brahmaputra river system (G-B) and submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to the shelf region, and an intrusion of high salinity waters from the Arabian Sea in the southern bay. The delta Si- 30 values of similar to 1. 34 +/- 0. 10 parts per thousand for deep/bottom waters of the BoB (depth > 1500 m) are similar to those reported for the deep Southern Ocean and indicate the dominant control of water mass mixing. The dissolved Si concentrations in the bottom waters of the BoB are generally higher than those of the water mass endmembers, which suggest the need for an additional source of Si; in situ particle dissolution and/or benthic release in the central bay seem to be the potential candidate. The annual Si budget in the top similar to 100 m of the BoB seems to suggest that meso-scale eddies frequently occurring during non-monsoon periods can supply at the most similar to 2. 6 g Si/m(2) /year, which is about 33 % of the Si requirement to support new production in the bay. The supply of dissolved Si (similar to 1. 3 +/- 0. 5 x 10 (11) mol/year) from the G-B river system and SGD has been calculated based on the distributions of dissolved Si concentration and delta Si- 30 in the <b>northern</b> <b>shelf</b> waters. A comparison of this supply with the reported Si flux upstream of the estuarine zone indicates about 40 % removal of dissolved Si in the G-B estuary. The mass balance of Si isotopes in the deep waters indicates that the dissolution of diatoms is the main cause of excess Si in the bay. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This paper develops depositional sequences of the carbonate ramp and the carbonate shelf models for an idealized cycle and multiple cycles of depositions. Based on the developed depositional sequences, the integrated recovery efficiency forecast models of primary, initial waterflood and infill drilling are developed for the San Andres and Clearfork reservoirs in Central Basin Platform and the <b>Northern</b> <b>Shelf,</b> west Texas. The geological parameters and well spacing are considered major factors for controlling recovery efficiencies. The depositional environment and diagenesis are controlling geological factors affecting oil recovery efficiencies. The depositional sequences characterize the vertical and lateral variations of depositional-energy environments in development of the carbonate ramp and the carbonate shelf The depositional-energy environment controls the depositional rock's facies. The well-sorted and large-size grainstones are related to the higher depositional-energy environment. The poorly-sorted and small-size rocks are related to the lower depositional-energy environment. The depositions of the San Andres and Clearfork formation in the Central Basin Platform, separately, follow the prograding-ramp sequences of one major cycle with multiple subcycles. The lumping depositional energy increases from the inner platform to the platform boundary. Similarly, the depositions of San Andres and Clearfork formation in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Shelf</b> also follow one major prograding cycle with multiple subcycles, separately. However, the lumping depositional energy, decreases from the inner platform to the platform boundary. A normalized depositional energy index is defined based on the depositional sequences of the ramp and shelf models. Normalization is also used to define a porosity index and a well spacing index. Linear and exponential regressions on a database are conducted to develop recovery efficiency forecast models which include depositional energy, porosity and well spacing indices. Section 17, Dollarhide Clearfork Unit is used as an example to show the applications of the recovery efficiency forecast models...|$|E

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. One way to {{evaluate}} the bio-economic performance of fisheries is to base the decision to harvest on {{whether there is a}} benefit from leaving particular sizes of fish to reproduce or sell them today at market price. This takes into account both size-dependent fecundity and size-dependent pricing, two commonly overlooked features in bio-economic stock assessments. Here, this construct was applied in a bio-economic model that simulated the <b>Northern</b> <b>Shelf</b> Melanogrammus aeglefinus fishery and was evaluated against different age-at-first-capture selectivity policies under two individual growth types. The first growth type was the individual growth type seen in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Shelf</b> stock based on 2014 data and the second was a theoretical, linear growth type, which was designed to simulate a stock which contains larger, mature haddock. Furthermore, parameters from growth types corresponding to the historical cohorts from the years 1970 - 2006 were used to assess the economic consequences of changes in growth types throughout time. It was found that the construct which compared reproductive values against market values was not significantly worse than any of the age-at-first-capture, and therefore more practical, fishing approaches simulated, for both individual growth types. The construct also consistently produced some of the highest profit estimations for the fishery. Hence the construct is a resilient theoretical fishing strategy and movement towards this type of fishing should be encouraged. The fishery may also have experienced economic losses in performance attributable to changes in individual growth types seen over time, commonly referred to as the shrinking of larger haddock...|$|E

Consistent with the otolith chemistry, simulations of the large-scale circulation predicted that particles released at depths of 100 – 300 m on the Antarctic Peninsula shelf during spring, corresponding to hatching of icefish larvae from benthic nests, are transported in the southern ACC, missing South Georgia but following trajectories along the southern Scotia Ridge instead.

40|$|SUMMARY: A {{sequence}} of Palaeocene basalts and late Pataeocene-early Eocene tuffaceous sandstones has been recovered from three boreholes on the <b>northern</b> Hebrides <b>Shelf</b> and Wyville-Thomson Ridge. The basalts, cored in boreholes 85 / 5 B and 85 / 7 on the <b>northern</b> Hebrides <b>Shelf,</b> can be seismically {{correlated with the}} extensive N Atlantic lava sequence. The basalt in 85 / 5 B displays major element chemistry typical of alkali-basalts but trace and rare-earth element (REE) patterns are typical of olivine-tholeiites. In contrast, the basalt in 85 / 7 displays geochemical characteristics typical of a de leted tholeiite. Despite their different compositions, the basalts have similar ratios of the highly incompatible elements La and Ta which may reflect different degrees of partial melting of similar source material. The tuffaceous sandstones, cored in b hole 85 / 2 B on the Wyvitle-Thomson Ridge, were deposited in a warm, shallow marine environment contemporaneous with the reworking of nearby basaltic terrains. Nummulites rockallensis Hinte & Wong occurs abundantly throughout the sandstones; its only previous known occurrence is from lat st Palaeocene [...] earliest Eocene sediments at DSDP Site 117 A on Rockall Bank.

40|$|On the Vietnam Shelf {{more than}} 1000 miles of shallow {{high-resolution}} seismics were analyzed to unravel post-glacial evolution in a tropical, siliciclastic environment together with 25 sediment cores from water depths between 21 and 169 m to determine stratigraphy, distribution {{and style of}} sedimentation. Fourty-seven samples were dated with the AMS- 14 C technique. The shelf was grouped into three regions: a southern part, a central part, and a northern part. On the broad Southern Shelf, sedimentation {{is influenced by the}} Mekong River, which drains into the SCS in this area. Here, incised valley fills are abundant that were cut into the late Pleistocene land surface by the Paleo-Mekong River during times of sea level lowstand. Those valleys are filled with transgressive deposits. The Holocene sedimentation rate in this low gradient accommodation-dominated depositional system is in the range of 5 - 10 and 25 - 40 cm/ky at locations sheltered from currents. The Central Shelf is narrow and the sedimentary strata are conformable. Here, numerous small mountainous rivers reach the SCS and transport large amounts of detrital sediment onto the shelf. Therefore, the Holocene sedimentation rate is high with values of 50 - 100 cm/ky in this supply-dominated depositional system. The broad <b>Northern</b> <b>Shelf</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} Red River Delta shows, as on the Southern Shelf, incised valleys cut into the Pleistocene land surface by paleo river channels. In this accommodation-dominated shelf area, the sedimentation rate is low with values of 5 - 10 cm/ky. Where applicable, we assigned the sampled deposits to different paleo-facies. The latter are related to certain intervals of water depths at their time of deposition. Comparison with the sea-level curve of (Hanebuth et al., 2000, doi: 10. 1126 /science. 288. 5468. 1033) indicates subsidence on the Central Shelf, which is in agreement with the high sedimentation rates in this area.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 The uptake of {{anthropogenic}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO₂) has caused perturbations to marine biogeochemistry in recent years, including decreasing ocean pH and carbonate mineral saturation states (Ω). Collectively termed ocean acidification (OA), these conditions hinder {{the growth of}} calcium carbonate shells and effectively reduce habitat for some marine calcifiers. Given that the Bering Sea {{is one of the}} world's most productive marine ecosystems and supports both commercial fishing industries and subsistence communities, it is integral to understand its susceptibility to OA. Here, new observations of the organic and inorganic carbon systems are used to identify mechanisms leading to CO₂ accumulation and sub-regional enhancement of vulnerability to OA processes. Chapter 1 describes the state of knowledge of OA in this area, highlighting two regions where low Ω conditions are consistently observed: near the coast, and over the <b>northern</b> <b>shelf.</b> Chapter 2 describes net heterotrophic processes near the coast, in conjunction with low bottom water Ω. Chapter 3 examines this heterotrophy in more detail, showing that focused deposition of organic matter and its subsequent respiration. Chapters 4 and 5 focus on very low Ω values observed over the <b>northern</b> <b>shelf.</b> In combination with natural respiration processes, anthropogenic CO₂ was shown to cause low Ω and seasonal dissolution of carbonate minerals in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 illustrates how sea ice cover inhibits the flux of CO₂ from the surface ocean to the atmosphere, which raises the inventory of CO₂ in the water column. These results are synthesized in Chapter 6. Low-Ω conditions and areas of carbonate mineral dissolution will continue to expand as anthropogenic CO₂ accumulates in shelf waters in the coming decades, further reducing viable habitat for key calcifiers. Model projections of future surface water conditions indicate that average Ω over the Bering Sea shelf will drop below the observed natural variability by 2100, with average conditions favoring carbonate mineral dissolution in surface waters by 2150. Presently, episodic events will cause regions of the Bering Sea to be undersaturated in Ω, which could have significant and cascading impacts throughout the Pacific-Arctic region...|$|E

This study investigates the feasibility of using geostatistics for data collected according to traditional methods and of enhancing such methodology. The experimental variograms were calculated (pooled variance minus spatial covariance between samples taken one pair at a time vs. distance) and fitted to a ' spherical ' model. The spatial structure model {{was used to}} estimate the abundance and distribution of the populations studied using the technique of kriging. The species display spatial structures, which are well marked during high density periods and in some areas (especially <b>northern</b> <b>shelf).</b> Geostatistical analysis allows identification of the density gradients in space {{as well as the}} patch grain along the continental shelf of 16 - 25 km diameter for M. intermedia and 12 - 20 km for M. sarsi. Patches of both species have a consistent location throughou...|$|E
40|$|The fishery for Illex argentinus in the Southwest Atlantic {{is subject}} to large inter-annual {{variability}} in recruitment strength. In this paper we attempt to build a predictive model using sea surface temperature (SST) to examine links between recruitment to the Falkland Islands fishery and environmental variability during the juvenile and adult life history stages. SST data from the National center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) {{were found to be}} comparable with near-surface data derived from in situ expendable bathy-thermograph (XBT) profiles in the southern Patagonian shelf. Variation in SST during the early life stages appears to be important in determining recruitment of I. argentin us. SST in the hatching grounds of the <b>northern</b> Patagonian <b>shelf</b> during the period of hatching (particularly June and July) was negatively correlated with catches in the fishery in the following season. SST anomaly data from positions in the Pacific and Southwest Atlantic were used to examine teleconnections between these areas. Links were seen at a lag of 2 yr between the Pacific and southern Patagonian shelf, and at about 5 yr between the Pacific and <b>northern</b> Patagonian <b>shelf.</b> This is consistent with SST anomalies associated with El Niilo in the Pacific propagating around the globe via the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave (ACW). Predicting cold events via teleconnections between SST anomalies in the Pacific and Atlantic would appear to have the potential to predict the recruitment strength of I. argentinus in the Southwest Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Stations in {{a survey}} of benthic {{invertebrates}} on the Canadian continental shelf and slope of southeastern Baffin Island, in Ungava Bay, and on the <b>northern</b> Labrador <b>Shelf,</b> fell into definite groups {{as a result of an}} objective analysis of similarity in species composition. The groupings were shown to correspond to major water masses in the area. Groups corresponding to cold surface water masses, to the deep Irminger Atlantic water mass, and to mixtures of these with adjacent water masses were observed. The Irminger Atlantic group dominated on the Baffin Island continental shelf. Species diversity, also measured in the study, was high, with large numbers of species present in low abundance...|$|R
40|$|In the Southern Ocean white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis {{form the}} {{majority}} of the bird bycatch in longline fisheries. Satellite tracking of breeding birds from the Crozet islands and from South Georgia indicates that during incubation they have the longest mean foraging ranges ever recorded for a seabird, 2390 and 2190 km. Crozet birds travel to the coast of South Africa at 3495 km, into subtropical waters as well as to Antarctic waters. South Georgia birds reach the <b>northern</b> Patagonian <b>shelf.</b> In all these areas birds are potentially in contact with fisheries. These results indicate that conservation measures limited to Antarctic waters are insufficient to protect seabirds with such extensive foraging ranges...|$|R
