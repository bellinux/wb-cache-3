50|$|Nisenblat et al. proposes {{the idea}} of power quality {{compression}} algorithm (similar to lossy compression methods) that enables meters to continuously store the waveform {{of one or more}} power signals, regardless whether or not an event of interest was identified. This algorithm referred to as PQZip empowers a processor with a memory that is sufficient to store the waveform, under <b>normal</b> <b>power</b> <b>conditions,</b> {{over a long period of}} time, of at least a month, two months or even a year. The compression is performed in real time, as the signals are acquired; it calculates a compression decision before all the compressed data is received. For instance should one parameter remain constant, and various others fluctuate, the compression decision retains only what is relevant from the constant data, and retains all the fluctuation data. It then decomposes the waveform of the power signal of numerous components, over various periods of the waveform. It concludes the process by compressing the values of at least some of these components over different periods, separately. This real time compression algorithm, performed independent of the sampling, prevents data gaps and has a typical 1000:1 compression ratio.|$|R
40|$|Acute {{toxicity}} of chloroform to four species {{of freshwater fish}} was studied in flow-through 96 -hr toxicity tests. Chloroform is toxic to fish {{in the tens of}} parts per million, a concentration well above that which would be expected to be produced under <b>normal</b> <b>power</b> plant chlorination <b>conditions.</b> Investigations of acute {{toxicity of}} chloroform and the bioaccumulation of chlorinated compounds in tissues of fish revealed differences in tolerance levels and tissue accumulations. Mean 96 -hr LC{sub 50 }s for chloroform were 18 ppm for rainbow trout and bluegill, 51 ppm for largemouth bass and 75 ppm for channel catfish. Mortalities of bluegill and largemouth bass occurred during the first 4 hr of exposure while rainbow trout and channel catfish showed initial tolerance and mortalities occurred during {{the latter half of the}} 96 -hr exposure. Rainbow trout had the highest level of chloroform tissue accumulation, 7 {micro}g/g tissue, catfish the second highest, 4 {micro}g/g tissue, followed by bluegill and largemouth bass which each accumulated about 3 {micro}g/g tissue. Accumulation of chloroform was less than one order of magnitude above water concentrations for all species...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{investigation was}} made on a Holley 1685 -HB carburetor mounted on an R- 2600 - 13 supercharger assembly to determine the icing characteristics and the heated-air de-icing requirements of {{this portion of the}} B- 25 D airplane induction system. Icing {{has been found to be}} most prevalent at relatively small throttle openings and, consequently, all runs were made at simulated 60 -percent <b>normal</b> rated <b>power</b> <b>condition.</b> Icing characteristics were determined during a series of 15 -minute runs over a range of inlet-air conditions. For the de-icing investigation severe impact ice was allowed to form in the induction system and the time required for the recovery of 95 percent of the maximum possible air flow at the original throttle setting was then determined for a range of wet-bulb temperatures. Results of these runs showed that ice on the walls of the carburetor adapter and on the rim of the impeller-shroud portion of the supercharger diffuser plate did not affect engine operation at 60 -percent <b>normal</b> rated <b>power.</b> Ice that adversely affected the air flow and the fuel-air ratio was formed only on the central web of the carburetor and then only when the inlet air was saturated or contained free moisture in excess of saturation. No serious ice formations were observed at inlet-air temperatures above 66 0 F or with an inlet-air enthalpy greater than 34 Btu per pound. The maximum temperature at. which any trace of icing could be detected was 1110 F with a relative humidity of approximately 28 percent, The air-flow recovery time for emergency de-icing was 0. 3 minute for. an enthalpy of 35 Btu per pound or wet-bulb temperature of 68 0 F. Further increase in enthalpy and wet-bulb temperature above these values resulted in very slight improvement in recovery time. The fuel-air ratio restored by a 5 -Minute application of heated air was approximately 7 percent less than the initial value for cold-air conditions...|$|R

40|$|Polymeric self-resettable circuit {{protection}} devices have been manufactured {{for many years}} with an extrusion based process. These devices add negligible resistance to a circuit at <b>normal</b> <b>power</b> operating <b>conditions</b> but increases in resistance by several orders of magnitude at a pre-determined level of power {{in order to protect}} the circuit from over- current or over-voltage conditions. After the electrical surge stops, and power returns to a normal level, the resistance of the device drops, and the circuit may resume its normal operation. These devices are used in computers, cell-phones, and other consumer and industrial electronic devices where normal fuses are not convenient or practical. The current manufacturing process extrudes long sheets of 2 -mm thick polymer lined with 0. 05 -mm thick foil on both sides. This foil-polymer-foil structure, called plaque, is punched into 13 mm x 8 mm x 2 mm rectangles, called chips. The chips undergo heat treatment and radioactive cross-linking steps before wire leads are soldered onto them for easy electrical connection to either test or circuit boards. Though effective, this process produces more waste and remains less flexible than an injection-compression (IC) molding process. With this new process, devices are made individually in a multi- cavity mold, skipping the punching and soldering steps. This thesis explores IC molding and its benefits and drawbacks for manufacturing {{circuit protection}} devices. IC molded devices were manufactured, tested, and compared to standard devices, produced by the extrusion process, in the areas of physical and electrical performance. (cont.) Budget considerations prevented the study of individually IC molded devices and instead a 150 mm x 75 mm mold cavity was used to create an IC molded plaque from which chips could be punched and wire leads attached. In this way, any electrical variations across the IC molded plaque, produced by flow or thermal properties of the new process, could be studied with electrical tests, and physical variations across the IC molded plaque could be examined with a peel test. Cycle life data and data comparing device resistance to device temperature show that the new manufacturing process has potential to create equal or better performing devices than the existing extrusion process. by Joseph T.

The boron-doped diamond film electrodes were characterised by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and both conventional and sonoelectrochemical methods. The one-electron reduction of Ru(NH 3) 3 + 6 was investigated in aqueous solutions under <b>normal</b> and <b>power</b> ultrasound <b>conditions.</b> Well-defined voltammetric responses were observed from which the standard rate constant for electron transfer, k 0 = 3 × 10 - 3 cm s- 1, was estimated ignoring the effect of surface roughness.

Although diamond is known to be exceptionally chemically inert, it was found that anodic polarisation of the boron-doped diamond electrode gave rise to changes in the surface properties. In order to rejuvenate the diamond electrode surface, a hydrogen plasma treatment was used. The two-electron reduction of dioxygen to give H 2 O 2 was studied in an aqueous 0. 1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 2). This process was found to be strongly affected by the state of the electrode surface with an increase in the observed current after negative polarisation. Voltammograms obtained under ultrasound conditions suggest that a potential pretreatment can switch the process from being nearly mass-transport controlled to one where mass transport effects are virtually absent...|$|R

40|$|The {{advancement}} {{of research and}} development for Electric Vehicle (EV) has pushed a similar advancement in the EV performance test and measurement. Traditionally, chassis dynamometer is used to measuring power delivered from Vehicle Under Test (VUT) typically by Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle which access power by unidirectional. This one-way power delivery becomes a limitation for advanced EV with the regenerative braking feature, which the kinetic power of the vehicles is converted into electrical power. To test and measure this capability, a new chassis dynamometer is needed where the power delivery must be bidirectional. With that intention, this study proposes the usage of half-bridge bidirectional DC–DC converter (HBDC) as the Power Absorption and Delivery Unit (PADU) for a DC machine based dynamometer. PADU is controlled by modified Hysteresis Current Controller (HCC) and PID controller. The modified HCC and PID control power flow direction; back and forth during testing. The testing includes normal condition and regenerative braking <b>condition.</b> In <b>normal</b> <b>condition,</b> <b>power</b> is delivered by the DC machine whereas in regenerative braking <b>condition,</b> <b>power</b> is absorbed by the DC machine. Several test cases are considered; inclination test, declination test, normal drive condition, brake condition and stop condition. It is found that the HBDC successfully control the power flow in both normal condition and regenerative braking condition. As compared to conventional HBDC, modified HBDC reduces conduction loss with up to 28. 21 % reduction and switching loss with up to 7. 69 % reduction. To evaluate the power flow control, several power measurement points are taken in the simulation and comprehensive results are presented. Based on these results, the testing for an EV during normal condition and regenerative braking condition is achieved by successfully implement bidirectional power flow control in chassis dynamometer...|$|R
