40|$|The writer {{believes}} that the experiments above recorded have demonstrated the following points: 1. As has been previously shown by other workers, complement is fixed by the precipitate formed in the reaction between unformed proteid and its homologous antiserum, {{and it is the}} precipitate only which fixes, the supernatant fluid being devoid of fixing power except to a slight degree in tubes very rich in antigen. This latter fixation is probably due to a redissolving of the precipitin-precipitinogen complex which, as Gay has shown, does not lose its fixing power on resolution. The fixation of complement by mixtures in which antigen is so slight in amount that <b>no</b> <b>precipitate</b> <b>is</b> <b>formed</b> may be explained by analogy with colloidal reactions in which combination of colloids takes place without precipitation unless definite quantitative relations are maintained. 2. In contrast to the results above described, precipitating mixtures of bacterial antigen and antiserum show complement fixation both by the precipitate and by the supernatant fluid. 3. The complement fixation by the supernatant fluid of such bacterial precipitin reactions, with the precipitate removed, is, in the presence of washed bacteria, equal to that exerted by the same amount of the original serum. The complement fixation of the precipitates, here, as in serum-antiserum tests, is proportionate to the bulk of the precipitate. 4. The precipitin body is not removed from a bacterial antiserum by treatment with washed whole bacteria, whereas the cell sensitizer or amboceptor is removed by such treatment. The writer {{believes that}} the work recorded above justifies Gengou's conclusion that an albuminolytic sensitizer is formed in response to immunization with unformed proteids. This sensitizer, or amboceptor, is, however, distinct and independent of the sensitizer that reacts specifically with either bacterial or other cells. It would appear that immunization with unformed proteids calls forth only the formation of these albuminolysins, while immunization with cells, in our case the typhoid bacillus, calls forth both the cytolytic and the albuminolytic sensitizers. The albuminolytic sensitizers are not carried down mechanically with the precipitates in the precipitin reactions. We see no reason for not considering them identical with the precipitins themselves, bodies which combine with the dissolved antigens and, as in other colloidal reactions, lead to precipitation when definite quantitative relations are observed. The undiminished precipitating value of a bacterial antiserum after considerable amounts of bacterial amboceptor have been absorbed out of it, would point against the identification of agglutinins with precipitins. However, this question must be subjected to further study. It is thus clear that only the cytolytic sensitizer can enter into combination with the washed bacterial cell, while it is probable that both cytolytic and albuminolytic sensitizer may combine with the dissolved ingredients of a bacterial filtrate. Whether or not they combine with the same constituent of such an antigen cannot be decided by our experiments...|$|E

In order to determine if microorganisms of the Geobacteraceae, the predominant dissimilatory metal reducers in many subsurface environments, were capable of reducing vanadium(V), Geobacter metallireducens was inoculated into a medium in which acetate was the electron donor and vanadium(V) was the sole electron acceptor. Reduction of vanadium(V) resulted in the production of vanadium(IV), which subsequently precipitated. Reduction of vanadium(V) was associated with cell growth with a generation time of 15 h. No vanadium(V) <b>was</b> reduced and <b>no</b> <b>precipitate</b> <b>was</b> <b>formed</b> in heat-killed or abiotic controls. Acetate was the most effective of all the electron donors evaluated. When acetate was injected into the subsurface to enhance the growth and activity of Geobacteraceae in an aquifer contaminated with uranium and vanadium, vanadium was removed from the groundwater even more effectively than uranium. These studies demonstrate that G. metallireducens can grow via vanadium(V) respiration and that stimulating the activity of Geobacteraceae, and hence vanadium(V) reduction, can be an effective strategy for in situ immobilization of vanadium in contaminated subsurface environments...|$|R

These observations indicate that diopside dissolution rates are unaffected by the simultaneous precipitation of calcite. Calcite likely forms a porous coating on diopside, which allows ions from the dissolving diopside to be transported readily to the bulk fluid.

40|$|In hydroponic plant {{nutritional}} research, nutrient solutions can {{be considered}} as aqueous solutions of inorganic ions. In this aqueous solution, the ions are submitted to the laws of aquatic inorganic chemistry. This means that the ions are involved in the dynamic equilibria between complexation, dissociation, and precipitation reactions. These chemical reactions seriously impact elemental speciation and bioavailability. As a result, plant roots experience a different nutritional composition. Ions withdrawn from the nutrient solution due to precipitation reactions, change the nutritional composition and are not available for uptake by plant roots. Like complexes, precipitates can buffer a nutrient solution, exchanging nutrients as these decrease by plant uptake. This research looks into the precipitation reactions that occur in hydroponic nutrient solutions. In the concentration range of nutrient solutions, <b>no</b> <b>precipitates</b> <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> involving potassium (K+), nitrate (NO 3 -), ammonium (NH 4 +), or sulphate (SO 42 -), while calcium (Ca 2 +) and magnesium (Mg 2 +) form mainly at a higher pH precipitates with hydrogen phosphate (HPO 42 -).
