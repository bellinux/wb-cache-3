They demand complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all orthodox Trotskyists out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.|$|E

By 1883, he was becoming known as the speaker of a liberal conservative faction of the National Liberal group. Kogălniceanu and his supporters criticized Rosetti and others who again pushed for universal (male) suffrage, and argued that Romania's fragile international standing did <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> electoral divisiveness.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least one partner must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E

These were his last matches in the tournament, as the rules did <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> professional cricketers (which he became when he signed for Nelson) to take part. In 1929 Constantine played one match in Jamaica for a West Indies team against an English touring team and then travelled to Nelson to begin his professional career.|$|E

Dalton advocated exercise for girls, including swimming and shooting.

She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did <b>not</b> <b>permit,</b> to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{surrender}} in November 1918, {{most of the}} battleships of the Atlantic Fleet {{were used}} as transports to ferry American soldiers back from France. Wisconsin and her sisters were not so employed, however, owing to their short range and small size, which would <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> sufficient additional accommodations. Wisconsin instead steamed to Cuba for training with the Atlantic Fleet into 1919. She went on a midshipmen training cruise to the Caribbean in mid-1919. On 15 May 1920, Wisconsin was decommissioned; she was reclassified as BB-9 on 17 July. She was eventually sold on 26 January 1922 and broken up for scrap.|$|E

The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone {{in relation to the}} Norwegian, caused Air Norway to lose NOK100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a PSO.

According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a {{freethinker}} who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government. She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did <b>not</b> <b>permit</b> this.|$|E
