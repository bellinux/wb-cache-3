Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible.

50|$|The genus Cathartes {{includes}} medium-sized {{to large}} carrion-feeding {{birds in the}} <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> (Cathartidae) family. The three species currently classified in this genus occur widely in the Americas.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{mistaken for}} a walking <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture,</b> Neocathartes is now {{classified}} as a bathornithid, a family of cariamaeans.

It was a flightless bird, much like other bathornithids, and most likely a terrestrial predator in the same vein as the related phorusrhacid birds.|$|R
5|$|The {{king vulture}} (Sarcoramphus papa) {{is a large}} bird found in Central and South America. It {{is a member of}} the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> family Cathartidae.

5|$|The {{king vulture}} has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures.</b> This bill has a hooked tip {{and a sharp}} cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red sclera. Unlike some <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures,</b> the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.|$|E
5|$|However, recent genetic {{studies have}} made it clear that neither New World nor Old World {{vultures}} are close to falcons, nor are <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> close to storks.|$|E
50|$|The {{black vulture}} (Coragyps atratus) {{also known as}} the American black vulture, is a bird in the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> family whose range extends from the southeastern United States to Central Chile and Uruguay in South America. Although a common and {{widespread}} species, it has a somewhat more restricted distribution than its compatriot, the turkey vulture, which breeds well into Canada and south to Tierra del Fuego. Despite the similar name and appearance, this species is unrelated to the Eurasian black vulture. The latter species is an Old <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> in the family Accipitridae (which includes eagles, hawks, kites and harriers), whereas the American species is a <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture.</b> It is the only extant member of the genus Coragyps, which is in the family Cathartidae. It inhabits relatively open areas which provide scattered forests or shrublands. With a wingspan of 1.5 m, the black vulture is a large bird though relatively small for a vulture. It has black plumage, a featherless, grayish-black head and neck, and a short, hooked beak.|$|R
5000|$|The {{generic name}} is {{composed}} of Cathartes, the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> genus and -saura, feminine declination of the Greek term sauros, [...] "lizard". It also implies the juxtaposition {{of the components of}} the scientific name of the turkey vulture, Cathartes aura, whose Spanish name, [...] "buitre", named the locality where the fossil was found due to the abundance of such birds there. The specific epithet honors the Argentinian adhesive company Anaeróbicos for providing field and laboratory support during the extraction and preparation of the fossils.|$|R
5|$|Large and {{predominantly}} white, {{the king}} vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail feathers. The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> species from a carcass. King vultures {{have been known to}} live for up to 30 years in captivity.|$|R
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{also has}} the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them evaporatively. This {{behavior}} is exhibited by storks and <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures.</b>|$|E
5|$|The taxonomic {{placement}} of the turkey vulture and the remaining six species of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> has been in flux. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. Some earlier authorities suggested that the <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> were more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintained their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.|$|E
5|$|Like all <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>{{vultures}},</b> {{it is not}} {{closely related}} to the Old World vultures of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The two groups strongly resemble each other because of convergent evolution; natural selection often leads to similar body plans in animals that adapt independently to the same conditions.|$|E
5|$|The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) is a <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture,</b> {{the largest}} North American land bird. This condor became extinct {{in the wild}} in 1987 (all {{remaining}} wild individuals were captured), but the species has been reintroduced to northern Arizona and southern Utah (including the Grand Canyon area and Zion National Park), the coastal mountains of central and southern California, and northern Baja California. Although other fossil members are known, {{it is the only}} surviving member of the genus Gymnogyps. The species is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN.|$|R
5|$|The {{black vulture}} also {{occasionally}} feeds on livestock or deer. It {{is the only}} species of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures to approach it. The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures. Black vultures have sometimes been seen to pick ticks off resting capybaras.|$|R
500|$|The Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) is a South American {{bird in the}} <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> family Cathartidae and is {{the only}} member of the genus Vultur. Found in the Andes {{mountains}} and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan. It has a maximum wingspan of [...] exceeded only by the wingspans of four seabirds and water birds—the roughly [...] maximum of the wandering albatross, southern royal albatross, great white pelican and Dalmatian pelican.|$|R
5|$|Like {{the turkey}} vulture, this vulture {{is often seen}} {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures,</b> Old World vultures, and storks.|$|E
5|$|Little {{can be said}} of the {{evolutionary}} history of the genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E
5|$|<b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> are not {{closely related}} to Old World vultures, but superficially {{resemble}} them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, <b>New</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E
