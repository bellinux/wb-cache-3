40|$|<b>Previous</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> {{is often}} seen as sign of poor {{entrepreneurial}} skills but few have examined whether renascent entrepreneurs actually perform worse or better upon reentering and how performance differences might be explained. Using a sample of 1, 745 Dutch SMEs firms of which 67 were managed by renascent entrepreneurs this study examines potential differences in performance between renascent and other firms and explores to what extent this {{can be attributed to}} effects of the bankruptcy involvement on embeddedness, innovativeness, ambition and financial discipline. Non-parametric and multiple mediation analyses were conducted to test a set of hypotheses. Renascent entrepreneurs were found to show better sales level and were more innovative but also indicate more negative growth rates. Further, they show less financial discipline, but do not differ in their overall embeddedness and ambition levels. These mixed findings suggest that <b>previous</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> involvement is not necessarily a clear admission of failure...|$|R
50|$|The line {{soon became}} the rural Wallkill Valley Branch of the West Shore Railroad, {{although}} the locals whose profits {{were wiped out}} during the <b>previous</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> didn't agree with this. An occasional scheme was hatched to extend it to the Pennsylvania coal mines to bring more money to the railroad, though it was never successful. The New York Central then bought the West Shore Railroad in 1884 when passenger service was slowly declining, as with most rural branches. Passenger service was completely abandoned in 1937.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We analyze {{trade credit}} {{in a sample}} of small distressed firms that are {{restructured}} under the Belgian procedure of court-supervised reorganization (Chapter 11 in the U. S). During the prebankruptcy period, firms rely on trade credit to finance a lack of internally generated cash. This is specifically true if banks contract their lending during the pre-bankruptcy period. Trade creditors lend more if firms are more transparent, and if their board members are less involved with <b>previous</b> <b>bankruptcies.</b> Suppliers may also lend to our sample firms because they have a long-run interest in their survival since our sample firms indeed succeed in getting a plan voted by their creditors and confirmed by the court...|$|R
