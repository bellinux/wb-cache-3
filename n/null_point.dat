40|$|SJE {{would like}} to thank the Isle of Man Government for support during her PhD and also for the {{financial}} support of the STFC. Magnetic <b>null</b> <b>points</b> are points in space where the magnetic field is zero. Thus, they can be important sites for magnetic reconnection by virtue of the fact that they are weak points in the magnetic field and also because they are associated with topological structures, such as separators, which lie on the boundary between four topologically distinct flux domains and therefore are also locations where reconnection occurs. The number and distribution of nulls in a magnetic field acts as a measure of the complexity of the field. In this article, the numbers and distributions of <b>null</b> <b>points</b> in global potential field extrapolations from high-resolution synoptic magnetograms are examined. Extrapolations from magnetograms obtained with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) are studied in depth and compared with those from high-resolution SOlar Long-time Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) and Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI). The fall-off in the density of <b>null</b> <b>points</b> with height is found to follow a power law with a slope that differs depending on whether the data are from solar maximum or solar minimum. The distribution of <b>null</b> <b>points</b> with latitude also varies with the cycle as <b>null</b> <b>points</b> form predominantly over quiet-Sun regions and avoid active-region fields. The exception to this rule are the <b>null</b> <b>points</b> that form high in the solar atmosphere, and these <b>null</b> <b>points</b> tend to form over large areas of strong flux in active regions. From case studies of data acquired with the MDI, SOLIS, and HMI, it is found that the distribution of <b>null</b> <b>points</b> is very similar between data sets, except, of course, that there are far fewer nulls observed in the SOLIS data than in the cases from MDI and HMI due to its lower resolution.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{launch of the}} Hinode {{satellite}} {{our view of the}} nature and evolution of quiet-Sun regions has been improved. In light of the new high resolution observations, we revisit the study of the quiet Sun's topological nature. Topology is a tool to explain the complexity of the magnetic field, the occurrence of reconnection processes, and the heating of the corona. This Letter aims to give new insights to these different topics. Using a high-resolution Hinode/SOT observation of the line-of-sight magnetic field on the photosphere, we calculate the three dimensional magnetic field in the region above assuming a potential field. From the 3 D field, we determine the existence of <b>null</b> <b>points</b> in the magnetic configuration. From this model of a continuous field, we find that the distribution of <b>null</b> <b>points</b> with height is significantly different from that reported in previous studies. In particular, the <b>null</b> <b>points</b> are mainly located above the bottom boundary layer in the photosphere (54 %) and in the chromosphere (44 %) with only a few <b>null</b> <b>points</b> in the corona (2 %). The density of <b>null</b> <b>points</b> (expressed as the ratio of the number of <b>null</b> <b>points</b> to the number of photospheric magnetic fragments) in the solar atmosphere is estimated to be between 3 % and 8 % depending on the method used to identify the number of magnetic fragments in the observed photosphere. This study reveals that the heating of the corona by magnetic reconnection at coronal <b>null</b> <b>points</b> is unlikely. Our findings do not rule out the heating of the corona at other topological features. We also report the topological complexity of the chromosphere as strongly suggested by recent observations from Hinode/SOT. Comment: accepted in A&A Lette...|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} cooling {{involves}} removing internal energy from a system. When no more energy can be removed, the system is at absolute zero, though this cannot be achieved experimentally. Absolute zero is the <b>null</b> <b>point</b> of the thermodynamic temperature scale, also called absolute temperature. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would cease {{and they would be}} at complete rest in this classical sense.

25|$|As an {{electron}} enters a magnetic field, it feels a Lorentz force and corkscrews. The radius of this motion is the gyroradius. As it moves it loses some energy as x-rays, {{every time it}} changes speed. The electron spins faster and tighter in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid. Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the <b>null</b> <b>point,</b> due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards {{the edges of the}} MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical electron cyclotron resonance motion. Their gyroradius shrinks and when they hit a dense magnetic field they can be reflected using the magnetic mirror effect. Electron trapping has been measured in polywells with Langmuir probes.|$|E
25|$|For axiomatic {{treatment}} of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, {{it has become}} customary {{to refer to a}} zeroth law of thermodynamics. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold. While the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the second law of thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred, absolute temperature, unique up to an arbitrary scale factor, whence called the thermodynamic temperature. If internal energy is considered {{as a function of the}} volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect the entropy at constant volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or <b>null</b> <b>point</b> is absolute zero at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the third law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.|$|E

During an initial stage of relaxation, variations in magnetic pressure are eliminated, and current sheets build up in the immediate neighborhood of <b>null</b> <b>points.</b> This initial phase is followed by a long diffusive phase of slow algebraic decay of the field, during which fluid is continuously sucked into the current sheets, leading to exponential growth of fluid density and concentration of mass around the <b>null</b> <b>points,</b> which show a tendency to cluster.

This is done to test the validity of ideal MHD in the vicinity of flow and magnetic field of the plasma boundaries of stellar winds and their local interstellar medium.

We show that the solution space in 2 -D consists almost exclusively of either exponentially (in time) growing velocity or magnetic fields, or collapse solutions. Regular solutions must be three-dimensional and seem to be unstable with respect to small perturbations. This is an argument that reconnection has to take place in such regions and that therefore nonideal terms in Ohm's law are necessary, allowing for reconnection. We conclude that the use of ideal MHD in the vicinity of singular points of flow and magnetic field has to be analysed very carefully with respect to simulation results as those simulations show numerical dissipation (resistivity). These simulations can therefore produce unphysical reconnection regimes. Thus one has to search for a realistic Ohm's law, allowing for reconnection at the heliospheric boundaries...|$|R
