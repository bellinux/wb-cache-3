50|$|Trisopterus esmarkii, the <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> is {{a species}} of fish in the cod family. It {{is found in the}} Barents Sea, North Sea, Baltic Sea, off the coasts of Norway, Iceland, the British Isles and {{elsewhere}} in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. It prefers depths between 100 and(-) 200 m, but occurs from 50 to(-) 300 m. <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> can reach 35 cm, but are more common at around 19 cm.|$|E
50|$|All {{species of}} sand eels are used {{extensively}} in the fish oil and fishmeal industries. Their bodies are rich in lipids which makes them an ideal fish for these purposes. The demand for fishmeal has increased {{with the rise of}} aquaculture over the last few decades. Global production of farmed fish doubled between 1985-2000 and this created huge demands for fishmeal to feed the farmed fish. Raitt’s sand eel alongside capelin and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> are the primary species used for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|There are {{prescribed}} {{rules and}} quotas for purchase of fishing vessels. Danish fishing companies {{are permitted to}} own vessels provided their the fishermen or fishing companies are residents of Denmark. This rule applies to EU or EEC citizens also. One ship owner is permitted to own only four vessels with a combined capacity of GT of 5,000. Fishing volume in one pelagic vessel is restricted {{to a maximum of}} 10% of the Danish herring in the North Sea. The quota for mackerel fish is also the same on one vessel. Additional sprat quota/sandeel quota may be purchased for Baltic Sea sprat and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> fishing.|$|E
50|$|Three broad {{categories}} of fishing in Denmark are industrial fishery, fishery {{for human consumption}} (also known as pelagic fishing), and demersal fishery. Industrial fishing is for industrial use of producing fish oil and fish meal. Initially, Industrial fishing using trawlers began in the 1940s with herring fishing in the North Sea. Over time, other fish species included sand eel, <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> blue whiting and sprat (sprat in Skagerrak/Kattegat and in the Baltic Sea). By 1993, the percentage of sand eel was about 70%, when the total industrial fish catch was 1.2 million tons. However, in terms of cash value, cod fish was a better catch. This type of fishing is also found to be overall remunerative as it contributes to 27% in financial value from 77% of catch.|$|E
50|$|In the North Atlantic, they {{primarily}} eat small schooling fish, demersal fish, and krill. A 2007 {{study showed}} that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly T. inermis), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area - haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while sandeel (Ammodytes spp.), Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made {{up the rest of}} the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting - an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on sandeel (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for sandeel in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on sandeel (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout.</b> Sandeel was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005-2007), while sandeel's importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003-2006, but only 18.1% in 2007). Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while sandeel dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadiods, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> (Trisopterus esmarkii) {{stock in}} the North Sea has {{experienced}} poor recruitment recently. Herring (Clupea harengus) has been suggested {{to be a major}} predator on fish larvae in the North Sea. We investigated possible interactions between herring and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> using a simple statistical analysis and a modified stock - recruit relationship. There was a significant negative relationship (linear regression, r = 20. 44, p < 0. 05) between total herring biomass and recruitment of <b>Norway</b> <b>pout.</b> The spawning stock of <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> is typically dominated by 2 -year-olds, and there was a strong negative relationship (linear regression, r = 20. 79, p < 0. 01) between herring biomass and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> spawning-stock biomass (SSB) 2 years later. A Beverton-Holt model fitted to stock recruit data of <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> produced a rather poor correlation (r(2) = 0. 04). However, when only the <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> SSB not overlapping with herring is considered, the fit between the model and the stock - recruit data improves (r(2) = 0. 31). The analyses indicate a negative impact by herring on recruitment of <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> the most plausible cause for this being herring predation on <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> larvae, but field studies are needed to verify such predation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the 0 -group {{abundance}} of <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and haddock in the North Sea a combined acoustic/trawl survey {{was carried out in}} July - August 1978. The 0 -group of both species were concentrated in a scattering layer between surface and 40 m depth during the night. During the day all the 0 -group <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and most of the 0 -group haddock were found {{in the vicinity of the}} bottom but a minor portion of the 0 -group haddock occurred in scattered schools throughout the entire water column. Acoustic estimates of the 0 -group stocks of the two species amounted to 165 * 10 ^ 9 specimens of <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and 23 * 10 ^ 9 specimens of haddock. The figure for <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> compares resonably well with estimates based on independent data, but regarding the haddock the acoustic estimate seems high compared with estimates based on other data sources...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a 20 -year {{time series}} of {{standardized}} bottom trawl winter survey data (1994 - 2013) from the Barents Sea, {{to investigate the}} changes in abundance and distributional range of <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> (Trisopterus esmarkii) in response to changing sea temperatures. Due to the boreal Norway pout’s rather limited geographical distribution in the Barents Sea, and that <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> suffers no targeted fishing mortality in the Barents Sea, the species may be a well suited indicator species of climate and ecosystem change here. Annual <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> abundance indices were adjusted for diel changes in catchability, and an evident increase in <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> abundance was found during the study period, although a marked decrease {{the last two years}} was also evident. The distributional range was also found to increase, especially northwards from the distinct core area in the southwestern part of the Barents Sea. Although a rather weak correlation was found when comparing annual <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> abundance indices with annual corresponding sea temperatures (r = 0. 32), stronger correlations were found when abundance indices were compared to sea temperatures which were measured two (r = 0. 67) and three years (r = 0. 72) in advance. Reasons for these rather strong lagged (delayed) correlations are briefly being discussed in this thesis, and may be related to temperature effects on recruitment, maternal conditions (e. g. fecundity), changes in abundance/distribution of other species which affect <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> abundance (prey, predators or competitors), and/or a gradual expansion due to increased suitable habitat...|$|E
40|$|Research PaperManagement of the Danish protein {{fisheries}} in the North Sea has during recent years become increasingly politicised, as various stakeholder groups are seeking {{influence on the}} decision-making process. In relation to management of the sand eel and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> fisheries, two different issues are debated. In the sand eel fishery, {{which is the most}} important fishery (value and volume), particularly British environmental organizations are accusing Danish fishers of removing the food base for important sea bird populations and commercial fish stocks, and thus the conflict of interest is primarily between fishers and environmental groups. The <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> fishery {{is a classic example of}} a within fisheries conflict (national or international). There is a clash of interest between fishers targeting <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and fishers targeting species for human consumption, because there is a large by catch of primarily (haddock and whiting) in this fishery. In this paper the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to evaluate stakeholder preference towards the management of the two protein fisheries (sand eel and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout).</b> The research is based on interviews and a questionnaire survey with 12 different stakeholders in Denmark and the UK. The stakeholders represent industry organizations, management authorities, government fisheries research institutions and environmental organizations. Comparisons are made between different stakeholder preferences and the conflicts of interest are analysed. The results from the AHP analysis have been supplemented with qualitative information in order to present a more in-depth picture of the arguments presented by the various stakeholders, which are tunnelled into the decision-making process regarding the management of the sand eel and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> {{fisheries in}} the North Sea...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} quarter of 1997 R. V. “Walther Herwig III” took part in the internationally (ICES) coordinated International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) in the North Sea. A total of 365 half-hour tows using a {{standardized}} GOV-net were made by seven research vessels {{in order to determine the}} strength of incoming yearclasses of cod, haddock, whiting, <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> herring, sprat, and mackerel. Overall results, though preliminary show a considerable increase of the index figures for cod, <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> herring, and mackerel whereas the indices for haddock, sprat, and whiting indicate lower recruitment figures. Water temperatures and salinity values were unhomogeneously below and above of the longterm mean...|$|E
40|$|The {{interplay between}} temperature-related {{processes}} and predation in determining age- 1 recruitment strength between 1992 and 2006 was analysed for North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> (Trisopterus esmarkii). For this purpose, an predation impact index (PI) was calculated out of survey data. PI {{was assumed to}} depend on the abundance of the predators and on the spatial overlap between predator and prey populations. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were created with spawning stock biomass (SSB) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the respective spawning and nursery areas and PI as explaining variables. SSB had no significant impact on recruitment during this time period for both species. SSTs during spring and PI explained the interannual variability in recruitment strength to a large extent (88 % of the total variance for cod and 68 % for <b>Norway</b> <b>pout).</b> The SST during spring determined the overall level of recruitment. At SSTs above a certain level, however, the effect on recruitment was no longer significant. In these temperature ranges, predation was the dominant effect. Therefore, the fate of North Sea cod and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> stocks under global-warming conditions will be strongly influenced by the status of the North Sea food web...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a joint survey with two research vessels in July 1985. Total estimates of abundance (N x 10 - 9), were: <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> 56, haddock 52, whiting 66 and cod 4. Comparisons are made with a similar survey in July 1984 and with some recruitment estimates from other surveys...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 313 Trisopterus esmarki, {{was caught in}} 11 beach seine-hauls in the {{littoral}} zone along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast in October 1992. The fish measured 5 - 10 cm (total length) and therefore belonged to the 1992 year-class. Similar surveys have been made annually since 1919, {{and this is the}} first time <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> has been caught...|$|E
40|$|Younger {{ages and}} smaller sizes at {{maturation}} {{have been observed}} in commercial fish stocks over the last century. We establish that age and length at 50 % proportion mature (i. e. the proportion of mature individuals in a population or the probability that an individual is mature) decreased from the 1970 s to the 2000 s in North Sea cod Gadus morhua, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and whiting Merlangius merlangus, but not in <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> Trisopterus esmarkii. The potential contributions of demography, phenotypic plasticity and evolution to these trends were assessed. First, maturation trends were extricated from demographic effects and growth-dependent plasticity by estimating probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs). PMRN midpoints have significantly shifted downwards at most ages for cod, haddock and whiting, but not for <b>Norway</b> <b>pout.</b> Second, increased temperature and food abundance, loosened trophic competition and relaxed social pressure may also trigger growth-independent plasticity in maturation. Principal component regression of PMRN midpoints on annual estimates of relevant environmental variables exhibiting a temporal trend suggest that, despite some evidence of environmental effects, PMRN trends were mostly independent of growth-independent plasticity in haddock, whiting and male cod, but not in female cod. According to these findings, evolution of maturation, potentially in response to fishing, is plausible in haddock, whiting and male cod, but unlikely for <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> and does not explain trends in female cod maturation. In agreement with life-history theory, the maturation response was larger in fast-growing, late- and large-maturing species exhibiting moderate reproductive effort...|$|E
40|$|The harbour seal, Phoca vitulina, {{occurs in}} small groups along the entire coast of Norway. It is thought to {{interact}} with the commercial fisheries, both as predator and as final host for parasitic nematodes infecting fishes. In order to describe the diet and the feeding behaviour of the harbour seal, field-studies were carried out in the Hvaler area in outer Oslofjord in 1990 and 1991. The studies include both analysis of harbour seal faeces and trawling for information on prey-occurrence. In the trawl-catches the species of Gadidae and Pleuronectidae were most frequently found, with <b>norway</b> <b>pout</b> and plaice, respectively, being the most important single species. Analysis of faeces showed that the harbour seal feed opportunistic on some species but not on all. The most important groups were the Gadidae, Clupeidae and Ammodytidae, <b>norway</b> <b>pout</b> being the most important single species. Benthic trawls, constructed to catch shrimps and crayfish, were used, and Ammotydidae and Clupeidae were not found in the trawls...|$|E
40|$|The poor {{recruitment}} {{in recent}} years (2001 – 2004) in planktivorous fish in the North Sea has become cause for concern for fishers, managers, and scientists alike. It has lead to fishery closures and cuts in total allowable catches in sandeel, <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> and herring. SGRECVAP met to investigate and describe the serial poor recruitment, and review probable mechanisms for the recruitment trends. Time-series analysis showed {{that there was a}} common trend in the recent recruitment of all three target species. There was a strong negative trend in the stock-recruit residuals for herring and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> suggesting that the poor recruitment in those stocks is not related to spawning-stock biomass size. This was not the case in sandeel, where the situation was more complex. The common pattern of decline in recruitment seen in the planktivorous fish was not common to the major commercially exploited fish species in the North Sea. There was evidence for significant shifts of at least two periods of recruitment for the major commercial fish species exploited in the North Sea (1986 and 1996 / 97). Specifically for the three target planktivorous species, SGRECVAP considered there was a significant shift in recruitment in 2001. There was enough evidence to conclude that poor recruitment in herring was caused by a higher mortality of herring larvae before February of each year. The mechanisms for this were most likely poor larval feeding, predation or poor hatching condition and probably a combination of these. There was evidence that higher mortality of herring larvae can co-occur with high larval production. Whilst herring, <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and sandeel showed a common trend in recruitment, it cannot be assumed that the same mechanism was common for all three species. Owing to insufficient information on the production of each life history stage in <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and sandeel {{it was not possible to}} determine the mechanisms driving recruitment. It was clear that the poor sandeel recruitment from 2002 occurred at low spawning-stock biomass (the stock was below Blim in 2000); this was not the case for <b>Norway</b> <b>pout.</b> A well documented change in the planktonic community occurred in the North Sea after the mid 1980 s. Change has continued to date, on a gradual basis, and is linked to the broader process of climate change/variability. Reponses at other trophic levels to this gradual change in the zooplankton may result in abrupt changes. More exploration is needed to investigate the hypotheses presented in the report particularly targeting ecosystem interactions, especially in zooplankton (combined with hydrographic variability), predation, and quality/condition of adults, eggs, and larvae.

The development of characteristic features of the physical environment throughout the year is demonstrated. Primary production is described for spring, summer and late autumn situations.

40|$|During {{the last}} 15 years, {{northern}} European hake (Merluccius merluccius) {{has increased in}} abundance, and its spatial distribution has expanded in the North Sea region in correlation with temperature. In a context of global warming, this spatial shift could impact local trophic interactions: direct impacts may affect forage fish through modified predator–prey interactions, and indirect impacts may materialize through competition with other resident predators. For instance, North Sea saithe (Pollachius virens) spatial overlap with hake has increased while saithe spawning-stock biomass has decreased recently notwithstanding a sustainable exploitation. In this context, we investigated the range of potential impacts resulting from most recent hake emergence in the North Sea, with a particular focus on saithe. We carried out a multispecies assessment of North Sea saithe, using the Stochastic MultiSpecies (SMS) model. In addition to top-down processes already implemented in SMS, we built in the model bottom-up processes, relating <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> (Trisopterus esmarkii) abundance and saithe weight-at-age. We simulated the effects, on all North Sea species being considered but focusing on <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and saithe, of combining different hake abundance trends scenarios with the inclusion of bottom-up processes in SMS. North Sea saithe FMSY was then evaluated in a multispecies context and contrasted with single-species value. The different scenarios tested revealed a negative impact of hake emergence on saithe biomass, resulting from an increase of predation pressure on <b>Norway</b> <b>pout.</b> These results confirm the competition assumption between saithe and hake in the North Sea and might partially explain the most recent decrease of saithe biomass. This study also highlighted that taking into account bottom-up processes in the stock assessment had a limited effect on the estimation of saithe FMSY which was consistent with single-species value...|$|E
40|$|In 1961 cod {{eggs and}} larvae were more scarce in the Lofoten area {{than in the}} {{previous}} year (Table 1). Maxima of spawning and hatching occurred later than in 1960. In April cod eggs were relatively abundant in the inner Vestfjord, but scarce on the banks farther south. (Fig. 3). Eggs of saithe and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> occurred in moderate numbers in the Vestfjord in March-April, and a few eggs were also found on the coastal banks farther south (Fig. 4). A few larvae of <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> were taken at the end of May in the area Stad-Frøya bank. At the beginning of April herring larvae were abundant, the major concentrations being taken on the Stad, Halten, Møre end Sklinna Banks in the order mentioned, mean numbers per m^ 2 of sea surface 550 - 30 (Fig. 5). At the end of April the larvae were numerous on the Frøya and Halten Banks but scarce in other areas. It seems as if the herring larvae were somewhat less abundant than in 1960, but concentrated in the same areas. Capelin larvae were scarce, a few being taken near Northcape in May-June. Redfish larvae were abundant in May-June (Fig. 7) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the multi-frequency species identification and separation algorithms may be significantly improved when the detailed acoustic scattering characteristics of the fish are known, including its expected variability and uncertainty. The modeling approach is effective for interpreting measured data collected for different fish species and may give {{a better understanding of}} the acoustic scattering characteristics. The paper is motivated by development of algorithms of multi-frequency species identification and separation of three economically valuable North European fish species: Atlantic mackerel, Norwegian spring spawn herring and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout.</b> The backscattering by these fish is studied using an advanced modeling approach, and the results of the analysis are compared with selected multi-frequency recordings. This allows for an explanation of the main backscattering mechanisms over the selected frequency range and often {{a better understanding of the}} dominating acoustic scattering parameters. The impact of fish orientation behavior, pressure (for herring) and the morphological state of the fish is also discussed. Typical backscattering frequency responses for herring, mackerel and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> are explained theoretically. The obtained results may be a base for improving the automatic identification algorithms now introduced in scientific echo sounder post-processing systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of acoustical scattering layers {{of fish and}} krill changed markedly in concert with fluctuating fluorescence (chlorophyll a) in upper waters, possibly due to a varying 'shadow effect'. Beneath clear waters on the outer Norwegian shelf (about 300 m depth), mesopelagic fish (Maurolicus muelleri) were located at approximately 150 to 200 m by day. Krill (mainly Thysanoessa inermis) was primarily found below the mesopelagic fish and above planktivorous demersal fish (<b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> Trisopterus esmarkii). The vertical distributions changed abruptly across a front into water with less Light penetration associated with increased fluorescence (chlorophyll a). Mesopelagic fish ascended by about 100 m accompanied by a rise of krill. Demersal fish left the benthic boundary zone, with ascending <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> foraging in {{the lower part of}} the krill layer. We suggest that the intermediate light conditions inside the front provided an 'antipredation window' (sensu Clark & Levy 1988 : Am Nat 131 : 271 - 290) and thereby favorable feeding conditions for the planktivore. These results indicate that properties of upper layers may impact plankton and fish distributions and their predator-prey interactions throughout the water column on continental shelves...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the stocks of North Sea <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and sandeel has been inhibited {{by the absence of}} catch-at-age data in recent years. A statistical model for the analysis of seasonal catch-at-age, effort, and research vessel abundance data is developed in which all the model parameters can be estimated even when some data are missing. The model is used to estimate the age compositions for the year when data are missing and recent stock trends.

40|$|We must {{therefore}} expect that a directed fishery on this small gadoid (landings in the Northeast Atlantic are about 3 3 105 t year 21) {{will have a}} positive effect on the euphausiids, which in turn prey on copep-ods, a much more important food source for commercial fish species than euphausiids. Hence, fishing for <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> may have a cascading effect, leading to a build-up of nonutilized euphausiids. Triangles such as the one involving <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> euphausi-ids, and copepods, and which may have a major effect on ecosystem stability, are in-creasingly being integrated in ecological theory (21), especially in fisheries biology (22). Globally, trophic levels of fisheries land-ings appear to have declined in recent de-cades at a rate of about 0. 1 per decade, without the landings themselves increasing substantially. It is likely that continuation of present trends will lead to widespread fisheries collapses and to more backward-bending curves such as in Fig. 5, whether or not they are due to a relaxation of top-down control (23). Therefore, we consider esti-mations of global potentials based on ex-trapolation of present trends or explicitly incorporating fishing-down-the-food-web strategies to be highly questionable. Also, we suggest that in the next decades fisheries management will have to emphasize the rebuilding of fish populations embedded within functional food webs, within large “no-take ” marine protected areas (24) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{present report}} {{outlines}} {{the results of}} a survey carried out by R. V. "G. O. Sars" and R. V. "Johan Hjort" in February 1972. The distribution and relative abundance of fish in the North Sea were mapped on the basis of echo integrator readings. Samples obtained by mid water and bottom trawls supported the identification of echo recordings and provided material for biological analyses of dominating fish species. The general features of the hydrography was determined, and the distribution of air and sea temperatures, temperature anomalies, and salinities are presented. Significant differences in echo integrator readings were observed: between day and night, between the two ships and in relation to obtained catch. Bottom trawl catches varied between 45 and 1545 kg per hour. Best catches were taken in the southeastern part of the North Sea. In total, herring, whiting and haddock amounted to 26, 25 and 21 per sent respectively while <b>Norway</b> <b>pout,</b> flatfish and other species each were less than 10 per cent in weight. Distribution, size, age etc. are reported in detail for the dominating species, and the relationship between the distribution and the abiotic environment is discussed, Young herring were found in greatest concentrations in the Bløden area. Sprat were found in the coastal waters, characterized by relatively low salinity, while <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> were most numerous in Atlantic water in the northern part on the North Sea plateau. Blue whiting and coalfish were mainly observed along the western slope of the Norwegian trench below the core of the Atlantic water which penetrates into the North Sea...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} 1964 — 69 {{investigations}} {{were carried out}} on the composition of fish species caught with purse seine for herring and sprat in Norwegian fjords. In the districts of Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane {{on the west coast}} of Norway 70 catches were examined. The greater part of the hauls were made by artificial light during the months of August to November. Besides herring and sprat, 27 other fish species were found in the purse seine catches. Among these the most frequent species was whiting (Merlangus merlangus) which was found in most of the seine catches taken by artificial light. The number of whiting usually was from 20 to 50, sometimes even up to 300. In some deeper fjords on the west coast two other gadoid fishes. i. e. blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> (Boreogadus esmarkii) were common in catches taken by artificial light. In one single haul in the Osterfjord 2400 blue whiting and 6000 <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> were found. In the autumn of 1966 a large number of sand eels (Ammodytes lancea) were present in catches from {{the southern part of the}} area. This species seemed to be strongly attracted by artificial light, and up to 200 hectolitres could be caught in one night by a single boat. In the deep fjords the bycatches were generally small. Common food fish as cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) were only found in purse seine catches from closed inlets or in shallow and narrow fjords. Our material so far indicates that on the west coast of Norway the catches of other species than herring and sprat in the purse seine catches obtained by use of artificial light are not of such a quantity that they could be detrimental to other commercial fisheries...|$|E
40|$|The distribution, abundance, growth, length-weight {{relationships}} and reproductive ecology of whiting, <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and poor-cod populations were studied in inshore and offshore areas around Oban from November 1974 to March 1977. Planktonic stages and mature adults were found only at offshore sites, the inshore areas being nursery grounds {{for all three}} species. Immigration occurred between June and December of the O-group when the fish were nektonic, with {{part of the population}} pelagiC and part demersal. In whiting the young fish aggregated for a short period inshore, but in other species abundance was always greater offshore. <b>Norway</b> <b>pout</b> and poor-cod remained on the nursery. grounds for between one and two years, whereas few whiting remained longer than one year. In all species shallower sampling sites were vacated more rapidly than deeper ones. The migration of fish offshore is considered in relation to growth, diet and maturation. The ecological significance and management implications of the migrations are discussed. The rate of growth in length and weight varied seasonally, being more rapid in summer and autumn in all species. Differences were found between localities in rate of growth and are thought to be due to a preference by older fish for deeper water. Only the poor-cod spawned in the study area, at Tiree Passage and on the south-west coast of Null. Spawning occurred between January and May, with a peak in April. Females matured at a mean. length of 15. 6 cm in the 2 -group with only a small proportion of 1 -group fish maturing. In males the average age of first maturity was lower (14. 0 - 14. 6 cm) and a greater proportion of 1 -group fish matured, which compensated for a slightly lower survival rate in older fish and equalised the sex-ratio of the spawning popUlation. The success of reproduction was highly dependent on a single year-class, since 83. 3...|$|E
