500|$|The Confederate {{point of}} view for the battle was much {{different}} from the reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones reported [...] "The information I have is that the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander (Colonel Toland) and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. They admit a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded; it was probably much greater. Their dead bodies were scattered along the roads and mountain paths. [...] Our loss, as reported to me, was 1 captain and 5 men killed, and about double that number wounded." [...] The Reverend J. M. Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote [...] "...there was <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> damage they would have done. Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville would have been at their mercy. So our little battle disconcerted their plans and the raid was a complete failure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Words Words Words, both the album and DVD, has been mostly positive. Francis Rizzo III, of DVD Talk, praises Words Words Words, citing Burnham's excellent wordplay {{coupled with an}} age-defying stage presence and fluidity. [...] SanDiego.com's Gordon Downs spoke highly of Words Words Words; after describing the two studio songs as [...] "sounding like a modern day Ray Stevens coupled with the slick production of a Yes album", Downs lauded the live set's flow and energy and Burnham's skill with his material. [...] Bill Brownstein of Montreal's The Gazette praised Burnham's wit claiming [...] "e could be the love child of Allen Ginsberg and George Carlin. [...] And there's <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> kind of comedy monster he can morph into {{by the time he}} hits 30 – even 25." ...|$|E

2500|$|Masterson {{was back}} in Dodge City on November 1, 1884, where he issued a small {{newspaper}} called Vox Populi, which was devoted to local political issues. Three days after its appearance, Bat received a flattering – and prophetic – review of his journalistic effort from another Dodge City paper which observed: [...] "We are in receipt of the first number of Vox Populi, W.B. Masterson, editor, which in appearance is very neat and tidy. The news and statements it contains seem to be of a somewhat personal nature. The editor is very promising; if he survives {{the first week of}} his literary venture, there is <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> he may accomplish in the journalistic field." [...] Editor Bat Masterson did not survive his first week. Vox Populi folded after printing just one issue and almost another 20 years would pass before Bat made journalism a full-time profession in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|The Tujunga Wash {{reached its}} peak flow on March 3, with a water flow of an {{estimated}} [...] Upper Big Tujunga Canyon was [...] "all but swept clean of structures that were not up above the flood line". In the San Fernando Valley, the floodwaters swept through many areas after escaping the normal channels of Tujunga Creek and its tributaries. Waters reached deep into the valley, flooding Van Nuys; five people died when the Lankershim Boulevard bridge collapsed at Universal City, just below the confluence of Tujunga Wash and the LA River. The flooding {{would have been much}} worse had a large debris flow not been halted at Big Tujunga Dam; Sam Browne, dam keeper during the 1938 flood, wrote that [...] "Large oak trees several hundred years old rushed down the canyon like kindling... If this dam had never been built, there is <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> would have happened to Sunland, and the city of Tujunga and the northern end of Glendale." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hulk {{is often}} viewed as a {{reaction}} to war. As well as being a reaction to the Cold War, the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the Vietnam War raised, and Ang Lee said that the Iraq War influenced his direction. In the Michael Nyman edited edition of The Guardian, Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics' reaction to the September 11 attacks. Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic Heroes, claiming that his greater prominence, alongside Captain America, aided in [...] "stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist." [...] In Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics, Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: [...] "As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity, there's <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> may happen, or how much our advancements in science may cost us." [...] Daniels continues, [...] "The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{positively}} received by critics, with Artistdirect giving its 4.5 out of 5, calling it music [...] "you throw {{on when the}} only passengers in your car are two recently emptied cans of Red Bull and a woofer". Remix called it a [...] "wild romp through present-day breaks and bass". [...] Rick Anderson of Allmusic stated [...] "each track comes across as fairly unexpected: you know it's going to be funky, you know the beats {{are probably going to}} lurch around crazily with lots of squelchy synth and frequent reggae vocal samples, but beyond that there's <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> <b>what's</b> going to happen. At its best, the result is thrilling".|$|R
2500|$|In {{his second}} {{professional}} season in 1986, Walker achieved his breakthrough while playing for two A-level clubs, the Burlington Expos and West Palm Beach Expos. [...] His combined totals in 133 games included a [...]288 average, [...]397 on-base percentage (OBP), [...]602 slugging percentage (SLG), 87 runs scored, 19 doubles, 11 triples, 33 home runs, 90 {{runs batted in}} (RBI) and 18 stolen bases. [...] Walker {{caught the eye of}} his fellow Canadians, and, as a 19-year-old minor leaguer, had acquired an entourage of Canadian reporters. [...] "I know now I can hit the ball. [...] I {{have a lot of confidence}} even though I still strike out a lot. [...] I swing at too many bad pitches," [...] he contemplated. [...] Predicted West Palm Beach manager Felipe Alou, [...] "If he keeps improving the way he has the last 12 months, there`s <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> he could do. [...] You have a kid with his kind of potential, they don`t last long in the minor leagues." [...] Meanwhile, the club clinched the Florida State League South division, winning by two games over the Fort Lauderdale Yankees.|$|E
2500|$|Gavin's final storyline {{sees him}} {{kidnapping}} Kathy, killing his sister Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey) and being arrested. Nicholas {{said of the}} storyline, [...] "Gavin {{will be up to}} the usual sullied, nasty things", while Taylforth explained, [...] "He is coming back to cause the usual mayhem that he always does. Paul is great playing a villain, we all love him to bits! He still controls Kathy in a certain way. She thought last time that she could control him – as soon as starts talking to her, he wins her over again—as he always does!" [...] The storyline includes a cliffhanger where it is not known if it is Margaret or Kathy who has been killed. Kilkelly said the end of the episode was a [...] "sinister surprise" [...] and that [...] "Gavin Sullivan appeared to reach villainous new heights". Duncan Lindsay from the Metro said of Gavin, [...] "He's clearly lost it and with a body on his hands and the control slipping from his grasp, there's <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> <b>what</b> Gavin might do next", adding that [...] "The final chapter of the saga is about to unfold in dramatic fashion." ...|$|E

60|$|As the {{afternoon}} wore away Venters's concern diminished, yet he kept {{close watch on}} the blacks and the trail and the sage. There was <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> of <b>what</b> Jerry Card might be capable. Venters sullenly acquiesced {{to the idea that}} the rider had been too quick and too shrewd for him. Strangely and doggedly, however, Venters clung to his foreboding of Card's downfall.|$|R

60|$|But {{take home}} with you, {{soldiers}} all, one lesson from this strange story, that while {{a man can}} keep his courage and his temper, he is not only never really beaten, but <b>no</b> man can <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> great things he may not do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Moreover, <b>no</b> one can <b>tell</b> <b>what</b> {{may happen}} to him. Your people are quarrelling with Tippoo, as they quarrelled with his father, Hyder; and I think that, before long, it is {{possible}} they will overthrow him, and take possession of his territory.|$|R
6000|$|But now all was excitement, {{for a large}} {{force of}} rebels had been {{uncovered}} and there was <b>no</b> <b>telling</b> but <b>what</b> the jungle ahead concealed even more.
