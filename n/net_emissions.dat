5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the <b>net</b> <b>emissions</b> of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E

The <b>net</b> <b>emission</b> coefficients are calculated for various equilibrium compositions (mole fractions of Cu and W) of the plasma. Calculations take into account continuum and line radiations, special attention has also been taken to the fraction of radiation that is below threshold of 120 nm.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>net</b> <b>emission</b> {{coefficient}} of plasmas containing argon and iron at atmospheric pressure is calculated and analysed {{for the case}} of cylindrical geometry. Its values are obtained by integrating the monochromatic <b>net</b> <b>emission</b> coefficient taking into account continuous and line radiation. The width of the spectral lines is determined by Doppler broadening, natural, resonance, van der Waals, electron and ion Stark broadening. As Stark broadening {{is the most important}} broadening mechanism in the considered pressure and temperature range, the electron Stark widths are calculated following the semi-empirical Stark broadening theory. Additionally, the electron Stark widths of Ar, Ar +, Fe and Fe + are multiplied by scaling factors in order to reproduce experimental electron Stark widths. The scaling factor is determined for each species separately. For small plasma radii the <b>net</b> <b>emission</b> coefficient determined here shows good agreement with literature values where spherical geometry is considered while they decrease faster with increasing plasma radius. This behaviour is caused by the increase of the irradiation of the symmetry axis when cylindrical instead of spherical geometry is considered. For radii and temperatures typical of the metal filled core of arcs occurring in gas metal arc welding processes, i. e. radii between 1 and 2 × 10 − 3 m and temperatures between 5000 and 10000 K, the scaling of the Stark widths increases the <b>net</b> <b>emission</b> {{coefficient of}} iron plasmas by between 2 and 23 %. In this parameter range the <b>net</b> <b>emission</b> coefficient of iron plasmas for cylindrical geometry is between 30 and 37 % smaller than values calculated for spherical geometry...|$|R

Radiation is weak in pure helium at low temperatures because of the high ionization energy of this species. On the opposite, at very high temperature, the influence of hydrogen tends to decrease because ionic lines do not exist for this last species.
