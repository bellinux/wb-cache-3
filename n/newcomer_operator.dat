They show that competitive advantage in terms of costs obtained by the new operator E 02 can be sufficient to neutralise {{the effect of the}} access specific constant as this affects not only costs but also prices, reflecting in the market share of the operator. Only with higher values of the specific constant the established operator E 01 can obtain bigger profits than the <b>newcomer</b> <b>operator</b> E 02. This means that this can only be achieved if renfe operadora (E 01) can utilise its position as established operator in this corridor by transmitting more confidence than its competitors.|$|E

The current status of Intermodal/Combined Transport in Europe, the alternative loading units (containers, swap bodies and semitrailers suitable for intermodal transport) {{as well as the}} operational requirements for a <b>newcomer</b> <b>operator</b> must be analyzed {{to be used in the}} appraisal process. A number of scenarios have been formulated taking into account all categories of operators, i. e., international carriers, forwarders and national carriers, different financing schemes and alternative loading units. The evaluation procedure concerns an (under investigation) Italy-Greece corridor but can be applied in similar studies. The financial advantage, in terms of Net Present Value, derives from the comparison of the net benefits of every operator when using the new corridor, against the benefits of the same operator continuing his current operations. The results of the financial evaluation indicate that under certain conditions of financial subsidies, a positive return to investment is expected for several cases...|$|E

In doing so, however, she accidentally gets ProtoMan (or Colonel, depending on the version) captured and corrupted by Nebula, and the team must confront and rescue him. In Team ProtoMan, this is series <b>newcomer</b> Jasmine, <b>operator</b> of medic-themed Navi Medi.EXE, and she seeks to find a medical book hidden on the Undernet to cure her grandfather. In Team Colonel, this is DNN reporter Ribitta, owner of ToadMan.EXE, and she seeks to deduce the identities of Team Colonel.|$|R

Kaj je tisto, kar zadržuje stare in pritegne nove uporabnike? Namesto dragih marketinških pristopov, lahko izvedemo raziskavo zadovoljstva uporabnikov. Naloga je vsebinsko razdeljena na dva dela: V prvem, teoretičnem, opisujem teorijo zadovoljstva potrošnikov, predstavljam podjetje, segmentiranje in pozicioniranje trga ter podjetja. Navajam tudi raziskovalna vprašanja. Drugi del je prikaz praktičnega dela. Poudarek je na raziskavi trga. Na anketni vprašalnik je odgovorilo 100 naključnih mimoidočih ljudi iz gorenjske regije. Sledi analiza raziskave ter lastno mnenje in predlogi za izboljšanje poslovanja. A {{successful}} {{company is}} the one that takes notice of customers wishes. The consumer, though, decides whether to stay true to the company or change allegiance and go to competition. It is of great significance to research consumer satisfaction since such survey offers the business to meet the wishes and needs of the consumer and to monitor the responses to new and already existing services and products. The situation regarding mobile telephony is changing quickly {{and there are lots of}} bidders. In my paper I chose a <b>newcomer</b> among mobile <b>operators</b> – Tušmobil – and delved into the satisfaction of their users. The paper is divided into two parts: The first one describes the theory of consumer satisfaction. It introduces the company, the segmentation and positioning of the market and the company. It cites the survey questions. The second part is empirical. The stress is on market research. 100 randomly chosen passers-by from the gorenjska region replied to the questionnaire. This way I obtained first hand information – direct personal contact with buyers and other prospective users is very important. The results of the survey and the analysis follow, the latter is accompanied by graphic representation. In the final part I give opinion and make suggestions as to the future dealings of the company...|$|R
