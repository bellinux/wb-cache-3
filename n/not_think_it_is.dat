25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} {{crowding}} out. When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E
25|$|We {{claim that}} the {{defendant}} is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue {{as to whether he}} taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fair to the court or counsel on the other side to waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E
500|$|Citron's {{relationship}} with his wife was debated because historians doubt that she betrayed him, since {{she gave birth to}} their child shortly after his death. Madsen was sure the betrayal happened, but he took the liberty of affirming the couple did not get back together. Madsen declared, [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> morally tarnished to show that people have affairs with people they are not married to. It's a beautiful description of a relationship that falls apart in a time that had great personal cost." ...|$|E

I did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> of material importance. The donor gives us money because of the brand of the NKF and I did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so important at that point of time to correct this error." ...|$|R

Felton worked on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix throughout 2006. Having read more of the Harry Potter books, Felton reflected: [...] "I have had input into Draco.

500|$|Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) becomes {{engaged to}} her state senator boyfriend, Robert. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who {{strongly}} believes that Robert is gay, shares his feelings with Pam. Ryan overhears them and confirms that Robert is gay, in his opinion. When {{the rest of}} the office thinks so as well, they must {{decide whether or not to}} tell Angela. They eventually decide not to tell Angela for a wide range of reasons—not everyone is sure Robert is gay, Oscar is looking forward to the elegant wedding, and Pam does <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> anyone's right to blurt out that information. Angela is then typically rude about her nuptial plans—first sing-songing to an indifferent Stanley that they might not have room to invite him to the wedding, and then asking Pam if she can borrow the plans for the dream wedding Pam never got to have, before mocking the ceremony where Pam and Jim got married at Niagara Falls. Pam is sorely tempted to spill the beans about Robert's sexuality, but ends up smiling sweetly and wishing Angela [...] "a very happy wedding".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the synagogue}} had {{undertaken}} innovations {{in some areas}} of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not believe my congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but {{it does not seem to}} me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E

500|$|With Lisa {{now facing}} a long jail sentence, Marge decides {{to help her}} out. She starts reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and becomes {{addicted}} to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a cold beer. Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the bottle on the bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a [...] "big monkey-faced gorilla." [...] Clarice then asks Ned to compare {{the picture of the}} [...] "missing link" [...] and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, but she just does <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> proper for the church to dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{the murdered}} man {{is known as}} Quentin Duguesclin {{by the end of}} the novel, he is never named by anyone in the adaptation. Instead, Poirot simply reveals in his {{denouement}} that he is either the relative or friend of the first Mrs Bland. The knowledge of this is emphasised as being important to Poirot through a comment he makes to Hardcastle during their investigations – [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important who he is, but who he is." ...|$|E

Walsh had revealed that she does <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible Girls Aloud will ever [...] "officially break up". She explained that they are planning to tour again and will probably take breaks from time to time, doing solo projects but they will never permanently go their separate ways.|$|E

2500|$|Elbegdorj stated [...] "Capital {{punishment}} is wrong–it degrades human dignity. It brings no peace to society. It does not deter crime {{and does not}} lift up mankind," [...] in [...] at the High-Level Meeting on the Rule of Law of the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 24 September 2012. [...] "By ratifying the Second Optional Protocol Mongolia would add yet one more {{country in the world}} community to fully abolish the death penalty. Pardoning a life does not mean pardoning a penalty. The punishment for serious and cruel felonies must be severe, and must be just. However, I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just to deprive any citizens of life in the name of state. The right to life is one of the fundamental rights of a human being and cannot depend on anyone, not even on the head of state.

2500|$|Van Vliet {{arrived in}} Salt Lake City on 8 September. Historian Harold Schindler states that his {{mission was to}} contact Governor Young and inform him of the expedition's mission: to escort the new appointees, {{to act as a}} posse comitatus and to {{establish}} at least two and perhaps three new U.S. Army camps in Utah. Conversing with Van Vliet, Young denied complicity in the destruction of the law offices of U.S. Federal Judge Stiles and expressed concern that he (Young) might suffer the same fate as the previous Mormon leader, Joseph Smith, to which Van Vliet replied, [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the intention of the government to arrest you," [...] said Van Vliet, [...] "but to install a new governor of the territory". Van Vliet's instructions were to buy provisions for the troops and to inform the people of Utah that the troops would only be employed as a posse comitatus when called on by the civil authority to aid in the execution of the laws.|$|E

2500|$|On 17 January 1866, the Governor confiscated most Ngāti Awa {{land in the}} Bay of Plenty on {{the grounds}} of war and rebellion. The Waitangi Tribunal noted there was a [...] "popular belief" [...] the {{confiscations}} were punishment for the murder of James Te Mautaranui Fulloon, an officer of the Crown, at Whakatane in July 1865, but said the Settlements Act could not be used as a punishment for the crime of murder. In addition, only two or three of 30 Ngāti Awa hapu (sub-tribes) were involved in the murder, the individuals responsible for the murder were already on trial {{at the time of the}} confiscation and all resistance was at an end in the area, with local rangatira (chiefs) having taken an oath of allegiance. The most unconscionable of the many ironies in the confiscation was that the main part of the land used for military settlements was at Whakatane, on the land of the most innocent. The tribunal concluded: [...] "We do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> at all established that there was a war in the usual sense. More particularly, we consider that there was no rebellion ... the confiscation was clearly contrary to the Treaty of Waitangi." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu (孫布) {{secretly}} sent {{a messenger}} to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey {{his desire to}} defect to Wei.

[...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious.
