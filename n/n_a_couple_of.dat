First Bayesian {{networks are}} de <b>ned</b> and <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> examples are given. It is illustrated how Bayesian networks {{are used for}} various task like calculating updated probabilities for variables given evidens, calculating probabilities for speci c con gurations of variables, calculating con gurations of maximal probability and analysis for con icting evidens. In uence diagrams are Bayesian networks argumented with special variables for actions. They are used for calculating optimal strategies for sequences of actions. It is nally shown how the problem of deciding between various information sources can be solved in situations with only one set of action options. These and other issues are treated more deeply in Jensen (1996). ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. I {{present a}} {{factoring}} algorithm that factors N = UV, where U < V, provably in O(N 1 / 3 +ǫ) time. I also discuss {{the potential for}} improving this to a sub-exponential algorithm. Along the way, I consider the distribution of solutions (x, y) to xy = <b>N</b> mod <b>a.</b> 1. Algorithm- hide and seek Let <b>N</b> be <b>a</b> positive integer that we wish to factor. Say N = UV where U and V are positive integers, not necessarily prime, with 1 < U < V. For simplicity, assume V < 2 U, so that V < (2 N) 1 / 2. The general case, without this restriction, will be handled {{at the end of}} this section. The idea behind the algorithm is to perform trial division <b>of</b> <b>N</b> by <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> integers, and to use information about the remainder to determine the factors U and V. Let a be a positive integer, 1 < <b>a</b> < <b>N.</b> By the division algorithm, write (1. 1) U = u 1 a + u 0...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{experimentally}} explore {{four different}} hierarchical space decomposition algorithms. Three of these algorithms are known from prior literature, whereas the fourth was derived {{as a result}} of initial experimental work with the previous algorithms, and is presented {{for the first time in}} this paper. The new algorithm has several variations, and one of them (called TX-AL) is consistently faster than all of the other algorithms, despite the fact that its worst-case asymptotic performance is suboptimal (TX-AL has worst-case complexity Θ(n log <b>n),</b> where <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> the other algorithms/variants have complexity O(n log log n)). This shows the validity of the bucketing technique introduced by algorithm RT, while making some sacrifices on asymptotic complexity to allow for smaller constants in the running time. We examine the decomposition algorithms by themselves and also in the context of three different applications: closest pair, all nearest neighbors, and n-body force computation. Other results presented here include: tests that show the important practical benefit of finding tight bounding boxes for regions prior to testing region dependencies and running applications; tests that show how the amount of non-uniformity in input distribution affects decomposition time; and tests that show that this framework of general decomposition plus application is indeed competitive with algorithms that are designed to solve specific problems...|$|R
40|$|We first {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} (p, q, r) -complemented subspaces in Banach spaces, where p, q, r is <b>an</b> element <b>of</b> <b>N.</b> Then, given <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> triples {(p, q, r), (s, t, u) } in N and putting Lambda = (q + r - p) (t + u - s) - ru, we prove partially the following conjecture: For every pair of Banach spaces X and Y such that X is (p, q, r) -complemented in Y and Y is (s, t, u) -complemented in X, we have that X is isomorphic Y {{if and only if}} one of the following conditions holds: (a) Lambda not equal 0, Lambda divides p - q and s - t, p = 1 or q = 1 or s = 1 or t = 1. (b) p = q = s = t = 1 and gcd(r, u) = 1. The case {(2, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1) } is the well-known Pelczynski`s decomposition method. Our result leads naturally to some generalizations of the Schroeder-B em stein problem for Banach spaces solved by W. T. Gowers in 1996. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|An exact-match overlap graph of n given {{strings of}} length ℓ is an edge-weighted graph {{in which each}} vertex is {{associated}} with a string and there is an edge (x,y) of weight ω = ℓ - |ov_max(x,y) | if and only if ω≤λ, where |ov_max(x,y) | is the length of ov_max(x,y) and λ is a given threshold. In this paper, we show that the exact-match overlap graphs can be represented by a compact data structure that can be stored using at most (2 λ - 1) (2 n + λ) <b>n</b> bits with <b>a</b> guarantee that the basic operation of accessing an edge takes O(λ) time. Exact-match overlap graphs have been broadly used in the context of DNA assembly and the shortest super string problem where the number of strings <b>n</b> ranges from <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> thousands to <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> billions, the length ℓ of the strings is from 25 to 1000, depending on DNA sequencing technologies. However, many DNA assemblers using overlap graphs are facing a major problem of constructing and storing them. Especially, it is impossible for these DNA assemblers to handle the huge amount of data produced by the next generation sequencing technologies where the number of strings n is usually very large ranging from hundred million to <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> billions. In fact, to our best knowledge there is no DNA assemblers that can handle such a large number of strings. Fortunately, with our compact data structure, the major problem of constructing and storing overlap graphs is practically solved since it only requires linear time and and linear memory. As a result, it opens the door of possibilities to build a DNA assembler that can handle large-scale datasets efficiently...|$|R
