40|$|Abstract. We here {{consider}} transition <b>systems</b> of Elementary <b>Net</b> <b>Systems</b> with Inhibitor Arcs. There {{are basically}} two di erent types of non-interleaving semantics of such Petri nets, the a-posteriori and a-priori semantics. The synthesis problem for Elementary <b>Net</b> <b>Systems</b> with Inhibitor Arcs executed under the a-priori semantics (ENI) was solved in [7]. The {{aim of this}} paper is to completely characterise transition systems which can be generated by Elementary <b>Net</b> <b>Systems</b> with Inhibitor Arcs executed under the a-posteriori semantics (ENI apost). This is achieved by adapting the notion of a step transition system, i. e. one in which arcs are labelled by sets of events executed concurrently. In developing the model, we follow the standard approach in which the relationship between nets and their transition systems is established via the notion of a region. We de ne, and show consistency of, two behaviour preserving translations between <b>nets</b> and transition <b>systems.</b> We then compare transition systems which are generated by ENIapost and ENI <b>net</b> <b>systems</b> (called respectively TSENIapost and TSENI transition systems) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Reconfigurable Object Nets (RONs) {{have been}} {{implemented}} in our group to support the visual specification of controlled rule-based transformations of marked place/transition (P/T) nets. RONs are high-level <b>nets</b> (<b>system</b> <b>nets)</b> with two types of tokens: object nets (P/T nets) and <b>net</b> transformation rules. <b>System</b> <b>net</b> transitions can be of different types to fire object net transitions, move object <b>nets</b> through the <b>system</b> <b>net,</b> or to apply a net transformation rule to an object net. The disadvantage of the RON approach and tool is the limitation of object nets to P/T nets and the limitation of the underlying semantics of RONs due to the fixed types for <b>system</b> <b>net</b> transitions. Often, a more general approach is preferred where the type of object nets and the behavior of reconfigurations may be defined in a more flexible way. In this paper, we propose to use Algebraic High-Level nets with in-dividual tokens (AHLI <b>nets)</b> as <b>system</b> <b>nets.</b> In this more general approach, tokens may be any type of Petri nets, defined by the corresponding algebraic signature and algebra.
