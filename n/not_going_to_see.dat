500|$|In {{accordance}} with Lee Strasberg's method acting, Jolie preferred {{to stay in}} character in between scenes during many of her early films, {{and as a result}} had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting Gia, she told her husband, Jonny Lee Miller, that she {{would not be able to}} phone him: [...] "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you for weeks.'" [...] After Gia wrapped, she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had [...] "nothing else to give." [...] She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at New York University to study directing and screenwriting. Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for George Wallace and the positive critical reception of Gia, Jolie resumed her career.|$|E
500|$|Because the CW is a fashion-orientated network, {{there were}} times Nikita had to be dressed {{in a certain way}} to get her noticed by her targets. Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence. You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me in a bikini again, that's for sure. [...] I was like, 'Danny, can you put me in a one-piece?,' and he gave me that red bikini. I was like, 'That's not a one-piece. That's a two-piece with a string.'" [...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{has often}} spoken {{in favour of}} {{privatisation}} and lessening the state role in economy, Kudrin also supported {{the creation of the}} so-called national champions. Kudrin has said that the state's role in the oil industry should not be increased, and has indicated that the purchase of Sibneft by Gazprom and the merger of some former Yukos assets to state-controlled oil company Rosneft were taken at a particular stage of the restructuring of the sector. According to Kudrin, [...] "no-one regards state ownership of such assets as an end in itself" [...] and [...] "we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a continuous strengthening of the state’s position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sharapova {{has made}} varying remarks {{on how long}} she intends to {{maintain}} her tennis career. Following the retirement of 25-year-old Justine Henin in 2008, Sharapova said, [...] "If I [...] 25, and I'd won so many Grand Slams, I'd quit too." [...] In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked {{at the idea of}} playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a [...] "nice husband and a few kids" [...] by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement." ...|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Brown {{had paid}} her four and sixpence--one florin and a half-crown--and {{she had three}} threepenny-pieces in her pocket, and twopence. Then Sally had been out and got a shilling's-worth of soap, and six-penn'orth of blue, and brought home one shilling; {{and there was the}} sausages--no one could {{recollect}} what they had cost, though they talked so much about their taste; and five-pence-worth of red-herrings, and the butter; yes, and threepence to the beggar who said he had been in Sebastopol.

2500|$|From its {{inception}} to its broadcast, {{there were a}} lot of changes in how the episode is presented. Originally, [...] "Pip" [...] was going to be a musical episode, the first South Park musical since the 1999 movie [...] At one point, the plan was to have Pip tell his own story to the South Park Elementary class. An early storyboard scene shows [...] "Pip walk up to the class holding a HUGE manuscript of paper. It could be a novel." [...] Beginning his story in the classroom, he starts by introducing the origins of his name, only to be interrupted by Cartman – much like the scene in [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig". In the end, the finished episode did not include the boys or any other regular characters. As Stone and Parker explained, [...] "bookend it with the kids or hav the kids listening to the story" [...] would be too formulaic for their tastes, so they decided to do the episode without the South Park boys, precisely [...] "ecause it's a bad idea." [...] Having an episode's worth of story told in front of the class was later used in the eighth season episode [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", which has Cartman telling a Christmas themed story (in a plot twist). The ending of the story's narration in that episode resembles the ending in [...] "Pip". In [...] "Pip", the narrator ends the story with the line [...] "And they all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B." [...] In [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", Cartman finishes the story by saying [...] "And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later." [...] Another idea was to have Chef narrate the episode, in the style of Masterpiece Theatre. In the end, the creators decided to do the Masterpiece parody in live action, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell. The reason behind the introduction was to make it clear to the viewers that it is going to be an [...] "extremely different experience" [...] from the other episodes, and that they are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the regular characters of the show. The creators said that they did this having learned the lesson from the second season episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] – which also revolves entirely around two minor characters – about the necessity of making the audience aware that they are not to expect to see the regular characters any time during the episode. Both McDowell and the two creators have spoken highly of each other. Parker and Stone said that shooting with McDowell was a positive experience, and that he told old stories about the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange – which McDowell starred in –, and its director Stanley Kubrick.|$|E

2500|$|In early January 1911, Churchill made a {{controversial}} {{visit to the}} Siege of Sidney Street in London. There is some uncertainty {{as to whether he}} attempted to give operational commands, and his presence attracted much criticism. After an inquest, Arthur Balfour remarked, [...] "he [...] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, but what was the right honourable gentleman doing?" [...] Biographer Roy Jenkins suggests that he went simply because [...] "he could <b>not</b> resist <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the fun himself" [...] and that he did not issue commands.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Fangoria, director Balagueró stated that the film would not have an apocalyptic style presumed by its title, stating, [...] "All of the movies in the REC series have the same budget, so you’re <b>not</b> really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> big scenes of Barcelona full of zombies; they’re just not intended that way.

5000|$|After {{the show}} got shelved, Tollin/Robbins {{approached}} Peter Roth, the President of Warner Bros. Television, about developing a series {{based on a}} young Superman back in the year 2000. That same year, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar developed a pilot based on the film Eraser. After watching the pilot, Roth approached the two men about developing a second pilot based on the young Superman concept that was brought to him. After meeting with Roth, Gough and Millar decided {{that they did not}} want to do a series where there was a cape and lots of flying. It was here that they developed a [...] "no tights, no flights" [...] rule, vowing Clark would not fly or don the suit at any point during the show.

She was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him <b>see.</b> She felt bound in honour to accept the situation for ever and ever unless--Ah, unless ...

500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added that he would <b>not</b> be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book.

2500|$|In early January 1911, Churchill {{arrived at}} the [...] "Siege of Sidney Street" [...] in London. He gave his own account of the {{incident}} in his book Thoughts and Adventures. There is some uncertainty as to whether Churchill attempted to give operational commands. Biographer Roy Jenkins comments that the reason he went was because [...] "he could <b>not</b> resist <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the fun himself" [...] {{and that he did}} not issue commands. A famous photograph from the time shows Churchill at the scene, peering around a corner to view the gun battle between cornered anarchists and Scots Guards. His role and presence attracted much criticism. The building under siege caught fire, and Churchill supported the decision to deny the fire brigade access, forcing the criminals to choose surrender or death. After an inquest, Arthur Balfour remarked, [...] "He [...] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing but what was the Right Honourable gentleman doing?" [...] The significance was that the whole highly publicised affair increased Churchill's already incipient reputation for being a frenetic and far-from-calm Home Secretary.|$|R
