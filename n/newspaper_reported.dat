40|$|The present thesis {{was aimed}} at {{investigating}} whether pre-exposure to biased <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports</b> influences remembering of the main session material. In general, {{the results show that}} remembering of the main session material varies {{as a function of the}} pre-exposure to the biased <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports.</b> It seems that pre-exposure to <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports</b> facilitates the accessibility of the main session items. However, recognition of the main session material in general seems to decrease when the participants are pre-exposed to <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports</b> written in order to discredit the defendant, whereas pre-exposure to <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports</b> written in favour of the defendant seem to facilitate recognition of the main session material. It Was suggested that the various schema activated on basis of the biased <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports</b> produced the effects obtained. Further, the ability to distinguish the various sources of information decreased when additional information (i. e., interference) was introduced. Some of the results obtained inquire previous views on expertise and prior knowledge and are discussed further. Moreover, the limits to generalizability are also discussed.

40|$|Discourse {{representation}} {{plays an}} important role in the news report. The reporter uses it to relate events in the real world to what he or she intends to report to the reader. Various types of verbs for representing discourse are used. There exist differences in the use of representing verbs in terms of illocutionary force. Speech act verbs are used to give illocutionary force to represented discourse. This paper elucidates the relationships between the value of news sources and the choice of representing verbs in Japanese and American <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports.</b> The reporter uses modes of direct and indirect discourse representation when he or she attributes statements to news sources. Each mode of discourse representation has different functions in the <b>newspaper</b> <b>report.</b> Thus, this paper analyzes this issue by comparing Japanese <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports</b> with American <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports.</b> In addition, this paper investigates how these modes of discourse representation are used to represent discourse in Japanese and American <b>newspaper</b> <b>reports</b> i...|$|R

Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London <b>newspaper</b> <b>reported</b> on it; widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, but he still travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event.|$|E

The report claimed that Ehud Barak led a seaborne command center on a navy missile boat off the shore of Tunis that oversaw al-Wazir's assassination. Up until 1 November 2012, Israel however did not take official responsibility for his killing and government spokesman Moshe Fogel and aides to Barak {{declined to comment on}} the issue. According to the report, Barak, who was then a deputy military chief, coordinated the planning by the Mossad, as well as the army's intelligence branch, the air force, navy and the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit. Mossad intelligence agents watched al-Wazir's home for months before the raid. The Washington Post reported on 21 April that the Israeli cabinet approved al-Wazir's assassination on 13 April and that it was coordinated between the Mossad and the IDF.|$|E

The King expressed an urgent need for Honolulu to upgrade its street lighting, which at that time was provided by kerosene lamps. Edison demonstrated some electric light bulbs, and Kalākaua showed interest in the technical details. The Sun <b>newspaper</b> <b>reported</b> that Armstrong joked with Edison about generating electric power from Hawaiian volcanoes.

5|$|From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old {{homemaker}} named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse {{under the}} identity Kaycee Nicole, a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared {{the details of}} her battles with leukemia online. The Guardian <b>newspaper</b> <b>reported</b> that millions of Internet users read the fictional blog, as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials of living with an intelligent and optimistic daughter who was dying. On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's death of an aneurysm was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in online communities. Although many cards and gifts had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in Kansas, had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed. The photo representing the girl was found to be that of a basketball player from Gracemont, Oklahoma, who was alive. After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.|$|E
5|$|West Avenal {{departed}} Norfolk on {{a voyage}} to Leith, Scotland on 9 April 1919, but {{was forced to}} return to port after suffering an engine breakdown. Following repairs, she made several voyages between the East Coast of the United States and various destinations in South America, Spain, France and England. A few mentions of the ship crop up in contemporary news accounts. In August 1919, for example, The New York Times shows West Avenal slated for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 12 August. The following January, the <b>newspaper</b> <b>reported</b> that West Avenal was rammed by the British Leyland Line cargo ship Lacastrian. Departing New York in a dense fog {{on the morning of}} 9 January 1920 for Antwerp, Lacastrian rammed into the port side of West Avenal, which was inbound with a load of onions from Valencia, Spain. The damage was severe enough that West Avenals captain ordered her grounded to avoid sinking in New York Harbor. More than two weeks later, The Washington Post printed a photograph of West Avenal, still grounded off the Red Hook flats. Another report in the Times a year later showed her arrival in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 August 1920.|$|E

5|$|On October 14, 1853, {{following}} the National Woman's Rights Convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, Stone and Lucretia Mott addressed Cincinnati’s first women’s rights meeting, arranged by Henry Blackwell, a local businessman {{from a family}} of capable women, who had taken an interest in Stone. After that successful meeting, Stone accepted Blackwell's offer to arrange a lecturing tour for her in the western states – considered then to be those west of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Over the following thirteen weeks, Stone gave over forty lectures in thirteen cities, during which a report to the New York Tribune said she was stirring the West on women’s rights “as it is seldom stirred on any subject whatsoever.” After four lectures in Louisville, Stone was begged to repeat the entire course and told she was having more effect there than she could have anywhere else. An Indianapolis <b>newspaper</b> <b>reported</b> that Stone “set about two-thirds {{of the women in the}} town crazy after women’s rights and placed half the men in a similar predicament.” St. Louis papers said her lectures attracted the largest crowds ever assembled there, filling the city’s largest auditorium beyond its capacity of two thousand. Chicago papers praised her lectures as the best of the season, and said they were inspiring discussion and debate in the city’s homes and meeting places. When Stone headed home in January, 1854, she left behind incalculable influence.|$|E
5|$|On {{its first}} landfall, the {{tropical}} storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160km/h (100mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, {{with the worst}} conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate. While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest. Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals. Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights {{to and from the}} region, and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions. On those ships were more than 5,000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made. By November 15, five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines, four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines. Immediately following the disaster, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority. According to the PAGASA in its post-storm report, a total of 13 people lost their lives, 5 others remained unaccounted for, and 11 sustained injuries. One <b>newspaper</b> <b>reported</b> that a motorized craft in the Tañon Strait capsized {{at the height of the}} storm, forcing the rescue of 11 people. Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality. It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident.|$|E
