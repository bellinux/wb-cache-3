40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to treat aspects that are related to the {{sensitivity}} of data, information and knowledge transmitted through Internet of Things, helping all people interested in these new ICT technologies to become aware of some ethical issues. In this new media, which is no more in its infancy, the vulnerabilities and attacks are various, caused by technological advances and proliferated through lack of users’ awareness. This warning message is needed because of data, information and knowledge transfer from virtual to physical devices that are connected to wireless networks of different sizes and importance. The transfer is augmented by the extended use of new technologies as RFID, <b>NFC,</b> <b>sensors,</b> 3 G and 4 G and brings along the adjustment of the traditional information security threats to this new environment, as well as the emergence of new characteristic dangers. The problems treated here are of interest both for each of us, as individuals, and for the organizations managers – especially in a world in which the borderline between the physical and virtual life is becoming more and more difficult to draw...|$|E
40|$|Tooteko {{is a smart}} {{ring that}} allows to {{navigate}} any 3 D surface with your finger tips and get in return an audio content that is relevant {{in relation to the}} part of the surface you are touching in that moment. Tooteko can be applied to any tactile surface, object or sheet. However, in a more specific domain, it wants to make traditional art venues accessible to the blind, while providing support to the reading of the work for all through the recovery of the tactile dimension in order to facilitate the experience of contact with art that is not only "under glass. " The system is made of three elements: a high-tech ring, a tactile surface tagged with <b>NFC</b> <b>sensors,</b> and an app for tablet or smartphone. The ring detects and reads the NFC tags and, thanks to the Tooteko app, communicates in wireless mode with the smart device. During the tactile navigation of the surface, when the finger reaches a hotspot, the ring identifies the NFC tag and activates, through the app, the audio track that is related to that specific hotspot. Thus a relevant audio content relates to each hotspot. The production process of the tactile surfaces involves scanning, digitization of data and 3 D printing. The first experiment was modelled on the facade of the church of San Michele in Isola, made by Mauro Codussi in the late fifteenth century, and which marks the beginning of the Renaissance in Venice. Due to the absence of recent documentation on the church, the Correr Museum asked the Laboratorio di Fotogrammetria to provide it with the aim of setting up an exhibition about the order of the Camaldolesi, owners of the San Michele island and church. The Laboratorio has made the survey of the facade through laser scanning and UAV photogrammetry. The point clouds were the starting point for prototypation and 3 D printing on different supports. The idea of the integration between a 3 D printed tactile surface and sensors was born as a final thesis project at the Postgraduate Mastercourse in Digital Architecture of the University of Venice (IUAV) in 2012. Now Tooteko is now a start up company based in Venice, Italy...|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of real {{time is not}} solved by simply generating data {{which is based on}} a proxy of ingestion. If such data isn't being parsed and used in an effective fashion to assist patients, caregivers and medical professionals with adherence management, then it is not a useful application of expensive resources. It can be argued that the highest and best use of technologies such as smart blister packages, are in stratifying patient groups into good compliers and poor compliers. In this case, the poor compliers maybe coached more intensively, and the good compliers have a continued incentive to remain adherent. Real time in this case might be achieved by sending a regular series of SMS, frequency depending on their adherence status, and requesting them to upload their <b>NFC</b> <b>sensor</b> data through their handheld or wrist worn device.|$|R

A Baritone Sax enthusiast, {{he played in}} {{professor}} John Garvey’s Jazz band for seven years. In 1991 Federspiel joined Los Alamos National Laboratory where he built the real-time data acquisition and analysis system for the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector experiment, which reported evidence for neutrino oscillations in 1996. In 1997 he joined BiosGroup, and then in 1999 founded e-Xchange Advantage Corporation (e-XA) to deploy technology allowing institutional traders to control the information released to the market about their orders. e-XA became Pipeline Trading Systems LLC, which implemented Federspiel's inventions {{to reduce the cost}} inflicted by high-frequency trading on institutional trade execution. Federspiel's block market invention [...] was one of two major market structure experiments enabling institutions to direct information dissemination about block orders to likely trading counterparties, the other notable example being Liquidnet. In 2011, Pipeline reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations that a Pipeline affiliate may have traded with Pipeline customer orders without adequate disclosure. Federspiel agreed to pay the SEC $100,000 to settle the matter. Federspiel is currently Director of Business Development at Gentag, building strategic relationships that leverage the company's disposable, wireless near field communications (<b>NFC)</b> <b>sensor</b> technology. He also serves as a Director of the BiosGroup and CyberKey Data Security.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Contactless {{technologies}} such as RFID, <b>NFC,</b> and <b>sensor</b> net-works are vulnerable to mafia and distance frauds. Both frauds aim at passing an authentication protocol by cheating on the actual distance be-tween the prover and the verifier. To cope these security issues, distance-bounding protocols have been designed. However, none of the current proposals simultaneously resists to these two frauds without requiring additional memory and computation. The situation is even worse con-sidering that just a few distance-bounding protocols are {{able to deal with}} the inherent background noise on the communication channels. This ar-ticle introduces a noise-resilient distance-bounding protocol that resists to both mafia and distance frauds. The security of the protocol is ana-lyzed with respect to these two frauds in both scenarios, namely noisy and noiseless channels. Analytical expressions for the adversary’s suc-cess probabilities are provided, and are illustrated by experimental re-sults. The analysis, performed in an already existing framework for fair-ness reasons, demonstrates the undeniable advantage of the introduced lightweight design over the previous proposals...|$|R

40|$|Novel {{techniques}} for high-performance wireless power transmission and data interfacing with implantable medical devices (IMDs) were proposed. Several system- and circuit-level techniques were developed towards {{the design of}} a novel wireless data and power transmission link for a multi-channel inductively-powered wireless implantable neural-recording and stimulation system. Such wireless data and power transmission techniques have promising prospects for use in IMDs such as biosensors and neural recording/stimulation devices, neural interfacing experiments in enriched environments, radio-frequency identification (RFID), smartcards, near-field communication (<b>NFC),</b> wireless <b>sensors,</b> and charging mobile devices and electric vehicles. The contributions in wireless power transfer are the development of an RFID-based closed-loop power transmission system, a high-performance 3 -coil link with optimal design procedure, circuit-based theoretical foundation for magnetic-resonance-based power transmission using multiple coils, a figure-of-merit for designing high-performance inductive links, a low-power and adaptive power management and data transceiver ASIC {{to be used as a}} general-purpose power module for wireless electrophysiology experiments, and a Q-modulated inductive link for automatic load matching. In wireless data transfer, the contributions are the development of a new modulation technique called pulse-delay modulation for low-power and wideband near-field data communication and a pulse-width-modulation impulse-radio ultra-wideband transceiver for low-power and wideband far-field data transmission.

40|$|Near field {{communication}} (Nfc), a contact-range and short-lived message exchange technology, has {{in recent years}} become popular in relation to payment-cards, key-cards and ski-passes. With the release of, in particular, the Google Nexus S, which is capable of reading and writing Nfc tags as well as exchanging messages between devices by touch, the roles of consumers have changed from carriers of passive cards to that of active readers. This publicly available hardware technology, embedded into relatively cheap connected smartphones, creates a new field of possibilities in which a complete and complex Nfc-based system can be developed solely by means of software. In this thesis work, the research is {{in relation to the}} field of Nfc, ranging from the physical characteristics of the technology to the design of the Nfc API on the Android platform. Nfc-based apps, library and systems are designed, developed and evaluated in terms of performance. The Android apps which are implemented are WiFi and Bluetooth connectors as well as an Nfc-sensor value visualizer. Additionally, two full systems are developed which consists of an Android app, backend server, database and web or PC-client frontend. These two systems are: a web-based high-performance live statistical visualizer of <b>Nfc</b> <b>sensor</b> values and an Nfc-scan based product endorsement, Like-event, presenting the picture and name of a user endorsing a product on the in-store advertisement displays on top of the ads. The system for scanning, distributing and presenting statistics on sensor-values from a specially crafted NfcV-enabled sensor is evaluated in terms of performance along the chain of events starting at the Nfc tag introduction and being dispatched on the mobile phone and ending with the calculations and plot-generation carried out by the browser connected to the backend via a WebSocket. The evaluations show that in a use-case in which the user holds a tablet in one hand and an Nfc-enabled smartphone in the other, the user would experience a mean-delay of 515 milliseconds between putting the device against an NfcV-sensor and seeing the statistical plot, containing the last 1000 values, updated in the browser on the tablet. Additionally, the user would experience a mean-delay of 74 milliseconds between the values being presented on the mobile device itself until they are presented on the tablet in the case of constant streaming from an NfcV connected sensor. The conclusion is that this delay of 74 milliseconds is sufficiently low for the user to feel that the devices are tightly coupled, making it natural {{to pay attention to the}} tablet when scanning sensors. Possible use-cases for this include a technician walking between built-in passive NfcV sensors on the factory floor or a nurse walking between patients wearing bandages with built-in passive health-sensors. Finally, the work is discussed in terms of ethics and social impact as development in the tele-healthcare field continues, and a set of Nfc-based applications are suggested including Nfc-tags for interactive product customization, company car management and app deployment...|$|R

40|$|Problem addressed? An {{average of}} 14 bikes stolen {{every day in}} Dublin (Dublin Cycling Campaign) {{this is a real}} issue for cyclists. More often than not the bike is never seen again. When a person has their bike stolen they will most likely report it to the police, An officer will file a report and for the {{majority}} of cases that is where the issue will end. Police are too busy with what they deem to be more serious crime to invest much time in a bike theft. Therefore, broader thinking is required to address this issue. My solution is to leverage the growing trends of crowd sourcing and mobile applications. Crowd sourcing the bike riding community to help one another find stolen bikes. Initially this project will be focused on bikes but further iterations of the application could easily be expanded to include other high value items such as cars. Three key feature of the application will be 1. Notifying a user if there is unauthorized movement of their bike. This will take place through an external sensor placed on the bike which will communicate with the user’s phone 2. Being able to browse a shared database of bikes listed as stolen by users and having the ability to report a suspected sighting of a stolen bike, which will notify the original owner and relevant authority’s. 3. Being able to scan the immediate area for bikes that have been registered as stolen and are using the sensors. Should bikes listed as stolen be found by the system all relevant information will be displayed to the user along with an approximate distance to the stolen bike. This is triangulated via the signal strength of the Bluetooth sensor on the bike. The user can then contact the original owner through the app and let them know they have a legitimate sighting of their stolen bike confirmed through the sensor technology. The technology used to implement this solution will include an application built on the android platform, using googles cloud hosted firebase database, google maps API integration and remote sensors. These sensors contain a micro-computer powered by an ARM chip. The sensors include motion and temperature scanners along with <b>NFC</b> compatibility. The <b>sensors</b> transmit signals through a 2. 4 GHz frequency of Bluetooth with a range of up to 70 m. The application will facilitate users to help one another locate their stolen bikes. Also provide a means to prevent theft occurring via the remote sensors...|$|R
