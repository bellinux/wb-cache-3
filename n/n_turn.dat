We explore a database of nearly 230 000 transactions for residential properties in the Paris area over the 1973 – 2001 period. We develop a factorial model that may capture the systematic link between residential prices {{and a set of}} predefined economic variables or a linear combination of these economic variables. We assume that capital growth rates in real estate are related to the variables we defined in the last paragraph. We measure this link which underlines the ‘true path ’ of the real estate market: in that way we can develop an index as a function of many other indices. The methodology we develop, based on a multifactor approach to apartment price movements in the long run, has two main advantages over traditional indices. Firstly, we are able to identify the main driving factors for the Paris residential market.

40|$|Understanding the {{distribution}} of taxa and associated traits across different environments {{is one of the}} central questions in microbial ecology. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies are presently generating huge volumes of data to address this biogeographical topic. However, these studies are often focused on specific environment types or processes leading to the production of individual, unconnected datasets. The large amounts of legacy sequence data with associated metadata that exist can be harnessed to better place the genetic information found in these surveys into a wider environmental context. Here we introduce a software program, seqenv, to carry out precisely such a task. It automatically performs similarity searches of short sequences against the "nt" nucleotide database provided by NCBI and, out of every hit, extracts if it is available the textual metadata field. After collecting all the isolation sources from all the search results, we run a text mining algorithm to identify and parse words that are associated with the Environmental Ontology (EnvO) controlled vocabulary. This, <b>n</b> <b>turn,</b> enables us to determine both in which environments individual sequences or taxa have previously been observed and, by weighted summation of those results, to summarize complete samples. We present two demonstrative applications of seqenv to a survey of ammonia oxidizing archaea as well as to a plankton paleome dataset from the Black Sea. These demonstrate the ability of the tool to reveal novel patterns in HTS and its utility in the fields of environmental source tracking, paleontology, and s of microbial biogeography...|$|E
40|$|In {{this model}} an {{extremely}} collimated ultra-relativistic ejecta collides with a dense cloud surrounding the central engine, producing gamma-rays via synhcrotron process. The ejecta {{is taken as}} a standard candle, while assuming a gaussian distribution in thickness and density of the surrounding cloud, {{as seen from the}} central engine. Due to the cloud high density, the synchrotron emission would be an instantaneous phenomenon (fast cooling synhcrotron radiation), so a GRB duration corresponds to the time that the ejecta takes to pass through the cloud. Fitting the model with the observed bimodal distribution of GRB’s durations, we obtained n ∼ 3 × 10 17 cm − 3 and L ∼ 2 × 10 13 cm for the mean density and mean thickness of the surrounding cloud, which yield Mcloud ∼ 6 M ⊙ for its mass, and E ∼ 10 48 erg, Γ ∼ 10 3, and ζm ∼ 10 − 2 for the ejecta parameters.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of convex sets when {{inside and outside}} observations are available is often needed in current research applications. An algorithm based on a discriminant analysis criterion was proposed and discussed in R'emon (15). The key idea {{of this paper is}} to generalize this Discriminant Analysis (DA) Algorithm to non convex domains. A class of non convex bodies is introduced in which the best estimate of the unknown domain is to be found. Simulations are done and comparisons are made with respect to a natural candidate for {{estimation of}} non convex bodies. Key Words Poisson Point Process, Convex hull, Pattern Recognition, Discriminant Analysis, Voronoi Tessellation. 1. The inside/outside problem for convex bodies Suppose that X is a Poisson point process within a fixed finite window F ae IR d. In F, we have a compact convex domain D. We suppose that the Poisson process X is homogeneous on F, with density. We observe a number t 1 of realizations of X in F, from which <b>n</b> <b>turn</b> out to be inside the domain D and m outside of D (t = n +m). We want to estimate the unknown convex domain D. This problem is indeed the third problem of Grenander (6). The solution we propose to the problem in R'emon (15) is the modification of a classical discriminant analysis criterion. This criterion was developed to distinguish between two disjoint convex domains. The situation here is quite similar as we have two disjoint domains, D and its complementary D = F n D. The main difference lies in the non convexity of D. 2.

The key idea in this presentation {{is to try to}} estimate the measure of a convex domain when inside and outside realizations are randomly observed. We can think here to oil fields detection, population polls, pattern recognition, etc. This problem is known in the literature as the third problem of Grenander [1]. Though the simplicity of the problem, it is indeed difficult to use, for the {{estimation of}} the original convex set, all the relevant information one gets, especially this amount of information coming from outside observations. In 1977, Ripley and Rasson [12] proposed a solution to a similar problem formulated by D. G. Kendall: the estimation of a convex domain when only inside observations are available. See also Moore [6]. The solution in that case is a dilatation of the convex hull statistic of the inside data. We propose here an estimator for the measure of this convex unknown domain. This estimator is a generalization of the one proposed by Ripley and Rasson [12]. A comparison with another possible estimator is given.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between international investment law and cultural heritage has commanded little attention and only recently. Certainly, international investment law {{has become one}} of the most prominent branches of international law. Its development has been strictly connected to the soaring growth of bilateral treaties on the promotion and protection of foreign investment and free trade agreements with foreign investment chapters. <b>n</b> <b>turn,</b> the status and place of cultural heritage under international law has grown, significantly progressing from some provisions included in international humanitarian conventions on the protection of heritage during armed conflicts. In light of the few studies existing on the subject of this thesis, which have in general concluded that conflictual and ambiguous relations exist between international investment law and cultural heritage, this thesis proposes to analyze this relation from both the substantive and dispute settlement standpoints. The idea that the relation between foreign investment and cultural heritage, regulated in different ways and ‘intensities’ by international law, could be positive was a general premise for all the research. Indeed, among investments, foreign investments have a great importance in a moment of economic crisis and difficulty in finding appropriate resources to safeguard heritage. Investments are hence vital for culture. The researches and analyses carried out for the thesis have shown that investment treaties often contain a number of provisions concerning culture and cultural heritage. With regard to international disputes, investment disputes have involved or touched upon different cultural forms and expressions: from UNESCO sites to cultural industries, to lieux de mémoire and indigenous communities’ heritage. Further, quite surprisingly, the international rules protecting foreign investors have sometimes been invoked, or resorted to, by subjects that had invested specifically in cultural ‘resources’ or to protect economic activities based on indigenous communities’ culture. The studies and researches carried out for this thesis have made it possible to reach and demonstrate a number of conclusions. First, the researches carried out have demonstrated that foreign investments are necessary to protect, safeguard, preserve and promote any form of cultural expression, and a strong interaction exists between the international regulation of foreign investments and cultural heritage. It has thus been shown that there exists a symbiotic {{relationship between}} international investment law and cultural heritage. Second, it has been possible to prove that, within international culture and cultural heritage law, there exists a ‘legitimate space’ for international investment law. Symmetrically, international investment arbitration can represent a valid cultural dispute settlement mechanism. Lastly, it is possible to assert that merging international rules on foreign investments and international rules on culture or cultural heritage can lead to create, or support the existence of, a more transparent, legitimate and rule-of-law-based system. In the light of all these considerations, the research, analysis and reflection carried out for the thesis has demonstrated how positive the relation between international investment law and cultural heritage can be fro states and the society. This, without denying any potentially negative effect. One might hope that the results obtained allow to adapt any practice in the field of culture. The protection of cultural heritage can indeed be strongly enhanced through the regulation of foreign investment...|$|E

40|$|Trace metals (e. g. Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ni) are {{important}} micronutrients that {{have historically been}} regarded as toxic pollutants rather than essential components of riverine and estuarine environments. The toxicity and behavior of trace metals, in response to physical and biogeochemical processes, are determined by their individual physico-chemical properties. In this dissertation, the vertical transformation of trace metals across oxic-anoxic interfaces was investigated at two sites, a Fe-rich freshwater river with minimal sulfide and an estuary with elevated Mn and H 2 S concentrations. Sediment profiles obtained from the Chattahoochee River showed that dissolved arsenic, present as As(V) only, is scavenged by Fe-oxides and accumulates directly below the sediment-water interface. Depth profiles also indicate that As(V) fluxes into the overlying water during baseflow conditions as well as after storm events. The significant correlation between Fe(II) and As(V) suggest that As(V) is released from Fe-oxides during their microbial reduction. By implementing a series of sediment incubations under increasing As(V) loads, {{it was determined that}} adsorption onto Fe-oxides and microbially mediated reductive dissolution of these mineral phases drive arsenic cycling in this sediment. These incubations also reveal {{for the first time that}} arsenic, even in low concentrations, <b>n</b> <b>turn,</b> arsenic loading impacts iron cycling by stimulating anaerobic respiration of Fe-oxides and promoting recrystallization of authigenic Fe-oxides, up to a toxicity threshold up to a few micromolar in concentrations. A combination of in situ measurements with discrete water sampling was utilized to determine the effects of tidal cycling on the distribution of trace metals under changing redox conditions during two consecutive tidal cycles at Station 858 in the Chesapeake Bay. Estuarine circulation patterns driven by tidal oscillations, a defined pycnocline, and the shallow sill (~ 20 m) of the Chesapeake Bay promoted bottom water anoxia during the summer months that allowed dissolved sulfide and reduced manganese to accumulate below the oxycline. The distribution of barium (conservative freshwater tracer) and uranium (conservative seawater tracer) across the pycnocline over the two tidal cycles indicated that the source of dissolved species was surficial sediments. During ebb and flood tides, the shear stress from the bottom waters flowing over the sediment seems to episodically promote the advection of porewaters enriched in dissolved sulfide, manganese, uranium, barium, lead, chromium, and copper. The selective enrichment of these trace metals appears to be controlled by their reactivity with sulfide. In contrast, cobalt and nickel are retained in sediments by adsorbed or incorporated in FeS and FeS 2, while arsenic co-precipitates with sulfide or iron sulfide minerals. Overall, this study demonstrates that natural aquatic systems are complex environments where the interplay between biological, chemical, and physical processes affects the distribution of trace metals over short time scales. While a great wealth of knowledge can be obtained by laboratory experiments with synthetic solutions or pure cultures of organisms, a combination of in situ measurements and incubations with real samples in necessary to characterize the processes regulating the cycling of trace metals in aquatic systems.
