Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special <b>natural</b> <b>monument</b> status.|$|E

25|$|The Mino Shibas {{tended to}} have thick, prick ears, and possessed a sickle tail, rather than the common curled tail found on most modern Shibas. The San'in Shibas were larger than most modern shibas, and tended to be black, without the common tan and white accents found on modern black-and-tan shibas. When the study of Japanese dogs was formalized in the early and mid-20th century, these three strains were {{combined}} into one overall breed, the Shiba Inu. The first Japanese breed standard for the Shiba, the Nippo Standard, was published in 1934. In December 1936, the Shiba Inu was recognized as a <b>Natural</b> <b>Monument</b> of Japan through the Cultural Properties Act, {{largely due to the}} efforts of Nippo (Nihon Ken Hozonkai), the Association for the Preservation of the Japanese Dog.|$|E
25|$|Yagul <b>Natural</b> <b>Monument,</b> {{located in}} the Tlacolula Valley, 35km {{to the east of}} Oaxaca city, was a {{settlement}} {{in the early part of}} the Monte Alban 1 Period (500 CE). It flourished as an urban centre, following the abandonment of Monte Alban around 800 BCE. However, even Yagul was abandoned for a brief period, before it became a city-state in Oaxaca. This status continued until the Spanish Conquistadores invaded the valley, which was then a settlement of Zapotecs. The fortified complex is laid out in three zones; the central part approached through a series of steps is a built-up platform that leads to the temples and palaces. It has the largest ball court in the valley and stated to be the largest in the Mesoamerican region. The palace of the rulers is an enormous monolith with six porticos and several entrances, built in stone and clay and covered with stucco. The main tomb has a stone façade, which is beautified with carved human heads and features hieroglyphic motifs on the door slab on both sides. To the south of the Palace of the Six Porticos, there is a narrow street that is paved with stone mosaics extracted from the nearby mountain. The street terminates into a long, narrow room called the 'Sala de Consejo' (Council Chamber).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of a relationship between current foreign tourism and <b>natural</b> <b>monuments</b> in Prague. Prague is touristically attractive mainly due to its cultural and architectural monuments, however it is also characterized by its specific relief and relatively well preserved nature. Nature motivated tourism in an urban destination is a rarely discussed topic in the academic literature. The main object of this thesis is to find, whether there is connection between foreign incoming tourism in <b>natural</b> <b>monuments</b> of Prague {{and to find out}} what impact this connection has. The research itself is divided into two parts with two different qualitative methods used. The first part uses a content analysis of chosen texts, in the second part the recreational potential of specific area was detected via case study in the urban district Prague - Lysolaje. The influence of <b>natural</b> <b>monuments</b> on the tourism in Prague was confirmed, but with comparison to the cultural <b>monuments</b> the <b>natural</b> <b>monuments</b> don't have much influence on the tourism in Prague.
