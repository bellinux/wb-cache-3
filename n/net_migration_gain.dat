40|$|Migration is {{a process}} which is {{difficult}} to measure accurately due to an absence of any mandatory system for registering a move to, from or within the United Kingdom (UK). This problem is exacerbated by inconsistency in statistical reporting, as three national statistics agencies produce migration statistics for the four countries of the UK: the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales, the National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. They draw upon different data sources, use different estimation methods and produce different outputs. What results is a data landscape which is not consistent and is missing some key information, notably migration where a person moves between local authorities which are located in different UK countries. This thesis makes {{the case for a}} consistent methodology to be employed in estimating migration in the UK. A key contribution is made through the harmonisation of available data and the use of an iterative proportional fitting method to estimate the missing flow data. The resulting output is a consistent UK wide dataset of migration at the local authority level for {{the first decade of the}} 21 st century, disaggregated by age and sex. Analysis of the dataset reveals a decline in the longstanding pattern of counterurbanisation which has characterised UK migration for the past 50 years, driven to a large extent by the fall in the intensity of migration from urban to rural areas. <b>Net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>gain</b> in the north from the south is reversed mid-decade, owing largely to an increase in moves from urban north to urban south.

There are large regional differences in net migration: southern Europe, and especially Spain, experienced massive immigration in 2000 - 2008 while many countries in south-eastern, eastern and central Europe registered migration losses. In total, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> in Europe amounted to 28. 4 million in 1980 - 2008, of which 22. 2 million `net migrants' were reported in European Union (EU) countries.

40|$|This {{annual report}} is the 15 th {{in a series}} that {{examines}} trends in temporary and permanent migration to and from New Zealand. The report updates trends to 2014 / 15 and compares recent immigration patterns with patterns identified in previous years. Canterbury returns to normal Canterbury had the second highest regional <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>gain</b> of 6, 400 people. A net outflow of permanent and long-term migrants followed the earthquake in February 2011, but since 2011 / 12 the number of arrivals has steadily increased. Although {{the number of people}} approved for Essential Skills work visas in Canterbury in 2014 / 15 increased, it was a much smaller increase than in the previous three years, suggesting the rebuild might have reached capacity. Net migration continues to grow A <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>gain</b> of 58, 300 people occurred in 2014 / 15, the highest net gain ever recorded. This was due to a low net migration loss of New Zealand citizens (5, 600 people) combined with a large net gain of non–New Zealand citizens (63, 900 people). Net migration is forecast to rise slightly until September 2015 before dropping back. International student numbers on the increase again A total of 84, 856 international students were approved to study in New Zealand, an increase of 16 per cent from 2013 / 14, the second year-on-year increase. China has remained the largest source country of international students (27 per cent) followed by India (23 per cent) and South Korea (6 per cent). Numbers of temporary workers increased across the three main work categories A total of 170, 814 people were granted a work visa, an increase of 10 per cent from 2013 / 14. Those approved to work in New Zealand under the Essential Skills policy rose 8 per cent from 2013 / 14. This was the third year-on-year increase in Essential Skills workers since the global financial crisis, and it reflects the ongoing demand for labour in New Zealand. One in six international students gained residence International students have become an important source of skilled migrants for New Zealand and in other OECD countries. By 30 June 2015, 17 per cent of students had transitioned to residence five years after their first student visa. In 2014 / 15, 43 per cent of skilled principal migrants were former international students. Skilled principal migrants largely have New Zealand work experience Research shows migrants have better employment outcomes if they have New Zealand work experience. By 30 June 2015, 18 per cent of temporary workers had transitioned to residence three years after their first work visa Permanent migration In 2014 / 15, 43, 085 people were approved for resident visas, down 2 per cent from 2013 / 14. The increase in those approved under the Skilled/Business stream (6 per cent increase) was not enough to offset the decrease in those coming through the Family stream (down 14 per cent). India is the largest source of skilled migrants In 2014 / 15, 21, 165 people were approved through the Skilled Migrant Category, almost half of all residence approvals (49 per cent). The number of Skilled Migrant Category approvals increased 4 per cent from 2013 / 14. China is the largest source country of family-sponsored migrants In 2014 / 15, 8, 922 people were approved for residence through the Partnership Category and 4, 477 people were approved through the Parent Category. Family approvals made up 35 per cent of all residence approvals.

40|$|Overview Australia is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} world’s major ‘immigration nations‘(together with New Zealand, Canada and the USA). Since 1945, when the first federal immigration portfolio was created, over 7. 5 million people have settled here and Australia’s overseas-born resident population—estimated to be 28. 2 per cent of the population in June 2015 —{{is considered}} high compared to most other OECD countries. Permanent migrants enter Australia via one of two distinct programs—the Migration Program for skilled and family migrants or the Humanitarian Program for refugees and those in refugee-like situations. Each year, the Australian Government allocates places, or quotas, for people wanting to migrate permanently to Australia under these two programs. Until recently, the United Kingdom (UK) had always been the primary source country for permanent migration to Australia. However, for the first time in the history of Australia, China surpassed the UK as Australia’s primary source of permanent migrants in 2010 – 11. Since then, China and India have continued to provide the highest number of permanent migrants. New Zealand (NZ) citizens also feature highly in the number of settler arrivals, but they are not counted under Australia’s Migration Program unless they apply for (and are granted) a permanent visa. Over the decades, migration program planning numbers have fluctuated according to the priorities and economic and political considerations of the government of the day. However, it is important to note that the Australian Government’s immigration policy focus has changed markedly since 1945, when attracting general migrants (primarily from the UK) was the priority, to focussing on attracting economic migrants and temporary (predominantly skilled) migrants. Currently the planning figure for the Migration Program is 190, 000 places (it has remained at this record high level since 2012 – 13), with skilled migrants comprising the majority. One of the most significant developments in the dynamics of migration to Australia since the late 1990 s has been the growth in temporary migration. The <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>gain</b> from long-term temporary movement exceeded that from permanent movement in 1999 – 00 and there were record numbers of temporary entrants in 2000 – 01. Many of these entrants arrived on either student or Temporary Work (Skilled) (subclass 457) visas. Unlike the permanent Migration Program, the level of temporary migration to Australia is not determined or subject to quotas or caps by Government, but is demand driven.   The 457 visa also provides a pathway for skilled workers and their dependants to apply for permanent residence and many students are also eligible to apply for permanent visas under the Migration Program at the completion of their courses. The largest contribution to net overseas migration (NOM) in recent years has been from people on temporary visas—mostly comprised of overseas students and temporary skilled migrants and the rate of Australia’s population growth has increased significantly over the few years largely driven by an increase in NOM...|$|E

40|$|Internal {{migration}} {{has been}} a key component in Spain’s sub-national population dynamics over the last century, particularly during the 1960 s and 1970 s, when the rural exodus was at its peak. Since then, as fertility levels have declined and {{the economy has been}} restructured, internal migration has continued to play an important, albeit different, role in shaping the distribution of the population across the country. This report, which is {{one of a series of}} studies of population dynamics and internal migration in different European countries, considers some of the more recent changes in the distribution of the population and in internal migration during each of the two calendar years, 1988 and 1994, at two spatial scales, provinces and municipalities. Whilst both the natural change and residual <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> components of population change are mapped at both geographical scales, the demographic dynamism of the ‘coastal’ provinces is evident when contrasted, in aggregate terms, with changes taking place in the ‘industrial’, ‘urban’ and ‘rural’ provinces. A Webb classification demonstrates the extent to which the number of municipalities with <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>gains</b> increased between 1988 and 1994, and a size classification suggests a shift of population expansion down the urban hierarchy. Registration data for the two annual periods are used to examine the changes in the volume, geographical distribution and demographic structure of internal migration. Whilst it is clear that the volume of migration between municipalities in the same province has increased between 1988 and 1994 more rapidly than the migration taking place between municipalities in different provinces, the efficiency with which the latter redistributes population has declined. Spatial patterns of aggregate inter-provincial <b>net</b> <b>migration,</b> <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rates, migration efficiencies and major flows are outlined but no evidence is found of a relationship between <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and unemployment or density at the municipality scale. Age variations in <b>migration</b> propensities and <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> balances give some indications of the variety of determinants that influence directional migration flows at different stages in the life course. The report presents the profiles of national migration rate schedules in 1988 and 1994 and examines the spatial patterns of <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> for five-year age groups. Provinces are classified according to their migration efficiencies in the two annual periods and age-specific efficiencies are examined for selected provinces to demonstrate major changes in more detail. Migration of those of working age accounts for the large majority of inter-provincial movements and migration efficiencies of those in three broad working age groups (young, middle and older) provide a useful summary of the main patterns. Finally, the report makes use of the information available from the registration data on place of birth as well as on place of residence before and after the move. New insights are given on the proportion of inter-provincial migration that involves return to the province of birth, the age variations in return proportions and the major flows of return migrants between provinces...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{patterns}} of internal migration in Germany have been discussed under the headings of East-West movements and sub- and re-urbanisation. This paper argues that the intense scientific and public debate that ignited about the possible causes and consequences of internal migration {{should be based on}} a clear understanding of how internal migration flows impact on regional population change. Using the German Internal Migration (GIM) database, a unique new dataset that holds annual interregional migration counts drawn from the population register for 397 regions with temporally consistent boundaries, this paper aims to provide a more comprehensive picture of the spatial structure of inter-county migration in Germany and how it has changed over the period 1995 - 2010. To reduce the complexity of the county-level flow data and to facilitate the identification of patterns and trends, county-to-county flows were analysed using a spatial framework of 132 'analytical regions'. The results show that the intensity of migration between East German regions has been higher than East-West migration throughout the period, suggesting that the former type of migration has a stronger impact on rural population decline than commonly believed in the literature. Following a strong suburbanisation pattern in the 1990 s, over the last decade, migration between counties in eastern Germany has resulted in a growing concentration of population in the cities of Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden. Increasing <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>gains</b> were recorded by many urban cores across Germany. The trend was driven by both continuing in-migration of young adults in search for education and employment, and by a cessation of the long-term trend of family out-migration to the cities' suburban and non-metropolitan hinterlands.
