40|$|AbstractRecently <b>new</b> <b>operations</b> {{have been}} defined for soft sets. In this paper, we study some {{important}} properties {{associated with these}} <b>new</b> <b>operations.</b> A collection of all soft sets with respect to <b>new</b> <b>operations</b> give rise to four idempotent monoids. Then {{with the help of}} these monoids we can study semiring (hemiring) structures of soft sets. Some of these semirings (hemirings) are actually lattices. Finally, we show that soft sets with a fixed set of parameters are MV algebras and BCK algebras...|$|R

5|$|Finally, in September, {{there was}} Operation Comet, {{in which the}} division's three brigades were to land in the Netherlands and each capture a river crossing. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave, and the last was the bridge over the River Rhine at Arnhem. Planning for Comet was well {{advanced}} when on 10September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a <b>new</b> <b>operation</b> was proposed with the same objectives as Comet but {{to be carried out}} by three divisions of the First Allied Airborne Army.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Romney left Bain & Company to cofound the {{spin-off}} {{private equity}} investment firm, Bain Capital. He had initially refrained from accepting Bill Bain's offer to head the new venture, until Bain rearranged the terms in a complicated partnership structure {{so that there was}} no financial or professional risk to Romney. Bain and Romney raised the $37million in funds needed to start the <b>new</b> <b>operation,</b> which had seven employees. Romney held the titles of president and managing general partner. Though he was the sole shareholder of the firm, publications also referred to him as managing director or CEO.|$|E
5|$|In all, 45 Israelis were killed, 50 were wounded, and 5 {{captured}} by Egypt. Of them, 29 killed and 34 wounded were from Zur's 54th Company. Egyptian sources reported 15 killed and 30 wounded, although {{this does not}} include the casualties suffered by the intercepted reinforcements from Majdal. Even before the final retreating troops came home, the Givati command had issued a <b>new</b> <b>operation</b> order, calling for renewed artillery and air bombardment of Isdud, and small harassment operations. The 57th Battalion, which gained a bad reputation after its failures in Yibna and Isdud, carried out several such successful operations, regaining prestige in the brigade.|$|E

5|$|At this point, the Australian {{commander}} {{issued a}} <b>new</b> <b>operation</b> order, reassigning {{the task of}} capturing the Christmas Hills area to the 24th Infantry Brigade and pulling the 20th Infantry Brigade back to Nongora to rest up for {{the next phase of}} the campaign, which would see them advance up the coast. The strain of the advance along the coastal route, which had been the 24th Infantry Brigade's main effort, however, had taken its toll. As a result, the 2/32nd Infantry Battalion was called forward again as the 2/28th was plagued by sickness and the 2/43rd was physically worn out. On the night of 4/5 December, the Japanese withdrew from their forward positions, leaving behind a large quantity of equipment and their dead. The following morning, a composite force of Australians from the 2/32nd and 2/43rd Infantry Battalions then took up the advance towards the Christmas Hills, ranging west, and undertaking a series of flanking moves in order to break into the Japanese main defensive position, where the Japanese were well-entrenched. A firefight ensued in which six Japanese and seven Australians were killed, before the Australian attack was turned back.|$|E
5|$|In early September {{the brigade}} {{prepared}} for Operation Comet, {{during which the}} 1st Airborne Division's three brigades were to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave and finally the bridge over the River Rhine at Arnhem. The objective of the British 1st Parachute Brigade would be the bridge at Arnhem. Planning for Comet was well advanced when on 10September the mission was cancelled.

5|$|The brigade's next {{operation}} {{was scheduled for}} early September 1944. Codenamed Comet, the plan called for the 1st Airborne Division's three brigades to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings.

The objective of the 4th Parachute Brigade would be the bridge at Grave. Planning for Comet was well advanced when on the 10September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a <b>new</b> <b>operation,</b> Market Garden, was proposed whose objectives {{were the same as}} those of Comet but would this time be carried out by three divisions of the 1st Allied Airborne Army.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} six <b>new</b> architecture-altering <b>operations</b> {{that provide}} a way to dynamically determine the architecture of a multi-part program during a run of genetic programming. The <b>new</b> <b>operations</b> are patterned after the naturally occurring operations of gene duplication and gene deletion and are motivated by Ohno's provocative book Evolution by Means of Gene Duplication. The <b>new</b> <b>operations</b> are branch duplication, argument duplication, branch creation, argument creation, branch deletion, and argument deletion. These operations dynamically change the architecture of various programs during a run of genetic programming. The <b>new</b> <b>operations</b> can also be interpreted as providing an automated way to specialize and generalize programs. The paper demonstrates that problems can be solved while the architecture is being evolved. 1 INTRODUCTION In nature, sexual recombination ordinarily recombines {{a part of the}} chromosome of one parent with a corresponding (homologous) part of the second [...] ...|$|R
5|$|She {{moved to}} BAM Racing in October 2001 and drove her first (and only) {{race in the}} NASCAR Winston West Series (now called K Pro Series West) at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that same month. Robinson {{was sent to a}} driving school to {{familiarize}} herself with the track, and Kranefuss granted her permission to race. She retired due to a car failure while running in third position. Team owner Tony Morgenthau first noticed Robinson at an ARCA race at Pocono Raceway the previous year when she made contact with his driver Matty Mullins who was sent into the wall. He had been impressed with her pace at Las Vegas. He spoke to Robinson after the race and asked her why she had not competed in more events. He later offered her a multi-year contract which she signed in December 2001. Her crew chief was former Busch Series driver Eddie Sharp. She attempted to qualify for 24-races during the 2002 season since her team had no owner points because they were a <b>new</b> <b>operation.</b> Robinson went to Kranefuss to terminate her contract with his team. She ran for the Rookie of the Year award, but was seen by the Chicago Tribune as having little chance of securing the honor.|$|E
