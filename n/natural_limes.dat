40|$|Due {{to their}} {{physical}} and chemical properties, mortars made with lime {{are considered to be}} more compatible with historic fabrics than those made with artificial cements. This paper explores the mechanical properties of clay brick masonry bound with hydraulic limes of different strengths, and hydrated calcium lime (CL 90 -s) with no hydraulic properties. Masonry wallettes built with a CL 90 -s mortar and two <b>natural</b> <b>limes</b> of hydraulic strengths 3. 5 and 5 MPa (NHL 3. 5 and NHL 5) respectively were tested for compressive and flexural strength. The strength of the bond between the mortar and the brick was also measured. The paper concludes that CL mortar masonry displays a plastic behaviour in compression while the mechanical behaviour of the HL mortar masonry is of a brittle nature, with wallettes splitting along the centre, cracks above and below the vertical joints and spalling of brick and mortar. It also concludes that neither the rate of late strength gain of masonry, nor its ultimate compressive strength or its bond strength are determined by the mortar nature, thus a mortar of low hydraulic strength can provide stronger masonry than an emminetly hydraulic mortar. The paper agrees with previous authors on that the masonry?s compressive strength is more sensitive to the brick-mortar bond strength than to the compressive strength of the mortar. Finally, the paper demonstrates that the NHL-mortar compressive strength increases at a higher rate, and reaches higher final values than that of the NHLmasonry whereas, in contrast, the CL 90 -s mortar is weaker in compression than the CL 90 -s mortar masonry...|$|E

Possibilities were investigated of combating the very resistant permanent spores of the economically significant agent of the clubroot (Plasmodiophora brassicae) by adding antagonists (Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Streptomyces graminofaciens) and <b>natural</b> <b>lime</b> (lime gyttja). A considerable reduction in infestation was achieved under favourable climatic growth conditions (cabim-Type greenhouse in the summer months) employing tested antagonists. Positive interactions of Pseudomonas fl. and Streptomyces gr. with the <b>natural</b> <b>lime</b> additives increased the infestation reducing effect of Calcium-ions in the plant substrate. Under unfavourable growth conditions (cabin-type greenhouse in the winter months with additional lighting) only Streptomyces gr. (without <b>natural</b> <b>lime</b> additives) proved able to reduce infestation. For infested compost, the combined addition of antagonists and <b>natural</b> <b>lime</b> are recommended for suppression of clubroot after the second decomposting phase. The results of the biotests conducted show that the reproducibility is too low for any decisions to be taken on the operation of composting installations (as recommended in LAGA-Memorendum M 10) which would be of significance to waste management.

30|$|Despite {{the same}} {{long history in}} the use of lime, China is far behind of Europe in the {{research}} of lime in modern times. Due to the wet slaking and lake of grinding technique, the ancient Chinese did not realize the hydraulic properties of limes, which can only be observed through dry slaking with or without grinding. Until 2008 <b>natural</b> hydraulic <b>lime</b> was introduced from Europe into China and has been researched comprehensively, but exclusively for conservation of cultural heritage. Adhesives, grouting slurries, restoration mortar for natural stones and kilned bricks (from traditional green bricks to firebricks) based on modified <b>natural</b> hydraulic <b>limes</b> (may be defined as formulated lime, FL, according to EN 459 - 1 / 2010) have been developed. With help of modern construction chemistry achievements, <b>natural</b> hydraulic <b>limes</b> can be modified to meet almost all kinds of requirements for conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. The new challenges will be grout to seal cracks from adobe and earthen masonry.|$|R
30|$|There {{are a few}} {{research}} works {{carried out}} to develop grouting materials {{on the basis of}} <b>natural</b> hydraulic <b>lime</b> for structural purpose [15 – 18]. The results were controversy. It is however clear, due to high shrinkage, the mixture of <b>natural</b> hydraulic <b>limes</b> only with water is not suitable for grouting. They need to be modified with help of modern construction chemistry. From 2008, a system of new adhesives based on modified <b>natural</b> hydraulic <b>limes</b> has been developed. The system consists of 2 products; the first one is an adhesive for refitting and emergency re-bonding, with pull-off strength on marble substrate of app. 0.5  N/mm 2, after 28  days, can reach up to 1.0  N/mm 2 after app. 180  days. Second one is a grout with excellent flow properties for injection and cavity filling. Both formulations are already patented in China [5, 6]. The practice to rescue Huashan Pictographs (Figure  1) and other natural stone monuments has proven their satisfied results. However, the durability and application under various climate zones need to be further studied.|$|R
30|$|In 2010, new European {{building}} lime standard EN 459 - 1, modified from previous version, was published [12]. Comparing to old version, <b>natural</b> hydraulic <b>lime</b> (NHL), formulated lime (FL) and hydraulic lime (HL) {{under the category}} of limes with hydraulic properties has been clearly specified. <b>Natural</b> hydraulic <b>lime,</b> its use can be dated back to Romans [13], is a lime with hydraulic properties produced by burning of more or less argillaceous or siliceous limestones with reduction to powder by slaking with or without grinding. No other additions are allowed except grinding agents up to 0.1 wt%. Hydraulic lime is, however, a binder consisting of lime and other materials such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, limestone filler and other suitable materials, but does not need to have a declaration of constituents. Formulated lime (FL), which is a new term, is a lime with hydraulic properties mainly consisting of air <b>lime</b> (CL) and/or <b>natural</b> hydraulic <b>lime</b> (NHL) with added hydraulic and/or pozzolanic material. To protect the user especially in restoration and conservation, formulated limes contain a constituent’s declaration.|$|R
