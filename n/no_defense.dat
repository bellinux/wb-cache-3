5|$|On May 11, a {{grand jury}} was {{assembled}} in McLennan County and quickly returned an indictment against Washington; the trial was scheduled for May 15. The Times-Herald of Waco published a notice on May 12 requesting that residents let the justice system determine Washington's fate. Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm; his address was well received. Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers. His lawyers prepared <b>no</b> <b>defense,</b> and noted that he appeared placid {{in the days before}} the trial.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Mazurkiewicz wrote {{a letter}} to Stanisław Radkiewicz, head of the Ministry of Public Security, {{complaining}} of the continued persecution of former Home Army soldiers and he was arrested again. During a two-year pre-trial confinement, Mazurkiewicz was interrogated and tortured—he was beaten and his teeth and hair were forcibly pulled out. He was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in a show trial, in which the prosecutor submitted a false confession allegedly made by Mazurkiewicz and <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> witnesses were allowed to appear. He remained imprisoned until the amnesty of 1956. Eventually rehabilitated, he was active in organizations which sought to protect former veterans of anti-Nazi resistance and served as vice-president of the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy, the Polish veterans association. In 1980, during a brief liberalization associated with the first Solidarity period he was promoted to the rank of General.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012 it was {{revealed}} that EA 32751 (Gebelein Man) had probably been murdered. A CAT scan of the mummified body taken at the Cromwell Hospital in London showed that Gebelein Man had been aged about 18 to 20 {{at the time of his}} death and had been well muscled. Under his left shoulder blade the scan revealed a puncture to the body; the murder weapon had been used with such force that it had slightly damaged the shoulder blade but had shattered the rib beneath it and penetrated the lung. It was believed that the injury had been caused by a copper blade or flint knife at least 12cm in length and 2cm wide. Daniel Antoine, the British Museum's expert on human remains, believes that Gebelein Man had been taken by surprise by the attack as there were <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> wounds.|$|E

25|$|Maiasaura were herbivorous. They {{were capable}} of walking both on two (bipedal) or four (quadrupedal) legs. Studies of the stress {{patterns}} of healed bones show that young juveniles under four years old walked mainly bipedal, switching to a mainly quadrupedal style of walking when they grew larger. They appeared to have <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> against predators, except, perhaps, its heavy muscular tail and their herd behavior. Herds were extremely large and could have comprised as many as 10,000 individuals. Maiasaura lived in an inland habitat.|$|E
25|$|On 3 February, the Japanese counter-attacked {{by attacking}} Singosari Airfield where a dive-bombing and {{strafing}} attack caught the Fortresses on the field.

Five planes were destroyed on the ground. That was not yet {{the end of the}} day's black news. The 7th Group, running its first mission out of Jogjakarta Airfield that morning, had sent nine B-17s up to Balikpapan. Eight came back. That made a total of six B-17s lost for the day.|$|E
25|$|The male Eciton burchellii are {{extremely}} {{affected by a}} fragmented forest habitat.

Also, the males seem to have <b>no</b> <b>defenses,</b> which contrasts greatly with the queen's hordes of stinging protectors. With the fragmented forest hindering the males' dispersal, gene flow is reduced among the Eciton burchellii populations.|$|R

25|$|Attorney William Francis Pepper, {{representing}} the King family, presented evidence from 70 witnesses and 4,000 pages of transcripts. Pepper alleges in his book, An Act of State (2003), {{that the evidence}} implicated the FBI, the CIA, the US Army, the Memphis Police Department, and organized crime {{in the murder of}} King. The suit alleged government involvement; however, no government officials or agencies were named or made a party to the suit, so there was <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> or evidence presented or refuted by the government. The jury found defendant Loyd Jowers and unknown co-defendants civilly liable for participation in a conspiracy to assassinate King in the amount of $100. Members of King's family acted as plaintiffs.|$|E
25|$|The North Vietnamese began {{launching}} {{surface-to-air missiles}} against U.S. aircraft in 1965. The Air Force {{had little or}} <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> against these missiles and assigned the USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center the critical mission of developing effective surface-to-air missile (SAM) countermeasures to protect aircrews over the skies of Vietnam. In response to this new threat, USAFTAWC originated and fielded the Wild Weasel program. Simultaneously, the center was testing radar homing and warning equipment and self-protection electronic countermeasures jamming pods. Four F-100F Super Sabres, modified as Wild Weasel I groundfire suppression aircraft, deployed from Eglin to Southeast Asia on 21 November 1965, assigned to the operational control of the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} courts-martial were held, one at Tacubaya on 23 August, {{and another}} at San Ángel on 26 August. At {{neither of these}} trials were the men represented by lawyers nor were transcripts made of the proceedings. This lack of formal legal advice {{could account for the}} fact that several of the men claimed that drunkenness had led them to desert (a common defense in military trials at the time that sometimes led to lighter sentences), and others described how they were forced to join the Mexican Army in some form or another. The majority of the San Patricios either offered <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> or their defenses were not recorded. Wealthy Mexicans came to the San Patricios' defence at the trials, and members of Mexico's first families visited them in prison.|$|E

25|$|Daschle {{also served}} as a {{panelist}} on the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a body that recommended changes to U.S. policy to strengthen national biodefense. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Governor Tom Ridge, the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues.|$|E
25|$|The Mbunda also fought {{alongside}} the Aluyi against the Tonga in the 1880s, emerging victory as the Tonga had <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> against the Mbunda‘s skill {{with a bow}} and arrow, resulting in the Lozi/Mbunda and Tonga Cousinship. Later the Kaonde/Lozi war which Lozis won {{with the help of}} the Mbunda war machinery, resulting in the Mbunda Chieftainship of Chief Mwene Kasimba having firmly been established there at the confluence of the Lalafuta and Kyamenge in 1893, opposite Chief Mushima Njivumina of the Kaonde. In honoring the Mulambwa/Chiyengele Treaty, the Mbunda have remained the true allies of the Aluyi both in military and political matters. The Mbunda lived peacefully, tendering their cattle and growing cassava, maize and rice, while many of the men left their homes to work in the South African mines. With Zambia independence from British rule that came in 1964, the practice was discouraged and the men were then recruited to work on the sugar plantations of Zambia.|$|E
25|$|The Union fleet faced only token {{opposition}} at Chalmette, {{and thereafter}} had clear sailing to New Orleans. The fourteen vessels remaining arrived {{there in the}} afternoon of April 25 and laid the city under their guns. In the meantime, General Lovell had evacuated the troops {{that had been in}} the city, so <b>no</b> <b>defense</b> was possible. Panic-stricken citizens broke into stores, burned cotton and other supplies, and destroyed much of the waterfront. The unfinished CSS Mississippi was hastily launched; it was hoped that she could be towed to Memphis, but no towboats could be found, so she was burned by order of her captain. Farragut demanded the surrender of the city. The mayor and city council tried to buck the unpleasant duty up to Lovell, but he passed it back to them. After three days of fruitless negotiations, Farragut sent two officers ashore with a detachment of sailors and marines. They went to the Custom House, where they hauled down the state flag and ran up the United States flag. That signified the official return of the city to the Union.|$|E

5000|$|A fossilized {{trackway}} in Goslar {{also reveals}} a possible reason behind Europasaurus's extinction. When the trackways were reconstructed through digital modeling, {{it was revealed}} that large theropods of unknown variety had migrated to the island via a land bridge from the mainland when the sea level had dropped. The theropods, estimated to be eight meters or more, would likely have hunted the Europasaurus. The invasion of large theropods would have quickly wiped out the specialized island herbivores, which likely had <b>no</b> <b>defenses</b> against predators as large as or larger than themselves.|$|R
