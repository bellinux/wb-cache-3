500|$|A Times Editor review from The St. Petersburg Times also {{described}} it as sounding similar to other hits: [...] "She hankers for a boy who either doesn't love her back or wants to ditch this small town." [...] Josh Love of The Village Voice thought [...] "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness" [...] shined through the lyrics and theme of [...] "You Belong with Me"; Love also mentioned {{that it was one}} of Fearless [...] "great songs". The same magazine later ranked the song at number 10 on its annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said Swift's vocals fit the song's melody and instrumentation, which, according to her, is [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "radio-friendly". Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine recommended for readers to download [...] "You Belong with Me", and Jeniffer Webb, also from About.com, predicted that the song would reach different age groups. Webb said, [...] "It continues the artist's tradition of having a little something for everyone, so it's <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> has such a large fanbase." ...|$|E

She spins snowflakes in blows breezes with such perfect care, it's <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she's</b> in charge of water and air. She carries a wand with a {{caterpillar}} on the top. When {{it comes to}} good deeds, she never does stop." ...|$|R
5000|$|Art [...] "Dustbowl" [...] Fowler (1902 - April 4, 1953) was an American {{actor and}} {{musician}} known as [...] "The Wizard of the Ukulele".

Among his hits are <b>No</b> <b>Wonder</b> <b>She's</b> a Blushing Bride, Crazy Words, Crazy Tune and Just A Bird's Eye View of my Old Kentucky Home.|$|R

6000|$|... "By gum! Ye don't tell me! <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> acted so blamed crazy like! Any reward fer her?" [...] And the farmer's voice betrayed {{a sudden}} interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember she {{was very}} young, {{so far away from}} her mother, with no real friend to warn and help her, and love is so sweet. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> went." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, it {{certainly}} {{led her to}} be very unjust, as she acknowledged this morning,' said Anne, 'and rather unkind to Helen. But then it was <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>she</b> was mad with the Hazlebys.' ...|$|R
60|$|Fanny Price puzzled Philip. Her conceit was stupendous. Philip {{had already}} {{discovered}} {{that everyone in}} the studio cordially disliked her; and it was <b>no</b> <b>wonder,</b> for <b>she</b> seemed to go {{out of her way to}} wound people.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drowne," [...] said Copley with a {{smile of}} intelligence, [...] "you have been a truly {{fortunate}} man. What painter or statuary ever had such a subject! <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>she</b> inspired a genius into you, and first created the artist who afterwards created her image." ...|$|R
6000|$|She hoard such fooleries? She have Mrs. Pugh's duplicates? <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> coldly answered, 'My {{little sister}} has been {{slightly}} infected, thank you, but I {{do not care}} for such things.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dick, {{you must}} be very blind not to see what has been plain to all of us.... I guess--it couldn't have been helped. You're a splendid fellow. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> loves you." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, {{reason as}} she would, Mrs. Archibald could not banish {{from her mind}} the belief that Arthur Raybold would come to their camp some time during the next day. In fact, not having heard otherwise, she {{supposed}} {{he had come to}} the camp-fire that night. She was filled with anger and contempt for the young man who was determined to force himself on their party in this outrageous manner, and considered it shameful that their peaceful life in these woods had been so wickedly disturbed. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> did not want to sleep; <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> sat at the window thinking and thinking.|$|E
60|$|This Princess {{having the}} Experience of her Father and Grand-father before her, join'd {{to her own}} Prudence and Honesty of Design; it was <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> if <b>she</b> prudently shun'd all manner of rash Counsels, and endeavour'd to carry it with a steady Hand between her contending Parties.|$|R
60|$|Will {{went over}} to the window. He thought how bright and {{handsome}} Ed used to be, and he felt after all that it was <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>she</b> married him. Life pushes us into such things. Suddenly he turned, something resolute and imperious in his eyes and voice.|$|R
6000|$|Berenger {{struck his}} {{forehead}} with wrath and perplexity, then cried, joyfully, 'It will not stand for moment. So foul a cheat can be at once exposed.

60|$|This {{undecided}} {{state of}} mind {{did not have a}} good effect upon her general appearance, and it was frequently remarked that her health was not what it used to be. Miss Nancy Shott thought there was nothing to wonder at in this. Mrs. Cliff had never been accustomed to spend money, and it was easy to see, from the things she had bought abroad and put into that little house, that she had expended a good deal more than she could afford, and <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> was troubled, and <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> was looking thin and sick.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite {{a mixture}} of nationalities then, and <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> is beautiful. That youth had a very {{striking}} profile; it quite {{reminded me of a}} gem as I saw it against the dark pillar.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{poor little}} slave! <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> gazed at you as she did;--she was {{thinking}} how sweet your life must be with people {{to love and}} care for you and no hard work to do." ...|$|E
60|$|Tom did {{not quite}} dislike the old lady: {{but he could not}} help {{thinking}} her a little spiteful--and <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> if <b>she</b> was, poor old soul; for if she has to wait to grow handsome till people do as they would be done by, she will have to wait a very long time.|$|R
60|$|So Nursey {{told her}} best tales; and {{when at last}} the child lay down under her lace curtains, her head was full of a curious jumble of Christmas elves, poor children, snow-storms, sugarplums, and surprises. So it is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>she</b> dreamed all night; {{and this was the}} dream, which she never quite forgot.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know I {{look upon}} Arthur {{as one of}} the family almost now," [...] said the good-natured Begum; [...] "he comes and goes when he likes; and the more I think of his dear mother, the more I see there's few people so good--none so good to me. And I'm sure I cried when I heard of her death, and would have gone into {{mourning}} for her myself, only black don't become me. And I know who his mother wanted him to marry--Laura, I mean--whom old Lady Rockminster has taken such a fancy to, and, <b>no</b> <b>wonder.</b> <b>She's</b> a better girl than my girl. I know both. And my Betsy--Blanche, I mean--ain't been a comfort to me, Major. It's Laura Pen ought to marry.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is in {{absolute}} error respecting Belamour; {{but then she}} has not seen him since his recovery. Women are prone to those fancies, and in her unprotected state, poor thing, <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> takes alarms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cunning rogue!' {{continued}} Horatia. 'How did he {{manage to}} give no suspicion? Oh! what fun! <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> looked {{green and yellow}} when he was flirting with the little Fulmort! Let's hear all, Cilly--how, when, and where?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if {{you could}} see the platefuls and cupfuls as the ladies carries out to her," [...] added Betsy Seddon. [...] "My word and honour! <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> is getting lively enough just to bust some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|Adeline had full {{satisfaction}} in recounting the governess's mistake to the maids, and in hearing from Esther {{that it was}} <b>no</b> <b>wonder,</b> 'for that <b>she</b> {{looked more like a}} born lady than Lady Florence herself!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Marian, growing eager in her defence, [...] "she {{really did}} know right from wrong. She would remonstrate, {{and tell us}} things that were every word good and true, only she did it with so little force, that they were apt not to mind her; {{and then it was}} <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>she</b> grew dispirited, and sunk into poor unfortunate." ...|$|R
40|$|Jackie Heaton’s latest {{contribution}} to the family law domain is formidable – 777 pages of carefully crafted opinions and discussions of the law affecting divorce and dissolution of life partnerships. Given the range, diversity and depth of issues in this area, it is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>she</b> calls on those being {{among the best in}} their field to assist her in writing up the book...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear, I cannot tell; I {{think she}} was off her guard with excitement; but all was very new to her, and there was every excuse. I was too happy to be wise, so <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> was.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, very probably, {{she cares}} {{a great deal}} about it. She is a serious person, intellectually at least, and it is a serious story. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> would like to know, at first hand, {{something}} about the man who wrote it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> winces, and is angry; {{there are}} some mischievous persons who rather like to witness that discomfiture. All Mr. Smee's flatteries that day failed to soothe her. She was {{in the state in}} which his canvasses {{sometimes}} are, when he cannot paint on them.|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>she</b> sighed for ghouls and for shadowy monsters, well-nigh {{longing for}} a sight of {{distorted}} faces, of ugly deformed bodies, and loathsome shapes far less hideous than that specter of an inhuman homicide which followed her along this dark road as she ran--ran on--ran towards the home where dwelt the living monster of evil, {{the man who had}} done the deed, which she had helped to accomplish.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>she</b> looked pale in the morning, {{and felt}} so tired and dejected {{as to make}} her {{sensible}} that she was cast loose from home and friends when no one troubled her with remarks or inquiries such as she could hardly have answered. However, when, {{on the evening of}} the second day's journey, Anne was set down at Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe's house at Westminster, she met with a very different reception.|$|R
5000|$|... "In Unnatural Death, she {{had invented}} a murder method that is {{appropriately}} dramatic and cunningly ingenious, the injection of an air-bubble with a hypodermic, but not only, in fact, would it {{require the use}} of an instrument so large as to be farcical, but Miss Sayers has her bubble put into an artery not a vein. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> afterwards <b>she</b> pledged herself 'strictly in future to seeing I never write a book which I know to be careless'." ...|$|R
