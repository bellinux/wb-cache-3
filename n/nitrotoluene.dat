40|$|Environmental {{pollutants}} {{released from}} factories in wastewater streams present a great {{risk to the}} environment unless properly treated. The current study establishes the biodegradative ability of the white-rot fungus (WRF) Pycnoporus cinnabarinus in treating a munition factory trade effluent containing <b>nitrotoluenes.</b> Nitroaromatic compounds are released into the atmosphere almost exclusively from anthropogenic sources due to the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and from their use in dyes, synthetic intermediates, pesticides and explosives [1]. Trinitrotoluene (TNT) is {{the most widely used}} explosive substance and its derivatives are biological poisons. Munitions factory wastes are commonly stored in surface storage areas referred to as 'pink water lagoons'. The wastewater samples used for this study were supplied by Australian Defence Industries (ADI) and were taken from the pink water lagoons of one of their Victorian munitions factories. The family of the WRF is the only fungi that have demonstrated their ability to completely mineralise the complex plant polymer lignin [2]. The unique, non-specific enzyme system used by the WRF for the degradation of lignin also allows the degradation {{of a wide range of}} pollutants [3]. Several research groups have reported the degradation and even mineralisation of nitro-aromatic compounds by WRF family member Phanerochaete chrysoporium [4]. This study focussed on another member of the family P. cinnabarinus which produces the ligninolytic enzyme laccase, which has been shown to successfully treat industrial effluents [5]. The extent to which the fungus was capable of degrading the <b>nitrotoluenes</b> present in the munitions effluent was determined by measuring the concentrations of the effluent components before and after exposure to the fungus.

50|$|In {{the initial}} enamine formation, {{dimethylamine}} (a gas) is displaced by pyrrolidine from the dimethylformamide dimethylacetal, producing a more reactive reagent. The mildly acidic hydrogens of the methyl {{group in the}} <b>nitrotoluene</b> can be deprotonated under the basic conditions, and the resultant carbanion attacks to produce the enamine shown, with loss of methanol. The sequence can be also be performed without the pyrrolidine, via the N,N-dimethyl enamine, though reaction times may be much longer in some cases. In the second step the nitro group is reduced to -NH2 using hydrogen and a Raney nickel catalyst, followed by cyclisation then elimination of the pyrrolidine. The hydrogen is often generated in situ by the spontaneous decomposition of hydrazine hydrate to H2 and N2 {{in the presence of}} the nickel.|$|E
50|$|Some polar liquids, such as <b>nitrotoluene</b> (C7H7NO2) and {{nitrobenzene}} (C6H5NO2) exhibit {{very large}} Kerr constants. A glass cell filled {{with one of}} these liquids is called a Kerr cell. These are frequently used to modulate light, since the Kerr effect responds very quickly to changes in electric field. Light can be modulated with these devices at frequencies as high as 10 GHz. Because the Kerr effect is relatively weak, a typical Kerr cell may require voltages as high as 30 kV to achieve complete transparency. This is in contrast to Pockels cells, which can operate at much lower voltages. Another disadvantage of Kerr cells is that the best available material, nitrobenzene, is poisonous. Some transparent crystals have also been used for Kerr modulation, although they have smaller Kerr constants.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, deactivating substituents destabilize the {{intermediate}} cation and thus decrease the reaction rate by either inductive or resonance effects. They {{do so by}} withdrawing electron density from the aromatic ring. The deactivation of the aromatic system means that generally harsher conditions are required to drive the reaction to completion. An {{example of this is}} the nitration of toluene during the production of trinitrotoluene (TNT). While the first nitration, on the activated toluene ring, can be done at room temperature and with dilute acid, the second one, on the deactivated <b>nitrotoluene</b> ring, already needs prolonged heating and more concentrated acid, and the third one, on very strongly deactivated dinitrotoluene, has to be done in boiling concentrated sulfuric acid. Groups that are electron-withdrawing by resonance decrease the electron density especially at positions 2, 4 and 6, leaving positions 3 and 5 as the ones with comparably higher reactivity, so these types of groups are meta directors (see below). Halogens are electronegative, so they are deactivating by induction, but they have lone pairs, so they are resonance donors and therefore ortho/para directors.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the monocarboxylic acids of the benzene series. The {{preparation}} of Benzoic acids from arenes, toluenes, aryl halides, and arynes is discussed. Optimum conditions for the oxidation of alkylarenes to benzoic acids, avoiding decarboxylation, have been determined. Monoalkylbenzenes are oxidized to benzoic acids by oxygen {{in the presence of}} a cobalt/manganese catalyst. The oxidation of toluenes (especially <b>nitrotoluenes)</b> with potassium permanganate at 95 ºC in nitrobenzene/water under phase-transfer conditions gives good yields of benzoic acids. Another well established approach involves the photochlorination of toluenes, to give benzotrichlorides, followed by hydrolysis. Benzyne can be generated from either bromobenzene, or chlorobenzene, by treatment with sodamide. The aryne is then reacted in situ with O-silyl enolates of carboxylic esters to form bicyclic adducts.

40|$|By mixing {{through a}} three-reactor system a nitroreducing {{consortium}} and an aniline-degrading Comamonas acidovorans, a mixed population was formed which {{was able to}} mineralize the nitroaromatic compound nitrobenzene via aniline, its corresponding aminoaromatic compound. The behavior of the mixed population was characterized in batch culture. In the first step, nitrobenzene was reduced to aniline by the reductive consortium and, in the second, oxidative step, aniline was mineralized via catechol and meta cleavage. Even though these two steps may seem incompatible in terms of required redox conditions, they were made to coexist in a single, simple reactor. However, when aeration was optimum for growth, only 16 % of the 0. 5 mM nitrobenzene introduced was mineralized. Decreasing the aeration led {{to an increase in}} the amount of nitrobenzene reduced and decreased its volatilized fraction. A decrease in aeration did not slow down aniline mineralization, although the latter is catalyzed by dioxygenases. This mixed population is thus able to remediate nitrobenzene and also aniline, which is often found with the former in the environment. Using C. acidovorans, which also degrades methylanilines, or other aminoaromatic-compound-degrading organisms, this strategy should be applicable to mineralizing more complex nitroaromatic compounds, like <b>nitrotoluenes</b> or dinitrotoluenes...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} nitroaromatic compounds, {{including}} 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), were reduced by hydrogen {{in the presence}} of enzyme preparations from Veillonella alkalescens. Consistent with the proposed reduction pathway, R-NO 2 H 2 leads to R-NO H 2 leads to R-NHOH H 2 leads to R-NH 2, 3 mol of H 2 was utilized per mol of nitro group. The rates of reduction of 40 mono-, di-, and trinitroaromatic compounds by V. alkalescens extract were determined. The reactivity of the nitro groups depended on other substituents and on the position of the nitro groups relative to these substituents. In the case of the <b>nitrotoluenes,</b> the para-nitro group was the most readily reduced, the 4 -nitro position of 2, 4 -dinitrotulene being reduced first. The pattern of reduction of TNT (disappearance of TNT and reduction products formed) depended on the type of preparation (cell-free extract, resting cells, or growing culture), on the species, and on the atmosphere (air or H 2). The "nitro-reductase" activity of V. alkalescens extracts was associated with protein fractions, one having some ferredoxin-like properties and the other possessing hydrogenase activity. Efforts to eliminate hydrogenase from the reaction have thus far been unsuccessful.

50|$|Water gel {{explosives}} {{are produced}} by combining nitroparaffins, usually nitromethane, with an aqueous salt solution and a gelling agent. These nitroparaffins typically make {{up most of the}} water gel explosive. Different types of gelling agents are used to create the water gel explosive. One agent is insoluble in water, but able to gel with nitromethane. The gel used for nitromethane is cyanoethylether, a derivative of galactomannan gum. Other agents are water-soluble and are used for the aqueous salt solution. As referenced in the first paragraph, water-soluble gums and gel modifiers like guar can be used for the gelling of aqueous solutions. When the salt solution and nitroparaffin are gelled, the entire mixture is combined and mixed together until the desired consistency is achieved. One characteristic that allows the explosive to work so well is the insoluble nature of the nitroparaffin. The effectiveness of the water gels is dependent on the dissemination of salts in the salt solution. The particles need to be very small and fine {{so that they can be}} dispersed well throughout the solution. Some salts that are commonly used include: ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium perchlorate and potassium chlorate. The sensitivity of the explosive must be increased in order to improve the initiation of the detonation of the explosive. There are different techniques for increasing the sensitivity. Aluminum or other powdered metals can help increase the sensitivity of the water gel, but increasing the sensitivity also means that the explosives are more combustible. Powdered metals have not proven to be completely effective in increasing the sensitivity of the explosive because they do not uniformly mix through the solution. They also lose sensitivity as storage time increases. Liquid non-self-explosive sensitizers like nitrobenzene and liquid <b>nitrotoluene</b> have not worked well either because they are difficult to hold in suspension. Liquid aliphatic mononitrates have been found to work very effectively as sensitizers when they are well mixed in the water gel.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development and evaluation of an alternative method for the deconvolution of overlapped chromatographic peaks that intended to improve the accuracy of results and the flexibility of curve-fitting models. The approach studied here involves the integration of overlapped peaks and resolution of the unidirectional area data using curve-fitting methods analogous to those used to resolve overlapped kinetic responses resulting from simultaneous chemical reactions. Two empirical four-parameter mathematical models, a segmented sequential sigmoid (SSS) model and an unsegmented sequential sigmoid (USS) model, were developed for the sigmoid shaped area vs. time data. ^ The performance characteristics of the proposed models were first evaluated by fitting them to single-component responses for barbiturates and five types of peak shapes simulated by published chromatographic models with asymmetry ranging from 0. 37 to 7. 33. Results show that the two sequential sigmoid models are more rugged {{to adapt to a}} variety of peak shapes and degrees of asymmetry (both tailing and fronting). They give smaller errors of peak area and better fitting quality than the EMG model for peaks with moderate to high degrees of asymmetry. Subsequently, this approach was evaluated on artificially overlapped and real unresolved multicomponent chromatograms for barbiturates and <b>nitrotoluenes.</b> Results demonstrated the feasibility of using peak areas rather than peak data to resolve components that are not fully resolved in chromatographic process. The degree of peak overlap has less impact on the sequential sigmoid models than on the EMG models.

For this purpose, N-(1 -adamantyl) acrylamide was synthesized and characterized as a hydrophobic monomer forming a water soluble-inclusion complex with statistically Me-β-CD. Mixed-mode monolithic stationary phases were synthesized by in situ free radical copolymerization of cyclodextrin-solubilized N-adamantyl acrylamide, methacrylamide (MA), piperazinediacrylamide (PDA), and vinylsulfonic acid (VSA) in aqueous medium. Due to the amphiphilic nature of the synthesized capillaries, separations in the reversed-phase, in the normal-phase, and in a mixed-retention mode (depending on the composition of the mobile phase) are achieved for polar and non-polar neutral analytes. The stoichiometry, the complex formation constant, and the spatial arrangement of the formed inclusion complex are determined by CD modified capillary electrochromatography (CD-CEC), CD modified micellar EKC (CD-MEKC), and the application of 1 H NMR and 2 D- 1 H NOESY spectroscopy. The influence of the total monomer concentration (%T) on the chromatographic properties of the synthesized monoliths is also investigated. In the second part of the thesis the morphology and the pore size distribution of a series of amphiphilic macroporous N-adamantyl-group containing mixed-mode acrylamide-based continuous beds synthesized under variation of the concentration of the lyotropic salt ammonium sulfate (AS) in the polymerization mixture are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and inverse size exclusion chromatography (ISEC). The impact of the concentration of the lyotropic salt AS in the polymerization mixture on the formed morphology and pore size distribution is determined. SEM photographs demonstrate the homogeneity and uniformity of the formed monolith over the length of the capillary and the covalent attachment of the formed polymer to the confining wall. Additionally, SEM photographs demonstrate a clear increase in the domain size (average size of globules + average flow through pore diameter) with increasing concentration of AS in the polymerization mixture. The pore size distribution determined with ISEC using the retention data of a series of polystyrene standards reveals the presence of two different types of pores for the synthesized capillaries: (i) pores located inside the microglobules (internal pores) and (ii) pores which are located between the microglobules (external pores). The presence of a trimodal pore size distribution is confirmed by ISEC for those monoliths which are synthesized with lower concentration of AS in the polymerization mixture, and a bimodal pore size distribution for those synthesized with higher content of AS in the polymerization mixture. In the third part of the thesis, efficiency data are gained for a series of amphiphilic macroporous N-adamantyl-group containing mixed-mode acrylamide-based continuous beds synthesized under variation of different synthesis parameters. The studied synthesis parameters are (i) concentration of ammonium sulfate, (ii) concentration of the initiator ammonium persulfate, and (iii) concentration of the negatively charged monomer vinylsulfonic acid (VSA) in the polymerization mixture. The optimization of different synthesis parameters with regard to the chromatographic efficiency under isocratic conditions for alkylphenones in the reversed-phase mode is studied employing CEC. The major conclusion was that with varied concentration of AS or varied concentration of ammonium persulfate in the polymerization mixture, a strong impact on the chromatographic efficiency is observed, while there is only a minor influence when varying the molar fraction of VSA. In addition, the absence of a significant influence by heating (Joule heating) and via extra-column band broadening effects on the determined efficiency is confirmed. In the fourth part of the thesis we studied with different classes of neutral analytes (with varied hydrophobicity) the impact of the type of retention mode (influenced by the type of analyte and the mobile phase composition) and the impact of the analyte functionality on the chromatographic efficiency and peak symmetry with a monolith synthesized with optimized parameters. With this monolithic capillary, high separation efficiencies (up to ca. 220, 000 m- 1) were obtained for separations of different analyte classes (alkylphenones, <b>nitrotoluenes,</b> and phenolic compounds with k = 0. 2 - 0. 55) in the reversed-phase mode, in the normal-phase mode, and in mixed retention-mode. For neutral alkylanilines (k < 0. 25) separated in the reversed-phase elution mode, high plate numbers exceeding 300, 000 m- 1 were routinely obtained. For phenolic analytes, it is shown that analyte functionality and mobile phase composition have a strong influence on peak symmetry and chromatographic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Plant-bacterial {{combinations}} {{can increase}} contaminant degradation in the rhizosphere, but {{the role played}} by indigenous root-associated bacteria during plant growth in contaminated soils is unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if plants had the ability to selectively enhance the prevalence of endophytes containing pollutant catabolic genes in unrelated environments contaminated with different pollutants. At petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sites, two genes encoding hydrocarbon degradation, alkane monooxygenase (alkB) and naphthalene dioxygenase (ndoB), were two and four times more prevalent in bacteria extracted from the root interior (endophytic) than from the bulk soil and sediment, respectively. In field sites contaminated with nitroaromatics, two genes encoding <b>nitrotoluene</b> degradation, 2 -nitrotoluene reductase (ntdAa) and <b>nitrotoluene</b> monooxygenase (ntnM), were 7 to 14 times more prevalent in endophytic bacteria. The addition of petroleum to sediment doubled the prevalence of ndoB-positive endophytes in Scirpus pungens, indicating that the numbers of endophytes containing catabolic genotypes were dependent on the presence and concentration of contaminants. Similarly, the numbers of alkB- or ndoB-positive endophytes in Festuca arundinacea were correlated with the concentration of creosote in the soil but not with the numbers of alkB- or ndoB-positive bacteria in the bulk soil. Our results indicate that the enrichment of catabolic genotypes in the root interior is both plant and contaminant dependent...|$|E
