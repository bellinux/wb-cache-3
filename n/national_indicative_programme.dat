The aim of the programme, {{which is to be}} implemented over a six-year period, is to create the necessary capacities in ACP countries so that they can benefit from increased trading opportunities. Commenting on the programme, the EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy said 'we need to ensure that the benefits from better trading opportunities translate into growth and development'. He spoke explicitly about sending the right signals to developing countries ahead of the Cancun WTO Ministerial. Commissioner Lamy emphasised that trade assistance is a key element of the EU-ACP EPA currently being negotiated. The trade-{{assistance programme}} is identified as important in enhancing ACP participation in trade negotiations, integrating trade into development strategies, ensuring that goods are produced to the requisite international standards and promoting ACP capacity to export. There are three main components to this trade. com programme: strengthening local capacities to formulate trade policies, while encouraging the participation of all stakeholders in the process; assistance for ongoing trade negotiations by establishing a unique network of ACP trade experts (this component is known as a 'hub and spoke' programme with the secondment of senior advisors - the hub - to regional organisations, and experts in national ministries -the spokes); funding of pilot projects to address institutional and supply-side constraints with a special emphasis on enabling ACP countries to meet technical standards and sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements, which the Commission acknowledged 'represent a major obstacle to improving their export performance'. Comment: The funds committed represent an average of less than € 660, 000 per ACP country for trade related technical assistance With an implementation period of six years this represents only € 110, 000 per annum per ACP country. This project gives concrete expression to the commitment made in Doha to provide ACP countries with trade-related technical assistance.

Accordingly, in its policies toward Central Asia, the bloc, as the <b>indicative</b> <b>programmes</b> of its Development Cooperation Instrument suggest (European Commission, 2007, 2011, 2014), primarily concentrates on the furtherance of regional collaboration and good neighbourly relations, improvement of living standards and lessening of poverty as well as energy, environmental and water projects. Incidentally, the 2007 Strategy also mentions human rights and democratisation as dimensions of the EU’s activities, but they are coupled with good governance (Council of the EU, 2007 : pp. 7 – 9), to which the EU, as some researchers argue, tends to give priority. Meden (2012 : p. 59), for instance, points out that Brussels is shifting its focus from democracy promotion to fight against corruption, on paper, however, continuing to demand democratisation.

40|$|In recent decades, The Netherlands {{has seen}} an {{increase}} in the use of regional design-led practices in <b>national</b> <b>indicative</b> planning. Despite this, the interrelations between design and planning decision making are not well understood, and attempts to involve the expertise and ambition of designers in planning have had unclear outcomes. This article elaborates on the role and position of regional design in indicative planning. It is argued that design in this realm resembles discretionary action, implying that design both influences, and is influenced by, prevailing planning rationales. An analytical framework is developed on these grounds and applied to a set of regional design initiatives that evolved in the context of Dutch national plans between 1988 and 2012. Significantly, the analysis reveals forms of discretional control that shape the creative design practice, of particular importance being the flexibility of planning guidance and the resulting room for interpretation. In theoretical terms, the article contributes to the discussion of how design – as an explorative search for solutions to problems in a particular spatial context – and design theory can contribute {{to an understanding of the}} multiple planning experiments emerging in this post-regulative era.

A concrete example of actions on residential buildings is used to illustrate the challenges for policy marker and stakeholders to set harmonized evaluation rules. The FWC and ESD calculations appear to be consistent from a physics point of view, as long as calculations are well-documented. But due to differences in the policy objectives, calculation routines may be necessary to convert national energy savings unit (e. g., kWh cumac) into supranational energy savings unit (e. g., ESD kWh).

40|$|International audienceThe Commission has {{proposed}} a Directive on the promotion of end-use efficiency and energy services (ESD) to enhance the cost-effective and efficient end-use of energy in Member States. According to the Directive, the Member States shall adopt and aim to achieve an overall <b>national</b> <b>indicative</b> energy savings target of 9 % (or beyond) in 2016. This target is to be reached by way of energy services and other energy efficiency measures.

As the accountings of energy savings in the FWC scheme and in the ESD are different (e. g. lifetime-cumulated and discounted kWh for FWC and annual kWh for ESD), an analysis of the compliance of both methodologies and a comparison of the assessed savings are necessary. In this paper, we evaluate the compliance with the ESD requirements of two different end-use actions (insulation, heating boiler) included in the FWC scheme. This is done through the concrete case of certificates filed by EDF. The main objective of this evaluation is to assess the contribution of the savings of these FWC actions to the target of the ESD.

Now the Member States {{have to develop}} strategies and policies for the national implementation of the Directive, which sets a <b>national</b> <b>indicative</b> energy savings target of 9 % for the ninth year of the Directive's application. This target is to be met using measures to improve energy efficiency. The Member States have to present their first energy efficiency action plan (EEAP) under the ESD by 30 June 2007, which must contain the national overall target for energy saving. According to the first provisional calculations of the national energy savings target under the ESD, the energy savings which have to be achieved in Germany in the ninth year of the Directive (2016) amount to 758 PJ of final energy. The target cannot only be achieved by new measures applied in the active period of the Directive (2008 - 2016), but measures taken since 1995 which still have an effect in 2016 ("early actions") may also be considered. According to a first rough estimate, early action can contribute substantially to achieving the ESD target value for Germany. Taking into account recent energy efficiency programmes of the Federal government, {{the main focus of}} new measures under the ESD will probably be on the building sector (existing and new buildings) and on electrical appliances. The transport sector could become a second area for energy efficiency measures under the ESD.
