50|$|On 8 September 1969, {{banknotes}} of 50 cents (5 shillings), $1 (10 shillings), $2 (£1), and $10 (£5) were introduced.

In 1917, 1-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued, and 2-krone <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued between 1918 and 1922.

5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect {{that provides a}} small variation in pitch while a <b>note</b> <b>is</b> being played, and a chorus effect where a note's sound is combined with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941, {{during the}} German occupation, <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} in denominations of 6 pence, 1 shilling 3 pence, 2 shillings 6 pence and 5 shillings.

The serial numbers of the banknotes issued in all denominations were prefixed by a Z.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the <b>note</b> <b>is</b> strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E
5|$|Morrowind also {{contained}} a fair bit of voiced dialogue; an aspect somewhat better {{received by the}} gaming press. Of <b>note</b> <b>is</b> Lynda Carter, television's Wonder Woman, promoted by Bethesda {{for her role in}} voicing the female Nords in the game. Morrowinds race-specific voice acting received praise from some reviewers, though was met with disdain from others, who disliked the discord between a culturally inflected voice spoken in an alien dialect and the grammatically flawless dialogue printed in the dialogue boxes. The Special Edition Soundtrack was released over DirectSong as a digital release.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all soprano and piccolo {{clarinets}} have keywork {{enabling them}} to play the E below middle C as their lowest written note (in scientific pitch notation that sounds D3 on a soprano clarinet or C4, i.e. concert middle C, on a piccolo clarinet), though some B clarinets go down to E3 {{to enable them to}} match the range of the A clarinet. On the B soprano clarinet, the concert pitch of the lowest <b>note</b> <b>is</b> D3, a whole tone lower than the written pitch.|$|E

5|$|Of {{particular}} <b>note</b> <b>is</b> that {{chemical analysis}} of ceramic fragments {{has revealed that}} the very same workshops not only produced the highest-quality Ik-style polychrome ceramics but also general low-quality ceramics for household use. High quality Ik-style ceramics made at Motul de San José have been excavated from across the Maya region, including Tikal and Uaxactún to the northeast of the city, Copán far to the south, and Altar de Sacrificios, Tamarindito and Seibal, in western Petén.|$|E
5|$|Of special <b>note</b> <b>is</b> that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer {{in a corner of}} the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E
5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, <b>note</b> <b>is</b> combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is {{the song of the}} golden oriole in Le loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
2500|$|The Bank {{has issued}} {{banknotes}} since 1694. <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> originally hand-written; {{although they were}} partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. <b>Notes</b> <b>were</b> fully printed from 1855.

5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Gibraltar was forced to issue banknotes to prevent paying out sterling or gold.

At first the typeset <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> signed by hand by Treasurer Greenwood, though he later used stamps. The notes bore the embossed stamp of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank Ltd. and circulated alongside British Territory notes. The 1914 <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> issued in denominations of 2 and 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 50 pounds. The 2 shilling and 50 pound <b>notes</b> <b>were</b> not continued when {{a new series of}} <b>notes</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1927.
