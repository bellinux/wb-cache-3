40|$|Objective The central {{goal of the}} HIV in <b>Europe</b> <b>Initiative</b> is {{to promote}} testing and {{treatment}} throughout Europe and Central Asia in order to decrease {{the number of people}} living with HIV presenting late for care. This article summarizes the results from the HIV in Europe 2009 Conference and the early results of the projects set up by the initiative, and discusses their implications for the future. Methods In November 2009, 100 key stakeholders from 25 countries met in Stockholm at the HIV in Europe Conference. The focus was to address five key issues that contribute to the barriers to testing identified in 2007 at an innovative HIV conference. The conference discussed barriers to testing and other reasons for late presentation and outlined concrete recommendations to address the problem. Results An early result of the initiative has been stimulation of the process of reaching a consensus definition of what is meant by a 'late presenter', with this definition to be implemented at the European level. Steps are being taken to advocate for appropriate health policies and surveillance data related to HIV throughout <b>Europe.</b> Also, the <b>initiative</b> has set up projects related to the barriers to testing, i. e. criminalization law, stigmatization and lack of offering of testing for people presenting with certain indicator diseases. Conclusions The final results of ongoing projects will be published and widely disseminated in 2010 and beyond. The HIV in <b>Europe</b> <b>Initiative</b> will continue to reinforce collaboration, advocacy and networking activities in the field throughout Europe...|$|R

This paper presents estimates of the costs of meeting these targets through the deployment of next-generation networks. Furthermore, the magnitude of the financing gap is estimated and public support mechanisms are discussed to complement market investment in areas with low financial viability for the investment. The rationale of public sector support is discussed in light of the expected economic benefits of NGNs to consumers and businesses...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} net {{benefits}} of {{the implementation of the}} broadband infrastructure deployment targets by 2020 as entailed by the Digital Agenda for <b>Europe</b> <b>Initiative</b> set forth by the European Commission. We estimate the returns from broadband infrastructure for the period 2005 - 2011, differentiating the impact of broadband by levels of adoption and speed while accounting for reverse causality and extensive heterogeneity. We find that in the base case scenario the overall benefits outweigh the costs by 32 % for the entire European Union. We further extrapolate the returns by country under different scenarios of implementation. In most cases the benefits are substantially well above the costs. The findings lead to policy recommendations related to the role of public support for the generalized build out of broadband infrastructure...|$|R
