25|$|The {{aircraft}} involved was de Havilland DH.34 G-EBBX, c/n 35. The aircraft {{had been}} in service since 6 March 1922. It was owned by the Air Council and had been leased to Daimler Hire Ltd, passing to Imperial Airways when that airline was formed in March 1924. It had been manufactured in 1922, and the first certificate of airworthiness had been issued on 19 September. In April 1924, {{a new set of}} wings had been fitted to the aircraft. These wings were of a different type to the standard wings. A <b>new</b> <b>certificate</b> of airworthiness had been issued on 29 April. On 12 May, the aircraft was involved in a ground collision with a searchlight at an unnamed airfield, damaging the wings. The aircraft was subsequently refitted with standard wings, and a <b>new</b> <b>certificate</b> of airworthiness was issued on 24 November.|$|E

It had been overhauled the previous month, and a <b>new</b> <b>certificate</b> of airworthiness had been issued on 31 December 1946.|$|E

25|$|During this turmoil, Zimmermann's team {{worked on}} {{a new version of}} PGP {{encryption}} called PGP 3. This new version was to have considerable security improvements, including a <b>new</b> <b>certificate</b> structure which fixed small security flaws in the PGP 2.x certificates as well as permitting a certificate to include separate keys for signing and encryption. Furthermore, the experience with patent and export problems led them to eschew patents entirely. PGP 3 introduced use of the CAST-128 (a.k.a. CAST5) symmetric key algorithm, and the DSA and ElGamal asymmetric key algorithms, all of which were unencumbered by patents.|$|E

60|$|The United States, {{with great}} liberality, offers its {{citizenship}} {{to all who}} in good faith {{comply with the requirements}} of law. These requirements are as simple and upon as favorable terms to the emigrant as the high privilege to which he is admitted can or should permit. I do not propose any additional requirements to those which the law now demands; but the very simplicity and the want of unnecessary formality in our law have made fraudulent naturalization not infrequent, to the discredit and injury of all honest citizens, whether native or naturalized. Cases of this character are continually being brought to the notice of the Government by our representatives abroad, and also those of persons resident in other countries, most frequently those who, if they have remained in this country long enough to entitle them to become naturalized, have generally not much overpassed that period, and have returned to the country of their origin, where they reside, avoiding all duties to the United States by their absence, and claiming to be exempt from all duties to the country of their nativity and of their residence by reason of their alleged naturalization. It is due to this Government itself and to the great mass of the naturalized citizens who entirely, both in name and in fact, become citizens of the United States that the high privilege of citizenship of the United States should not be held by fraud or in derogation of the laws and of the good name of every honest citizen. On many occasions it has been brought to the knowledge of the Government that certificates of naturalization are held and protection or interference claimed by parties who admit that not only they were not within the United States {{at the time of the}} pretended naturalization, but that they have never resided in the United States; in others the certificate and record of the court show on their face that the person claiming to be naturalized had not resided the required time in the United States; in others it is admitted upon examination that the requirements of law have not been complied with; in some cases, even, such certificates have been matter of purchase. These are not isolated cases, arising at rare intervals, but of common occurrence, and which are reported from all quarters of the globe. Such occurrences can not, and do not, fail to reflect upon the Government and injure all honest citizens. Such a fraud being discovered, however, there is no practicable means within the control of the Government by which the record of naturalization can be vacated; and should the certificate be taken up, as it usually is, by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the Government to whom it may have been presented, there is nothing to prevent the person claiming to have been naturalized from obtaining a <b>new</b> <b>certificate</b> from the court in place of that which has been taken from him.|$|E

50|$|Under Governor Steve Beshear in 2008, so many {{commissions}} {{were being}} issued that state budget cuts {{led to a}} major change {{in the design of the}} commission certificate. The certificate was downsized from the 10 by 15 in size to 8.5 by 14 in. The wording remained the same on the certificate; however, the traditional gold seal and ribbon were replaced with a state seal that is embossed. Reducing materials for the <b>new</b> <b>certificates</b> was expected to save $5,000; the substantial savings was for excluding the labor formerly needed to apply the gold seal and ribbon by hand. The Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels objected to the changes in the certificates, and the order offered to pay $5,000 a year to keep the traditional certificates. Due to the substantial savings in labor to produce the <b>new</b> <b>certificates,</b> the Secretary of State's office proceeded with the changes.|$|R
