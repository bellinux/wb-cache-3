So when they're hit with this device they're blindsided by it. The first thing they do is make money with it. They're <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the ethics of altering your former self.|$|E
5|$|After {{being thrown}} out of the theater by the manager, the gang shoplift from the Kwik-E-Mart, throw rocks at the Jebediah Springfield statue, and watch clouds. Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield, but without a head. His new friends remark that they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be funny to see the town so upset. When Bart disagrees, the bullies make fun of him. Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's beliefs to be popular. Homer tells Bart that popularity {{is the most important thing}} in the world, as long as Bart is <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks out of the house and decapitates the statue.|$|E
5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> ourselves too much.|$|E

6000|$|... "But I do not think," [...] {{continued}} Wayne, [...] "that {{this horrible}} silence of modernity will last, though I {{think for the}} present it will increase. What a farce is this modern liberality! Freedom of speech means practically, in our modern civilisation, that we must only <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> unimportant things. We must <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> religion, for that is illiberal; we must <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> bread and cheese, for that is talking shop; we must <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> death, for that is depressing; we must <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> birth, for that is indelicate. It cannot last. Something must break this strange indifference, this strange dreamy egoism, this strange loneliness of millions in a crowd. Something must break it. Why should it not be you and I? Can you do nothing else but guard relics?" ...|$|R
25|$|Sociologist David Gibson has {{explored}} the ExComm's deliberations from a discourse-analytic, or conversation-analytic, perspective. He argues that inasmuch as Kennedy's decisions were {{shaped by the}} ExComm's deliberations, they hinged on the group <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the dangers that awaited around every corner—such as the danger that the U.S. would have to bomb operational nuclear missiles were the blockade to fail to force Khrushchev to remove the missiles.|$|E
25|$|Some {{educators}} {{hold the}} view that sexuality is equated with violence. These educators think that <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> sexuality will decrease the rate of adolescent sexuality. However, not having access to sexual education {{has been found to}} have negative effects upon students, especially groups such as adolescent girls who come from low-income families. Not receiving appropriate sexual health education increases teenage pregnancy, sexual victimization and high school dropout rates. Researchers state {{that it is important to}} educate students about all aspects of sexuality and sexual health to reduce the risk of these issues.|$|E
25|$|As this is {{a sacred}} ceremony, people are {{typically}} reluctant to discuss it in any great detail. Given {{a long history of}} cultural misappropriation, indigenous people are suspicious that non-Natives may abuse or misuse the traditional ways. Elders and medicine men are concerned that the ceremony should only be passed along in the right ways. The words used at a sun dance are often in the native language and are not translated for outsiders. <b>Not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> this ceremony is part of the respect the people display for it. In addition, the detailed way in which a respected elder speaks, teaches, and explains a sun dance to younger members of the tribe is unique and not easily quoted, nor is it intended for publication.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, at Cambridge, James married Prudence A. ("Prue") Shaw, an emeritus {{reader in}} Italian studies at University College London {{and the author}} of Reading Dante: From Here to Eternity. James and Shaw have two daughters. In April 2012, the Australian Channel Nine {{programme}} A Current Affair ran an item in which the former model Leanne Edelsten admitted to an eight-year affair with James beginning in 2004. Shaw threw her husband out of the family home following the revelation. Prior to this, for most of his working life, James divided his time between a converted warehouse flat in London and the family home in Cambridge. He maintained a general policy of <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> his family publicly, although he has made occasional self-deprecating comments in his various memoirs about some of his experiences of living in a house with three women.|$|E

[...] "He's <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a guy running around in green tights and a glossy fun-filled movie for kids. He's talking along the lines of tragedy and psychodrama.

500|$|The {{journalist}} Dave Besseling of GQ, in 2014, described Kapoor as [...] "friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you’d {{want to play}} {{video games}} with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister". However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental. Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles. Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, [...] "I just don’t socialise much, I don’t party too much, I don’t {{know what to say}} to the media if I’m <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a film that I am doing, so yeah, maybe I am perceived as a snob." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first line}} of {{dialogue}} Whithouse wrote was the Doctor's translation of the Minotaur's words: [...] "An ancient creature, drenched {{in the blood of}} the innocent, drifting in space through an endless shifting maze. For such a creature, death would be a gift". The Minotaur then tells the Doctor he was <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> himself, but rather the Doctor. This is foreshadowing of the upcoming event of the Doctor's death, the story arc of the series. Amy and Rory's departure in the episode was only temporary; they return for the series finale, [...] "The Wedding of River Song" [...] and appear briefly {{at the end of the}} 2011 Christmas Special.

500|$|On the Charlie Rose talk show, Cameron {{acknowledged}} {{parallels with}} {{idea of the}} [...] "noble savage", but argued: [...] "When indigenous populations who are at a bow and arrow level are met with technological superior forces, [...] somebody doesn't help them, they lose. So we are <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a racial group within an existing population fighting for their rights." [...] Cameron rejected claims that the film is racist, asserting that Avatar is about respecting others' differences. [...] Adam Cohen of The New York Times felt similarly, writing that the Na'vi greeting [...] "I see you" [...] contrasts with the oppression of, and even genocide against, those who we fail to accept for what they are, citing Jewish ghettos and the Soviet gulags as examples.|$|E
500|$|James Hunt of {{the website}} Den of Geek said that [...] "This {{is one of}} those episodes which exemplify all that is awful about Star Trek in general. I'm <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> season one's dubious {{production}} values (which, to be fair, are considerably more even than they were when the series began) but about the episode's very fabric." [...] Michelle Erica Green for TrekNation thought that the episode could have been better if the guest cast was up to a better quality. However, she felt that the episode fell foul of several TNG season one writing errors, such as Deanna Troi's statements breaking any mounting tension and the crew failing to do such quite simple steps such as separating feuding aliens and William Riker being held hostage {{for the second time in}} successive episodes.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Colbert, portraying his {{character}} Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, chose the word truthiness just moments before taping the premiere episode of The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005, after deciding that the originally scripted word – [...] "truth" [...] – was not absolutely ridiculous enough: [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> truth, we're {{talking about something}} that seems like truth – the truth we want to exist", he explained. He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: [...] "Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen." ...|$|E

500|$|Even if the Nazko swarm were {{a warning}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption, Hickson doubted {{it would turn}} out to be a highly explosive eruption like those that can occur in subduction-zone volcanoes. [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption or the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a lava fountain that sends globs of lava [...] into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide would be released during the event.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, Rihanna {{sings in}} a taunting nature, taking {{pleasure}} {{in being able}} to tease the listener. T'Cha Dunlevy of The Montreal Gazette compared Rihanna's [...] "" [...] vocals in the lyrics “Suck my cockiness/Lick my persuasion" [...] to the style in which Britney Spears sings on her 2009 single [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] (Circus, 2008). Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine noted that Rihanna's vocals in the lyrics [...] "I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it" [...] offer [...] "coos" [...] about wanting sex, whilst sarcastically writing that [...] "we're pretty sure she's <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the chicken pot pie she left for dinner." [...] James Montgomery of MTV noted that the lyrics [...] "Suck my cockiness/Lick my persuasion", are, in his opinion, the best [...] "come-on" [...] line of 2011 alongside Lady Gaga's [...] "Heavy Metal Lover" [...] (Born This Way, 2011) lyrics [...] "I want your whiskey mouth/All over my blond south".|$|E
500|$|The {{romantic and}} emotionally charged {{aspects of the}} film were equally praised. Andrew L.

[...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as, [...] "A lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that [...] "Cameron's magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine, on the other hand, wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.|$|E
