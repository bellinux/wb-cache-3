25|$|Individuals {{who suffer}} from chronic pain {{experience}} prolonged pain at sites {{that may have been}} previously injured, yet are otherwise currently healthy. This phenomenon is related to neuroplasticity due to a maladaptive reorganization of the nervous system, both peripherally and centrally. During the period of tissue damage, <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> inflammation cause an elevation of nociceptive input from the periphery to the central nervous system. Prolonged nociception from the periphery then elicits a neuroplastic response at the cortical level to change its somatotopic organization for the painful site, inducing central sensitization. For instance, individuals experiencing complex regional pain syndrome demonstrate a diminished cortical somatotopic representation of the hand contralaterally as well as a decreased spacing between the hand and the mouth. Additionally, chronic pain has been reported to significantly reduce the volume of grey matter in the brain globally, and more specifically at the prefrontal cortex and right thalamus. However, following treatment, these abnormalities in cortical reorganization and grey matter volume are resolved, as well as their symptoms. Similar results have been reported for phantom limb pain, chronic low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E

30|$|Potential {{mechanisms}} for increased pain threshold at the exercising muscle site {{are associated with}} peripheral inhibition of the nociceptive signal. Endogenous opioid-related substances are expressed at central sites in the nervous system but are also locally expressed at the exercising muscle site and this may attenuate the nociceptive signal (Tegeder et al. 2003). However, caution must be applied when appraising exercise-induced pain inhibition with experimental stimuli. It {{has been shown that}} noxious thermal sensitivity such as cold and heat are not consistently inhibited following aerobic exercise (Ruble et al. 2005; Janal et al. 1984). In another study, reduced pressure pain sensitivity was observed following isometric exercise but not for aerobic exercise (Vaegter et al. 2015). Moreover, heat pain threshold was shown to be increased but not PPT following aerobic exercise (Kodesh and Weissman-Fogel 2014). Reduced pain sensitivity following exercise has been more consistently evident with suprathreshold <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> (Kodesh <b>and</b> Weissman-Fogel 2014; Naugle et al. 2012). Together, this suggests that the reduced pain sensitivity following exercise may be observed according to the type of <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> the modality of exercise applied (Naugle et al. 2012; Lau et al. 2015). Despite these limitations, our results show an increase in the PPT at the exercising muscle site following moderate intensity aerobic exercise.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{spatially}} cued behavioural {{responses of}} {{two species of}} fish to an acute <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> <b>and</b> demonstrates response elasticity. Typical avoidance responses to a nociceptive stimulus were used to test (1) if fish learn to avoid spatial areas associated with a potentially <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus,</b> (2) learning <b>and</b> memory improves with increased <b>stimulus</b> intensity <b>and</b> (3) a supposedly innate reflex behavioural responses change depending on the circumstances. Electric shocks with two different intensities, low (2. 5 V and 3 V for trout and goldfish, respectively) and high (25 V and 30 V for trout and goldfish, respectively), were administered directly to the skin to stimulate cutaneous nociceptors. Goldfish (n = 8) demonstrated spatially cued shock avoidance {{and an increase in}} stimulus voltage, significantly improved shock-avoidance learning and memory. However, trout (n = 8) demonstrated shock-avoidance learning but no significant <b>stimulus</b> discrimination <b>and</b> little information retention. The presence of a conspecific significantly changed this behavioural response to a <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Trout were willing to remain {{in the vicinity of the}} conspecific while being subjected to low intensity shock stimuli previously shown to elicit avoidance. Goldfish tended to leave this area yet remain in the mid-tank area, adjacent to the stimulating zone, rather than at the end of the tank. These results suggest that shock avoidance in fish is not purely a reflex action. Fish were prepared to change the supposedly innate avoidance reaction according to a change in circumstances, an important concept in the ongoing debate on pain perception in fish.

40|$|Background: Anatomic sites {{within the}} brain, which {{activate}} {{in response to}} <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli,</b> can be identified {{with the use of}} functional magnetic resonance imaging. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the analgesic effects of ketamine could be imaged. Methods: Ketamine was administered to eight healthy volunteers with use of a target-controlled infusion to three predicted plasma concentrations: 0 (saline), 50 (subanalgesic), and 200 ng/ml (analgesic, subanesthetic). Volunteers received <b>noxious</b> thermal <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> auditory <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> performed a motor task within a 3 -T human brain imaging magnet. Activation of brain regions in response to <b>noxious</b> <b>and</b> auditory <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> during the motor task was compared with behavioral measures. Results: The analgesic subanesthetic dose of ketamine significantly reduced the pain scores, and this matched a decrease in activity within brain regions that activate in response to <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli,</b> in particular, the insular cortex and thalamus. A different pattern of activation was observed in response to an auditory task. In comparison, smaller behavioral and imaging changes were found for the motor paradigm. The lower dose of ketamine gave similar but smaller nonsignificant effects. Conclusion: The analgesic effect can be measured within a more global effect of ketamine as shown by auditory and motor tasks, and the analgesia produced by ketamine occurs with a smaller degree of cortical processing in pain-related regions...|$|R

2500|$|In 2009, Elwood and Mirjam Appel {{showed that}} hermit crabs make motivational {{trade-offs}} between electric shocks {{and the quality}} of the shells they inhabit. In particular, as hermit crabs are shocked more intensely, they become increasingly willing to leave their current shells for new shells, and they spend less time deciding whether to enter those new shells. Moreover, because the researchers did not offer the new shells until after the electrical stimulation had ended, the change in motivational behavior was the result of memory of the noxious event, not an immediate reflex. [...] It was also shown that hermit crabs experiencing increasing electric shocks left their shell at a reduced intensity when the shell was from a less preferred species than did those in shells of a more desirable species.
