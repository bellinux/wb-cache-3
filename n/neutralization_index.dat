40|$|In rhesus monkeys a wide dosage {{range of}} 17 D yellow fever (YF) vaccine {{extending}} {{to a level}} even below that recommended for vaccination of man elicited an immune response providing solid protection to challenge with virulent YF virus. Forty-three of 45 monkeys vaccinated with 102. 3 or greater weanling mouse mean lethal doses of 17 D vaccine were resistant to challenge 20 weeks later with virulent Asibi strain YF virus. Monkeys given graded doses of lesser amounts of vaccine were progressively more susceptible to challenge. With a vaccine dose ≥ 102. 3 weanling mouse mean lethal doses, plaque neutralization (PN) seroconversion rates were 90 % or greater, whereas hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) and complement-fixing (CF) seroconversion rates were unrelated to vaccine dosage and were generally {{in the range of}} 20 to 80 %. Ninety-six percent (51 of 54) of immune monkeys had PN titers ≥ 0. 7 log 10 (fivefold) <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> as compared to approximately 55 to 65 % who showed HI or CF titers ≥ 2 log 2 (fourfold) <b>neutralization</b> <b>index.</b> After challenge with Asibi strain YF virus, antibody titers of all three tests increaed equally.

40|$|In {{studies on}} the factors and {{conditions}} influencing the yellow fever (YF) virus plaque neutralization test, 60 min {{was found to be}} the minimal time necessary for equilibration of the virus-antibody complex at 23 and 37 C. Maximal virus titers in the diluent controls and the pre- and postinoculation serum-containing mixtures occurred by the 60 -min adsorption time. Serum <b>neutralization</b> <b>indices</b> also seemed to level by this time. Heating (56 C for 30 min) decreased the neutralizing capacity of serum. However, the slope of the neutralization curve was not affected. The addition of native (unheated) “serum factor” in the form of fresh guinea pig or monkey sera partially restored the neutralizing activity lost by heating in some, but not all, sera. Many sera contained nonspecific inhibitors of YF virus infectivity and neutralization. Preliminary studies with ether extraction suggest that these inhibitors are lipid in nature...|$|R
40|$|Groups of two {{or three}} day old pigs were inoculated {{intravenously}} with cell culture grown transmissible gastroenteritis virus. A single or a multiple dosage schedule was used. The magnitude of immune response was measured in terms of serum <b>neutralization</b> <b>indices.</b> A single dose of relatively attenuated virus caused mild clinical signs of transmissible gastroenteritis infection in the pigs and induced a low level of antibody in the serum by the seventh day after inoculation. Repeated injections of virus at seven day intervals stimulated little increase in antibody titers. However, high serum antibody titers were obtained for all pigs if the time interval between injections was extended to 15 days. Sera obtained early after exposure to live transmissible gastroenteritis virus contained mainly IgM antibody whereas sera obtained later after exposure contained mainly IgG antibody.

40|$|We have exposed 22 {{independent}} type 2 poliovirus isolates {{to human}} intestinal fluid and purified trypsin. In all cases the virus retained its infectivity, while {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} of viral proteins showed disappearance of the VP 1 bands. Concomitantly, the viruses became resistant to antigenic site 1 -specific monoclonal antibodies, indicating that the cleavage {{took place at the}} antigenic site 1. Sera from persons immunized solely with the inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) neutralized intact type 2 polioviruses more readily than the corresponding trypsin-cleaved virus preparations. The ratio between the <b>neutralization</b> <b>indices</b> for the intact and trypsin-cleaved type 2 polioviruses was not significantly changed by a dose of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine given to children previously immunized with IPV. These results indicate that while the antigenic site 1 of type 2 poliovirus is immunogenic in humans when IPV is used, the relative role of this antigenic site in human immunity appears to be less critical than {{that in the case of}} type 3 polioviruses. Before we obtained these results, only antigenic site 1 had been shown to be immunogenic in type 2 polioviruses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Brushtail possums, Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr, were {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} Ross River (RR) or Barmah Forest (BF) virus by Aedes vigilax (Skuse) mosquitoes. Eight of 10 animals exposed to RR virus developed neutralizing antibody, and 3 possums developed high viremia for 48 hr after infection, sufficient to infect recipient mosquitoes. Two of 10 animals exposed to BF virus developed neutralizing antibody. Both infected possums main-tained detectable neutralizing antibody to BF {{for at least}} 45 days after infection (log <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> 2. 0 at 45 days). Eight possums did not develop neutralizing antibody to BF despite exposure to infected mosquitoes.

40|$|Due to {{variations}} in serotypes among different strains of {{avian infectious bronchitis}} viruses (IBV), vaccination of chicks by imported vaccines fails {{to protect them from}} IBV infections in Taiwan. Therefore, we develop attenuated vaccines from local strains in Taiwan. A Taiwan Group I (TW I) strain was passaged 74 times through specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs, and then tested in SPF chickens. The attenuated vaccine was not pathogenic in 1 -week-old chicks, had a <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> (NI) of greater than 4. 4 and efficacy of 90 % when inoculated birds were challenged with a field IBV strain. Similar results were obtained for a vaccine made from a Taiwan Group II IBV strain. Additionally, the TW I attenuated vaccine strain had no reversion to virulence after five back passages in chicks.

During this period the owl monkey developed specific antibody to H. saimiri to a maximal <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> of 5. 5 logs. The other monkey remained uninfected for an observation period of one year. The documentation of this horizontal transmission of H. saimiri infection from squirrel monkeys to an owl monkey suggests that owl monkeys developing spontaneous malignant lymphomas associated with H. saimiri infection may also have acquired the infection in this manner.

40|$|Abstract. We {{conducted}} a randomized, double-blind, phase III yellow fever (YF) vaccine trial among 1, 107 healthy children in Sullana in northern Peru. The {{safety and efficacy}} (by measurement of geometric mean neutralizing antibody titer responses) were determined for two YF vaccines, ARILVAX ™ (n 738) and YF-VAX (n 369). Serocon-version rates were higher (94. 9 %) in ARILVAX ™ than in YF-VAX (90. 6 %) recipients. The two-sided 95 % confidence interval (YF-VAX–ARILVAX™) was (− 12. 8 % to − 2. 5 %), indicating that the higher seroconversion rate for Arilvax™ was significant. Post-vaccination (30 -day) mean log 10 <b>neutralization</b> <b>indices</b> {{were found to be}} similar for both products: 1. 32 for ARILVAX ™ and 1. 26 for YF-VAX (P 0. 1404, by analysis of variance). A similar number of subjects in each group reported at least one adverse event (AE); 441 (59. 8 %) for ARILVAX ™ versus 211 (59. 9 %) for YF-VAX. Most (591; 96. 7 %) of these were of a mild nature and resolved without treatment. There were no treatment-related serious AEs.

40|$|Simple assay {{systems for}} {{infectivity}} titrations of {{avian infectious bronchitis}} virus (IBV) in chicken embryo trachea organ cultures (OC) were developed using plastic multiplate wells with one tracheal ring per well; these assays appeared {{to be much more}} satisfactory than the conventional rolled-tube method. The medium, 0. 05 M HEPES (N- 2 -hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'- 2 -ethanesulfonic acid) -buffered Eagle minimal essential medium was not changed during observation. A medium containing 0. 4 % bovine serum albumin did not influence the virus yield, but did stabilize virus viability during storage. Reproducibility of results obtained in the OC system was confirmed by performing replicate titrations of the Beaudette strain with three different passage histories. The mean virus titers in the OC were lower than those in chicken embryos, depending on the IBV passage histories. The time required for ciliostasis was related not only to the concentration of virus, but also to the IBV passage history. Application of OC techniques for the constant serum-variable virus neutralization test gave low <b>neutralization</b> <b>indexes</b> with excellent reproducibility as compared with those obtained in the chicken embryo assay system. Also, the slopes of neutralization curves obtained by assays in OC were less steep than those seen in the chicken embryo system...|$|R
40|$|Three {{families}} in which cases of poliomyelitis had recently occurred were studied for {{the extent of}} subclinical infection {{and the presence of}} serum antibodies to both the mouse-adapted Lansing strain and the specific strain of poliomyelitis isolated from members of the family. Virus was recovered from the stools of all 5 cases and from 8 of 17 familial associates {{at the time of the}} first collection of specimens. Only two of the associates were still carrying virus 3 weeks later. The individuals from whom virus was recovered were younger than 11 years of age with two exceptions, one of them a frank case. Antibodies to the mouse-adapted Lansing strain of poliomyelitis virus were demonstrated in the sera of every person 11 years of age or older but in none from individuals under this age with the possible exception of one whose second specimen was weakly positive. Antibodies for the specific agent isolated from each family were likewise found at the beginning of the study in every person over 11 years of age but also in 4 of 9 under that age. The <b>neutralization</b> <b>indices</b> of sera of the second collection were generally higher than those of the sera collected soon after the disease occurred in the family, reflecting the antigenic stimulus of the "family" viruses. The inverse relationship of demonstrable antibodies to virus isolations strongly suggests that the presence of serum antibodies is effective in limiting subclinical infection with poliomyelitis virus. The question of cross-immunity in protection against infection with poliomyelitis virus is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of an active vaccination program, recently emerged strains of nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in Korea have caused significant economic losses in the poultry industry. In this study, we assessed the pathogenic and antigenic characteristics of a K-IIb type field strain of IBV that emerged in Korea since 2003, such as Kr/Q 43 / 06. Specific pathogen free 1 -weekold chickens exhibited severe respiratory symptoms (dyspnea) and nephropathogenic lesions (swollen kidneys with nephritis and urate deposits) following challenge with the recent IBV field strain. The antigenic relatedness (R value), based on a calculated virus <b>neutralization</b> <b>index,</b> of the K-IIb type field strain and K-IIa type strain KM 91 (isolated in 1991) was 30 %, which indicated that the recent strain, Kr/Q 43 / 06, is a new variant that is antigenically distinct from strain KM 91.

40|$|Eighteen {{hybridoma}} lines {{obtained by}} immunization of mice with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) lentogenic strain La Sota or velogenic strain Italien produced hemagglutinating monoclonal antibodies. The 18 monoclones {{were divided into}} four groups according to their reactivity toward native hemagglutinin neuraminidase protein (HN), nonglycosylated HN precursor, and heat-denatured HN blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Only group II reagents were reactive toward their targets in all conditions tested. They were considered sequence-specific antibodies. Group I antibodies did not require glycosylation but lacked reactivity towards the denatured glycosylated antigen. Monoclonal antibodies from group III recognized only the native HN. Group IV {{was made up of}} a single monoclone that lacked reactivity with NDV Italien but recognized the La Sota strain in hemagglutination inhibition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Five hybridoma lines produced monoclonal antibodies which neutralized viral infectivity but failed to inhibit hemagglutination.

Fifty-five poliovirus laboratory strains and field isolates were assayed by <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> test with {{a panel of}} homotypic monoclonal antibodies. A total of 27 monoclonal antibodies were used. Two categories of neutralization epitopes were found, i. e., cross-reacting (K), which is present on almost all strains of the same serotype, and strain-specific (V, variable), either wild (VW) or Sabin (VS). Several distinct neutralization epitopes were defined {{for each of the}} three poliovirus serotypes in almost every category. The study of antigenic variation of the Sabin type 1 vaccine virus during replication in human intestine showed that the VS neutralization epitope may be lost and even replaced by the VW epitopes of the parental Mahoney virus. A late isolate from a vaccine-fed infant recovered the complete neutralization epitope pattern of the Mahoney strain. Upon in vivo virus replication, a different kind of antigenic variation was also detected in which an epitope lost its function in virus neutralization but kept its antigenic conformation unaltered. Neutralization epitope analysis demonstrated that the presence of VS epitopes on a field isolate suggests the Sabin origin of the strain when the isolate displays the same epitope pattern as the original Sabin virus, or confirms it when the VS epitope(s) is mutually exclusive of VW epitopes. The lack of VS epitopes on a field isolate does not rule out its being of Sabin origin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{comparative}} visualization of the acoustic simulation results obtained by two different approaches that were combined {{into a single}} simulation algorithm. The first method solves the wave equation on a volume grid based on finite elements. The second method, phonon tracing, is a geometric approach that we have previously developed for interactive simulation, visualization and modeling of room acoustics. Geometric approaches of this kind are more efficient than FEM in the high and medium frequency range. For low frequencies they fail to represent diffraction, which {{on the other hand}} can be simulated properly by means of FEM. When combining both methods we need to calibrate them properly and estimate in which frequency range they provide comparable results. For this purpose we use an acoustic metric called gain and display the resulting error. Furthermore we visualize interference patterns, since these depend not only on diffraction, but also exhibit phase-dependent amplification and <b>neutralization</b> effects. <b>Index</b> Terms—acoustic simulation, comparative visualization, ray tracing, finite element method, phonon map...|$|R

COV(HIV) pseudotype virus is {{a useful tool for}} the investigation of a variety of questions regarding HIV entry into susceptible cells, including steps in virus binding, fusion, and internalization, and the role of molecules which inhibit entry. COV, a rhabdovirus closely related to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), replicated and caused cytopathic effect in primary cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and in human cell lines of lymphocytoid or monocytoid origin, making it an ideal candidate for pseudotype production. 174 XCEM cells, which were permissive for selected macrophage-tropic strains as well as most lymphocyte-tropic strains of HIV- 1, were used to produce stocks of putative pseudotype virus. To neutralize parental COV in these stocks, a rabbit antiserum was produced which had a <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> of > 10 (7) at a dilution of 1 : 100.

40|$|Abstract. Yellow fever (YF) is a {{significant}} health problem in South America and Africa. Travelers to these areas require immunization. The United States, infested with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, is at risk of introduction of this disease. There is only a single U.

A randomized, double-blind outpatient {{study was conducted in}} 1, 440 healthy individuals, half of whom received the U. S. vaccine (YF-VAX) and half the vaccine manufactured in the United Kingdom (ARILVAX). A randomly selected subset of approximately 310 individuals in each treatment group was tested for YF neutralizing antibodies 30 days after vaccination. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of individuals who developed a log <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> (LNI) of 0. 7 or higher. Seroconversion occurred in 98. 6 % of individuals in the ARILVAX group and 99. 3 % of those in the YF-VAX group. Statistically, ARILVAX was equivalent to YF-VAX (P. 001). Both vaccines elicited mean antibody responses well above the minimal level (LNI 0. 7) protective against wild-type YF virus. The mean LNI in the YF-VAX group was higher (2. 21) than in the ARILVAX group (2. 06; P. 010) possibly because of the higher dose contained in YF-VAX. Male gender, Caucasian race, and smoking were associated with higher antibody responses. Both vaccines were well tolerated. Overall, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to safety except that indi-viduals in the ARILVAX group experienced significantly less edema, inflammation, and pain at the injection site than those in the YF-VAX group. No serious adverse events were attributable to either vaccine. YF-VAX participant...|$|E
40|$|Vaccination {{has been}} one of the most {{important}} interventions in disease prevention and control. The impact of vaccination largely depends on the quality and suitability of the chosen vaccine. To determine the suitability of a vaccine strain, antigenic matching is usually studied by in vitro analysis. In this study, we performed three in vitro test methods to determine which one gives the lowest variability and the highest discriminatory capacity. Binary ethylenimine inactivated vaccines, prepared from 10 different foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype A strains, were used to vaccinate cattle (5 animals for each strain). The antibody titers in blood serum samples 3 weeks postvaccination (w. p. v.) were determined by a virus neutralization test, <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> test, and liquid-phase blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The titers were then used to calculate relationship coefficient (r 1) values. These r 1 values were compared to the genetic lineage using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. In the two neutralization test methods, the median titers observed against the test strains differed considerably, and the sera of the vaccinated animals did not always show the highest titers against their respective homologous virus strains. When the titers were corrected for test strain effect (scaling), the variability (standard error of the mean per vaccinated group) increased because the results were on a different scale, but the discriminatory capacity improved. An ROC analysis of the r 1 value calculated on both observed and scaled titers showed that only r 1 values of the liquid-phase blocking ELISA gave a consistent statistically significant result. Under the conditions of the present study, the liquid-phase blocking ELISA showed less variation and still had a higher discriminatory capacity than the other tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} drug cyclophosphamide {{was used to}} study the effect of immunosuppression {{on the degree of}} chronic lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV) viremia in mice. Weekly injections of cyclophosphamide caused an increase of LDV viremia of ca. 2. 5 log 10 50 % infectious doses per ml as compared to the viremia in the nontreated mice. This increase occurred {{at about the same time}} that the formation of antibody with a <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> of 2 to 3 log 10 per ml could be demonstrated in the serum of control mice, whereas both neutralizing antibody and sensitized (antibody-bound but infectious) virus were absent in the immunosuppressed mice. In one experiment, antibody did not reappear 28 weeks after a 24 -week course of cyclophosphamide treatment. In another experiment in which the drug was given for 12 weeks, antibody appeared again in the treated mice 14 weeks after cessation of drug administration and was accompanied by a decrease in viremia. The normal decrease of early viremia during the first 2 weeks of infection in immunosuppressed mice suggests that the immune response is not the cause of this initial decrease in LDV viremia but that interferon and perhaps other nonimmune factors may be involved here. The increased viremia in the immunosuppressed mice during the later stages of infection indicates that the immune response plays an important role in partial control of chronic viremia. The quantitative correlation between the decrease in neutralizing antibody and the increase in viremia in immunosuppressed mice suggests that antibody rather than cellular immunity may be the more important immune factor in the control of chronic viremia...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) M group strains {{have been assigned}} to date to nine distinct genetic subtypes, designated A through I, according to phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequences of their env or gag genes. Whether there is any relationship between phylogenetic subtypes and the neutralization serotypes is not clear, yet defining the nature of any such relationship by mathematical means would be of major importance {{for the development of}} globally effective HIV- 1 vaccines. We have therefore developed a quantitative method to analyze serum neutralization of HIV- 1 isolates and to identify HIV- 1 neutralization serotypes. This method involves calculations of the <b>neutralization</b> <b>index,</b> N(i), a newly defined parameter derived from plots generated from in vitro neutralization assays, calculations of pairwise serum-virus vector distances, and cluster analyses. We have applied this approach to analyze three independent neutralization matrices involving primary HIV- 1 strains and sera from genetic subtypes A, B, C, D, E, F, and I. Detailed serum and HIV- 1 isolate cluster analyses have shown that in general, the identified neutralization serotypes do not directly correlate with HIV- 1 genetic subtypes. These results suggest that neutralization serotypes do not during natural HIV- 1 infection are not governed by antibodies directed against simple epitopes within gp 120 monomers. A significant proportion (28 %) of 1, 213 combinations of sera and HIV- 1 isolates caused serum-dependent infectivity enhancement [negative N(i) values] rather than neutralization. We also noted that negative N(i) values tended to correlate better with certain HIV- 1 isolates rather than with HIV- 1 -positive sera. Syncytium-inducing variants of HIV- 1 were slightly more likely than non-syncytium-inducing variants to undergo serum-dependent infectivity enhancement, although the latter variants could clearly be susceptible to enhancement...|$|E
40|$|During the 1971 {{epidemic}} of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) in south Texas, 203 suspect VEE cases {{were evaluated by}} the Center for Disease Control. Sixty-seven were confirmed as cases of VEE. Laboratory confirmation was accomplished by isolation of VEE virus from a serum specimen taken during the acute illness in 50 (75 %) of the confirmed cases. Serological confirmation was obtained in 17 cases (25 %). Virus isolations were most often obtained from sera collected during the first 3 days of illness. Peak serum virus titers (algebraic mean, 10 (5 - 7) suckling mouse intracranial 50 % lethal doses [SMICLD 50] per ml) occurred on day 2 of illness. One-half of the sera from which virus was isolated contained at least 10 (5) SMICLD 50 /ml, which {{has been shown to}} be sufficient to infect some vector mosquitoes. Blood from 13 virus-positive VEE cases was obtained 1 and 11 months after illness. Hemagglutination-inhibiting, complement-fixing, and neutralizing antibodies were formed by all 13 patients 1 month after illness. Hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers were essentially unchanged 11 months after illness. Complement-fixing antibody was undetectable 11 months after illness in 23 % of cases and was detectable at dilutions of 1 : 8 or 1 : 6 in 77 %. Neutralizing antibody (measured by log <b>neutralization</b> <b>index)</b> was not detectable 1 year after illness in one person (8 %); titers had declined from 1. 0 to 2. 0 in 46 %, were unchanged in 39 %, and were not tested in one person (8 %). No evidence of intrafamilial spread of VEE virus was obtained in either of two illness and antibody surveys. A randomized household illness and antibody survey of 681 Port Isabel residents revealed an inapparent infection ratio of 1 : 11 and an overall antibody prevalence of 3. 2 %...|$|E
40|$|Lassa virus-infected cynomolgus monkeys were passively immunized with immune plasma of primate {{or human}} origin to {{gain insight into}} {{criteria}} for plasma selection and administration to human Lassa fever patients. Protective efficacy was correlated with neutralizing antibody concentrations, expressed as a log 10 <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> (LNI). Convalescent Lassa-immune monkey plasma was titrated for protective efficacy in monkeys by intravenous inoculation with dilutions of plasma {{on the day of}} subcutaneous Lassa virus inoculation (day 0) and again on days 3 and 6. Monkeys that received undiluted plasma (LNI = 4. 1) (1 ml/kg per treatment) survived a lethal viral dose, whereas those given a 1 : 3 dilution (LNI = 2. 6) of this same plasma (1 ml/kg per treatment) died. Protection was restored when the volume of the 1 : 3 plasma dilution was increased to 3 ml/kg per treatment. Plasma diluted 1 : 9 or more (LNI = 1. 5 or less) delayed onset and suppressed the magnitude of viremia but failed to confer protection at 3 ml/kg per treatment. Immunological enhancement, defined as increased viremia or accelerated death, did not occur following inadequate treatment. Human convalescent plasma also protected recipient monkeys; reductions in mortality and viremia were accurately predicted by the LNI of the plasma. Plasma of Liberian origin neutralized a Liberian Lassa strain more effectively than a Sierra Leone strain in vitro (LNI = 2. 8 and 1. 6, respectively) and protected monkeys more effectively against the Liberian strain. Geographic origin is thus a factor in the selection of optimal plasma for treatment of human Lassa fever, since geographically matched plasma is more likely to contain adequate LNI titers against homologous Lassa virus strains.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study the prospect of bovine colostrum utilization to produce specific antibody as passive immunotherapy against avian influenza. Pregnant Frisian Holstein cows were injected with commercial killed Avian Influenza (AI) vaccine given double doses subcutaneously three times every two weeks. Prior to vaccination, the cows were given immunomodulator 0. 1 mg. kg- 1 BW administered orally for three days. The animals then were injected by inactive H 5 N 1 antigent without adjuvant intravenously to meet the dose of 104 HAU. Blood samples were collected to detect anti AI antibody using Enzyme Linked Jmmunosorbent Assay technique. Colostral samples were analysed to detect antibody against AI using Haemagglutination Inhibition technique. IgG stabilities were tested against enzyme, pH, and spray dried prosessing with inlet dan outlet temperature of 1400 C and 520 C. repectively. The colostral lgG efficacy on neutralizing H 5 N 1 virus activity was determined in vitro (by using Serum Neutralization Test and protective titer measurement) and in ovo (challenge test by using Embryonic Chicken Egg). The result indicated that serum antibody against H 5 N 1 was detected {{one week after the}} second vaccination. Titer of colostral antibody against H 5 N 1 was high (28). Biological activity of colostral IgG remain stable at pH 5 - 7 and after spraying-drying prosessing, but decreased after treatment by trypsin and pepsin enzymes. The neutralization test showed that the fresh and spray dried colostral IgG against H 5 N 1 were able to neutralize 107 EID 50 AI virus H 5 N 1 with <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> of 1. 1 and 1. 0, respectively. In conclusion, pregnant Frisian Holstein cows injected with commercial killed Avian Influenza (AI) vaccine were able to produce colostral lgG against AI H 5 N...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocytic choriomeningitis {{virus and}} Semliki Forest virus readily {{multiply}} in the rabbit eye following inoculation into the vitreous. Less than 10 mouse LD 50 of LCM virus {{was sufficient to}} induce multiplication in the eye, whereas, approximately 1000 LD 50 of SFV was required to initiate infection. Both viruses multiplied in the rabbit eye as an inapparent infection. Little or no virus could be recovered from the optic nerves or brains of the rabbits, although virus was present in high titer in the eyes. The animals {{showed no signs of}} illness other than a transitory fever. Large amounts of SFV induced a severe iritis followed by corneal opacity. This reaction appeared to be due to "toxic" properties of the virus. No ocular reactions have been observed with LCM virus other than a mild transitory hyperemia. The yield of virus from the eye following inoculation of large amounts of SFV was less than when more dilute inocula were used. Maximum multiplication of both viruses occurred about 48 hours after inoculation into the vitreous. SFV remained in high titer for about 4 days and thereafter could be recovered in variable amounts up to about 5 weeks after inoculation. LCM virus could be recovered in gradually decreasing amounts up to about 3 weeks after inoculation. Serum-neutralizing antibodies appeared in high titer (<b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> up to 3000) following inoculation of SFV into the rabbit eye. However, only traces of antibody could be detected in extracts of the eyes. SFV was obtained irregularly and in low titer from the aqueous humor following inoculation into either the vitreous or anterior chamber. No significant difference in the virus content of the vitreous, an extract of the retinal cells, and an extract of the whole eye could be detected 48 hours after inoculation of SFV into the vitreous. The Lansing strain of poliomyelitis virus failed to cause any detectable reaction in the rabbit eye and no evidence of multiplication of the virus was obtained in these experiments...|$|E
40|$|Two {{outbreaks}} of sheeppox {{that occurred in}} Gedarif State in June 2003 and one outbreak of goatpox that occurred in Khartoum State in March 2005 were investigated. Clinical signs were reported, morbidity rates were estimated and the total mortalities were recorded. Clinically, the disease was characterized by fever, depression and eruption of generalized pox lesions. Mortality rate ranged between 5. 2 and 6. 7 {{with a mean of}} 6. 1. All age, sex and breed groups were affected. However, more than 50 % of deaths were reported in young animals in comparison to adult sheep. Skin Scabs were collected from sick animals, homogenized and inoculated in cell culture and embryonated eggs. Two virus isolates were obtained when 4 skin samples were inoculated onto Lamb testes (LT) cell culture. These viruses as well as one previous isolate of sheeppox virus (SP 4) and the vaccine strain 0240 induced no lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of embryonated chicken eggs. On the other hand, sheeppox and goatpox isolates grew well in lamb testes (LT) cell culture with no difference in virus yield or type of CPE produced by the two viruses. In Vero cells, both viruses produced more than 90 % CPE within 7 days PI. In MDBK however, both viruses induced slight CPE that reached 60 % in 9 days. On the other hand, both viruses induced no CPE in chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells. Titration of an isolate of sheeppox virus (SP 1 O) was performed in Vero cells and resulted in a titer of 105. 2 /ml. The same virus was identified as sheeppox in virus neutralization test with 1. 4 <b>neutralization</b> <b>index.</b> Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in this study to determine the feasibility of improving diagnosis of sheep pox and goat pox in scabs collected from the field as well as in supernatant of infected cell cultures. Three methods of DNA extraction were tried. The first method (PCR 1) employed no DNA extraction step with scab homogenate or cell culture supernatant added directly to the PCR mix. This method failed to detect pox virus DNA in all scab homogenates tested but three out of six cell culture supernatants gave positive results. In the second method (PCR 2), viral DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform from skin scabs; three samples out of six gave positive results. In the third method (PCR 3), viral DNA was extracted using a commercial DNA extraction Kit; two out of three gave positive result. Accordingly, the best PCR method for sheeppox and goatpox diagnosis should include an initial step of DNA extraction...|$|E
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was {{the first}} animal {{pathogen}} {{to be identified as}} a virus, and today, more than a century later, it remains at the forefront of major animal diseases. It is a very contagious disease and affects cloven-hoofed domestic and wild animals, mostly cattle, swine, sheep, goats and buffaloes. To be able to advice on the best control measures in Africa, information on transmission of FMDV, circulating FMDV topotypes and strains in Africa and how to match vaccines to circulating outbreak virus strains is essential. In this thesis these issues are addressed. The research work described in this thesis has been performed for three important aspects. The first was to get an overview of the role that animal husbandry, trade and wildlife have on the transmission of FMD virus and to provide a scientific basis for different FMD control measures in Africa. On the same track, two surveillance studies on FMD were carried out to know the level of sero-prevalence and identify the serotypes in cattle in Eritrea. The second was to determine which serological test method is best to be used to test cross-reactions in serology and addresses the inherent variability of the relationship coefficient (r 1 -value). To this end we analysed the cross-reactions in serology using serum samples from cattle vaccinated with 10 different FMDV serotype A strain vaccines using three serological test methods (virus neutralization test, <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> test and the liquid phase blocking ELISA). The third was to investigate whether the formulation of using different adjuvants, antigen composition, antigen payload and administration route of an FMD vaccine had any influence on the breadth of the antibody response in cattle. 	The review of reported outbreaks shows that substantial diversity of the circulating FMDV serotypes and topotypes is linked to the complexity of the livestock husbandry system, the marketing structure, and livestock-wildlife interface reflecting the significant influence on the risk of transmission of the virus. The sero-surveillance studies show that serology can give indications of virus circulation not detected by agent surveillance. The comparisons of tests used for antigenic matching shows that the LPB-ELISA is the best test for detecting antigenic differences between FMDV strains. Our study on vaccine formulation and application shows that breadth of the antibody response depends mainly on the vaccine strain; we therefore propose that, for vaccine preparation, only FMD virus strains are selected that, among other important characteristics, will induce a wide antibody response to different field strains. For Africa control of FMDV by vaccination seems the best option, as control of animal movement will be difficult. Use of broadly cross-protective vaccines for FMD is recommended as variant viruses could be introduced from neighbouring countries/regions. A vaccination strategy has still a number of challenges, among others vaccine quality control and quality control of the vaccination campaign. We believe that despite the enormous investments needed in the long run, FMDV control in Africa would improve national and regional economies and food security and protect livelihoods...|$|E
40|$|Lumpy {{skin disease}} is an {{economically}} important disease which produces debility in infected cattle. The morbidity rate is about 2 % to 98 % while {{the mortality rate}} {{is estimated to be}} 3 % or more. The purpose of this research was to study the prevalence of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in Red Sea State, Eastern Sudan. Two outbreaks of LSD that occurred in Red Sea State in March 2003 to August 2005 were investigated. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed in the laboratory by virus isolation and identification. Clinically, the disease was characterized by fever, nasal discharge and salivation for about 3 days. The skinraches soon developed into nodules, 0. 5 to 5 cm in diameter, which appeared on the neck, brisket, back and thighs. Occasionally nodules were seen on the udder, vulva, scrotum and around the eyes and lips, odema of legs and brisket and enlargement of lymph nodes, depression, emaciation and loss of appetite were frequently observed. A variation in the severityof the lesion was noticed and that had been severe in crossbred animals in comparison to local ones. In the investigated outbreaks, all age, sex and breed groups were affected. However, more than 50 % of the deaths were reported in young animals in comparison with adult cattle. To determine the sero-epidemiology of LSD in Red Sea State, the agar gel immunodiffussion test was used to detect antibodies in serum samples collected from cattle of two different breeds, sex and age distributed in different areas. Out of 500 test serum samples, 341 samples gave positive result (68 % seropositive). On the other hand, 285 serum samples out of 500 were positive when tested by serum neutralization test (57 % seropositive). Seropositivity is higher when AGID test was used in comparison to serum neutralization test. IX Serological testing using AGID and neutralization tests applied on sera collected from local and crossbred cattle resulted in higher seropositive in crossbred cattle (90 % for the AGID and 63 % for SN test) than in local breed (76. 4 % for the AGID and 43. 0 % for SN test). It is obvious that the crossbred animals are more susceptible to this disease. With regard to sex, seropositivityin females was higher (73. 6 for AGID, 54. 6 % for SN test) than in males (58. 6 for AGID, 44. 7 % for SN test). Concerning the age, seropositive was higher in the age 0 – 1 year (100 % for the AGID, 70. 4 % for SN test) followed by the age 1 – 3 years (97. 7 for the AGID, 68. 3 % for SNtest) and lower in age above 3 years (59. 8 % for the AGID, 46. 8 % for SN test). This result indicates that this disease is prevailing mostly in young animals at the age of 0 – 3 years. With regard to area, seropositivitywas higher in Tokar (88 for the AGID, 75 % for SN test) and Port Sudan (64 for the AGID, 59. 5 % for SN test) and lower in Sinkat (57 % for the AGID, 18 % for SN test) and Haya (42 for the AGID, 12 % for SN test). The LSD is found to be more spreading between animals reared in Tokar area followed by Port Sudan and then Sinkat. Haya area showed a very limited prevalence of LSD disease among the animals. In the present study, the skin scabs and nodules were collected from sick animals, homogenized and inoculated in LT cell culture. Four virus isolates were obtained when 5 skin samples were inoculated in lamb tests (LT) cell culture (Port Sudan 1,Port Sudan 2, Tokar and Sinkat). These isolates produced characteristicCPE of LSDV, such as rounding of cells and cell clumping or shrinking and plaque formation when inoculated in LT cell culture. The CPE progressed slowly with cell X detachment leaving irregular holes. Spindle-shaped cells with long extremities at the margin of the holes were also seen. The affected cells exhibited a conspicuous granular appearance and irregular hole and rounding up of some cells were also observed. Titration of isolates of lumpy skin virus (Port Sudan 1, Port Sudan 2, Tokar and Sinkat) was performed inLT cells and resulted in a titer of 10 5. 2 /ml, 10 4. 2 /ml, 10 4. 3 /ml and 10 3. 6 /ml, respectively. The virus neutralization test was used as confirmatory test for diagnosis of lumpy skin disease and for comparing it with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). LT cells infected with Tokar isolate were used and the results were taken after 9 days. The results confirmed the identity of lumpy skin virus isolates {{used in the present study}} since the test gave a <b>neutralization</b> <b>index</b> of 1. 4. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in this study to determine the feasibility of improving diagnosis of lumpy skin disease virus in scabs collected from the field, as well as in supernatant of infected cell culture. Two methods of DNA extraction were tried. The first method (PCR 1) employed on DNA extraction step with scabs homogenate or cell culture supernatant added directly toPCR mixture at 99 °C for 15 min to release the DNA and then followed by ordinary PCR. By this method, 1 out of 5 samples gave positive result. In the second method (PCR 2), viral DNA was extracted by phenolchloroform specimens, four samples out of 5 gave positive results. The DNA band sizes corresponded to the expected size of 192 bp. PCR 2 seemed to be more sensitive than (PCR 1) method. Finally certain recommendations are given in this aspect...|$|E
