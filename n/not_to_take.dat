5|$|Half-Life 2: Episode Four – Also {{known as}} Return to Ravenholm, {{this project was}} in {{development}} by Arkane Studios around 2006–2007, however Valve decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the project forward. In 2012, Valve writer Marc Laidlaw confirmed rumors surrounding the project's existence and screenshots of gameplay later emerged in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Privy {{counsellors}} {{can choose}} to affirm their allegiance in similar terms should they prefer <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a religious oath. At the induction ceremony, the order of precedence places Anglicans (being those of the established church) before others.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While {{we do not have}} government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5000|$|Again {{something}} {{written before}} Tommy {{had actually been}} formed as a total idea, and that particular song wasn't about Tommy's devotees at all. It was about the rabble in general, how we, myself as part of them, were <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> fascism, were <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> dreary, dying politics; were <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{things the way they}} were, the way they always had been and that we were keen to change things."

5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off.|$|E
5|$|Bond chooses <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Smythe {{into custody}} immediately, but leaves him to {{contemplate}} his options – suicide or a court martial. As Smythe hunts for scorpion fish to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which triggers a fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.|$|E
5|$|Brudenell's first {{action on}} leaving Oxford was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his {{parliamentary}} seat but, as was traditional for wealthy {{young men of}} the time, to take the Grand Tour. His itinerary, with Russia and Sweden included, was more extensive than the traditional destinations of France and Italy. The trip allowed Brudenell to enjoy the full pleasures of both cultural and social opportunities afforded by the countries he visited.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{received}} {{an offer from}} the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London to pursue a PhD {{in the history of}} art, but decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the offer because he failed to secure a grant. Viewing acting as nothing more than a creative outlet, he joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society and starred in a successful touring production of Twelfth Night.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, after {{most of his}} {{students}} in Trieste were conscripted {{to fight in the}} First World War, Joyce moved to Zurich. Two influential private students, Baron Ambrogio Ralli and Count Francesco Sordina, petitioned officials for an exit permit for the Joyces, who in turn agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> any action against the emperor of Austria-Hungary during the war.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{governing}} power within Israel remained silent. However, on May 27, the Israeli daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which {{spoke of a}} great victory by the Arab Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, the Israeli press stressed that {{the aim of the}} operation was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths for the Arab side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded on the Israeli side.|$|E

5|$|Power, the {{defending}} champion of the Honda Indy Edmonton, won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying. In the race, Power maintained the first position {{throughout most of the}} event but was passed by teammate Hélio Castroneves with eighteen laps remaining. On the race's final restart on lap 92, Power attempted to reclaim the lead from Castroneves but the latter defended his position and was issued with a drive-through penalty. He chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it and was demoted to tenth and the victory was awarded to Dixon.|$|E
5|$|The bombing {{prompted}} {{debate within}} the administration of United States President Lyndon B. Johnson. Most of his advisers favored retaliatory bombing of North Vietnam {{and the introduction of}} American combat troops, while Johnson preferred the existing strategy of training the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to protect South Vietnam from the Vietcong. In the end, Johnson decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> retaliatory action.|$|E
5|$|The site of Goodison Park was {{earmarked}} in 1997 and 2003 for a {{food store}} by Tesco who offered £12 million which was valued at £4 {{million for the}} site but Liverpool City Council's advisor's advised against allowing planning permission. The club were advised that the planning permission required would not necessarily be granted, and chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the scheme further.|$|E

5|$|Émilie {{departed}} on 3 September 1795 with a congé de navigation authorising her {{to defend}} herself, but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> prizes as a privateer. The next day, {{she made a}} port call at Saint-Denis before cruising to Mahé. At Sainte Anne Island, two large British ships chased him, but {{he was able to}} evade them by sailing through the reefs, at night.|$|E
5|$|After two {{consecutive}} third-place finishes, Martin was victorious in 2011, beating Bradley Wiggins and defending champion Cancellara by {{a minute and}} fifteen seconds. He retained the rainbow jersey the following year; however, the margin of victory was considerably smaller as he beat the American Taylor Phinney by five seconds. In 2013, Martin won the event for a third consecutive time, again overcoming Wiggins and Cancellara. After two runner-up finishes, Wiggins prevented Martin's fourth successive win in the following season, taking the world title for the first time. Wiggins decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in 2015, focusing instead on breaking the hour record. In his absence, the winner was Belarussian cyclist Vasil Kiryienka, who came in third to Martin in 2012, beating Italy's Adriano Malori and France's Jérôme Coppel.|$|E
5|$|Although greatly {{obstructed}} by Ranavalona's policies, French and British {{political interests}} in Madagascar remained undiminished. Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries exploited {{in an attempt}} to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, Radama II. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, as expressed in the Lambert Charter he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.|$|E

5|$|Ashe and {{the party}} journey to Pharos tower, the {{location}} of the Sun-cryst, where she decides <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her revenge by following the Occuria's wishes, but instead destroy the Sun-cryst. The party defeats Gabranth, who reveals that he killed King Raminas, and then the party also defeats Cid, before destroying the crystal. The group later learns from Al-Cid that the Dalmascan Resistance, led by Ondore, is about to fight Archadia in Rabanastre, but the Archadian forces now include the Sky Fortress Bahamut, powered by the Mist released by the destruction of the Sun-Cryst. They infiltrate the Bahamut, and find Larsa attempting to dissuade his brother Vayne from his plans for war to no avail. They defeat Vayne and Venat, and Ashe and Larsa announce the end of the conflict to the battlefield. Larsa becomes the Archadian emperor and Ashe the Queen of Dalmasca; Basch replaces his brother Gabranth as Larsa's protector; Vaan and Penelo fly an airship to meet Balthier and Fran for another adventure.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the pre-production phase, Carter and Bowman were busy with the television series, leaving Sackheim to work alone. Sackheim hired executive producer Lata Ryan, who had previously collaborated with Steven Spielberg for his 1993 film, Jurassic Park. Once hired, Ryan was allowed to read the script in front of the Ten Thirteen Productions staff members—but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it away. At this time, most of the staff members had not read the script for themselves. After Ryan accepted the offer of becoming executive producer, Chris Nowak was hired as production designer, Ward Russell as director of photography and Bill Liams as construction coordinator. According to Ryan, they had secured all key personnel six weeks before principal filming began.|$|E
5|$|Burnett {{took his}} seat in the 37th Congress; sources make no mention of his making good on his threat <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the oath of office. Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden {{proposed}} a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett asked that the question be divided. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E
