5|$|In March 1950 the {{municipality}} decided definitely {{to close the}} tramway, but its actual closure came somewhat later. It was not until Saturday, 28 February 1953 that the last tram ran on the Champ de Courses line, 76 years after the network's first service. But the Rouennaise did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> the tram's services rendered, organising a first-class funeral: Just before the last scheduled run, a parade of honour made up of three trams ran from the Hôtel de ville to the Trianon depot, cheered by the crowds.|$|E
5|$|The main {{legacy of}} the SSR Abkhazia is that it created, {{for the first time}} in modern history, a defined {{geographic}} entity under the name Abkhazia. The Abkhaz people were cognizant of their republic and its quasi-independent status, and though it was removed in 1931 they did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> that it had existed. The SSR Abkhazia would take a prominent role during the glasnost and perestroika era of the late 1980s, as Abkhaz leaders called for their state to once again be formed and break away from Georgia, citing the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR Abkhazian constitution, which ultimately led to the 1992–1993 war between Abkhazia and Georgia, and the modern Abkhaz–Georgian conflict.|$|E
5|$|A chorus greets {{the dawn}} as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, {{returns to the}} shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair {{at the thought that}} Theseus will not return, Ariadne {{nevertheless}} decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a pastoral interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung ballo celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.|$|E

5|$|Conley was cross-examined by {{the defense}} for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with his normal practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E
5|$|Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) is outed at {{his school}} and {{subsequently}} bullied by his teammates {{in the locker}} room. He is also mercilessly attacked online. Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock at his old school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E
5|$|In Macau, {{three men}} {{break into a}} house, shoot a French woman (Sylvie Testud) and kill {{her husband and two}} children. The woman's father, Francis Costello (Johnny Hallyday), arrives to visit his {{daughter}} who is now suffering from serious injuries. She is nevertheless able to tell her father that there were three shooters and that she shot one of the killers in the ear. At a hotel, Costello meets Kwai (Anthony Wong), Chu (Lam Ka-Tung) and Fat Lok (Lam Suet), a trio of hitmen who are hired to murder the unfaithful wife of Triad crime boss George Fung (Simon Yam). After overhearing the murder in a hotel room, Costello reaches an unspoken agreement to walk away. Costello later tracks down Kwai's syndicate, hands them a stack of euros and his watch, and asks them to help him avenge his daughter's family's deaths. Before doing so though, he takes a Polaroid picture of each of the hitmen, and writes their names on the pictures so that he will <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> who they are. The four go to the apartment where the shooting occurred and work out what happened, the number of shooters and the weapons used.|$|E

5|$|Kublai's {{absence from}} the war front was seen by Chancellor Jia Sidao as an opportune moment, so he ordered to resume armed conflict. The Song army routed the small armed {{detachment}} that Kublai had stationed south of the Yangzi, and the Song regained its lost territory. With his ally Hulagu busy fighting the Golden Horde and his own forces needed in the north against the rival Khagan claimant Ariq Böke, Kublai was unable to focus on hostilities in the south. On May 21, 1260, Kublai sent his envoy Hao Jing and two other advisors {{to negotiate with the}} Southern Song. Upon their arrival and attempts to solve the conflict through diplomatic means, Jia Sidao ordered Kublai's embassy to be detained. Although Kublai would <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> this slight of imprisoning his ambassadors, he nonetheless had to focus on more pressing affairs with the threat of his brother and rival Khan. From 1260 to 1262 the Song forces raided Kublai's southern border which forced Kublai to retaliate with some minor incursions until 1264, when his brother finally surrendered and ended the civil war. In 1265 the first major battle in five years erupted in Sichuan province, where Kublai gained a preliminary victory and considerable war booty of 146 Song naval ships.|$|E
5|$|This {{bridge is}} {{named in honor}} and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to public service and {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, let us <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> the lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E
5|$|Watt was {{appointed}} an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on 1January 1919, {{in recognition of}} his war service. He returned to Australia on 6May {{with the rest of}} 1st Training Wing's personnel, aboard the troopship Kaisar-i-Hind, on which he was the ranking officer. Leaving the AFC soon afterwards, he was elected president of the New South Wales section of the Australian Aero Club. He also served as senior delegate on a committee of veteran military pilots examining applications for appointment to a proposed independent Australian air service. Watt was esteemed as a man who did <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> old comrades, providing former AFC members with financial aid and helping them re-establish themselves in civilian life. He maintained an interest in commercial flying but refused an offer to take up the position of controller of civil aviation in 1920 owing to his business interests, which included partnership in the family shipping firm of Gilchrist, Watt & Sanderson Ltd, and directorships of mining, rubber, and art corporations. He also turned down invitations to stand for parliament, and to join the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force.|$|E

5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E
