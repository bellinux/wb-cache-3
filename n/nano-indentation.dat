This is an effective numerical approach for studying many intriguing issues such as material deformation, dislocation propagation, phase transformation, as well as material property evaluation. Many of these issues are beyond the capability of experimental approaches under very small scales. It should be noted that MD simulation has been widely adopted in studying various nano-manufacturing processes, such as <b>nano-indentation</b> [17], nano-machining [18, 19], and nano-forming [20]. Nevertheless, the MD simulation literature on material processing that considers material deformation under wet condition is scarce.

The microstructure of the feedstock powders was better retained when sprayed with HVAF process. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed two small exothermic peaks at about 600  °C for the HVOF-sprayed coatings, without any increase in weight in thermogravimetric analysis. It suggested the re-precipitation of carbides that were dissolved during spraying due to the higher particle temperature reported by spray diagnostics system during the HVOF process (≈ 1800  °C) compared to the HVAF one (≈ 1400  °C). Micro- and <b>nano-indentations</b> helped to show the difference in inter-lamellar cohesive strength and, in turn, in the particle deposition mechanism.

The surface {{roughness}} influences the mechanical properties of materials, such as elastic modulus, hardness, tensile and yield strengths and ductility. Previous studies have shown the behavior of hardness changes by surface roughness of the material using spherical indenters on the spherical surfaces. The effect of the elastic modulus changes with the roughness, but {{this has not been}} truly investigated. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a computational methodology to estimate the behavior of elastic modulus and hardness of the material on different surfaces. The models used in this study are developed using the Msc Patran and simulated by a finite element analysis code LS-DYNA. In this study, four models have been developed with different surfaces to estimate the behavior of elastic modulus and hardness by <b>nano-indentation</b> using a sharp tip conical indenter. The change in modulus and roughness are estimated by <b>nano-indentation</b> using the Oliver and Pharr's theory. The penetration depths are normalized as the change in roughness scale on the material and also as the change in radius of the indenter. The study shows that as the roughness of a surface increases, the hardness increases from the actual hardness at various depths, and it carries on a first order model of roughness with a fractal surface material by <b>nano-indentation</b> method. Not only the roughness influences the material properties but also when the material has damage, it also influences the material properties. For this, the models are developed by placing some voids in the material, and the behavior of elastic modulus and hardness of material with and without damage are estimated. Finally, the penetration depth estimated from <b>nano-indentation</b> is compared using the classical macro-scale Hertzian theory, and interestingly found that this theory can also be used for <b>nano-indentation</b> of metals and solids.

40|$|The {{indentation}} hardness and elastic modulus of leadframe materials that consist of Cu alloy substrate and Ni/Pd bi-layer films of differing thicknesses are characterised using the micro-hardness and <b>nano-indentation</b> tests. The `true' hardness {{of the individual}} substrate and film layers is evaluated based on the empirical relationship between the measured `composite' hardness and the volume of plastically deformed material of film layers. It is found that the composite hardness determined from the <b>nano-indentation</b> test increases rapidly toward a peak at extremely low indentation depth of less than about 20 - 30 mu m for all materials studied, due mainly to the finite value of the indenter tip radius and the rough surface of the specimen on the nano-scale. The composite hardness for the coated specimens decreases with further increasing indentation depth toward the hardness value of the substrate, because of the strong influence of the film/substrate interaction and the indentation size effect. The <b>nano-indentation</b> test in general gives higher true hardness values than those obtained from the micro-hardness test.

The tribo-films, with modified properties compared to the bulk, are dynamic structures that {{play a significant role}} in friction. The existence of a tribo-modified surface layer and its importance on the overall friction of elastomers has been shown both theoretically and experimentally before. The characteristics of the modified surface layer deserve specific attention since the tribological properties of elastomers in contact with a rough counter-surface are determined by these modified surfaces together with the properties of bulk of the material. Both the formation of the modified layer and the break down (wear) of it are of importance in determining the existence and thickness of the tribo-modified layer. In this study, the importance of the wear is emphasized by comparing two styrene butadiene rubber-based elastomers in contact with a granite sphere. A current status of perception of the removal and the stability of the modified surface layers on rubbers is introduced as well as experimental work related to this matter and discussion within literature. Pin-on-disk friction tests are performed on two SBR-based samples in contact with a granite sphere under controlled environmental conditions to form the modified surface layer.

40|$|Hardness and {{elastic modulus}} {{of a typical}} {{leadframe}} material which consists of a Cu alloy substrate with Ni and Pd bi-layer coatings were characterised using Vicker's micro-hardness and <b>nano-indentation</b> tests. The two different testing methods produced similar results in that `composite' hardness for all coated specimens decreased (except at very low loads in the <b>nano-indentation</b> test) with increasing indentation depth and tended to converge at sufficiently high loads due to the strong influence of the coating/substrate interaction. The hardness values of substrate and Ni and Pd coatings were successfully determined from the `composite' hardness values based on the empirical linear relationship with the inverse of indentation diagonal {{and the rule of}} mixtures principle...|$|E
