40|$|The War of June 1967 {{proved to}} be {{instrumental}} in changing {{the perceptions of the}} principal protagonists in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and also the major powers outside the region. The pre-emptive strike launched by Israel on 6 June began a comprehensive defeat of the Arab states, and in just six days Israel increased her size threefold, incorporating large portions of Arab land into her territory. The changes that occurred can be briefly summed up as follows: Soviet influence within the Arab states increased with military advisers sent to Egypt and Syria in great numbers to help reconstruct the defeated armies (despite the fact that Soviet armaments had failed to avoid a convincing Israeli victory). Israel's confidence both i <b>n</b> <b>her</b> own strength and i <b>n</b> <b>her</b> ability to survive increased. The idea that Israel could act as a "strategic asset" became a firmly established tenet of American foreign policy. Ironically, relations between the Soviet Union and the Arab states, who backed them, were strengthened after the defeat inflicted by Israel. On a practical level, the Soviet Union embarked upon a massive programme of military and economic support for the Arab states, quickly replacing the amount of military hardware that had been lost in the war. The Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" suggested that the Arab states realised that only: "through reliance upon the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, can they abolish completely imperialist influence in the Middle East and achieve Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Territories"...|$|E

40|$|The {{stereotype}} of the dualist West versus the nondualist East has far outlived whatever usefulness it may have had. As {{one who has been}} concerned with this issue in my own work, I am happy to see Michelle Voss Roberts addressing it methodically and effectively <b>n</b> <b>her</b> Dualities: A Theology of Difference. She gives us in this book a multi-leveled study that advances this discussion dramatically on a number of interconnected fronts, both theological and ethical, encompassing wide-ranging feminist, ecological, and social justice concerns. I find myself in enthusiastic agreement with much that she writes. In what follows I will offer some reflections on a rather focused segment of Voss Robert 2 ̆ 7 s broader discussion, namely, the contribution of the Kashmiri poet-saint Lallesvari, an aspect of the book that was of particular interest to me given my training in medieval Hindu theology...|$|E
40|$|A novel pretargeted SPECT imaging {{strategy}} {{based on}} the HaloTag enzyme has been evaluated {{for the first time}} in a living system. To determine the efficacy of this approach, two clinically relevant cancer biomarkers, HER 2 and TAG- 72, were selected to represent models of internalizing and non-internalizing antigens, respectively. In MDA-MB- 231 /H 2 <b>N</b> (<b>HER</b> 2 -expressing) and LS 174 T (TAG- 72 -expressing) xenograft tumors in mice, pretargeting experiments were performed in which HaloTag-conjugated derivatives of the antibodies Trastuzumab (anti-HER 2) or CC 49 (anti-TAG- 72) were utilized as primary agents, and the small molecule HaloTag ligands 111 In-HTL- 1, - 2, and - 3 were evaluated as secondary agents. While this approach was not sufficiently sensitive to detect the internalizing HER 2 antigen, pretargeting experiments involving the most optimal secondary agent, 111 In-HTL- 3, were successful in detecting the non-internalizing antigen TAG- 72 and provided high contrast SPECT images at 4 and 24 h post-injection...|$|E
