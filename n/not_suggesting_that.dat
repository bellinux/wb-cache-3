500|$|On April3 a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} a very active hurricane season of 17named storms, ninehurricanes and fiveintense hurricanes. The increase in the forecast was attributed to the rapid dissipation of El Niño conditions. The team also forecast a neutral or weak-to-moderate La Niña and noted that sea surface temperatures were much higher than average. The estimated potential {{for at least one}} major hurricane to affect the U.S. was increased to 74percent; the East Coast potential increased to 50percent, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability rose to 49percent. However, the team's report noted that while they predicted an active season, it was <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> 2007 would be [...] "as active as the 2004 and 2005 seasons".|$|E
500|$|Since President Johnson {{had dropped}} out {{immediately}} prior to the Wisconsin Primary, McCarthy easily won {{although he did not}} face his new challenger, Robert Kennedy, who was ineligible for the ballot because he entered the race following the filing deadline. Polls suggested that McCarthy benefited the most from Johnson's withdrawal, reached 22 percent among the Democratic field, up eleven points, and two behind the still-undeclared Humphrey and fifteen behind Kennedy. He traveled to Pennsylvania later in the month, to prepare for the state's primary in late April. While there, he discussed North Korea's seizing of the USS Pueblo, stating that the United States should [...] "expect once [...] to pay ransom...if you have ships adjacent to countries that don't respect international law." [...] He clarified that he was <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the ransom should be paid, and agreed that President Johnson's use of negotiation was correct. He then compared his record of service to Kennedy, articulating that his accomplishments on civil rights paralleled {{a longer period of time}} than the senator. On April 23, McCarthy won the Pennsylvania Primary, receiving more votes than Kennedy, whose name did not appear on the ballot but ran as a write-in candidate.|$|E

It {{is clear from the}} context that Eddington is <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term improbable is functionally equivalent to impossible.|$|E

2500|$|His 1889 article [...] "On Alternating Sounds", however, made a {{singular}} {{contribution to the}} methodology of both linguistics and cultural anthropology. It {{is a response to}} a paper presented in 1888 by Daniel Garrison Brinton, at the time a professor of American linguistics and archeology at the University of Pennsylvania. Brinton observed that in the spoken languages of many Native Americans, certain sounds regularly alternated. This is clearly not a function of individual accents; Brinton was <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> some individuals pronounced certain words differently from others. He was arguing that there were many words that, even when repeated by the same speaker, varied considerably in their vocalization. Using evolutionary theory, Brinton argued that this pervasive inconsistency was a sign of linguistic inferiority, and evidence that Native Americans were at a low stage in their evolution.|$|E

2500|$|The DSM-IV-TR {{states that}} acts of self-mutilation, impulsivity, and rapid changes in {{interpersonal}} relationships [...] "may warrant a concurrent diagnosis of borderline personality disorder". [...] Steven Lynn and colleagues {{have suggested that}} the significant overlap between BPD and DID may be a contributing factor to the development of therapy induced DID, in that the suggestion of hidden alters by therapists who propose a diagnosis of DID provides an explanation to patients for the behavioral instability, self-mutilation, unpredictable mood changes and actions they experience. In 1993 a group of researchers reviewed both DID and borderline personality disorder (BPD), concluding that DID was an epiphenomenon of BPD, with no tests or clinical description capable of distinguishing between the two. Their conclusions about the empirical proof of DID were echoed by a second group, who still believed the diagnosis existed, but while the knowledge to date did not justify DID as a separate diagnosis, it also did not disprove its existence. Reviews of medical records and psychological tests indicated that the majority of DID patients could be diagnosed with BPD instead, though about a third could <b>not,</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> DID does exist but may be over-diagnosed. Between 50 and 66% of patients also meet the criteria for BPD, and nearly 75% of patients with BPD also meet the criteria for DID, with considerable overlap between the two conditions in terms of personality traits, cognitive and day-to-day functioning, and ratings by clinicians. [...] Both groups also report higher rates of physical and sexual abuse than the general population, and patients with BPD also score highly on measures of dissociation. [...] Even using strict diagnostic criteria, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish between dissociative disorders and BPD (as well as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia), though the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders may help.|$|E

"In my last lecture I {{endeavored}} {{to present the}} destructive side of present social theories as little as possible; to dwell more on the keen desire of the modern thinkers for constructive imagination.

My 'radicalism' has been spoken of. Radical! Do you realize that I am <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> there might possibly some day be a revolution in America, but rather that now I am stating that there is, this minute, and for some years has been, an actual state of warfare between capital and labor?

6000|$|Next morning, after breakfast, Lady Surrey {{sent for}} Gladys {{to come to}} her in her boudoir. Then she put her {{daughter}} in a chair by the window, drew her own close to it, laid her hand kindly on her shoulder--she was a nice little woman at heart, was the countess--and said to her gently, [...] "My dear Gladys, there's a little matter I {{want to talk to you}} about. You are still very young, you know, dear; and I think you ought to be very careful about not letting your feelings be played upon in any way, however unconsciously. Now, you walk and talk a great deal too much, dear, with Mr. Vardon. In many ways, it would be well that you should. Mr. Vardon is very clever, and very well informed, and a very instructive companion. I like you to talk to intelligent people, and to hear intelligent people talk; it gives you something that mere books can never give. But you know, Gladys, you should always remember the disparity in your stations. I don't deny that there's a great deal in all that sort of thing that's very conventional and absurd, my dear; but still, girls are girls, and if they're thrown too much with any one young man"--Lady Surrey was going to add, [...] "especially when he's handsome and agreeable," [...] but she checked herself in time--"they're very apt to form an affection for him. Of course I'm <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> you're likely to do anything of the sort with Mr. Vardon--I don't for a moment suppose you would--but a girl can never be too careful. I hope you know your position too well;" [...] here Lady Surrey was conscious of certain internal qualms; [...] "and indeed whether it was Mr. Vardon or anybody else, you are much too young to fill your head with such notions at your age. Of course, if some really good offer had been made to you even in your first season--say Lord St. Ives or Sir Montague--I don't say it might not have been prudent to accept it; but under ordinary circumstances, a girl does best to think as little as possible about such things until she is twenty at least. However, I hope in future you'll remember that I don't wish you to be quite so familiar in your intercourse with Mr. Vardon." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{again there}} is no mention of the word [...] "negro" [...] or of slavery. In all three of these places, being the only allusions to slavery in the instrument, covert {{language}} is used. Language is used <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> slavery existed or that the black race were among us. And I understand the contemporaneous history of those times to be that covert language was used with a purpose, and that purpose was that in our Constitution, which it was hoped and is still hoped will endure forever,--when it should be read by intelligent and patriotic men, after the institution of slavery had passed from among us,--there should be nothing on the face of the great charter of liberty suggesting that such a thing as negro slavery had ever existed among us. This is part of the evidence that the fathers of the government expected and intended the institution of slavery to come to an end. They expected and intended that it should be in the course of ultimate extinction. And when I say that I desire to see the further spread of it arrested, I only say I desire to see that done which the fathers have first done. When I say I desire to see it placed where the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, I only say I desire to see it placed where they placed it. It is not true that our fathers, as Judge Douglas assumes, made this government part slave and part free. Understand the sense in which he puts it. He assumes that slavery is a rightful thing within itself,--was introduced by the framers of the Constitution. The exact truth is, that they found the institution existing among us, and they left it as they found it. But in making the government they left this institution with many clear marks of disapprobation upon it. They found slavery among them, and they left it among them because of the difficulty--the absolute impossibility--of its immediate removal. And when Judge Douglas asks me why we cannot let it remain part slave and part free, as the fathers of the government made it, he asks a question based upon an assumption which is itself a falsehood; and I turn upon him and ask him the question, when the policy that the fathers of the government had adopted in relation to this element among us was the best policy in the world, the only wise policy, the only policy that we can ever safely continue upon that will ever give us peace, unless this dangerous element masters us all and becomes a national institution,--I turn upon him and ask him why he could not leave it alone. I turn and ask him why he was driven to the necessity of introducing a new policy in regard to it. He has himself said he introduced a new policy. He said so in his speech on the 22d of March of the present year, 1858. I ask him why he could not let it remain where our fathers placed it. I ask, too, of Judge Douglas and his friends why we shall not again place this institution upon the basis on which the fathers left it. I ask you, when he infers that I am in favor of setting the free and slave States at war, when the institution was placed in that attitude by those who made the Constitution, did they make any war? If we had no war out of it when thus placed, wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that policy? Have we had any peace upon this matter springing from any other basis? I maintain that we have not. I have proposed nothing more than a return to the policy of the fathers.|$|E
