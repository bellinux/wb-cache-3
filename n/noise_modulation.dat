50|$|Because dbx Type I and Type II are {{broadband}} (single-band) companders (unlike Dolby-A's four bands), {{they are}} susceptible to audible <b>noise</b> <b>modulation</b> and other artifacts. To deal with this, both Type I and II use very strong high-frequency pre-emphasis of the audio signal in both the recording path and the control signal path. This causes the compander to 'back off' the gain in certain circumstances and reduce the audibility of <b>noise</b> <b>modulation</b> - even with this pre-emphasis, <b>noise</b> <b>modulation</b> can become audible when using very noisy media to begin with, such as the Compact Cassette format. In the control signal path, the dbx Type II process rolls off {{the high and low}} frequency response to desensitize the system to frequency response errors - since the roll-off is only in the control path, it does not affect the audible sound.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of medium noise in magnetic recording are usually evaluated by using various different terms; namely, bulk erased noise, AC-biased noise, DC-magnetized noise and recorded signal noise. These evaluated medium noise, however, {{can be arranged}} by combining two elemental components. One is the random component which is originated from the rerecording phenomenon of bulk erased noise {{and the other is}} the modulated component resulted from bulky irregularities of the medium. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present several data about the later component, the <b>modulation</b> <b>noise,</b> and to investigate the origins of this <b>noise</b> component. <b>Modulation</b> <b>noise</b> is not included in bulk erased noise or AC-biased noise but is included in DC-magnetized noise and recorded signal noise. In DC-magnetized <b>noise,</b> the <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> component yields a peculiar transformation of its noise spectrum in the lower frequency region; on the other hand, it produces a side band spectrum skirt beside the signal in the recorded signal noise spectrum. The magnitude of <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> takes a maximam at the unsaturated region of a medium and then it gradually decreases with increasing magnetizing level. The roughness of the medium surface and the clustering of magnetic perticles in the coating layer are considered to be the origins of moduration noise; however, as for recent magnetic tapes, the later term seems to be the main origin of the <b>modulation</b> <b>noise...</b>|$|R

Typical sputtered tape media deposited on traditional polymeric substrates at room temperature revealed sideband <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> and large intergranular exchange coupling. A substantial improvement in surface roughness by utilizing smooth polymeric substrates eliminated this <b>modulation</b> <b>noise</b> and accounted for the signal dependent broad-band noise power.
