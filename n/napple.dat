50|$|While {{enjoying the}} once-per-year Summer Festival, the heroine Poach Arsia is accidentally brought to <b>Napple</b> World {{due to a}} mistake made by Straynap, a novice Spirit Guide who leads souls into the afterlife. <b>Napple</b> World, known as the land of daydreams, lies between the Real World and the Deep Dream, where souls go to rest. The concept of time in <b>Napple</b> World is unlike the real world: the seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter exist {{separately}} from each other as distinct locations. When Poach arrives in <b>Napple</b> World, six fairy-like beings called Petals leave her body and escape into the seasons, and she must retrieve {{them in order to}} go home again. To make up for his mistake, Straynap becomes Poach's guide and instructs her throughout the game, explaining the often contradictory nature of <b>Napple</b> World to her.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of Paffets. Some Paffets go to the Paffet Collection Room below 13 Ice and others go to various places in town. The Paffets that go to random places in <b>Napple</b> Town are usually {{structures}} or appliances (street lamps, balconies, stoves, etc.). The Paffets that go to the Paffet Room are mostly animal- or plant-based. A maximum of five can be carried at any one time and they have limited numbers of uses before they return to the Paffet Room. Items dropped by some enemies will raise the number of uses if it is below the starting value. The Paffets that can be carried perform useful functions in <b>Napple</b> Town or in stages such as becoming trampolines or unleashing powerful attacks. There are 71 Paffets total: 28 that go to the Paffet Room and 43 that go to random places in the town.|$|E

50|$|The levels {{extend from}} the <b>Napple</b> Town hub level, and {{correspond}} to the seasons. They contain a fixed path with a boss at the end. The enemies encountered along the way sometimes drop recipe pieces or random items. The recipes show four items which, if combined, will create a Paffet. Poach wields a racket-like weapon which she swings to battle foes. She can double-jump and attack to perform a spinning attack. Health is designated with petals and by finding certain items you can increase your maximum health. Each time Poach falls into a hole or gets attacked she loses half of a petal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a process}} called {{juncture}} loss, the n has wandered {{back and forth between}} the indefinite article and words beginning with vowels over the history of the language, where for example what was once a nuncle is now an uncle. The Oxford English Dictionary gives such examples as smot hym on the hede with a nege tool from 1448 for smote him on the head with an edge tool, as well as a nox for an ox and a <b>napple</b> for an apple. Sometimes the change has been permanent. For example, a newt was once an ewt (earlier euft and eft), a nickname was once an eke-name, where eke means [...] "extra" [...] (as in eke out meaning [...] "add to"), and in the other direction, a napron (meaning a little tablecloth, related to the word napkin) became an apron, and a naddre became an adder. The initial n in orange was also dropped through juncture loss, but this happened before the word was borrowed into English.|$|E

In this study, the use of biogas from the landfill Cahaya Kencana then to gasoline motor generator sets using this type with a capacity 1 kVA four steps that have been previously modified {{in order to be able}} to use biogas, but no purification process before being used as fuel. This study aims to determine the purification process biogas to be used as fuel biogas, conversion techniques on gasoline motor generator set in order to use biogas, gain settings on the carburetor and faucet pipes that optimum flow generator sets can be well lit, and the last to know Performance generator sets that have been modified to use biogas. The study was conducted by first making biogas purification devices and modifications to the intake manifold insulator and then test generator sets generator sets that have been modified, test levels and the CO 2 content without purification, and the final Performance test generator with power loading. Purification levels of carbon dioxide in the biogas use in the activation CaCO 3, then modifications made to the generator set that perforate the insulator and then embed <b>napple</b> ¼ inch and spliced using hoses and given tap ¼ inch, biogas purification flowed through the device then accommodated using plastic bags before being drained towards the generator set. The results of research that the levels of carbon dioxide in the biogas without purification ie 21614 ppm, and biogas through a purification process that is 9103 ppm. While opening the tap biogas for ½ the power load of zero to a light load (350 W), while the full biogas faucet openings at medium load (650 W) to full load (~ 80 % of the capacity of the generator) ...|$|E
