5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} on a common strategy: Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion—by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the <b>Neman</b> River towards Ragnit (<b>Neman).</b> To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a central location from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction rather quickly. Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To keep their plans secret and mislead the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place.|$|E

5|$|The city of Kaunas {{is located}} at the {{confluence}} of two rivers, the <b>Neman</b> and Neris, which link Lithuania's interior and its capital, Vilnius, to the Baltic Sea. The Baltic peoples had created significant domains by the 1st century, and came into conflict with the Scandinavians and the Slavs; the Teutonic Order began targeting Lithuanian lands {{at the beginning of the}} 13th century. Since Lithuania was heavily wooded and its lands were often impassable, its interior was most approachable along its rivers when frozen and during the short dry harvest season in late summer. In response to this vulnerability, defensive structures, including a brick castle in Kaunas, were in place at various points on the Nemunas River by the 14th century. The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1361; it received Magdeburg rights, regulating its autonomy and establishing trade protocols, from Vytautas the Great in 1408. An outpost of the Hanseatic League was created there in 1441. By the end of the 16th century Kaunas had become a major regional trade center, but plagues, fires, and wars adversely affected the country and city during the 17th and 18th centuries. Following the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at the end of the 18th century, Lithuania was incorporated into the Russian Empire. Two major 19th century projects contributed to the city's revival. The Augustów Canal, completed in 1832, linked the <b>Neman</b> to the Black Sea, and a rail line linking Saint Petersburg, Warsaw, and Germany via Kaunas was completed in 1862; it was part of a limited network of western Russian railways.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1392, Jogaila {{proposed}} a compromise through his envoy, Henry of Masovia, Bishop of Płock: Vytautas {{would become the}} Grand Duke of Lithuania if he would recognize Jogaila as the Supreme Duke. By summer, Vytautas had secured the release {{of many of the}} hostages he had given to the Knights, and accepted the offer. Since this agreement with Jogaila was reached in secret, the Knights suspected nothing when Vytautas invited them to the festivities at his headquarters, the Ritterswerder Castle on an island in the <b>Neman</b> River. Most of the prominent guests were taken prisoner and Vytautas' army proceeded to attack and destroy the undermanned wooden castles of Ritterswerder, Metenburg, and Neugarten (New Hrodna) near Hrodna.|$|E

5|$|The Gediminid dynasty {{began its}} ascent in Lithuania {{during this time}} with the {{emergence}} of its first leader, Butigeidis. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked Sambia. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day Sovetsk (Tilsit) and their raids intensified. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the <b>Neman</b> River. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother Butvydas (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown. Butvydas was the father of Vytenis and probably of Gediminas. During his short reign Butvydas tried to defend the duchy against the Teutonic Knights; he also attacked Masovia, an ally of the knights. His son, Vytenis, advanced to power in 1295 and ended the period of relative instability. His reign marks the transition from the state's establishment to the point at which it was poised for expansion.|$|E
5|$|The {{protracted}} {{period of}} {{war between the}} Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on 12 October 1398 by the Treaty of Salynas, named after the islet in the <b>Neman</b> River where it was signed. Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the Teutonic Order in a campaign to seize Pskov, while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize Novgorod. Shortly afterwards, Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles; but the following year his forces and those of his ally, Khan Tokhtamysh of the White Horde, were crushed by the Timurids at the Battle of the Vorskla River, ending his imperial ambitions {{in the east and}} obliging him to submit to Władysław's protection once more.|$|E
5|$|In 1385 Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania {{agreed to}} marry Queen Jadwiga of Poland in the Union of Kreva. Jogaila {{converted}} to Christianity and was crowned as the King of Poland (Władysław II Jagiełło), thus creating a personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The official Lithuanian conversion to Christianity removed the religious {{rationale for the}} order's activities in the area. Its grand master, Conrad Zöllner von Rothenstein, supported by the Hungarian king, Sigismund of Luxemburg, responded by publicly contesting the sincerity of Jogaila's conversion, bringing the charge to a papal court. The territorial disputes continued over Samogitia, which had been in Teutonic hands since the Peace of Raciąż in 1404. Poland also had territorial claims against the Knights in Dobrzyń Land and Gdańsk (Danzig), but the two states had been largely at peace since the Treaty of Kalisz (1343). The conflict was also motivated by trade considerations: The knights controlled the lower reaches of the three largest rivers (the <b>Neman,</b> Vistula and Daugava) in Poland and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|In 1812, as Napoleon entered Russia, the Poles and Lithuanians {{rallied to}} Napoleon's Grande Armée {{in the hope}} of resurrecting the Commonwealth. The Vistula Legion, {{withdrawn}} from Spain in early 1812 and reorganized into a division (with a planned strength of 10,500 that was never fully attained) was part of Napoleon's invasion forces. Poles formed the largest foreign contingent, 98,000-strong (the entire French Grande Armée was about 600,000 strong). Polish Lancers of the Vistula Legion were the first unit to cross the <b>Neman</b> River when the Grand Armee entered Russia and, as part of the Imperial Guard, the first unit to enter Moscow. They distinguished themselves in the Battle of Borodino and, under Prince Józef Poniatowski (who personally saved Napoleon's life), were one of the units that served as the rear guard during Napoleon's retreat. This later led to the claim that just as they had been the first to enter it, they were the last to leave Russia. They sustained heavy losses during the campaign: only 26,000 of the original 98,000-strong contingent returned. The elite Vistula Legion entering Russia was about 7,000 strong; its strength {{at the end of the}} campaign was just 1,500.|$|E
5|$|The conference {{began in}} the evening of September 29, 1920. The Polish {{delegation}} was led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz (who originated from Lithuania), and the Lithuanian delegation by general Maksimas Katche. Lithuania proposed an immediate armistice, but the Polish delegation refused. Only after the Lithuanian delegation threatened to leave the negotiation table did Poland agree to stop fighting, but only {{to the east of}} the <b>Neman</b> River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting {{to the west of the}} river continued. The Polish delegates demanded that the Lithuanians allow the Polish forces to use a portion of the Warsaw– Saint Petersburg Railway and the train station in Varėna (Orany). The Lithuanians refused: their major forces were concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. The Lithuanian side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|After having scouted the Russian fortifications at Grodno, Charles {{realized}} {{a frontal}} assault would be impossible. At the same time, the Russians {{would not let}} themselves be provoked out into the field. Charles instead decided to try and starve them out by crossing the <b>Neman</b> river in January 15, encircling the city from the east, forcing 15,000 Russian cavalry to withdraw. In doing this he blocked the Russian communication lines, and also cut off their resources and supplies. Smaller Swedish parties were sent towards Vilnius {{in order to prevent}} General Christian Felix Bauer from supplying the trapped Russians. One of these, commanded by Jan Kazimierz Sapieha and Józef Potocki managed to beat 3,000 Russians at the Battle of Olita on February 9. Meanwhile, on February 7 Schulenburg had received word of Charles' crossing of the Vistula, and begun his march with the Saxon army in order to beat Rehnskiöld's smaller force near Poznań. Rehnskiöld, however, did not wait to be defeated and instead strove to engage Schulenburg before the arrival of Augustus 8,000 men. By using a daring feint Rehnskiöld managed to lure Schulenburg into a more disadvantageous position near Wschowa (Fraustadt), where the two armies clashed on February 13. Here, the Swedish general won a decisive victory killing or capturing up to 75% of Schulenburg's force. Crippled by this setback, the main Saxon army {{had no choice but to}} retreat. The whole allied plan collapsed, as the opportunity for the allies to destroy Charles' army in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with a sweeping movement from behind, vanished.|$|E

40|$|So far, the vendor-customer (bakul-langgan) {{relationship}} is blamed for perpetuating {{poverty in the}} fisherman community. This patron-client relationship has disadvantaged fisherman as customers (langgan), and has brought advantages to vendors (bakul) as jeragan <b>nemen</b> because of their possession of production tools. This position has hardly changed, and the cultural aspect has received a more dominant position than the structural factors in causing poverty. This development is unfortunate, because when {{the state and the}} global market could not reach them, this traditional institution (bakul-langgan) would sustain the lives of poor fisherman. The wave of reform in 1998 has also transformed this custom institution. It began to lose its patron – client relationship. Today, the vendor – customer relationship has become more functional, and every aspect is negotiable. In addition, there is also a matter of “desecration” of debt which is given by bakul. Finally, the spirit of reform has also changed the position of jeragan <b>nemen</b> to langgan, and many of the subordinates (pendega) have become small business leaders. However, the involvement of rent seeking actors such as banks and micro finance institutions on behalf of cooperatives could bring back the fishermen to poverty...|$|R

25|$|The {{negotiations}} between Poles, led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz, and Lithuanians, led by general Maksimas Katche, {{began in the}} evening of September 29, 1920. Both sides agreed to an armistice, but only {{to the east of}} the <b>Neman</b> River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting to the west on the river continued around Marcinkonys, Zervynos, Perloja, Eišiškės. The major point of contention, both diplomatic and military, was the train station in Varėna (Orany) on the Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway. Major Lithuanian forces were still concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. Fighting west of the <b>Neman</b> River ceased only on October 6, when Polish troops had already captured the train station in Varėna.|$|E
25|$|The bridges {{across the}} <b>Neman</b> River were prematurely {{destroyed}} by the retreating Soviets.

During these fights about 100 rebels were killed, 100 Soviet troops (including several officers) were taken prisoner, and a large booty of equipment (including three tanks but no one knew how to operate them) was captured. Other groups secured police stations, shops, warehouses, attempted to re-establish general order in the city. The rebels hastily organized their own police and freed some 2,000 political prisoners.
