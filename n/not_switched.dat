Prior to his elimination, he provided useful information to Vavrick-O'Brien about possible betrayal by former members of Rotu who were <b>not</b> <b>switched</b> during the tribal switch.|$|E

Two {{years earlier}} Occidental management ordered a study, {{the results of}} which warned {{of the dangers of}} these gas lines.

Mr Cook touched a pole to the electric wiring and suffered a horrific death which caused Mr Young great distress. Even though he never feared for the loss of his own life, the court held that Mr Young was in the area of potential damage, so he was entitled to claim compensation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first officer}} {{called for the}} arming of the {{spoilers}} one second after touchdown, and the commander armed them half a second later. Two seconds later the first officer called [...] "no spoilers" [...] as the spoiler indicator light had <b>not</b> <b>switched</b> on. He then verified the hydraulic pressure and that the switch was set correctly. Meanwhile, the commander had switched the thrust levers from flight idle to ground idle, and six seconds after touchdown activated the wheel brakes. From 12.8 seconds after touchdown various screeching sounds can be heard from the tires. The braking took place nominally until halfway down the runway. From this point the pilots reported that nominal retardation did not occur. The commander attempted to use the brake pedals to apply full braking, without effect. He then moved the brake lever from green to yellow and subsequently emergency brake, disconnecting the anti-lock. Witnesses observed smoke and spray emitted from the landing gear.|$|E

In a press release posted to his Senate web page, Espada emphasized that [...] "I remain a staunch, reform Democrat.

However, when pressed by Wayne Barrett on June 11, 2009 as to whether he felt allegiance to the Democratic party, the Senator claimed he owed nothing to a political party that spent [...] "hundreds of thousands" [...] to defeat his past elections.|$|E

60|$|But what {{produced}} the greatest impression {{on my mind}} was a gathering {{at night in the}} coffee-room of my hotel of a few men of mark whom I was asked to join. It was about one o'clock in the morning. The shutters were up. For some reason or other the electric light was <b>not</b> <b>switched</b> on, and the big room was lit up only by a few tall candles, just enough for us to see each other's faces by. I saw in those faces the awful desolation of men whose country, torn in three, found itself engaged in the contest with no will of its own, and not even the power to assert itself at the cost of life. All the past was gone, and there was no future, whatever happened; no road which did not seem to lead to moral annihilation. I remember one of those men addressing me after a period of mournful silence compounded of mental exhaustion and unexpressed forebodings.|$|E

40|$|Achieving ambitious CO 2 {{emission}} reductions require changing mundane consumer {{behaviors in}} addition to increasing modern technology’s energy-saving potential. Frequently, energy-related behaviors, however, may occur highly and thus tend to become habitual. On basis {{of the notion that}} habits represent automatic reactions to situations, and hence, are hard to control, we examined whether the capability to perform or abstain from performing actions depends on the type of habit established. We tested whether an acting habit (switching off the light upon leaving a room) supports execution of the intention to act (switching it off), but hinders the intention to abstain from acting (<b>not</b> <b>switching</b> it off). Conversely, a habit of <b>not</b> <b>switching</b> off the light (a non-acting habit) is expected to obstruct execution of the intention to switch the light off, but facilitates the intention to <b>not</b> <b>switch</b> it off. Results support these ideas, and underscore the importance of differentiating between habits resulting from frequently acting and frequently not acting...|$|R
