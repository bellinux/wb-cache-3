5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with full {{membership}} in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent {{on a tour of}} the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.|$|E

The Gronsfeld cipher is a variant created by Count Gronsfeld which {{is identical to}} the Vigenère cipher, except that it uses just 10 different cipher alphabets (corresponding to the digits 0 to 9). The Gronsfeld cipher is strengthened because its key is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> but it is weakened because it has just 10 cipher alphabets. Gronsfeld's cipher did become widely used throughout Germany and Europe, despite its weaknesses.|$|E

25|$|Plautus wrote around 130 plays, {{of which}} 20 have survived intact, {{making him the}} most {{prolific}} ancient dramatist in terms of surviving work. Only short fragments, mostly quotations by later writers of antiquity, survive from 31 other plays. Despite this, the manuscript tradition of Plautus is poorer than {{that of any other}} ancient dramatist, something not helped by the failure of scholia on Plautus to survive. The chief manuscript of Plautus is a palimpsest, known as the Ambrosian palimpsest (A), in which Plautus' plays had been scrubbed out to make way for Augustine's Commentary on the Psalms. The monk who performed this was more successful in some places than others. He seems to have begun furiously, scrubbing out Plautus' alphabetically arranged plays with zest before growing lazy, then finally regaining his vigor {{at the end of the}} manuscript to ensure <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of Plautus was legible. Although modern technology has allowed classicists to view much of the effaced material, plays beginning in letters early in the alphabet have very poor texts (e.g. the end of Aulularia and start of Bacchides are lost), plays with letters in the middle of the alphabet have decent texts, while only traces survive of the play Vidularia.|$|E
25|$|Fabius {{had opposed}} the {{permission}} given to Scipio {{to carry the}} attack to the enemy's home, and Cato, whose appointment was intended to monitor Scipio's behavior, adopted the views of his friend. Plutarch reports that the lenient discipline of the troops under Scipio's command and the exaggerated expenses incurred by the general provoked Cato's protests, such that Scipio, immediately afterward, replied angrily, saying he would {{give an account of}} victories, not of money. Cato left his place of duty after the dispute with Scipio about the latter's alleged extravagance, and returning to Rome, condemned the uneconomical activities of his general to the senate. Plutarch {{went on to say that}} at the joint request of Cato and Fabius, a commission of tribunes was sent to Sicily to examine Scipio's activity. Upon their review of his extensive and careful arrangements for the transport of the troops, they determined he was not guilty of Cato's charges. Plutarch's version, which would seem to attribute to Cato the wrongdoing of quitting his post before his time, is barely consistent with Livy's narrative. If Livy is correct, the commission was sent because of the complaints of the inhabitants of Locri, who had been harshly oppressed by Quintus Pleminius, Scipio's legate. Livy says <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of Cato's interference in this matter, but mentions the bitterness with which Fabius blamed Scipio for corrupting military discipline and for having illegally left his province to take the town of Locri.|$|E

Apart from an entry on 26 December 1974, in which Coey wrote about his loneliness at Christmas and desire to get married, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> remained after 11 November 1974. Having become engaged to a young Rhodesian woman, Coey successfully filed for Rhodesian citizenship while on leave in June 1975, then renewed his US passport in South Africa.

[...] However, his achievements were always qualified by suspicion over the legality of his bowling action, even before he was no-balled by Phillips.

500|$|The Queen's health {{remained}} fair {{until the}} autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham, the niece of her cousin and close friend Lady Knollys, came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a [...] "settled and unremovable melancholy", and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end. When Robert Cecil {{told her that she}} must go to bed, she snapped [...] "Must is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to use to princes, little man". She died on 24 March 1603 at Richmond Palace, between two and three in the morning.

[...] It was first made in a supplementary brief printed after the opening argument of counsel on the other side had been commenced, and not handed in until the second day, just previous to its conclusion.|$|E
500|$|MacGregor was duly {{confirmed}} as a Venezuelan citizen and divisional {{general in the}} Venezuelan Army, with a pension of one-third of his salary. He settled in the capital and became a respected member of the local community. After his death at home in Caracas on 4 December 1845, he was buried with full military honours in Caracas Cathedral, with President Carlos Soublette, Cabinet ministers and the military chiefs of Venezuela marching behind his coffin. Obituaries in the Caracas press extolled General MacGregor's [...] "heroic and triumphant retreat" [...] to Barcelona in 1816 and described him as [...] "a valiant champion of independence". [...] "There was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> about Amelia Island, Porto Bello or Rio de la Hacha, {{and there was no}} reference to the Cazique of Poyais," [...] Sinclair concludes. The part of today's Honduras that was supposedly called Poyais remains undeveloped in the 21st century.

500|$|Another {{departure}} from history comes during Victoria's coronation scene. Contrary {{to what is}} shown in the film, Albert was not present at the ceremony; the couple instead wrote letters to each other, but Fellowes felt that having them keep opening letters would be less cinematic. Furthermore, according to Fellowes, [...] "The scene where [...] is trying to make her sign the paper when she is ill and she throws it to the floor - it's completely true", and [...] "The scene in Windsor where the King stands up and insults Victoria's mother is not only true, but about two-thirds of his speech is what he actually said!" [...] However, the Duchess of Kent was seated next to the King when he spoke and did not leave during the speech; and, undepicted in the film, the princess burst into tears, [...] "and the two parties, soon realising that they had gone too far, patched up an uneasy truce". According to Charles Greville's memoirs: [...] "The Queen [...] looked in deep distress, the Princess [...] burst into tears, and the whole company were aghast. The Duchess of Kent said <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> Immediately after they rose and retired, and a terrible scene ensued; the Duchess announced her immediate departure and ordered her carriage, but a sort of reconciliation was patched up, and she was prevailed upon to stay till the next day." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1953, Chartwell became Churchill's refuge once more when, again in office as Prime Minister, he {{suffered}} a massive stroke. At {{the end of a}} dinner held on 23 June at 10 Downing Street, for the Italian Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi, Churchill collapsed and was barely able either to stand or to speak. On the 25th, he was driven to Chartwell, where his condition deteriorated further. Churchill's doctor Lord Moran stated that, [...] "he did not think the Prime Minister could possibly live over the weekend". That evening Colville summoned Churchill's closest friends in the press, Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Camrose and Brendan Bracken who, walking the lawns at Chartwell, agreed to try to ensure a press blackout to prevent any reporting of Churchill's condition. Colville described the outcome, [...] "They achieved the all but incredible success of gagging Fleet Street, something they would have done for nobody but Churchill. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of the Prime Minister's stroke was published until he casually mentioned it in the House of Commons a year later". Secluded and protected at Chartwell, Churchill made a remarkable recovery and thoughts of his retirement quickly receded. During his recuperation, Churchill took the opportunity to complete work on Triumph and Tragedy, the sixth and final volume of his war memoirs, which he had been forced to set aside when he returned to Downing Street in 1951.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 review asserted: [...] "Many are the {{knowledgeable}} and discriminating {{people for whom}} Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific, brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all." [...] In 1987, however, John Rockwell of The New York Times reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while South Pacific had been innovative for 1949, [...] "Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, South Pacific epitomized {{the concerns of the}} day– America's responsibilities {{in the world and the}} dangers of racism.... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It still seems that way, with M*A*S*H having contemporized this same setting". [...] A 2008 Huffington Post review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on [...] "exotic background roles" [...] in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she [...] "speaks <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." [...] South Pacific is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, Helmet for My Pillow, after he walked out of a performance: [...] "I have to tell the story of how it really was.

500|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of [...] "foreign equivalents," [...] a foreign language term used in a foreign country, that is considered generic in that country, cannot be imported into the United States and used as a trademark. In applying {{the doctrine}}, the courts consistently refer to two policy rationales. The first rationale, [...] "the doctrine serves the interests of domestic competition":"Because {{of the diversity of}} the population of the United States, coupled with temporary visitors, all of whom are part of the United States marketplace, commerce in the United States utilizes innumerable foreign languages. No merchant may obtain the exclusive right over a trademark registration if that exclusivity would prevent competitors from designating a product as what it is in the language their customers know best." [...] Otokoyama Co. Ltd. Vs Wine of Japan Import Inc.The second rationale, [...] "the doctrine serves the interests of international comity":"Because United States companies would be hamstrung in international trade if foreign countries granted trademark protection to generic English words, the United States reciprocates and refuses trademark protection to generic foreign words." [...] Enrique Bernat F., S.A. v. Guadalajara, Inc.However, the Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure ("TMEP") states that the test for applying {{the doctrine of}} foreign equivalents is [...] "whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent".The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board has, for the purposes of the guide, ruled that an [...] "ordinary American purchaser" [...] refers to the [...] "significant portion of consumers" [...] who speak both English and the relevant foreign language. In the case In re Joint Stock Co. [...] "Baik ," [...] 80 USPQ2d 1305, 1310, 0.22% was accepted as a significant portion of consumers in the United States.
