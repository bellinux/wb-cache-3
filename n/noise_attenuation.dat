40|$|Most active {{noise control}} (ANC) systems are {{designed}} and analyzed in ideal sound fields, where ANC performances are predictable with acceptable accuracies. In many ANC applications sound fields are non-ideal with significant differences between real ANC performances and theoretical predictions. If one uses an ideal model to optimize locations of actuators or error sensors for an ANC system in a non-ideal sound field, the actual quiet zone is inevitably different from its theoretical prediction. It is desired that users of ANC systems can tune quiet zones by adjusting ANC configurations, such as locations of secondary sources or error sensors. Model-independent ANC (MIANC) systems are preferred for this purpose. In this study, a model-independent ANC system is improved, implemented and applied to create a quiet zone in a non-ideal sound field. Users of the system can adjust locations of actuators or error sensors to tradeoff between sizes of quiet zones and levels of <b>noise</b> <b>attenuations.</b> Experimental results are presented to demonstrate observations and effects of quiet zone tuning using the improved ANC system.

Some significant deviations can be observed mainly for high frequencies and also for homogeneous propagation conditions. A comparison between calculated and experimental sound attenuations is also presented for each method, on the basis of 5 road noise experimental campaigns, where each site is representative of different common topographies. Some statistically significant deviations between both mean and standard deviation are observed between the two models. In light of these road traffic noise cases, the NMPB 2008 model appears to have a better accuracy and a better precision than the Harmonoise/Imagine model have...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{acoustic}} {{data have}} shown larger <b>noise</b> <b>attenuations</b> than predicted for acoustically treated aircraft engine inlets without splitter rings. These data have stimulated {{a more detailed}} theoretical study of the acoustic propagation of spinning modes in acoustically treated open circular ducts. In addition, the suppressor with splitter rings was modeled by using the rectangular approximation to the annular duct. The theoretical models {{were used to determine}} optimum impedance and maximum attenuation for several spinning lobe numbers from 0 to 50. It is found that for circular ducts the maximum possible attenuation and the optimum wall impedance are strong functions of the lobe number. For annular ducts the attenuation and optimum wall impedance are insensitive to the spinning lobe number for well cut-on modes. The results help explain why suppressors with splitter rings have been quite effective in spite of the lack of detailed information on the noise-source modal structure. Conversely, effective use of outer-wall treatment alone will require expanded knowledge of the noise-source structure. Approximate solutions are presented to help interpret the more exact theoretical results...|$|R

50|$|Personal noise {{reduction}} devices can be passive, active or a combination. Passive ear protection includes earplugs or earmuffs which can block noise up {{to a specific}} frequency. Earplugs and earmuffs can provide the wearer with 10 dB to 40 dB of attenuation. However, use of earplugs is only effective if the users have been educated and use them properly; without proper use, protection falls far below manufacturer ratings. Higher consistency of performance has been found with custom-molded earplugs. Because of their ease of use without education, and ease of application or removal, earmuffs have more consistency with both compliance and <b>noise</b> <b>attenuation.</b> Active ear protection (electronic pass-through hearing protection devices or EPHPs) electronically filter out noises of specific frequencies or decibels while allowing the remaining noise to pass through.|$|E
