25|$|The Muslims of Jolo sacked {{the islands}} of Camotes, Leyte and Samar around 1663. The towns {{affected}} were Poro, Baibai, Sogod, Cabalian, Basey, Bangajon, Gibatan , and Capul. At that time, the main residencia in Carigara was then coping from the 1629 raid done by the same pillagers. This dreadful incident prompted the coming of Padre Pedro Oriol, a Catalan, to Leyte. He entered the Society in 1658 as an aspirant. Before taking his assignments in Bohol, Cebu, Iloilo and Cavite, Sogod and Cabalian were his first pastoral posts. During the visit of the Jesuit Provincial in 1675 to the country, the priest was tasked to go to Carigara for his profession of vows. With <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>asked</b> {{he went to the}} place on foot, traversing mountains and forests and experiencing unspeakable fatigue. He died peacefully on September 28, 1705 at Catbalogan, in Samar.|$|E
25|$|The Danish National Bank {{estimates}} that the occupation had resulted in the printing press increasing the currency supply from the pre-war figure of 400 million kroner to 1,600 million, much of which {{ended up in the}} hands of war profiteers. In July 1945, two months after the liberation of Denmark, the Danish Parliament passed an emergency law initiating a currency reform, making all old banknotes void. A small number of employees at the National Bank had clandestinely begun the production of new banknotes in late 1943. The production of new notes happened without the knowledge of the German forces located at the bank, and by the spring of 1945 the bank's stock of notes was sufficient to initiate the exchange. The law required was passed hastily on Friday 20 July and published the same day; it also closed all shops for the weekend. By Monday 23 July, all old notes were officially outlawed as legal tender and any note not declared in a bank by 30 July would lose its value. This law allowed any Dane to exchange a total of 100 kroner to new notes, <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>asked.</b> An amount up to 500 kroner would be exchanged, provided the owner signed a written statement explaining its origins. Any amount above this level would be deposited in an escrow account and only released or exchanged following scrutiny by tax officials examining the validity of the person's statement about the origins of this wealth. All existing bank accounts were also scrutinized. Multiple exchanges of cash by the same person were avoided by the requirement that currency would only be exchanged to anybody also handing in a specified ration stamp, previously issued in a different context, which had not yet been authorized for use. The exchange resulted in a significant drop in the currency supply, and around 20% of the 3,000 million kroner property declared had not previously been registered by the tax authorities. Estimates vary for the amounts of currency simply destroyed by its owners. All banknotes issued since the changeover date remain valid indefinitely; earlier ones are not valid.|$|E
500|$|Chicago Pile 1 was encased {{within a}} balloon {{so that the}} air inside could be {{replaced}} by carbon dioxide. Anderson had a dark gray balloon manufactured by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. A [...] cube-shaped balloon was somewhat unusual, but the Manhattan Project's AAA priority rating ensured prompt delivery with <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>asked.</b> A block and tackle was used to haul it into place, with the top secured to the ceiling and three sides to the walls. The remaining side, the one facing the balcony from which Fermi directed the operation, was furled like an awning. A circle was drawn on the floor, and the stacking of graphite blocks began {{on the morning of}} 16 November 1942. The first layer placed was made up entirely of graphite blocks, with no uranium. Layers without uranium were alternated with two layers containing uranium, so the uranium was enclosed in graphite. Unlike later reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system, as it was only intended to be operated at very low power.|$|E

500|$|Ron Glass as Derrial Book– a Shepherd (equivalent to a pastor). Although {{presented}} as a devout Christian, Book has profound, unexplained knowledge about criminal activities, police corruption, and military strategy, tactics, and weapons. In [...] "Safe", he was shown to have sufficient status in the Alliance to receive emergency medical treatment from an Alliance ship, with <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>asked.</b> He is also proficient in hand-to-hand combat {{and the use of}} firearms. While objecting to violence most of the time, on a rescue mission he joins the fight, stating that while the Bible is quite specific about killing, it is [...] "somewhat fuzzier on the subject of kneecaps". Book is a moral guide for Mal {{and the rest of the}} crew, a voice of reason, conscience and spirituality. At the same time, he seems to get along well with the amoral mercenary Jayne, with the two spotting each other while working out using a bench press. His hidden backstory would have been gradually revealed, had the series continued, but was instead explored in the 2010 comic book The Shepherd's Tale.|$|E
2500|$|Norman {{reinforcements}} {{and local}} miscreants, who found a welcome in Ranulf's camp with <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>asked,</b> swelled Ranulf's numbers.

In 1035, Tancred of Hauteville's three eldest sons (William [...] "Iron Arm", Drogo and Humphrey) arrived in Aversa from Normandy.|$|E
2500|$|Disgraced {{psychologist}} George Rekers {{was labeled}} a [...] "right-wing, religious-based" [...] expert witness and rejected for months by state attorneys defending Florida's gay adoption ban. [...] But when they couldn't find {{anyone else to}} replace him on the witness stand, Attorney General Bill McCollum overruled his trial attorneys, quickly hired Rekers, and paid him twice his agreed upon contract with <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>asked,</b> according to documents released this week by McCollum's office[...] [...] [...]|$|E

2500|$|Questions {{were raised}} about the {{security}} of black churches (as well as the security of churches in general) and their long-standing practice of welcoming anyone {{who is willing to}} pray (as most Christian churches are, regardless of the race of the majority of its parishioners). Roof, a stranger to churchgoers, was easily able to enter Emanuel AME Church with <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>asked.</b> In the weeks after the shooting, AME Church leaders distributed a document titled [...] "12 Considerations for Congregational Security", which recommended creating security plans and teams for black churches, improving communications, developing relationships with local law enforcement, and securing and monitoring all entrances and exits to churches. Some churches considered hiring armed security guards and installing metal detectors, but conversations in support of these steps have currently not gained traction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, in {{response}} to criticism from a historian Ron Radosh, a former Trotskyite who now writes for the conservative National Review—Seeger wrote a song condemning Stalin, [...] "Big Joe Blues": [...] "I'm singing about old Joe, cruel Joe. / He ruled with an iron hand. /He {{put an end to}} the dreams / Of so many in every land. / He had a chance to make / A brand new start for the human race. / Instead he set it back / Right in the same nasty place. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Keep your mouth shut or you will die fast. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Do this job, <b>no</b> <b>questions</b> <b>asked.</b> / I got the Big Joe Blues." [...] The song was accompanied by a letter to Radosh, in which Seeger stated, [...] "I think you're right, I should have asked to see the gulags when I was in U.S.S.R [...]" ...|$|E
