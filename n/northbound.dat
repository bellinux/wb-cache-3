5|$|There {{are plans}} to add a ramp from <b>northbound</b> SR844 to <b>northbound</b> SR 444, and to add a ramp from <b>northbound</b> SR 444 to {{southbound}} SR844. As of October 2013, the status and funding for this project are unknown.|$|E
5|$|After DE 9A, DE 9 enters Wilmington {{and heads}} through urban areas as an {{undivided}} road, crossing Norfolk Southern's Shellpot Secondary before intersecting the <b>northbound</b> direction of US 13. At this point, DE 9 splits into a one-way pair with the <b>northbound</b> direction becoming concurrent with <b>northbound</b> US 13 on one-way New Castle Avenue and the southbound direction following southbound US 13 on South Heald Street, briefly turning east along with <b>northbound</b> US 13 on D Street {{at the south}} end of the one-way pair. The one-way pair, which carries two lanes in each direction, passes rowhomes and businesses, with New Castle Avenue merging onto South Heald Street. Here, US 13/DE 9 continue north-northeast on four-lane undivided South Heald Street, coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of DE 9A.|$|E
5|$|After {{paralleling}} {{the reservoir}} {{for almost two}} miles (3km), a third route, US6, joins the concurrency {{just east of the}} village of Brewster. The three routes cross under a high, long bridge carrying I-84, then veer east to an interchange with the north end of I-684. US6 and 202 continue east for Danbury while NY22 uses the <b>northbound</b> on-ramp of the I-684 roadway. The short expressway connector that carries <b>northbound</b> I-684 traffic to <b>northbound</b> NY22 is NY981B, an unsigned reference route.|$|E
5|$|In West Friendship, <b>northbound</b> MD32 {{would have}} {{half of a}} partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with MD144. Access between MD144 and southbound MD32 would be via a right-in/right-out interchange with a frontage road. MD144's intersections with the frontage road and the ramps to and from <b>northbound</b> MD32 will be roundabouts.|$|E
5|$|Lake Shore Drive was reconstructed in 1996 {{so that it}} {{no longer}} cut through the Museum Campus. Previously the <b>northbound</b> lanes ran east of Soldier Field. After {{reconstruction}} both <b>northbound</b> and southbound lanes ran west of Soldier Field.|$|E

5|$|The M54 {{currently}} {{meets the}} M6 at junction 10A {{where there is}} no access to the <b>northbound</b> M6 or to the M6 Toll. <b>Northbound</b> access to the M6 is via the A449 from junction 2 and the most direct route to the M6 Toll is via the congested A460 from junction 1.|$|E
5|$|The road {{turns to}} the {{northwest}} and interchanges with Eighth Avenue at exit2E and exit2W <b>northbound</b> and exit2 southbound. PA378 turns westward through Bethlehem, paralleling Union Boulevard and crossing under Fourteenth Avenue. The route then turns northward, crossing under Eaton Avenue and a Norfolk Southern rail line and passing the Hal Fenicle Memorial Park. PA378 continues <b>northbound,</b> interchanging with and crossing under Catasauqua Road. After running to the southwest of Lehigh Valley Hospital at Muhlenberg, the freeway enters an interchange with US22 (Lehigh Valley Thruway), PA378 <b>northbound</b> traffic is directed onto US22 westbound.|$|E
5|$|The route {{passes to}} the west of the Golden Nugget casino and comes to a ramp that {{provides}} access from <b>northbound</b> Route 87 to both the Trump Marina and Harrah's Atlantic City casinos before passing under the <b>northbound</b> Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector again. Immediately after, the route has a ramp from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound U.S. Route 30. The <b>northbound</b> Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector parallels Route 87 to the east as it turns northeast and comes to a right-in/right-out in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah's and Borgata. From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah's. The <b>northbound</b> Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector merges onto <b>northbound</b> Route 87 before the route comes to a ramp that provides access to the <b>northbound</b> direction of the route from Harrah's. Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on the Justice Vincent S. Haneman Memorial Bridge and runs along the border of Atlantic City to the northwest and Brigantine to the southeast. After crossing the Absecon Channel, the route arrives on Brigantine Island and passes through wetlands, with U-turn ramps in both directions. A short distance later, Route 87 ends and County Route 638 continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Brigantine.|$|E
5|$|When Angel {{was first}} opened, a long {{dead-end}} siding was provided for train stabling, converging {{from the left}} onto the <b>northbound</b> line {{just south of the}} station. This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal box {{at the south end of}} the platform) to simplify through running. The siding lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme. Part of the siding was used as the <b>northbound</b> diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing <b>northbound</b> line, cut through into the end of the siding and continued along it until it branched off left to the new <b>northbound</b> platform.|$|E
5|$|A {{signal and}} switch tower {{is located at}} the north end of the <b>northbound</b> {{platform}} and is active only on weekdays.|$|E
5|$|According to THSR's April 2017 timetable, {{there are}} 967 train {{services}} per week of operation, with operation times between 06:30 to 24:00 every day. Most southbound trains originate from Nangang station and most <b>northbound</b> trains originate from Zuoying; however, a few trains operate just between Nangang and Taichung or between Taichung and Zuoying. Southbound trains are designated by odd train numbers, and <b>northbound</b> trains by even train numbers.|$|E
5|$|After the Throgs Neck toll {{booth in}} the Bronx, I-295 {{becomes part of}} the Cross Bronx Expressway Extension. Just north of the toll booth is <b>northbound</b> access to Harding Avenue and Pennyfield Avenue. The exit is right next to the Y-{{interchange}} with I-695 (Throgs Neck Expressway), which takes motorists to <b>northbound</b> I-95. The only other interchange between there and the terminus is Randall Avenue.|$|E
5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from <b>northbound</b> I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to <b>northbound</b> I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from <b>northbound</b> I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to <b>northbound</b> I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E
5|$|I-215 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} {{at the mouth}} of Parley's Canyon in Millcreek near the southeast corner of Salt Lake City that connects I-80, Foothill Drive (State Route 186, or SR-186) and Parleys Way. At this point, I-215 splits into three legs, connecting I-80 toward Salt Lake City, Foothill Drive and Parleys Way, and I-80 through Parley's Canyon. From here, the freeway travels southeast along the Salt Lake Valley's east bench with three lanes in each direction. The route enters a residential area of East Millcreek and turns south. Then, the first exit appears, an incomplete diamond interchange with 3300 South (SR-171) that lacks an off-ramp from <b>northbound</b> I-215. Past this interchange, an on-ramp connects 3800South to <b>northbound</b> I-215. A block further south is a partial interchange lacking an off-ramp from <b>northbound</b> I-215 onto 3900South. Entering Holladay, I-215 is heading south but soon turns southwest. An off-ramp here allows <b>northbound</b> motorists to connect to Wasatch Boulevard. However, this exit is signed as 3900South and 3300South because of the incomplete interchanges on both roads. Past an interchange at 4500 South (SR-266) that serves southbound I-215, the road turns south again and begins descending toward Knudsen's Corner and Cottonwood Heights. At this point, the southbound lanes are lower than the parallel <b>northbound</b> lanes. The belt route flattens out upon reaching an interchange at 6200 South at Knudsen's Corner.|$|E
5|$|In Saginaw, the two {{parallel}} streets continue east and meet M-84 which runs north–south along Bay Street. The {{distance between the}} {{two parallel}} streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street {{marks the beginning of}} the connections to the exit3 interchange along a bend in the I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic <b>northbound</b> under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to <b>northbound</b> I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from <b>northbound</b> I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 1997, a train {{derailment}} caused the <b>northbound</b> Bakerloo line service between Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Circus to be suspended for 12 days.|$|E
5|$|On July15, 2008, {{the town}} of Irondequoit let a $12.8 million {{contract}} for the Sea Breeze Drive project, a mark that was within the $14 million accumulated in funding by this time. Ground was officially broken on the project on July28 {{as part of a}} ceremony attended by several Rochester-area dignitaries. Among those present were Jim Walsh and David Schantz, both of whom played large roles in making the project a reality. The corridor was subsequently reduced to two lanes as the southbound lanes of NY590 were reconfigured to handle both directions of traffic while work ensued on permanently narrowing the <b>northbound</b> lanes to a single lane. <b>Northbound</b> traffic on NY590 was realigned to use the new <b>northbound</b> lane on August17, 2009.|$|E
5|$|On Sundays {{the first}} <b>northbound</b> train leaves at about 9:15 am {{and the first}} {{southbound}} train leaves at about 10:30 am.

5|$|Reconstruction of the MD 3 {{divided highway}} from Millersville to MD 3 Business began in 1987 over two sections. The first section, from north of MD 3 Business to north of Benfield Boulevard, began in 1987. The work {{included}} {{the construction of}} the flyover ramp from <b>northbound</b> I-97 to Veterans Highway just south of MD 3 Business. The section from north of Benfield Boulevard to MD 178 at Dorrs Corner was reconstructed starting in 1989. The second section included construction of the Benfield Boulevard interchange. The southbound MD 3 roadway was rebuilt in place as the southbound lanes of I-97. New <b>northbound</b> lanes were built immediately to the east of the southbound lanes. In February 1991, the new <b>northbound</b> lanes opened and access from I-97 to Veterans Highway was removed at Dorrs Corner. The old <b>northbound</b> lanes were reconstructed and re-purposed as a two-lane road, Veterans Highway, later that year. Anne Arundel County agreed to accept Veterans Highway for maintenance after the I-97–related construction concluded in a road transfer agreement on July 21, 1988. MD 3 was truncated at Millersville after I-97 opened in October 1991; signage for MD 3 on I-695 was removed by 1993.|$|E
5|$|Route 87 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City, {{heading to the}} northeast on Huron Avenue, an undivided road with two <b>northbound</b> lanes and three southbound lanes. Immediately after beginning, it passes under the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector and comes to a ramp that provides access from southbound Route 87 to the southbound connector. From here, the route widens to seven lanes, with two <b>northbound</b> lanes and five southbound lanes. It passes by the Borgata casino, with a ramp from the casino to the <b>northbound</b> direction. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes under a ramp from the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector to the Borgata before heading under <b>northbound</b> direction of the connector. Here, a ramp from the connector provides access to Route 87. A short distance later, the route comes to the northern terminus of Route 187 and turns north to follow Brigantine Boulevard, which is a four-lane divided highway.|$|E
5|$|Scott Jurek. Jurek {{made the}} trip <b>northbound,</b> from late May to mid-July 2015, in 46 days, 8 hours, and 7 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{north of}} the I-495 interchange, the <b>northbound</b> off-ramp and {{southbound}} on-ramp at NY25A split, then run under a pedestrian bridge that connects 46th Avenue. Other pedestrian bridges cross over the highway near 42nd Avenue and at 33rd Avenue. The <b>northbound</b> exit 5 uses 206th Street as a de facto service road, while 207th Street {{is used in the}} same way for the <b>northbound</b> on-ramps. Real service roads run beneath the Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road to connect NY25A and 35th Avenue (exit6A). The service roads merge into the expressway north of 26th Avenue (exit6B).|$|E
5|$|The freeway {{has also}} been {{expanded}} with an extra lane <b>northbound</b> between Perth and Hutton Street, in conjunction with works to increase {{the capacity of the}} Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel. Works progressed in two stages, with Vincent Street as the midpoint. As part of the project, the overpasses at Powis Street, Vincent Street and Scarborough Beach Road have been widened. An additional slip lane has been constructed, from Graham Farmer Freeway's Loftus Street exit ramp to Mitchell Freeway <b>northbound,</b> to access Vincent Street without changing lanes to the left lanes of Mitchell Freeway <b>northbound.</b> The project commenced in February 2013 and was completed in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{has never}} been {{publicly}} signed as Highway400A. Instead, <b>northbound</b> it is indicated as Highway11 and southbound as Highway400.|$|E
5|$|The highway veers {{northeast}} and crosses both the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision before Exit 13 with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) and MD 151 (Erdman Avenue); the entrance ramp {{extends from the}} US 40MD 151 partial cloverleaf interchange immediately {{to the north and}} west. After crossing Herring Run, I-895 meets Moravia Road at Exit 14, a five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange that lacks an exit from <b>northbound</b> I-895, which is accessed via Exit 13 and a loop ramp to the northwest. This interchange complements Exit 60 off I-95, where the eastern terminus of Moravia Road meets the planned western terminus of the Windlass Freeway. A branch of the I-95 Express Toll Lanes begin within the interchange with Moravia Road, and there is a ramp from <b>northbound</b> I-895 to the <b>northbound</b> toll lanes. The highway crosses Moores Run before reaching its northern terminus at Exit 62 of I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), a pair of flyover ramps from I-895 to <b>northbound</b> I-95 and from southbound I-95 to I-895 on the boundary between the city of Baltimore and the Baltimore County community of Rosedale.|$|E
5|$|The six-lane Arroyo Seco Parkway (part of State Route 110) {{begins at}} the Four Level Interchange, a {{symmetrical}} stack interchange {{on the north side}} of downtown Los Angeles that connects the Pasadena (SR 110 north), Harbor (SR 110 south), Hollywood (US 101 north), and Santa Ana (US 101 south) Freeways. The first interchange is with the north end of Figueroa Street at Alpine Street, and the freeway then meets the north end of Hill Street at a complicated junction that provides access to Dodger Stadium. Beyond Hill Street, SR 110 temporarily widens to four <b>northbound</b> and five southbound lanes as it enters the hilly Elysian Park, where the <b>northbound</b> lanes pass through the four Figueroa Street Tunnels and the higher southbound lanes pass through a cut and over low areas on bridges. One interchange, with Solano Avenue and Amador Street, is located between the first and second tunnels. Just beyond the last tunnel is a <b>northbound</b> left exit and corresponding southbound right entrance for Riverside Drive and the <b>northbound</b> Golden State Freeway (I-5). Immediately after those ramps, the Arroyo Seco Parkway crosses a pair of three-lane bridges over the Los Angeles River just northwest of its confluence with the Arroyo Seco, one rail line on each bank, and Avenue 19 and San Fernando Road on the north bank. A single onramp from San Fernando Road joins SR 110 <b>northbound</b> as it passes under I-5, and a <b>northbound</b> left exit and southbound right entrance connect to the north segment of Figueroa Street. Here the original 1940 freeway, mostly built along the west bank of the Arroyo Seco, begins as the southbound lanes curve from their 1943 alignment over the Los Angeles River into the original alignment next to the <b>northbound</b> lanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{southbound}} {{platform is}} {{adjacent to the}} station building, and its high-level section requires crossing only a lightly used spur of State Street. However, access to the <b>northbound</b> platform requires crossing both Northeast Corridor tracks. The footbridge to the planned Coast Guard Museum will allow access to the <b>northbound</b> platform without crossing tracks, which will improve safety and prevent passengers from being trapped on the platform by stopped trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} the {{southern}} terminus of the Bakerloo line, with <b>northbound</b> trains terminating at either Queen's Park, Stonebridge Park or Harrow & Wealdstone.|$|E
5|$|Unusually, {{traffic to}} and from the Highway400 {{extension}} enters and exits at the right of the roadway, while traffic {{to and from}} Highway400A/11 simply continues on the same roadway. The interchange is also incomplete; drivers must either use the Forbes Road and Penetanguishene Road interchanges, or continue southbound into Barrie and switch direction at Duckworth Street in order to travel from southbound Highway400A to <b>northbound</b> Highway400 or from southbound Highway400 to <b>northbound</b> Highway400A.|$|E
