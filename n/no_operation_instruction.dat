50|$|Whereas {{the full}} 40-bit word {{was used for}} data, {{instructions}} were only 20-bits long and were stored two per word. Since indexing was commonly done by modifying the address part of an instruction (say, by adding one to access the next data item in a list), such instructions always {{had to be in}} the second half-word, and the first half-word was padded with a NOP (<b>No</b> <b>operation)</b> <b>instruction.</b> Programmers also used these NOP instructions to provide space for future inserted instructions, since the assembler did not allow for use of symbolic addresses, and the insertion of a single instruction could otherwise require rewriting a lot of code.|$|E
50|$|Another {{perceived}} {{deficiency of}} VLIW designs is the code bloat {{that occurs when}} one or more execution unit(s) have no useful work to do and thus must execute <b>No</b> <b>Operation</b> NOP <b>instructions.</b> This occurs when there are dependencies in the code and the instruction pipelines {{must be allowed to}} drain before later operations can proceed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince {{the intakes}} outflow {{variations}} {{have an impact}} on network performance, it is necessary to evaluate the behavior of different types of intake structures in unsteady flow condition. In the present study, a computer model has been developed in which unsteady Saint–Venant flow equations have been discretized using finite difference and Crank–Nicolson method. Water surface elevation at junctions is calculated implicitly using matrix properties and influence line technique. After model verification, main channel of Miandarband irrigation network and its five branches were simulated. The result showed that without any <b>operation</b> <b>instruction,</b> a 10 % decrease in the upstream flow discharge will reduce the slid gate, Neyrpic single orifice Module and double orifice Module intakes outflows for about 17. 6 %, 3. 04 % and 2. 56 %, respectively.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{which kind}} of assistance users need to run a VCR a study {{was carried out in}} which operating tasks were supported by providing either printed <b>operation</b> <b>instructions</b> or a human expert as support.

Subjects who used the <b>operation</b> <b>instructions</b> needed more time to solve the problem but could solve the posttest task as fast as the subjects beforehand supported by a human expert. The human experts were not instructed concerning the kind of assistance they provided.

[...] In a synchronous system, <b>operations</b> (<b>instructions,</b> calculations, logic, etc.) are coordinated by one, or more, centralized clock signals. An asynchronous digital system, in contrast, has no global clock. Asynchronous systems do not depend on strict arrival times of signals or messages for reliable operation. Coordination is achieved via events such as: packet arrival, changes (transitions) of signals, handshake protocols, and other methods.|$|R
