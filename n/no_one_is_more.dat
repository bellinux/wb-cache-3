2500|$|Manchester Evening News: [...] "The {{individuality}} of {{the music}} is extraordinary. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> willing to serve his music with raw political passion, and that curious cantor-like tone on clarinet is immediately arresting, like Artie Shaw writhing in his death throes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Skeptics and magicians Penn & Teller credit Randi and {{his career}} as a skeptic for their own careers. During an {{interview}} at TAM! 2012, Penn stated that Flim-Flam! was an early influence on him, and said that [...] "If not for Randi there would not be Penn & Teller as we are today." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "Outside of my family... <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> important in my life. Randi is everything to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the First World War, J.K. and the Government of the Gold Coast {{felt the}} need for an {{advanced}} education. As Guggisberg put it, [...] "In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local demagogues, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> delighted at {{the result}} than Tom Stevens, who had cheered loudly and enthusiastically. Dimchurch was also exuberant at Will’s success.|$|R
5000|$|... "Years ago, {{there were}} many serious and daring {{individuals}} in Greenwich Village under 30 as well as young playwrights, myself included. It was a wild and vital time, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> vital than Leonard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course I {{should do}} nothing in such haste as to {{inconvenience}} Mr. Froggatt,' said Felix;' and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> anxious for our real benefit, {{if this were}} possible.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Miss Morton, I {{know it is}} too true; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> {{sensible}} of it than myself. I {{can only}} hope to do my best, such as it is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is very hard, Lance. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> {{concerned}} than I; {{but if this}} intimacy once begins, {{there is}} no guessing where it will lead; and I do not speak without grounds. Listen--' ...|$|E
5000|$|Bailey Rae told The Sun: [...] "There's a line {{in there}} that love is bigger than your pride and that's how I felt about him. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> right for me than him. No one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] {{the doctor}} said; [...] "but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> fitted to die. He was a brave {{man and a}} true Christian, but he ran too many risks, and your news does not {{surprise}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{greeted me}} {{with more than}} affability. Mr. Harding assured me he had read my speeches. Mr. Densmore thought <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to <b>be</b> envied than {{a man who had}} the gifts that secured for him a seat in Parliament.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{can you say}} that? I {{admit that}} I {{think that it is}} better to be {{beautiful}} than to be good. But on the other hand <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> ready than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly." ...|$|E
6000|$|He gave a deep, heavy sigh. Albinia {{felt that}} if he had hoped to have lessened the sadness, he had surely found it again at his own door. He roused himself, however, to say, 'This is using you ill, Albinia; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> {{sensible}} of it than I am.' ...|$|E
60|$|It is most {{cheering and}} {{encouraging}} {{for me to}} know that in the efforts which I have made and am making for the restoration of a righteous peace to our country, I am upheld and sustained by the good wishes and prayers of God's people. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> deeply than myself aware that without His favor our highest wisdom is but as foolishness and that our most strenuous efforts would avail nothing in the shadow of His displeasure.|$|E
5000|$|When the News folded, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> distraught than Keasler. “I feel half numb, like I've got a {{head full of}} cold Crisco,” {{he said at the}} time. “The News was {{a living}} thing with a heart and a soul, and it's dying.” ...|$|R
50|$|Among the men {{who rose}} to power during the later days of the Maharaja's life, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{remarkable}} than Raja Dina Nath.He was well and happily styled Talleyrand of the Panjab and his life and character bore a strong resemblance {{to those of the}} European statesmen.|$|R
60|$|Then half a {{dozen of}} the Second Fifteen, who should have been washing, strolled in to condole with 'Pater' Winton, whose misfortune and its {{consequences}} <b>were</b> common talk. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> sincere than the long, red-headed, knotty-knuckled 'Paddy' Vernon, but, being a careless animal, he joggled Winton's desk.|$|R
6000|$|She looked {{round at}} the {{different}} faces, and Mr. Gerrish slightly frowned, {{as if the}} vision of the Social Union interposing between his late porter and a drunkard's grave, with a cup of good coffee, were not to his taste altogether; but he said: [...] "Precisely so! And I was about to make the remark that while I am very strict--and obliged to be--with those under me in business, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> disposed to promote such objects as this of yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your uncle is a {{very wealthy}} man," [...] said Diana, with easy composure. [...] "He has made you an heiress, placing you in a class much sought after in these {{mercenary}} days. But aside from that, my dear, your personal accomplishments have not escaped notice, and gossip declares {{you to be a}} very fascinating young woman, as well as beautiful and good. I do not imagine society claims to be of divine origin, but were it so <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> qualified to grace it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has several}} times been urged {{by the most}} violent section that the mob should be incited to attack the chateau, but he has each time {{successfully}} opposed the proposition. He has declared that while <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> hostile than himself to the privileges of seigneury, and while he would not only abolish the nobles as a class but confiscate their possessions, he considers {{that in the case}} of the marquis nothing should be done until a decree to that effect is passed by the Assembly.|$|E
6000|$|And then {{he showed}} me more. I {{discovered}} that in Paris he had been painting just the same stale, obviously picturesque things that he had painted for years in Rome. It was all false, insincere, shoddy; and yet <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> honest, sincere, and frank than Dirk Stroeve. Who could resolve the contradiction? ...|$|R
5000|$|He died in Paris {{of a heart}} attack. Upon his death, Gilles Jacob, artistic {{director}} of the Cannes International Film Festival, said: [...] "The Italian cinema has lost one of its most original artists, one of its most personal authors (...) <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> demanding nor more allegorical than he in showing the state of crisis of contemporary man."http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-10/news/mn-57414_1_marco-ferreri ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But you {{are going}} to this place for my sake, papa;--and it is right that he should bear the expense for his own wife. And, papa, you must {{remember}} always that though his mind is distracted on this horrible business, he is not a bad man. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> liberal or more just about money." [...] Sir Marmaduke's feelings on the matter were very much the same as those which had troubled Mr. Outhouse, and he, personally, refused to touch the money; but his daughter paid her own share of the expenses of the journey.|$|E
60|$|SIR,--The {{assistant}} {{editor of the}} Sunday Sun, on whom seems to devolve the arduous duty of writing Mr. T. P. O'Connor's apologies for him, does not, I observe with regret, place that gentleman's conduct in any more attractive or more honourable light by the attempted explanation that appears in the letter published in your issue of today. For the future {{it would be much}} better if Mr. O'Connor would always write his own apologies. That he can do so exceedingly well <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> ready to admit than myself. I happen to possess one from him.|$|E

All what I want is a definitive answer, and it is much fearer [fairer] to say [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no," [...] than to keep one in suspence, which hinders that distressed person of taking other measures, that might make him perhaps gain his Lawsute. However, I shall neither medle or make in it untill I here from you again, which I hope will be soon, for my friend has lost all patience, and so have I to see him Linger so Long.|$|E
5000|$|Afterwards, Rafael Maroto gave a {{stirring}} speech: «Volunteers and Basque countrymen, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> devoted than I to restoring {{the right to}} the Spanish throne to Carlos María Isidro de Borbón, but none <b>is</b> <b>more</b> convinced by {{the experience of a}} multitude of events, that never could this prince bring my country happiness, which is the sole motive of my heart.» ...|$|R
2500|$|Pupil had a {{hard time}} searching for a record label.

However, BMG accepted Buendia again like a [...] "prodigal son" [...] as he himself describes it in their debut album's insert.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998 Aril Brikha’s ‘Groove La Chord’ crossed generic boundaries. Is it techno? Is it house? Is it deep house? <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{surprised}} {{by the success of}} the record than Brikha himself - he’d originally presented it on his demo as a potential B-side. It was not until two years after he recorded the track, when Derrick May played it in a club, that he realised it was good.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our great man, {{the leader}} and liberator of the people," [...] said Field with a smile, [...] "who has carried all before him, and who I verily believe will carry all before him, for Providence {{has given him}} those superhuman {{energies}} which can alone emancipate a race, wishes to confer {{with you on the}} state of this town and neighbourhood. It has been represented to him that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> knowing and experienced than yourself in this respect; besides as the head of our most influential organ in the Press, it is in every way expedient that you should see him. He is at this moment below giving instructions and receiving reports of the stoppage of all the country works, but if you like I will bring him up here, we shall be less disturbed." ...|$|E
60|$|To this I {{can only}} reply that the exclamation {{would be most}} just and would have my own entire sympathy, if it were only relevant. But, it is not I who seek to base Man's dignity upon his great toe, or insinuate that we are lost if an Ape has a {{hippocampus}} minor. On the contrary, I have done my best to sweep away this vanity. I have endeavoured to show that no absolute structural line of demarcation, wider than that between the animals which immediately succeed us in the scale, can be drawn between the animal world and ourselves; and I may add the expression of my belief that the attempt to draw a psychical distinction is equally futile, and that even the highest faculties of feeling and of intellect begin to germinate in lower forms of life. [7] At the same time, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> strongly convinced than I am of {{the vastness of the}} gulf between civilized man and the brutes; or is more certain that whether 'from' them or not, he is assuredly not 'of' them. No one is less disposed to think lightly of the present dignity, or desparingly of the future hopes, of the only consciously intelligent denizen of this world.|$|E
6000|$|By {{the time}} all was quiet again I heard the Altrurian saying: [...] "As to our social life, I cannot {{describe}} it in detail, but I {{can give you}} some notion of its spirit. We make our pleasures civic and public as far as possible, and the ideal is inclusive and not exclusive. There are, of course, festivities which all cannot share, but our distribution into small communities favors the possibility of all doing so. Our daily life, however, is so largely social that we seldom meet by special invitation or engagement. When we do, {{it is with the}} perfect understanding that the assemblage confers no social distinction, but is for a momentary convenience. In fact, these occasions are rather avoided, recalling, as they do, the vapid and tedious entertainments of the competitive epoch, the receptions and balls and dinners of a semi-barbaric people striving for social prominence by shutting a certain number in and a certain number out, and overdressing, overfeeding, and overdrinking. Anything premeditated {{in the way of a}} pleasure we think stupid and mistaken; we like to meet suddenly, or on the spur of the moment, out-of-doors, if possible, and arrange a picnic or a dance or a play; and let people come and go without ceremony. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> host than guest; all are hosts and guests. People consort much according to their tastes--literary, musical, artistic, scientific, or mechanical--but these tastes are made approaches, not barriers; and we find out that we have many more tastes in common than was formerly supposed.|$|E

6000|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{obliged to}} him than Hector Ernescliffe, who wrote to Margaret {{that it would be}} very jolly to come home again, and that he was delighted that the captain could not hinder either that or Cocksmoor Church.
