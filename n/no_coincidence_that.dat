5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|During the {{occupancy}} of {{the palace}} by Dom Pedro and Maria I, the chapel was central to the daily routine of their court. It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the chapel was the first part {{of the palace}} to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband—the couple attended mass several times a day. Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies. Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity. Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in Rio de Janeiro in 1816.|$|E
25|$|They would dine {{early on}} first Thursdays at a hotel, {{planning}} what to do; {{high on the}} agenda was {{to change the way}} the Royal Society Council did business. It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the Council met later that same evening. First item for the Xs was to get the Copley Medal for Darwin, which they managed after quite a struggle.|$|E
50|$|It was, perhaps, <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> {{the city}} {{became one of}} the main centres for trade union {{organisation}} and agitation in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> the legio II Parthica came to {{be known}} as legio Albana and its legionaries as Albani, even though the whole legion did not remain at the Castra Albana, but had other encampments in Mesopotamia.|$|R
60|$|Examples are {{not wanting}} to {{substantiate}} theory. It is <b>no</b> mere <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the two most impersonal nations of Europe and Asia respectively, the French and the Japanese, are {{at the same time}} the most artistic. Even politeness, which, as we have seen, distinguishes both, is itself but a form of art,--the social art of living agreeably with one's fellows.|$|R
25|$|This {{political}} void {{was quickly}} {{filled with a}} number of opposition parties which recognized Muslims as a separate nation. Among them was the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, as a document from the 1930s reveals. It's <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> a large number of Bosnian Muslims joined the Communist Party, and later the partisans, many of them becoming prominent political leaders and commandants.|$|E
25|$|Radiocarbon dating {{traces the}} {{disappearance}} of ground sloths in the United States to around 11,000 years ago. Steadman et al. {{argue that it is}} <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> studies have shown that {{the disappearance of}} ground sloths occur a few years after humans inhabited their living areas, however, recent scientific work is beginning to reveal that climate change had much more of an impact on the decline of the mega fauna in North America.|$|E
25|$|Rogers was philanthropist Edward Harkness's {{favorite}} architect, and Harkness {{would often}} condition {{a gift for}} a new academic or medical building upon the institution's agreement to hire Rogers for the project. It is thus <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Rogers' work is abundant at Yale, Columbia and the other institutions Harkness supported lavishly. Though Harkness loved Rogers's work, when Harkness donated a new home for Wolf's Head, his society at Yale, another architect (Bertram Goodhue) was chosen.|$|E
5000|$|Hong Kong films {{centering}} on Hong Kong police {{at the time}} often relied on comedy rather than action. The American film Dirty Harry {{is said to have}} inspired filmmakers to bring a more true-to-life representation of life [...] "behind the shield" [...] to the screen (It is probably <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Lee later named his production company [...] "Magnum", after Harry Callahan's weapon of choice).|$|R
5000|$|Digby {{addressed}} the packed chamber: [...] "It is <b>no</b> mere <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> {{the only country}} fighting {{for the cause of}} peace, Soviet Russia, is the country that has rid itself of the war-mongering clique. The justification urged for the last war was that it was a war to end war. If that were untrue it was a dastardly lie; if it were true, what justification is there for opposition to this motion tonight?" ...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural land in Nebraska is a {{significant}} asset of wealth and a key economic input into the state 2 ̆ 7 s economy. It is <b>no</b> mere <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Nebraska consistently ranks fourth among the 50 states in total cash receipts from farm marketings while also ranking fourth in land acreage in farms and third in terms of irrigated acreage. This NebGuide provides an overview and an intepretation of land ownership and tenure patterns in Nebraska...|$|R
25|$|Deepak's {{works are}} characterised by their tragic, dark endings. His {{characters}} find {{death as a}} constant companion, and often succumb to it. Often, critics have suggested that Deepak walks alongside his characters with a loaded gun—recoiled and ready to fire. Maybe, one can trace the beginnings of Deepak's present mental ordeal to the dark stories that he was writing even in the early 1970s. Perhaps, it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Deepak's favourite authors are Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, who succumbed to mental agony themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest and}} most celebrated of the chansons de geste is The Song of Roland (earliest version {{composed}} c. 1098), seen by some as the national epic of France (comparable with Beowulf in England, the Song of the Nibelungs in Germany and the Lay of el Cid in Spain). It is perhaps <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the Song of Roland was first written down at a date very close to that of Pope Urban's call (1095) for the First Crusade; its plot {{may be seen as}} a glorification of the crusader ethos.|$|E
25|$|Furman {{may have}} been the most {{successful}} coach in the history of chess, although some would give that title to Mark Dvoretsky. Chess culture has traditionally and typically credited the player for chess success, with the coach recognized in a much lesser fashion, or not at all. Chess coaches were not commonly seen for top players until the post-World War II period, when competition became much stiffer. They were first developed in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries; it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> top players from these nations have dominated chess for the past sixty years. Furman, with a very significant role in Karpov's development from his late teens, building upon earlier roles with World Champion Botvinnik and world-class players such as Bronstein, Korchnoi, and Geller, may have done more than any other coach, from the early 1950s until the late 1970s, to help ensure Soviet dominance.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{mainstream}} bands to release a live Led Zeppelin cover was the US band Heart. A live version of [...] "Rock & Roll" [...] appeared on the band's 1980 compilation [...] "Heart Greatest Hits: Live". It is <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Nancy Wilson, one of the band's founders, later married Cameron Crowe, the famous Rolling Stone journalist who covered Led Zeppelin during the band's peak years. He was also the writer {{and director of the}} semi-autobiographical movie Almost Famous.|$|R
2500|$|But the {{translation}} offered {{an opportunity to}} attack the monarchy indirectly, without explicitly naming the King or the Queen. [...] In some cases party politics were involved. [...] "It is <b>no</b> great <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the individual who expressed in the severest tones his disapproval of {{the translation}} was Nikolaos D. Levidis, {{one of the most}} vociferous leaders of the Opposition. [...] Therefore, political demagogy and its probable electoral gains should be considered instrumental in motivating individuals in their opposition to Olga's translation." [...] (Carabott 1993 p.125) ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1937 - Even as Odisha {{acquired}} statehood {{under the}} British Empire on 1 April 1936, {{there was no}} legislative assembly for people’s representatives to represent their will and legislate on their behalf. It is <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the grounds of Ravenshaw College were chosen {{for the very first}} meeting of the Legislative Assembly of Odisha on 28 July 1937.The new Legislative Assembly of Odisha started functioning from the Examination Hall of Ravenshaw College and upper balcony and verandah acted as balcony for visitors.|$|R
25|$|It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> as RPI {{merged with}} Medical College of Virginia to form Virginia Commonwealth University, {{the dreams of}} {{building}} a great university propelled the crew. After struggling for three years as a student club, the crew's growing stature earned it varsity status, university funding, and a new coach, D.K. Waybright in 1970. With new shells, new equipment, and Waybright's unorthodox and aggressive coaching philosophy, the crew drew support at home and built a reputation on the road. The crew attracted crowds of picnicking students gathering {{on the banks of}} the James as the crews rowed from south of the 14th Street Bridge to the finish line at Ancarrow's Marina on the south side of the river. On the road, Commonwealth Crew traveled to Washington, Philadelphia, New York, South Carolina, and Miami and acquitted themselves against established crews such as Georgetown, Notre Dame, and even Cambridge University.|$|E
25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the practice of}} quarantine drove Hamilton's work in public health. It was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the Hygienic Laboratory began in an attic at Staten Island's Marine Hospital, near Ellis Island, the single busiest port of entry for immigrants during this period. Earlier on, Hamilton had established a Marine Hospital on Bedloe's Island, future site of the Statue of Liberty. Although MHS would not receive formal authority to issue domestic quarantines until 1893, Hamilton and his staff worked with the Congress to advance incremental changes toward a national policy. Maritime quarantine legislation (Act of August 1, 1888) strengthened the Act of 1878, adding new Federal quarantine stations along the East and West coasts; March 1891 legislation made medical inspection of immigrants part of MHS's duties; and interstate quarantine legislation (Act of March 27, 1890) gave MHS authority to establish quarantines against epidemic cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, and plague. On the request of his successor, Surgeon General Walter Wyman, Hamilton also returned to New York during the 1892 cholera pandemic, {{to set up a}} quarantine camp at Sandy Hook (Camp Low).|$|E
25|$|Distinct trends exist {{regarding}} conservation development. While many countries' {{efforts to}} preserve species and their habitats have been government-led, {{those in the}} North Western Europe tended to arise out of the middle-class and aristocratic interest in natural history, expressed {{at the level of}} the individual and the national, regional or local learned society. Thus countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, etc. had what we would today term NGOs – in the shape of the RSPB, National Trust and County Naturalists' Trusts (dating back to 1889, 1895 and 1912 respectively) Natuurmonumenten, Provincial Conservation Trusts for each Dutch province, Vogelbescherming, etc. – a long time before there were national parks and national nature reserves. This in part reflects the absence of wilderness areas in heavily cultivated Europe, as well as a longstanding interest in laissez-faire government in some countries, like the UK, leaving it as <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> John Muir, the Scottish-born founder of the National Park movement (and hence of government-sponsored conservation) did his sterling work in the USA, where he was the motor force behind the establishment of such NPs as Yosemite and Yellowstone. Nowadays, officially more than 10 percent of the world is legally protected in some way or the other, and in practice, private fundraising is insufficient to pay for the effective management of so much land with protective status.|$|E
50|$|Though Charles V {{fought the}} Reformation, it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> either <b>that</b> {{the reign of}} his nationalistic {{predecessor}} Maximilian I saw {{the beginning of the}} movement. While the centralized states of western Europe had reached accords with the Vatican permitting them to draw on the rich property of the church for government expenditures, enabling them to form state churches that were greatly autonomous of Rome, similar moves on behalf of the Empire were unsuccessful so long as princes and prince bishops fought reforms to drop the pretension of the secular universal empire.|$|R
2500|$|At Óc Eo, Roman coins {{were among}} the items of long-distance trade {{discovered}} by the French archaeologist Louis Malleret in the 1940s. These include mid-2nd-century Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius, and his adopted son and heir Marcus Aurelius. It is perhaps <b>no</b> small <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> the first Roman embassy from [...] "Daqin" [...] recorded in Chinese history is dated 166 AD, allegedly sent by a Roman ruler named [...] "Andun" [...] (Chinese: 安敦, corresponding with the names Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius Antoninus) and arriving through the Eastern Han Empire's southernmost frontier province of Jianzhi in northern Vietnam.|$|R
40|$|The UN-established ad hoc Tribunals (ICTY and ICTR) {{have been}} the first {{international}} criminal courts to dispose of cases through plea agreements. The consensual disposal of grave international crimes such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity has given rise to serious controversy and heated debates, {{especially in light of the}} broad and multifaceted goals that international criminal justice is meant to pursue. It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> plea bargaining provisions were not included in the Statutes nor in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (RPE) of these courts and that the ICTY/ICTR judges initially rejected negotiated outcomes as incompatible with the broad and unique mandate of the Tribunals...|$|R
500|$|The {{final scene}} in which Peggy leaves both Don and the agency was pinpointed by critics as a {{standout}} sequence. Maureen Ryan said, [...] "the scene between Don and Peggy was tremendous, but Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss are always magnificent together. It's <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> their final pose—Don at Peggy's waist, kissing her hand—recalled Don's brutal reconciliation with Megan a few weeks ago, kneeling, begging her to stay with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Promoting saints was {{something}} Jocelin would repeat at Glasgow, where he [...] "transferred his enthusiasm to St Kentigern" [...] and commissioned a hagiography of that saint, the saint most venerated by the Celts {{of the diocese}} of Glasgow. It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Jocelin of Furness, {{the man who wrote}} the Life of St. Waltheof, was the same man later commissioned to write the Life of St. Kentigern.|$|E
500|$|Jason Jacobs, a {{lecturer}} in {{film and television}} studies at the University of Warwick, wrote in his 2000 history of early British television drama that [...] "It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale... and Rudolph Cartier... that challenged the intimate drama directly... Kneale and Cartier shared a common desire to invigorate television with a faster tempo and a broader thematic and spatial canvas, and it was <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> they turned to science-fiction {{in order to get}} out of the dominant stylistic trend of television intimacy." ...|$|E
50|$|Martin Rapaport's impact {{within the}} {{industry}} is largely controversial because his commercial price guides have made manipulation of prices {{much more difficult for}} the diamond industry, and are considered a step toward commoditizing diamonds. This is an affront to all the industry represents, with efforts to sell diamonds as something as unique as a snowflake, and of eternal value, hence the De Beers' sales pitch A Diamond Is Forever. It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> either, <b>that</b> Rapaport has largely played a maverick role in issues such as conflict diamonds, synthetic diamonds, diamond treatments, and Fair-Trade diamond issues, or has often been an unlikely ally to NGOs.|$|R
5000|$|Bivens' {{performances}} {{on the album}} You Were On My Mind and in concert largely foreshadowed a female vocal style that, by 1967, was associated with, among others, Elaine [...] "Spanky" [...] McFarlane, Grace Slick of the Great Society and Jefferson Airplane, and Cass Elliot and Michelle Phillips of The Mamas & the Papas. Bivens {{was said to have}} inspired Jefferson Airplane's original vocalist Signe Toly Anderson, who was already well established on San Francisco's jazz and folk scene before joining the Airplane. It may be <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> either <b>that</b> Karen Carpenter who, like Bivens, had a fine vocal range, was signed by Alpert to A&M, with her brother Richard, in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|The neo-aristocratic {{defense of}} {{so-called}} transhistorical and universal human values may also often {{be linked to}} a conservative political project. A return to universal values implies the delegitimation of any group which does not conform to those values. It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> attempts in the United States to define a common [...] "American cultural legacy" [...] tend to neglect the cultures of ethnic minority groups. Or that the fight against franglais (French [...] "contaminated" [...] by American English) in France was mainly fought by intellectuals seeing their traditional position in French society threatened by the import of American cultural products, as Clem Robyns describes.|$|R
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Drögereit {{describes}} [...] "Æthelstan A"'s style {{as having a}} [...] "poetic quality", and Woodman describes him as an [...] "author of no little genius, a man who not only overhauled the legal form of the diploma but also {{had the ability to}} write Latin that is as enduringly fascinating as it is complex." [...] In Woodman's view: [...] "Never before had the royal diploma's rhetorical properties been exploited to such a degree and it seems <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> these documents appeared following King Æthelstan's momentous political conquest of the north in 927." ...|$|E
500|$|During 1893, {{the company}} {{considered}} adding a third tank, which would add another 60 pots of capacity. The expansion cost estimate was $150,000 (over $3.8 million in 2012 dollars), and {{was said to}} [...] "give employment to 350 men." [...] Two major concerns voiced by management to community leaders were adequate fire protection and housing for the workers. [...] Community leaders did not respond soon enough, and the expansion was postponed. [...] However, it is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> Hartford City's waterworks began operations in 1894, and the plant {{was built on the}} city's south side. [...] The city also acquired a chemical fire engine from the Chicago Fire Extinguisher Company, which was delivered in February 1894.|$|E
500|$|The {{influence}} of several contemporary bands was deemed apparent upon {{the sound of}} the album. Robin Jahdi writes that [...] "the Isis sound, debuted proper on the 2002 album, is still present and correct, but there's more subtle shifts in mood here, most interestingly when they take influence from outside (Tool's Adam Jones plays on two songs). The basslines bounce and jolt with that familiar elasticity, but the seismic six-string shifts on songs like 'Hand of the Host' and '20 Minutes / 40 Years' are the sort not heard from this band in years. It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> <b>that</b> these are highlights." [...] The rhythms of [...] "20 Minutes / 40 Years" [...] are described as [...] "Pelican-like" [...] by NME reviewer Ben Patashnik, and No Ripcords Sean Caldwell compares the album to Mastodon's Blood Mountain, citing its potential for [...] "crossover" [...] appeal.|$|E
40|$|Mammalian {{molecular}} geneticists {{face the}} challenge of understanding how a fertilized egg develops into a mature organism, with all of its complex organ sys-tems. Much has been learned about the molecular cor-relates of differentiation in, for example, hemato-poietic cell lineages, but the molecular mechanisms of the development of mammalian organ systems remain virtually unexplored. In mammals, the reproductive tract will undoubtedly prove to be among the organ systems most amenable to developmental genetic studies. Consider the inver-tebrates, where developmental genetics has been pur-sued with greatest success in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode). It is <b>no</b> mere <b>coincidence</b> <b>that,</b> in both fruit fly and nema...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{arbitration}} (E-arbitration) {{is usually}} {{defined as a}} method to settle disputes through online platforms providing arbitration services. It constitutes a recent process dispute resolution mechanism between economic agents {{through the use of}} information and communication technology. E-arbitration is inseparable from the growth of e-commerce and cross-border trade transactions. Contracting parties in such transactions expect a swift, cost-effective and efficient dispute resolution mechanism. It is <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> therefore <b>that</b> an increasing number of domestic legislations and international regulations adhere to the rules governing E-arbitration. The fact remains that, surprisingly, the Lebanese regulatory framework puts several obstacles to the successful implementation of E-arbitration in Lebanon. In this respect, this contribution endeavors to identify the scope of such obstacles, and discusses the solutions adopted in other legal frameworks...|$|R
25|$|The Zamarons are {{the first}} to acknowledge, after {{learning}} of Larfleeze's role in banishing the Orrery of Archangel Invictus into another dimension, that the events like Sinestro becoming a Green Lantern once again, the fall of the Sinestro Corps, the Red Lanterns Central Battery being poisoned, the return of Invictus and the Reach invasion in Odym are <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> a fact <b>that</b> was currently revealed to be the Guardians of the Universe doing as they try to bring about the rise of the Third Army.|$|R
