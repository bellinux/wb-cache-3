25|$|Until 1994 the No.1 Dress {{was also}} the {{everyday}} working uniform, but today it is rarely seen except on formal occasions. The normal working dress retains the shirt and trousers. In some forces short sleeved shirts may be worn open-necked. Long sleeved shirts must always be worn with a tie or cravat, worn {{with or without a}} jersey or fleece. If a jersey, fleece or jacket is worn over a short sleeved shirt, then a tie must be worn. In 2003, Strathclyde Police replaced the white shirts with black wicking T-shirts with stab vest on top, for the majority of officers on duty. Some forces use combat trousers (trousers are of a cargo pocket style i.e. two thigh pockets and two conventional side and rear pockets) and boots. Today, female officers almost <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> a skirt in working dress, and sometimes wear trousers in formal dress as well. Officers also frequently wear reflective waterproof jackets, which have replaced the old greatcoats and cloaks traditionally worn in inclement weather. Most officers now wear stab vests, a type of body armour, when on duty.|$|E
25|$|The {{average time}} to death once a lethal {{injection}} protocol has been started is about 7 to 11 minutes. Since {{it only takes}} about 30 seconds for the thiopental to induce anesthesia, 30–45 seconds for the pancuronium to cause paralysis, and about 30 seconds for the potassium to stop the heart, death can theoretically be attained {{in as little as}} 90 seconds. Given that it takes time to administer the drug, time for the line to flush itself, time for the change of the drug being administered, and time to ensure that death has occurred, the whole procedure takes about 7–11 minutes. Procedural aspects in pronouncing death also contribute to delay, so the condemned is usually pronounced dead within 10 to 20 minutes of starting the drugs. Supporters of the death penalty say that a huge dose of thiopental, which is between 14 and 20 times the anesthetic induction dose and which has the potential to induce a medical coma lasting 60 hours, could <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> off in only 10 to 20 minutes.|$|E

500|$|Santa's Little Helper has fathered several puppies. In [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] (season six, 1995), he {{runs away}} to the dog racing track where he mates with a female hound named She's the Fastest. She later gives birth to 25 puppies and when the Simpsons cannot {{take care of them}} any longer, they decide to sell them; however, Mr. Burns steals the puppies and decides to make a tuxedo out of them. Before he does this, however, he becomes emotionally touched by them. This convinces him to <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> fur again and instead raise the puppies to be {{world-class}} racing dogs. Santa's Little Helper sires another litter of puppies with Dr. Hibbert's poodle in the episode [...] "Today I Am a Clown" [...] (season 15, 2003). These puppies are given away to townspeople.|$|E
500|$|In 1984 Jesús Andrade Salas {{was allowed}} to use the name [...] "Espanto Jr." [...] by Miguel Vázquez, {{adopting}} the distinctive black and white mask that all Espantos wore {{at some point in}} their career. As Espanto Jr. he began working for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA). After working under the moniker for a few years he became embroiled in a feud with El Hijo del Santo, the feud between the two mirrored the feud between El Santo and Espanto, Jr.'s storyline father Espanto I, using the previous storyline to build interest in the matches between Espanto Jr. and El Hijo del Santo. The storyline feud between the two reached its high point as the two faced off in a Lucha de Apuestas match, where both wrestlers put their mask on the line. El Hijo del Santo won, and just like Espanto I, Espanto, Jr. was forced to unmask and <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> the Espanto mask again. In 1995 he became the first wrestler to portray the Pentagón character. He would later be forced to retire after being injured during a match and being clinically dead in the ring for moments before being brought back to life.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was {{harder to get}} right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has {{to have a sense of}} sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come up with is amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1984, Andrade adopted {{his most}} well known ring character: the masked [...] "Espanto Jr." [...] (Spanish for [...] "Horror Jr.") {{who was a}} storyline son of Espanto I. Espanto I had died in 1968 without any sons so Andrade was given {{permission}} to use the name by the surviving Los Espantos, Espanto II and Espanto III. He began wrestling wearing the distinctive black and white mask of the Los Espantos team (that also encompassed Espanto IV and V) as he began working for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA). After working under the moniker for a few years he became embroiled in a feud with El Hijo del Santo, mirroring the feud of Hijo del Santo's father El Santo and Espanto Jr.'s storyline father Espanto I. The storyline feud between the two reached one of its highlights as the two wrestlers faced off in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, where both wrestlers put their mask on the line. El Hijo del Santo won, mirroring the victory of El Santo and just like Espanto I, Espanto Jr. was forced to unmask and <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> the Espanto mask again {{for the rest of his}} wrestling career. As part of the escalating storyline between the two, Espanto Jr. defeated El Hijo del Santo to win the UWA World Lightweight Championship on July 26, 1987, a title he would hold until May 1, 1988 when El Hijo del Santo regained the championship. The storyline between the two stretched over several years, with El Hijo del Santo winning Lucha de Apuestas matches over Espanto on three occasions, each time forcing Espanto Jr. to have his hair shared off. Espanto Jr. would later lose a similar Luchas de Apuestas match to Super Muñeco on June 2, 1991. On April 14, 1992 Espanto Jr. defeated El Hijo del Santo to win the UWA World Welterweight Championship, but only held it for 41days before losing it to Celestial. He would subsequently work for World Wrestling Association (WWA) as the UWA began attracting fewer spectators and eventually going out of business. In WWA he won the WWA World Welterweight Championship when he defeated Piloto Suicida and held it for 193days until losing it to his rival El Hijo del Santo. He also won the WWA World Lightweight Championship by defeating El Hijo del Black Shadow. In 1994 Espanto Jr. began working for Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA), which had been founded a year before. He worked AAA's Triplemanía II-C show on May 27, 1994 where he teamed up with Rambo and Magnate to defeat the team of Winners, Super Caló and El Solar when Espanto Jr. pinned El Solar.|$|E

2500|$|Smart {{is one of}} Australia's {{best known}} artists with his almost iconic and unique imagery, heavily {{influenced}} by various artists and art forms. His stark portrayals of contemporary life, both realistic and absurd, have been the basis of many artistic discussions. Critics and admirers of Smart's paintings often debate his subject matter but in interviews Smart has preferred not to discuss his style; [...] "Leaving the interpretation as the prerogative of the individual viewer." [...] Smart states that he [...] "paints a picture because he likes the shape", and when asked why his skies are always so gloomy and smog-laden or why his faces <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> a smile, he claims [...] "I need a dark sky for the composition, because pale blue {{at the top of}} a frame looks nothing... because a smiling face is too hard to paint".|$|E
2500|$|The notorious extravagance of Elizabeth came {{to define}} the Court in many respects. Elizabeth created {{a world in which}} {{aesthetics}} reigned supreme, producing a Court in which an understood competition existed amongst courtiers to see who could look best, second only to Her Majesty. As historian Mikhail Shcherbatov stated, her court was “arrayed in cloth of gold, her nobles satisfied with only the most luxurious garments, the most expensive foods, the rarest drinks, that largest number of servants and they applied this standard of lavishness to their dress as well.” [...] Clothing soon became the chosen means in Court by which to display wealth and social standing. Elizabeth is reported to have owned 15,000 dresses, several thousand pairs of shoes, and a seemingly unlimited number of stockings. She was known to <b>never</b> <b>wear</b> a dress twice and to change outfits anywhere from two to six times a day. Since the Empress did this her courtiers did as well. It is reported that to ensure no one wore a dress more than once to any ball or notably formal occasion, the Empress had her guards stamp each gown with special ink. Men at court were known to wear diamond buttons, own jeweled snuff boxes, and adorn their servants in uniforms made of gold. It was also during her reign that a great number of silver and gold objects were produced, the most the country had seen thus far in its history. Elizabeth’s extravagance was also clearly displayed in the foods eaten at Court. It was not unheard of for Elizabeth to order over a thousand bottles of French champagnes and wines at any given time to be served at one event and present pineapple at all of her receptions, despite the difficulty of procuring the fruit in such quantities. [...] However Elizabeth’s incredible extravagance and adoration of exotic goods ended up greatly benefiting the country’s infrastructure. Needing goods shipped from all over the postal system roads were modernized in order to fulfill the Empress’s many desires.|$|E
