50|$|<b>Notebooks</b> are {{traditionally}} {{used in the}} science as electronic lab <b>notebooks</b> to document research procedures, data, calculations, and findings. <b>Notebooks</b> track methodology as {{to make it easier}} to reproduce results and calculations with different data sets.|$|R
40|$|Journals, {{also called}} <b>notebooks</b> or log books, are {{frequently}} {{used in conjunction}} with computerized business simulations. This paper discusses the use of <b>notebooks,</b> as a form of learning device. The paper takes the position that while <b>notebooks</b> are used by most instructors [...] as a written assignment to accompany the simulation [...] instructors are not sure what to expect of <b>notebooks</b> and/or have no criteria by which to evaluate <b>notebooks.</b> The paper suggests that a <b>notebook’s</b> use can be enhanced through the use of menu-driven computer support programs. The paper describes one such support program written with LOTUS 1 - 2 - 3 (release 2. 00) TM for the DECIDETM simulation...|$|R

5|$|Unable {{to contact}} Kell, Hannay flicks through the <b>notebook,</b> finding it {{contains}} pages of code using Roman numerals. He finds a map {{in the back}} and takes a train to Scotland to prove Scudder right, attempting to decipher the code en route. Finding out Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated, Hannay reaches Scotland and leaves the train to escape the police. He stays in a barn overnight, where he deciphers the code in the <b>notebook</b> (except a section in double code), which reveals the Germans want to destroy the Royal Navy so that they could invade the country, starting a war. Chased by the police, the Germans and machine-gun-fire from a biplane, he encounters brother and sister Harry and Victoria Sinclair, a prospective Member of Parliament and a suffragette respectively (Patrick Kennedy and Lydia Leonard), who believe him to be a Liberal spokesman. At a political rally in a nearby town (Culross) where Hannay meets Sir George Sinclair, Harry and Victoria's uncle (David Haig), Victoria aids Hannay's attempt to escape, before they are captured by the Germans. With the <b>notebook</b> missing from Hannay's pocket, they are taken to Longkeep Castle (Dumbarton Castle), the headquarters of the German espionage ring, where they are imprisoned by Professor Fisher (Patrick Malahide). Sir George arrives as they are captured and inquires about them while they are held in another room. After he leaves they are bound and gagged and placed in the cellar. They escape and return to where they were captured to look for the <b>notebook,</b> which Victoria reveals she had picked from Hannay's pocket and hidden. They stay overnight in an inn, where Hannay details the contents of the <b>notebook</b> to Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Casting Andy {{was less}} clear-cut. Fox wanted an A-list younger actress, and felt Rachel McAdams, then coming off successes in The <b>Notebook</b> and Mean Girls, {{would help the}} film's {{commercial}} prospects. However, she declined several offers to play Andy, telling the studio {{she was trying to}} avoid mainstream projects for a while.|$|E

Personal organizers can have various kinds of preprinted pages.|$|R
5000|$|The Blue Octavo <b>Notebooks</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as The Eight Octavo <b>Notebooks)</b> {{is a series of}} eight <b>notebooks</b> written by Franz Kafka from late 1917 until June 1919. The name was given to them by Max Brod, Kafka's literary executor, to differentiate them from the regular quarto-sized <b>notebooks</b> Kafka used as diaries. Along with the octavo <b>notebooks,</b> Brod also found a series of extracts copied out and numbered by Kafka. Brod named this brief selection [...] "Reflections on Sin, Suffering, Hope, and the True Way" [...] and included it in The Great Wall of China.|$|R

5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf <b>notebook,</b> more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the <b>notebook</b> on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E

5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30percent its original speed. The <b>notebook</b> was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as <b>notebook</b> sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E

5|$|After the film's release, several {{blogs and}} users of social media {{websites}} Twitter, Facebook and YouTube accused {{the director of}} plagiarism. Media further alleged that Basu had not tried to credit the original sources. Several videos were uploaded to YouTube showing side-by-side comparisons with Hollywood films like Cops, The Adventurer, City Lights, Singin' in the Rain, Project A, The <b>Notebook</b> and Benny & Joon. They also accused Barfi!s music director Pritam of copying the background music from the French film Amélie.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis compares expansion {{possibilities and}} architecture of desktop PCs and <b>notebooks.</b> It analyses {{different types of}} computers for personal use, desktops and <b>notebooks,</b> it categorizes them and analyses contemporary available on the Czech market. The goal of this thesis is to analyze expansion possibilities and also analyze the issue of using <b>notebooks</b> as desktop replacements.

5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished <b>notebook,</b> also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate <b>notebook</b> for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
40|$|There {{was a need}} to {{classify}} Flaubert's <b>notebooks</b> and this recent edition of the « Carnets de travail » proposes such a classification : <b>notebooks</b> for projects, <b>notebooks</b> for ideas, <b>notebooks</b> for scientific investigation and erudition.

50|$|When Brod {{published}} Kafka's diaries in 1948 {{he decided}} to omit the octavo <b>notebooks</b> as he considered their contents more philosophical and literary than the regular diaries Kafka kept. The Octavo <b>notebooks</b> were later included in a volume of fragments and uncollected writings published in 1953, along with the numbered extracts. The <b>notebooks</b> first appeared in English in Dearest Father. Stories and Other Writings (Schocken Books, 1954). Some English printings removed the extracts from their original place in the <b>notebooks</b> to avoid repetition.|$|R
