40|$|The {{move towards}} {{automated}} driving is gaining ground. This paper reviews {{the development process}} of self-driving technology and discusses the safety and efficiency advantages of autonomous vehicles. The discussion shows that the existing traffic management system, including transport infrastructures and regulations, should be changed accordingly to maximize the advantages of autonomous driving. Thus, this paper subsequently gives an insight of the traffic management from three aspects: fully self-driving traffic infrastructures, mixed traffic infrastructures and regulations. First, it is summarized in detail what should be adjusted in intersections, parking lots, pedestrian crossings, ramps, signs and markings. With the transformation of traffic infrastructures, the advantages of driverless car will be more pronounced on account of increased capacity, reduced delay and land use. Also, this paper indicates that the implementations of strict product liability for self-driving car manufacturers and <b>no-fault</b> tort <b>liability</b> for users are applicable to automated vehicle accidents...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to highlight}} the ambiguities contained in section 61 of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA), which attempts to introduce strict product liability for the entire supply chain {{in the event of}} product failure, and to propose amendments from which both the consumer as well as the supply chain could benefit. The new dispensation of strict product liability will lead to a step away from the <b>no-fault</b> based <b>liability</b> system that our courts have implemented for decades. Although this system is unfamiliar to South Africa, strict liability regimes have been followed in foreign countries for a considerable period of time. A comparative study of the approaches followed in America and Europe, which both advanced strict product liability regimes, will be undertaken in this study in order to illuminate problematic aspects relating to the concept of defect contained in section 61 of the CPA as well as the various duties of the supply chain in a strict product liability regime. It is argued that the provisions of the CPA ought to be supplemented with regulations, including, but not limited to, the implementation of adequate safety regulations to mitigate product recalls and product liability claims.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{the history}} of water {{management}} and water safety especially, goes back centuries. Compensation of damage caused by lawful acts of an administrative body (<b>no-fault</b> <b>liability)</b> is developed mostly {{in the field of}} water management and has quite a long history as well. The compensation of <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> in the Netherlands since its introduction has been part of public law and not of civil law. This {{does not mean that the}} administration cannot be held liable for wrongful actions, in which case private law is applied. There is a strict distinction between wrongful and lawful acts of the administration: both can cause damage, but the way they are compensated differs: for lawful acts, public law is applied and for wrongful acts civil law (tort law) is applied. This article only considers public law, because it is the most important branch of law for the compensation of damage caused in the field of water safety. The field of water safety and flood risk management has seen many new developments, of which integration is the latest one. However, the course of flood risk management tends towards more segmentation of responsibilities. <b>No-fault</b> <b>liability</b> and other questions of compensation are also areas that are developing towards more integration. Assessment of <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> in the field of water safety management cannot be made without taking into consideration the historical development of the responsibility of the state for water management tasks in general. In this contribution, the author addresses the historical development of responsibilities of the state for water management tasks, recent developments in this area and the system of <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> regarding measures to prevent flooding...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{incentive}} effects of automobile insurance, compulsory insurance laws, and <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> laws on driver behavior and traffic fatalities. We analyze {{a panel of}} 50 U. S. states and the District of Columbia for 1970 – 98, {{a period in which}} many states adopted compulsory insurance regulations and/or nofault laws. Using an instrumental variables approach, we find evidence that automobile insurance has moral hazard costs, leading to an increase in traffic fatalities. We also find that reductions in accident liability produced by <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> laws have led to an increase in traffic fatalities (estimated to be on the order of 6 percent). Overall, our results indicate that, whatever other benefits they might produce, increases in the incidence of automobile insurance and moves to <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> systems have significant negative effects on traffic fatalities. In the United States today, we are at the threshold of a great experiment in social insurance—one of the most far-reaching in consequence of any that has been yet attempted in the New World.

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Dissertation: THE TORT REVOLUTION: PRODUCT LIABILITY AND THE RULE OF COURTS Ian J. Drake, Doctor of Philosophy of History, 2010 Dissertation {{directed}} by: Professor Herman J. Belz, Department of History This dissertation is {{a history}} of the changes in tort law, specifically in products liability law, from the fault-based negligence standard to the <b>no-fault</b> strict <b>liability</b> standard. It covers a period from the late nineteenth century {{through the end of the}} twentieth century. The historical questions this dissertation seeks to answer are i) what caused the change from negligence to strict liability, ii) who were the historical actors responsible for this change, iii) what was the political character of this change, and iv) what were the political consequences of this change. This dissertation reveals that the revolutionary expansion in product liability law in the states in the 1960 s was the product of the Progressive ideologies of state court judges. During the Progressive Era, American legal education responded and adapted to the political climate of the wider society by adopting a new philosophical disposition regarding how the courts should address civil wrongs. The political and ideological responses to the industrialization of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century resulted in legal academics and practitioners advocating new ideologically oriented theories about how law does and should affect citizens. These theories, known as sociological jurisprudence and legal realism, became popular in American law schools. The law students of the 1920 s became the judges and legal academics of the 1950 s and 1960 s. In the latter decades, Progressive state court judges instituted dramatic, revolutionary changes in the area of law known as torts, particularly products liability law. Products liability law was changed from a fault-based system to an insurance or no-fault system. These politically motivated changes in the courts had the unintended consequence of making a theretofore non-political issue into an inherently political issue, subjecting tort law to the pluralism of the American political system at the state and federal levels. Accordingly, this dissertation contributes to our understanding of the process of legal change, and explores the methods by which social and political changes filter into court decisions...|$|R
40|$|The Author {{wonders why}} the EEC Directive 374 / 1985, {{concerning}} liability for defective products, {{was at first}} given only a slow and cautios reply by Italian and European Law Courts. Though Italian scholars welcomed its transposition (1988) as the long expected introduction of a strict producers' liability system, Italian lawyers and Courts {{went on for a}} long time using their old law tools, and only in the present century we are facing with a real blossoming of judgments applying the Directive: but in spite of this the old trends still survive. In Italy, but also in other Member States, in a number of cases the Courts chose to base their judgments on their domestic general rules of tort law, instead of applying the special rules implementing the Directive, so altering in favour of consumers the delicate balance established at European level; therefore the European Court of Justice tried to stop all attempts to set up a parallel <b>no-fault</b> tort <b>liability</b> system. But in cases concerning damages due to medicaments or blood transfusions Italian judges still go on applying art. 2050 of the Civil Code, holding producers liable for having exploited a dangerous activity: doing so, they can bypass the problems arising from the fact that the Italian Act transposing the Directive did not choose to shift development risk from victims to producers. There are other shortcomings (in the Directive and) in the Italian Consumer Code concerning product liability: for instance, the fact that it only allows compensation of the economic loss for damages to the victim’s goods different from the defective product, whereas damages to the defective product itself lie outside its scope; or the fact that non material damages due to defective products are not covered by the (Directive and the) Consumer Code. So the victims’ path towards a full compensation does not appear straight-lined, if compared with the traditional Civil Code tools. But there are also aspects that may grant victims a better protection: when, at last, the victims’ lawyers and the Courts became confident with the European tool, they found that the rules concerning the proofs of both the product defectiveness and the causal link between defect and damage could be substantially reduced to one: the evidence that there was a damage in normal use conditions. So, in actual fact, they built a res ipsa loquitur rule, that arouses the victims’ interest in the European tool...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of no-fault or strict liability by the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) poses serious {{problems in the}} health care context. With a patient as a ‘consumer’ in terms of the CPA, health care practitioners may find themselves as ‘suppliers’ or ‘retailers’ as part of a supply chain, and potentially liable for harm and loss suffered by a patient in terms of the new <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> provision. The claimant (patient) can sue anyone in the supply chain in terms of this provision, which places the health care practitioner who delivered the care in a very difficult position, as he or she is the most easily and often only identifiable person in the supply chain. Although the causal link between the harm suffered by the complainant will still need to be established on a balance of probabilities, the traditional common law obstacle requiring proof of negligence no longer applies. The article argues that this situation is unsatisfactory, as it places an increasingly onerous burden on certain health care practitioners. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Repeated {{analyses}} of the Swedish national workers’ compensation claims data material in the Occupational <b>No-Fault</b> <b>Liability</b> Insurance Scheme have pointed to {{the high incidence of}} severe hand injury associated with getting caught in rotating (drilling, milling, boring, turning, grinding) machines in the metal manufacturing and engineering industry (Jedeskog & Larsson, 1988; Larsson, 1990; Persson, 1992). In an analysis of all permanently disabling injuries sustained in the Swedish engineering industry during 1986, six out of ten injuries associated with machines for drilling, boring and threading were caused by the operator getting caught in the rotating tool or work-piece with his/her glove or other garment (Larsson, 1990). In a repeated analysis of the national claims data material from the Swedish engineering industry for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, half of all injuries sustained at the same types of rotating machines were due to glove getting caught in the rotating action (Persson, 1992). A development project aimed at reducing the risk of traumatic hand injury associated with rotating action machines was initiated in 1994 by the Institute for Human Safety and Accident Research (IPSO), in co-operation with the Swedish Institute of Production Engineering Research.

40|$|According to {{the current}} {{legislation}} in the Labour Code the employer’s liability for personal injury resulting from industrial injury or disease is objective, i. e. liability for result. Employer has always an obligation to pay damages if the employer has not liberated himself from <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability.</b> In terms which are explicitly defined by the Labour Code the employer can relieved from fully liability or in part. The injured party is entitled to compensation for loss of earnings and compensation for pain and diminished social capability, and compensation for reasonably incurred expenses related to medical treatment and compensation for damage. Additional compensation is provided {{in the case of}} an employee’s death which occurred due to an industrial injury or occupational disease. This may be compensation for reasonable funeral expenses, reimbursement for dependent survivors, one- off compensation for dependents and damage compensation. Each employer now has to pay compulsory insurance against injury. The new law on accident insurance of employees makes the principle of compensation redundant and establishes the principle of insurance. Employers will pay premiums to the Czech Social Security Administration, who will pay allowances from the accident insurance directly to the injured employees. The aim of the new law on accident insurance of employees is to motivate employees to return to work and curb abuse of the insurance. The law should come into effect on 1 st January 2013...|$|E

When moving themselves between the homes of the patients and between different wards, 94 (45 %) were injured (18 in vehicle crashes). The injuries most often resulting in medical impairment were sprains and/or strains (101; 48 %) and frac-tures (67; 32 %). The injuries primarily affected the upper extremities (48 %). Fifteen percent had a medical impairment of 10 % or more, and in about half of the cases, the impairment was 1 % to 4 %.

40|$|Chemoprevention {{agents are}} an {{emerging}} new scientific area that {{holds out the}} promise of delaying or avoiding a number of common cancers. These new agents face significant scientific, regulatory, and economic barriers, however, which have limited investment in their research and development (R&D). These barriers include above-average clinical trial scales, lengthy time frames between discovery and Food and Drug Administration approval, liability risks (because they are given to healthy individuals), and a growing funding gap for early-stage candidates. The longer time frames and risks associated with chemoprevention also cause exclusivity time on core patents to be limited or subject to significant uncertainties. We conclude that chemoprevention uniquely challenges the structure of incentives embodied in the economic, regulatory, and patent policies for the biopharmaceutical industry. Many of these policy issues are illustrated by the recently Food and Drug Administration-approved preventive agents Gardasil and raloxifene. Our recommendations to increase R&D investment in chemoprevention agents include (a) increased data exclusivity times on new biological and chemical drugs to compensate for longer gestation periods and increasing R&D costs; chemoprevention is {{at the far end}} of the distribution in this regard; (b) policies such as early-stage research grants and clinical development tax credits targeted specifically to chemoprevention agents (these are policies that have been very successful in increasing R&D investment for orphan drugs); and (c) a <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> insurance program like that currently in place for children's vaccines...|$|E
40|$|The urban {{misdemeanor}} process {{relies on}} a wide variety of informal groupings and aggregations. Order maintenance police arrest large numbers of people based on neighborhood, age, race, and other generalizations. Prosecutors and public defenders resolve entire classes of minor plea bargains based on standard local practices and pricing. Urban courts process hundreds of cases en masse. At each stage, the pressure to aggregate—to treat people and cases by group—weakens and sometimes eliminates individuated scrutiny of defendants and the evidence in their cases; people are largely evaluated, convicted, and punished by category and based on institutional habit. This wholesale process of creating criminal convictions in the aggregate is in deep tension with core precepts of criminal law, most fundamentally the idea that criminal guilt is an individuated concept reflecting the defendant’s personal culpability. This Article traces the influence of different sorts of aggregation through each step of the urban misdemeanor process, demonstrating how that process has effectively abandoned the individuated model of guilt and lost many of the essential characteristics of a classic “criminal” system of legal judgment. It then explores civil scholarship’s insights into the substantive power that informal aggregations can exert over liability rules and outcomes, in particular how mass settlement scenarios can generate <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> regimes with high risks of fraud. The Article concludes that the misdemeanor system as it currently stands does not function as a traditional “criminal” system of judgment in large part because aggregation erodes the substantive content of criminal convictions...|$|E
40|$|English law has {{demonstrated}} {{itself to be}} particularly hostile {{to the idea of}} holding parents tortiously liable for the acts of their children. It deals with allegations of parental negligence with a degree of leniency that, arguably, defies all rational justification. In advocating reform, the primary objective of this thesis is to put forward a proposal for a new regime of liability that obliges parents to take much greater legal responsibility for their children's conduct. The proposition set out is that English law has a lot to learn from the continental approach to parental liability. In seeking guidelines for change, the French system is singled out as a particularly good model for comparison. Over the years it has experimented with different forms of parental liability, and so its law in this respect is well developed, not to mention excellently documented. The French system offers two main options for reform: a regime of strict liability based on a rebuttable presumption of fault or a regime of vicarious liability. It is contended that, for present purposes, the former offers the more viable solution for a legal system that is notoriously resistant to the concept of <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability.</b> In adapting this French regime to suit English needs, the focus of this thesis is on the substantive legal issues involved. The normative feasibility of the proposed regime is established by demonstrating its consistency with the principles of English negligence law. This, in turn, is done by demonstrating the existence, in a typical parental liability action, of the elements of duty of care, breach of duty and both factual and legal causation...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} and analytical study which comprises of {{an analysis of}} the rules of the seller's liability for non-conforming goods of four legal systems; Korean law, English law, the U. N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980) and the E. C. Directive on Certain Aspects of the Sale of Consumer Goods and Associated Guarantees. The {{purpose of this study is}} to ask whether there is any need to introduce a unified liability system into Korean law and how to achieve the system under the existing law in order to overcome all the complexities caused by the separate existence of the general liability for non-performance and the seller's guarantee liability. A further purpose is to investigate how effectively the rules of the seller's liability for non-conforming goods protect the reasonable expectations of the parties; in particular, the interests of consumers and private sellers which are distinguished from those of commercial buyers and business sellers, respectively, and where the issue is not directly related to the particular interests of consumers or private sellers, the common interests of all the parties. The study is conducted by an internal evaluation within the boundaries of law in a legal context and an external evaluation in light of 'efficiency' as used by economists. It shows, first, that Korean law needs a unified liability system which is based on a contract to resolve the problems originating in the distinction between the general liability as a contractual liability and the seller's guarantee liability as a legal liability. Second, achieving a genuine unified liability system require one's interpretation that rescission and damages in the seller's guarantee liability should be as they are in the general liability. This would settle other problems inherent in the casuistic distinction between the general liability as a fault liability and the seller's guarantee liability as <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> and its consequences in interpreting damages under the seller's guarantee liability. Finally, in what aspects of the seller's liability for non-conforming goods each jurisdiction fails to reflect the interests of consumers and private sellers, and the common interests of all the parties...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Questioning the Social Desirability of Product Liability Claims This thesis {{seeks to}} answer the primary {{question}} as to whether Product Liability Claims are socially desirable by reference to three Product Liability case studies and a survey of 132 archived Product Liability claims. These constitute a representative random sample of Product Liability cases handled by the Author’s Legal Practice. This practice has provided a window through which serious failings are identified in (i) the strict liability based Product Liability Directive; (ii) tort itself as a mechanism for compensating injured persons; and (iii) the procedural infrastructure in which claims are made, as recently reformed in accordance with Lord Justice Jackson’s recommendations. This thesis tests Product Liability claims against the objectives of tort: deterrence; corrective justice; retribution and vindication; distributive justice and compensation. It is found that Product Liability claims fail to meet the defined standard of social desirability. There is nothing special about products to necessitate or justify a bespoke system of liability. Product Liability claims for damages represent in microcosm the broader picture of personal injury claims as a whole. This thesis highlights the failings of a system which relies heavily on gambling upon outcomes; perpetuates a ‘have a go’ culture; rewards the lucky few; builds in an unacceptable element of moral hazard and tolerates and generates the costs of a high volume of claims which serve no practical or legal purpose. It is concluded that 1. The Product Liability Directive was introduced as an emotive response to the Thalidomide tragedy but it would fail to provide a remedy in a similar disaster. Instead it treats sufferers of minor mishaps as victims and contributes to a litigation industry that inculcates in society a false and unnecessary sense of entitlement. 2. The Product Liability Directive should be repealed as a flawed and misconceived piece of legislation that fails to achieve its key goal of protecting consumers and harmonising the law. 3. Support is found in this practical research for much of what Atiyah advocated in his seminal work The Damages Lottery. The possibility of an all-embracing <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> system should be reconsidered subject to strict controls, including thresholds, to ensure that it compensates and rehabilitates only those with genuine needs. 4. A first party insurance market would have to develop to fill the gaps...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of negligence cases being adjudicated in the Malaysian courts are cases involving road accidents. The settlement process is being criticized by some analysts {{due to the}} fact that the litigation process is time consuming. Compensation payouts by insurance companies do not cover all kinds of victims. As a consequence, a proposal to amend the law has been suggested by some researchers including a renewal based on the <b>no-fault</b> <b>liability</b> scheme as practised by other countries. An amendment to the Civil Law Act 1956 has been done in order to improve some aspects in solving of cases. However, it is not able to solve the various problems that arise. Hence, this study puts forward the solution to road accident cases based on Islamic law. The similarities and differences between Islamic law and the law in Malaysia were analysed in order to find the solution to this problem. The comparisons focus on three aspects, which are, determining liability, quantum of compensation and burden of liability. This study employs the library method and a structured interview on a purposive sample. The data analysis was done inductively, deductively and comparatively. The findings show that in Malaysia, it is very complex to prove negligence in cases of road accidents because proving a case depends on the elements to be proven. The quantum of compensation is done based on estimation, especially for cases regarding future loss. These laws which are unclear result in long periods of appeals from the litigation parties. This contributes to late settlement of cases. The findings of this study show otherwise in Islamic law where basically, the method of determining liability is based on the type of action. Therefore, the act of determining libility is clear and also easier because evidence of negligence is not applicable in all situtions. The quantum of compensation according to Islam is based on the use of diat as the ceiling value for various types of losses and self-injuries. Also, the scope for burden of liabilty on ‘aqilah and bayt al-mal in Islamic law is wider as it covers all victims whose rights were wrongly assaulted. Finally, the findings of this study concludes that the Islamic law concept should be applied in order to expedite the settlement of accident cases in Malaysia and to give an overall protection of rights to the victims. It is hoped that this study will contribute significantly to the lawmakers in their efforts to enhance the settlement process of road accidents in Malaysia...|$|E
