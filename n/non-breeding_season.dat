5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season,</b> they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels in Canada and the {{northern}} United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean. Birds that breed south of about 35Â° north latitude are usually year-round residents. Migration also depends on local weather conditions. Wintering kestrels' choice of habitat varies by sex. Females are found in open areas more often than males during the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season.</b> A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females arrive at the preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season,</b> storks in the Indian region {{disperse}} widely, {{mainly in}} the Gangetic Plains and sightings from the Deccan region are rare. Records of flocks from further south near Mahabalipuram have been questioned. In the 1800s, adjutant storks were extremely common within the city of Calcutta {{during the summer and}} rainy season. These aggregations along the Ghats of Calcutta however declined and vanished altogether by the early 1900s. Improved sanitation has been suggested as a cause of their decline. Birds were recorded in Bangladesh in the 1850s, breeding somewhere in the Sundarbans, but have not been recorded subsequently.|$|E
50|$|Of the 16 {{species of}} neotropical raptors, {{including}} the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), who are known altitudinal migrants, most breed {{in the high}} Andes and migrate to lowland areas during <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons.</b>|$|R
50|$|A. arundinacius has a {{primarily}} carnivorous diet. Observation of prey collection specifically during {{breeding season}} {{has shown the}} retrieval of insect larvae, moths, dragonflies, damselflies, beetles, spiders, small fish, and frogs. A. arundinacius has also been reported to eat fruit during <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons.</b> Nestlings typically feed on diptera and arachnids, though {{this may not be}} their preferred food.|$|R
50|$|This {{species can}} be quite tame, but is often {{surprisingly}} difficult to see on mountain faces. While it may be confiding in the breeding and <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons,</b> and vagrant birds especially are extremely tame, they will still hide when {{they are aware of}} being watched, and will hesitate before entering the nest and even take roundabout routes towards the nest during prolonged observations.|$|R
5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season</b> in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E
5|$|As the long-tailed {{ground roller}} is remarkably silent and {{difficult}} to see during the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season,</b> the local inhabitants of Madagascar once believed that this bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and dug out its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers {{to be one of}} the world's most elusive birds.|$|E
5|$|Many procellariids {{undertake}} long annual migrations in the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season.</b> Southern {{species of}} shearwater {{such as the}} sooty shearwater and short-tailed shearwater, breeding on islands off Australia, New Zealand and Chile, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to the waters off Alaska and back each year during the austral winter. Manx shearwaters from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to the waters off Brazil in the South Atlantic. The mechanisms of navigation are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown {{that they are able}} to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. A Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200mi).|$|E
25|$|Engagements {{of sexual}} {{activities}} during <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> {{have been observed}} in the animal kingdom. Dolphins and Japanese macaques {{are two of the}} many species that engage in sexual activities that do not lead to fertilization. Great varieties of non-copulatory mounting are expressed in several species. Male lions engage in mounting with other male lions, especially when in search for another pride. The varieties of mounting include mounting without erections, mounting with erection but no penetration, and mounting from the side.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific robin inhabits {{the islands}} of the south western Pacific. It ranges from Bougainville in Papua New Guinea through the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. ({{although}} the species is absent from New Caledonia) and eastwards through Fiji into Samoa. Across its range the species is resident, although {{there may be some}} small localised movements of birds in the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons.</b> A fossil found on {{the islands of}} Ha'apai in Tonga show that the species once occurred in the group but is now extinct there.|$|R
40|$|The European beaver (Castor fiber L.) is an {{important}} free-living rodent that inhabits Eurasian temperate forests. Beavers are {{often referred to as}} ecosystem engineers because they create or change existing habitats, enhance biodiversity and prepare the environment for diverse plant and animal species. Beavers are protected in most European Union countries, but their genomic background remains unknown. In this study, gene expression patterns in beaver testes and the variations in genetic expression in breeding and <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> were determined by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. Paired-end sequencing in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer produced a total of 373. 06 million of high-quality reads. De novo assembly of contigs yielded 130, 741 unigenes with an average length of 1, 369. 3 nt, N 50 value of 1, 734, and average GC content of 46. 51 %. A comprehensive analysis of the testicular transcriptome revealed more than 26, 000 highly expressed unigenes which exhibited the highest homology with Rattus norvegicus and Ictidomys tridecemlineatus genomes. More than 8, 000 highly expressed genes were found to be involved in fundamental biological processes, cellular components or molecular pathways. The study also revealed 42 genes whose regulation differed between breeding and <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons.</b> During the <b>non-breeding</b> period, the expression of 37 genes was up-regulated, and the expression of 5 genes was down-regulated relative to the breeding season. The identified genes encode molecules which are involved in signaling transduction, DNA repair, stress responses, inflammatory processes, metabolism and steroidogenesis. Our results pave the way for further research into season-dependent variations in beaver testes...|$|R
5|$|Overall, data on {{the social}} {{behaviour}} of the grey currawong is lacking, and roosting habits are unknown. It is generally shyer and more wary than its pied relative, but has become more accustomed to people in areas of high human activity in southwest Western Australia. Its undulating flight is rapid and silent. It hops or runs when on the ground. Birds are generally encountered singly or in pairs, but may forage in groups of three to eleven birds. Up to forty birds may gather to harvest a fruit tree if one is found. The black-winged subspecies is seldom seen in groups larger than four or five, while the clinking currawong may form groups of up to forty birds over the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow is gregarious, {{generally}} forming {{small groups}} of four to six birds while feeding. It tends to breed in loose colonies of a few pairs, and non-breeding birds may gather to roost in acacias or tamarisks near water. During winter, the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season,</b> it forms larger flocks {{of as many as}} 30 birds, and joins flocks with other seed-eating birds, such as house sparrows and red avadavats. The Sind sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grasses and other plants such as Polygonum plebeium. It may also forage for insects such as caterpillars, especially to feed nestlings. Flocks forage on flats alongside rivers, flying into nearby bushes and continuing to forage when disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season</b> they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
40|$|In goats, {{the control}} of estrous and {{ovulation}} is a valuable tool to improve and maintain the pro-duction of milk and meat throughout the year. Therefore, estrous synchronization together with AI is extensively applied in the reproductive man-agement of goat (Leboeuf et al., 1998). Progesterone or a progestagen analogue is generally used to syn-chronize estrous in does during the breeding and <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> (Ak et al., 1998). Worldwide, the most common route of progestagen application in goats is via the intravaginal sponge (Bretzlaff, 1997). The most widely used procedures for syn-chronization and/or the induction of estrous are 12 â 21 days of FGA or MAP impregnated intra vagi-nal sponge treatment (Romano, 1996. 1998, 2002...|$|R
40|$|Kleptoparasitism, the {{stealing}} of already-procured food {{by individuals}} {{of the same}} or other species, is a widespread behaviour among birds (Brockmann & Barnard 1979). Such behaviour often occurs among seabirds and {{may be an important}} feeding technique of Laridae (gulls and terns), in which the habit has been recorded for more than 25 % of the family (Furness 1987). Likewise, some species of gulls frequently engage in intra- and interspecific kleptoparasitism, and this behaviour can become an important feeding method during the breeding and <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> for those birds. This note provides information about new records of kleptoparasitism by Kelp Gull Larus dominicanus on two species of tern. Kleptoparasitism by Kelp Gulls was recorded in October an...|$|R
40|$|The fall {{migration}} marks {{a transition}} between the breeding and <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons.</b> While some species, such as Mourning Dove, are still reproductively active well into autumn, most species that breed north of Mexico and the Caribbean have completed their primary breeding period, {{and those that}} migrate are making their way to wintering areas. The sojourn to nonbreeding sites includes some epic migrations, {{some of which are}} still being discovered [...] for example, the 11, 000 -km presumably non-stop flight of baueri Bar-tailed Godwits from coastal Alaska to New Zealand. Most species have much shorter flights, usually broken into segments, and other species reside in the same area year-round or make only facultative movements...|$|R
5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season</b> the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E
5|$|Some {{populations of}} cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and {{distinguishing}} {{between the two}} can be difficult for this species. In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand {{in the winter and}} return in the spring. Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season.</b> Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (Ardeola grayii) on the south-eastern coast of India and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly {{little is}} known of sarus crane ecology from Australia. Sarus crane {{breeding}} records (confirmed sightings of nests with eggs, or of adult birds with flightless young) are known from only three locations, all in the Gulf Plains in Queensland state. Two records are from near Normanton town: one of adults with flightless chicks seen about 30km west of the town, and another of adults incubating eggs seen 7-km south of the town. The third record is a one-month study that provides details of 32 nests located within 10-km around Morr Morr cattle station in the Gilbert River floodplains. Other published records provide insufficient information to be useful, {{and there is a}} need to carefully map breeding areas of sarus cranes in Australia. They are uncommon in Kakadu National Park, where the species is often hard to find among the more numerous brolga. Flocks in the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season</b> are commonly seen in the Atherton Tablelands in eastern Queensland.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{season in the}} wild is unknown; reproductive activity has been noted between June and August but few records exist and as in many rainforest birds {{there might not be}} well-marked breeding and <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons.</b> Males court the females by strutting around them and giving booming calls. These birds copulate on the ground, and as in many other Galloanseres and in paleognaths the males have a kind of penis. Couples presumably form for years, often essentially for life, as in other curassows; a change of partners may occur occasionally, and were males are frequently hunted (their loud calls make them easy to stalk) survivors may pair up with more than one female.|$|R

50|$|Typical {{characteristics}} of tropical altitudinal migrants include: {{a high rate}} of frugivory or nectarvory; movement between lower elevation areas during <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> and higher elevation areas during breeding seasons, or on a consistent annual or seasonal cycle; {{at least part of the}} population being migratory with a possible portion of the population residing at breeding sites year-round. This last characteristic can be sex-biased, as it is with juncos, in which the males are less likely to migrate than the females. The white-ruffed manakin provides a good example of an altitudinal migrant by displaying all of these traits. It has {{a high rate of}} frugivory, migrates from lower elevations to higher elevations on a predictable breeding-season based cycle, and part of the population is migratory, with a small portion possibly remaining at the breeding sites year-round.|$|R
5|$|Within its Indus valley {{breeding}} range in Pakistan and western India, the Sind sparrow is patchily distributed in riverine and wetland habitats with thorny scrub and tall grass. During the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season,</b> some birds enter drier habitats as they disperse short distances from their breeding habitat, or migrate into western Pakistan and the extreme east of Iran. Since this species is fairly common and expanding its range, it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The Sind sparrow is social within small groups while feeding and breeding, and during its winter dispersal. It feeds mostly on seeds and less often on insects, foraging {{close to the}} ground. Nests {{are made in the}} branches of thorny trees, and are untidy globular masses constructed from grass or other plant matter and lined with softer material. Both sexes are involved in building the nest and caring for the young, and usually raise two clutches of three to five young each breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, {{and for the}} most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naÃ¯ve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season,</b> which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.|$|E

5000|$|Similar {{to other}} widowbirds, male red-collared widowbirds have both {{seasonal}} and sexual dimorphism. Males are about 25 cm in length while females are only 13 centimeters. A similar trend is seen with weight, where males range from 20 to 26 g and females are only between 16 and 22 grams. During <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons,</b> the male plumage is brown, while in breeding season, October to April, they have black plumage {{with a long}} tail, approximately 22 cm, and crescent -shaped carotenoid based chest patch. [...] There is significant variation in brightness, hue, and chroma of the carotenoid badges. [...] In contrast, females and subadults, like nonbreeding males, are streaky dull brown with a short tail, approximately 4 cm. Nonbreeding males, however, retain their black tails, while females and subadults' tails are dark-brown.|$|R
30|$|Reproduction in mammals {{is likely}} {{affected}} by the resources available in its habitat to sustain the energy demands of reproduction. Plateau pika is a native herbivorous species inhabiting the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. They have short spring-summer breeding seasons typical to herbivorous small mammals inhabiting alpine environments [12]. Considered the seasonal reproduction of plateau pika, we proposed several discrete models to understand the dynamics of plateau pika. During the breeding and the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons,</b> the dynamics of plateau pika population satisfies different models. This kind of model can describe the population dynamics in more detail. With this kind of model, Burkey and Stenseth [13] studied the effects of resource patchiness {{and the effects of}} a seasonally variable environment on the population dynamics of a herbivore species, and Liu et al. [14] investigated the influence of environment change on population dynamics.|$|R
50|$|This gull is {{resident}} {{from the}} western coast of Alaska to the coast of Washington. It also breeds on the northwest coast of Alaska, in the summertime. During <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> they can be found {{along the coast of}} California. It is a close relative of the western gull and frequently hybridizes with it, resulting in identification problemsâparticularly in the Puget Sound area. This species also hybridizes regularly with the herring gull in Alaska. Both hybrid combinations resemble the Thayer's gull. Glaucous-winged gulls are thought to live about 15 years, but some live much longer; a bird in British Columbia, for example, lived for more than 21 years, while one in the US state of Washington, lived for at least 22 years, 9 months. The longevity record though, is more than 37 years, for a bird banded as a chick in British Columbia.|$|R
25|$|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} circulating androgen hormone and can be rapidly metabolized within target tissues into potent androgens and estrogens. Gonadal steroids generally regulate aggression during the breeding season, but non-gonadal steroids may regulate aggression during the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season.</b> Castration of various species in the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season</b> {{has no effect on}} territorial aggression. In several avian studies, circulating DHEA {{has been found to be}} elevated in birds during the <b>non-breeding</b> <b>season.</b> These data support the idea that non-breeding birds combine adrenal and/or gonadal DHEA synthesis with neural DHEA metabolism to maintain territorial behavior when gonadal testosterone secretion is low. Similar results have been found in studies involving different strains of rats, mice, and hamsters. DHEA levels also have been studied in humans and may play a role in human aggression. Circulating DHEAS (its sulfated ester) levels rise during adrenarche (~7 years of age) while plasma testosterone levels are relatively low. This implies that aggression in pre-pubertal children with aggressive conduct disorder might be correlated with plasma DHEAS rather than plasma testosterone, suggesting an important link between DHEAS and human aggressive behavior.|$|E

40|$|Migratory {{shorebirds}} {{inhabit the}} shorelines of rivers, wetlands, oceans and lakes, {{where they need}} to rest and feed during their <b>non-breeding</b> <b>seasons</b> to prepare for their annual migrations to breeding grounds in the Arctic.

In this thesis I investigated how migratory shorebirds responded to habitat loss in the Hunter estuary, a non-breeding site in south-eastern Australia, and how they used remaining estuarine habitats. The Hunter estuary is a wetland of international importance but {{has a long history of}} modification from industrial and urban development which began in the late 1800 s.

40|$|In California {{restoration}} {{efforts are}} ongoing {{to save the}} threatened California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) from further decline, yet {{our understanding of the}} food web linkages for this species in nature remain largely unknown. Conserving species that have diphasic lifecycles containing aquatic and terrestrial stages can be challenging. For example, while it is clear that aquatic habitat must be preserved for breeding, there is less known about the importance of terrestrial habitat. This study uses three approaches to delineate food web linkages for the California red-legged frog: 1) stable isotopes collected from frogs and key species in their ecosystem; 2) stomach samples from live frogs in the wild; and 3) dissections from museum specimens. The stable isotope mixing model showed that terrestrial carnivore and terrestrial detritivore invertebrates were the two main contributors to R. draytonii diet.
