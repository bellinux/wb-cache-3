The Apollo 13 landing site is in the Fra Mauro uplands; the two National Aeronautics and Space Administration previous landings were in mare or 'sea' areas, Apollo 11 in the Sea of Tranquility and Apollo 12 in the Ocean of Storms...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} Indian {{middle class}} <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear {{of violence in}} public spaces. It attempts to broaden {{the perspective of the}} implications of fear of violence. Both the public and academic discourses on violence in public spaces in India are centered on the notion of the female victim. In this thesis I argue that we need to open up a strict binary understanding of only women as vulnerable and affected by the fear of crime in public spaces. I discuss the gendered implications of different types of violence, and how different identity categories that cut across gender, have an impact on middle class <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear. In addition to this I assess how the fear for others safety and the masculine ideal of being a protector has an impact on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> personal fear of violence. Because there is <b>no</b> research on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of crime in an Indian context I have supported my analyses with three theoretical frameworks, all relevant in different ways. This is the research on masculinity in India, the research on men and fear from the West, and the research on middle class women and fear of crime in India. My own research consists of data collected through a survey where 98 men and women participated, and interviews with men who are involved in initiatives for safer cities. To understand how fear of violence in public spaces is affecting lives in India, it is necessary to not restrict ourselves to only women s narratives. This thesis is an attempt at putting <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of violence on the agenda, and hopefully it contributes to a widening of the understanding of fear of violence in public spaces...|$|R

40|$|Colonial outpost settlements, in {{the form}} of garrison-controlled open air gaols, had been {{established}} at the four cardinal points of the Australian continent, within four decades of European colonisation in Australia. In Van Dieman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Land,</b> such settlements were serviced by regimental surgeons of the deployed garrisons and by doctors of the Colonial Medical Service. Almost nothing survives of the pre-existing Aboriginal medicine practised for millennia by the first Tasmanians. A French naval surgeon and naturalist, Francois Peron (1775 - 1810) of the Baudin expedition (1800 - 1804) undertook the first medical research in Australia, on the eastern coast of Van Dieman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Land</b> in 1801. Convict medicine had special characteristics in Van Dieman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Land,</b> exemplified perhaps in its most extreme form in that practised on Sarah Island and on Grummett Island at the notorious Macquarie Harbour Settlement. Naval surgeons of both the French and the Royal Navies and early colonial surgeons contributed significantly to the scientific study of natural history in Van Dieman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Land.</b> Their names are recorded in such examples such as the seaweeds Phacelocarpus labillardieriand Jeannerettia lobata. Sir Joseph Hooker (1817 - 1911), Assistant Surgeon and Naturalist on HMS Erebus, botanised extensively in Van Dieman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Land.</b> It was said that his Flora Tasmaniae is regarded "as one of the finest pieces of botanical literature". Perhaps the most significant representative of the surgeonnaturalists who practised in Van Dieman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Land</b> in the decades following colonisation, was Surgeon Robert Brown (1773 - 1858). Brown, sometimes called, "The Father of Australian Botany", lived for some five months in Tasmania. His massive work, Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae etInsulae van Dieman, published in 1810, was regarded by Sir William Hooker as "the greatest botanical work which ever appeared"...|$|R
