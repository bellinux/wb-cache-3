40|$|A {{number of}} public safety-net {{programs}} exist {{to help improve}} the economic well-being of vulnerable children, but {{little is known about}} the extent to which families with a child maltreatment report receive these services over time. In this brief, we examine the incidence of receiving four types of income support both immediately after the child maltreatment report and eighteen months following. The data for this analysis come from the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II), a national sample of children who had a maltreatment report that resulted in an investigation by CPS within a 15 -month period beginning in February 2008. Authors Wendy Walsh and Marybeth Mattingly report that the child protective system, especially in rural areas, may link families to needed supports. Among families who did not initially report safety <b>net</b> <b>receipt</b> and reported financial challenges, more rural (51 percent) than urban (38 percent) received at least one safety net program eighteen months later. Among families who did not initially report safety <b>net</b> <b>receipt</b> and reported financial challenges, more rural (38 percent) than urban (7 percent) families said they were managing to “save a little money each month” eighteen months after their encounter with the child protective system...|$|E
40|$|Data from 76 {{experimental}} welfare-to-work programs {{conducted in}} the United States between 1983 and 1998 are used to investigate whether the impacts of such programs on employment had been improving over time and whether specific program features influencing such changes can be identified. Over the period, an increasing percentage of control group members received services similar to those offered to program group members. As a result, differential participation in program service activities between program and control group members decreased steadily over time. This reduction in the <b>net</b> <b>receipt</b> of program services tended to reduce {{the impact of these}} programs on employment. However, the negative influence of the reduced incremental services was offset by other factors that resulted in program impacts remaining essentially constant from 1983 to 1998. Suggestions are made for possibly improving program impacts in future experiments. Welfare Programs; Program Evaluation; Employment Behavior of Low-Income Families; Meta Analysis...|$|E

Os dados foram coletados da pÃgina na {{internet}} da FederaÃÃo Cearense de Futebol-FCF, do blog Contexto Esportivo e do portal da transparÃncia do Tribunal de Contas do MunicÃpio-TCM. Aplicou-se o Valor de Shapley e o Ãndice de Poder de Shapley-Shubik para classificar os clubes de acordo com os ganhos de renda lÃquida obtidos nesta alocaÃÃo. Os resultados mostraram que a alocaÃÃo do Valor de Shapley Ã mais equitativa, de modo que clubes como QuixadÃ, Limoeiro e Boa Viagem, que obtiveram arrecadaÃÃo negativa pelo sistema de rateio atual da renda lÃquida, passaram a auferir renda lÃquida positiva com a alocaÃÃo do Valor de Shapley, de modo que pode-se dizer que estes clubes sÃo subsidiados com a repartiÃÃo de renda via valor de Shapley. Verificou-se que os clubes de maiores rendas lÃquidas obtiveram maiores valores para o Ãndice de Poder Shapley-Shubik, com exceÃÃo apenas do Fortaleza Esporte Clube. This {{research is}} {{an application of}} the Shapley Value and the Power Index Shapley-Shubik as studied {{in the context of}} the Cooperative Game Theory. Specifically, this paper studied the distribution of net income generated at the box office of the FederaÃÃo Cearense de Futebol-FCF during the 2010 football championship. The data were collected from the website of FCF, as well as from the Contexto Esportivo blog, and from the ransparency portal of the Tribunal de Contas do MunicÃpio-TCM. The Shapley value and the power index Shapley-Shubik were applied to rank the football clubs participants according to the net income gains achieved in this allocation. The results revealed that the Shapley value application is more equal because the minor participants clubs like QuixadÃ, Limoeiro e Boa Viagem, with negative receipts from games in the previous status, get now positive ones from those techniques. The results from Power Index Shapley-Shubik show that the bigger the football club the bigger the <b>net</b> <b>receipt</b> from games, except to Fortaleza Esporte Clube...|$|E

50|$|The {{author of}} a work may receive a {{percentage}} calculated on a wholesale or a specific price or a fixed amount on each book sold. Publishers, at times, reduced the risk {{of this type of}} arrangement, by agreeing only to pay this after a certain amount of copies had sold. In Canada, this practice occurred during the 1890s, but was not commonplace until the 1920s. Established and successful authors may receive advance payments, set against future royalties, but this is no longer common practice. Most independent publishers pay royalties as a percentage of <b>net</b> <b>receipts</b> - how <b>net</b> <b>receipts</b> are calculated varies from publisher to publisher. Under this arrangement, the author does not pay anything towards the expense of publication. The costs and financial risk are all carried by the publisher, who will then take the greatest percentage of the receipts. See Compensation for more.|$|R
