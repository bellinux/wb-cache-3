5|$|Mitch {{was also}} {{responsible}} for the loss with all hands of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises' schooner Fantome. The story was recorded in the book The Ship and The Storm by Jim Carrier. The schooner, which was sailing <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, experienced over 50foot (15m) waves and over 100mph (160km/h) winds, causing her to sink {{off the coast of}} Honduras.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in an atom {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E

5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow {{outward from}} the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} {{large and}} rich region for detecting interstellar molecules is Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). This giant molecular cloud lies <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way galaxy {{and is a}} frequent target for new searches. About half of the molecules listed below were first found near Sgr B2, and nearly every other molecule has since been detected in this feature. A rich source of investigation for circumstellar molecules is the relatively nearby star CW Leonis (IRC +10216), where about 50 compounds have been identified.|$|E
5|$|After much discussion, Harrison, who {{coordinated the}} meetings, {{determined}} that a design based on Niemeyer's project 32 and Le Corbusier's project 23 would be developed for the final project. Le Corbusier's project 23 consisted of a large block containing both the Assembly Hall and the Council Chambers <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site with the Secretariat tower emerging as a slab from the south. Niemeyer's plan was closer to that actually constructed, with a distinctive General Assembly building, a long low horizontal block housing the other meeting rooms, and a tall tower for the Secretariat. The complex as built, however, repositioned Niemeyer's General Assembly building {{to the north of}} this tripartite composition. This plan included a public plaza as well.|$|E

At the northern edge of the island, NY324, as signed, terminates at exit20; however, officially, NY324 rejoins I-190 across the Niagara River once again via the North Grand Island Bridge. Now in Niagara Falls, Niagara County, NY324 ends at a complex interchange featuring NY384, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and the LaSalle Expressway on the eastern bank of the river. Farther north, I-190 meets U.S. Route62 (US62) at exit22 and NY182 at exit23.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the higher education programs, Unicamp is also responsible for running and funding two technical high schools, the Technical High School of Campinas (COTUCA) and the Technical High School of Limeira (COTIL). Cotuca was located for 50 years in a historical building <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city built in 1918 which also housed Unicamp {{for a brief period}} before the current campus was built. In 2014 it was transferred to the main campus as the old building went through renovations. Both schools are amongst the best public high schools in the country, and are highly competitive, with admissions done through a selection exam open to middle-school students.|$|E
5|$|<b>Near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{county in}} the town of Sodus, NY104 serves as the {{northern}} terminus of NY88 northwest of the village of Sodus. While NY88 heads east into the village, NY104 bypasses Sodus to the north. East of the village, Ridge Road and NY104 intersect as Ridge Road flips to the north side of NY104. The two highways follow parallel routings southeast toward Alton, where NY104 intersects NY14. East of Alton, the gap between the two widens as Ridge Road veers north to access Sodus Bay. NY104, meanwhile, follows a nearly linear routing into the town of Huron, where it intersects the northern terminus of NY414.|$|E

5|$|The Warren Family Mortuary Chapel is a stone chapel {{built on}} a knoll <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cemetery. It was {{designed}} by Henry Dudley of New York City and built in 1860 in the English country Gothic style, complete with a nave and transept floor plan. A tower was added in 1883, with great care placed on finding building material that matched the earlier structure. The Chapel contains stained glass windows above the altar designed by artist Robert Walter Weir. Former member of the United States House of Representatives Joseph Mabbett Warren (1813–1896) is interred in the chapel.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{thunderstorm}} development. Mature thunderstorms are found <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cluster, while dissipating thunderstorms exist on their downwind side. Multicell storms form as clusters of storms but may then evolve into one or more squall lines. While each cell of the cluster may only last 20minutes, the cluster itself may persist for hours at a time. They often arise from convective updrafts in or near mountain ranges and linear weather boundaries, such as strong cold fronts or troughs of low pressure. These type of storms are stronger than the single-cell storm, yet much weaker than the supercell storm. Hazards with the multicell cluster include moderate-sized hail, flash flooding, and weak tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Weather fronts {{mark the}} {{boundary}} between two masses of air of different temperature, humidity, and densities, and {{are associated with the}} most prominent meteorological phenomena. Strong cold fronts typically feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Such fronts form west of the circulation center and generally move from west to east; warm fronts form east of the cyclone center and are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. Warm fronts move poleward ahead of the cyclone path. Occluded fronts form late in the cyclone life cycle <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone and often wrap around the storm center.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for {{a large part of}} the Deep South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|A weak {{surface area}} of low {{pressure}} detached from a frontal system on August 8 while 1,150miles (1,850km) to the east of Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the county}} line in Lake Luzerne, NY9N begins {{to deviate from}} the Hudson River, {{gradually}} curving to the northeast as it passes through the hamlets of Lake Luzerne, Fourth Lake, and Lake Vanare, {{all of which are}} named for small lakes bearing those names <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> communities. Just northeast of Lake Vanare, NY9N enters the town of Lake George, where it connects to I-87 (the Adirondack Northway) at exit21 and meets US9. Here, it joins its parent route northward toward the village of Lake George. The conjoined routes intersect the northern end of NY9L just south of the village line before becoming Canada Street and entering the village limits upon crossing over West Brook. US9 and NY9N serve as the primary north–south thoroughfare through the village before splitting {{at the north end of}} the village. While US9 continues to the north, NY9N heads northeast along the western edge of Lake George.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, {{a total of six}} or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E
