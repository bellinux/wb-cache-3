Hurley Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC). [...] The DOTS, upgraded and frequently referred to as [...] "DOTS +", permits airlines to save fuel by flying random routes, in contrast to structured routes, and permits the air traffic controller to achieve lateral spacing requirements more efficiently. [...] The DOTS generates flexible oceanic tracks that are optimized for best airspace utilization and best time/fuel efficiency. [...] Flexible tracks are updated twice a day using forecasted winds aloft and separation (vertical and lateral) requirements. [...] The DOTS oceanic traffic display gives a visual presentation of tracks and weather. [...] The DOTS sends traffic advisories and track advisories to users and receives aircraft progress reports from the commercial communications service providers (CCSP). [...] These external data exchanges are achieved through interfaces with the National Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN) Packet Switch Network (PSN) for Position Reports, Air Traffic Management (ATM) messages, Pilot Reports (PIREPS), and the Anchorage FDP2000. [...] An interface to the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) will improve coordination between the oceanic and domestic Traffic Flow Management (TFM) systems/activities. [...] The DOTS Weather Server, installed at the ATCSCC, receives National Weather Service (NWS) wind and temperature data via the Weather and Radar Processor / Weather Information Network Server (WARP/WINS) system. [...] The weather data is then distributed to the ARTCCs via commercially provided Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) telephone lines.

This study investigates the role of short-term memory representation, activated through brief exposure to the spatial layout of an unfamiliar complex environment.

40|$|Desktop Virtual Reality is on {{the rise}} in human {{navigation}} studies. The high controllability of stimuli and the increased possibilities for measurements seem to make it useful addition to navigation research. A major difference between traditional, real world navigation studies and desktop VR studies is the lack of locomotion in desktop VR, which results in reduced sensory input. The consequences this might have on human navigation are not fully known. The aim {{of this study is to}} conclude whether VR is a valid research method for navigation studies by comparing <b>navigation</b> <b>performances</b> between <b>navigation</b> with and without locomotion. Additionally, two new types of VR display were tested to study how these displays influence <b>navigation</b> <b>performances.</b> We assessed route memory performance in four conditions: a real world environment, a desktop virtual environment, a desktop virtual environment with additional directional information (compass) and a hybrid condition, in which participants used locomotion to follow a virtual route. The results confirmed that locomotion is important for acquiring navigational information, and survey knowledge in particular. When choosing to apply VR methods in a navigation study, the implications of this decision therefore have to be considered. Providing additional bearing information in virtual environments does not help to overcome the defunct in survey knowledge acquisition. The hybrid condition, which combines high controllability and measurability with real world locomotion, showed a high validity to real world navigation, indicating it might be a useful navigation research method worthy of additional research and development...|$|R

The <b>navigation</b> <b>performances</b> of four choices (GPS alone, GPS+GLONASS, GPS+Galileo and GPS+GLONASS+Galileo) are evaluated in terms of availability, coverage, and continuity based on simulation. The results show that there are significant improvements in availability, coverage and continuity, by using GPS+GLONASS+Galileo compared with the other hoices.

40|$|With easy-to-be-disposed {{architecture}} and premium <b>navigation</b> <b>performances,</b> polar-coordinate navigationsystem (PCNS) is still widely utilized by modern military navigation systems. Unfortunately, PCNS has very poor electronic counter-counter measures (ECCM) performances, {{due to the}} lack of electronic warfare (EW) considerations during its initial system design. To solve this problem, an improved PCNS (Imp-PCNS) is proposed in this paper to introduce ECCM capabilities to PCNS. The low probability of intercept (LPI) waveforms are utilized instead of regular pulses to reduce the probability of hostile interception. Both the bandwidth and the transmitted power of LPI are designed to generate the signals submerged under the thermal noises at the front ends of enemy receivers. Finally, a kinematic bearing method is proposed to dramatically reduce the possibility of intercept. The principle of kinematic bearing is analyzed in detail. An undistorted observed geometric position (OGP), which is independent ofthe deviation of observing angle, is achieved by controlling the rotation of the antenna array of PCNS beacon.
