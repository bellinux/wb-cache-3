40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>nanofiller</b> surface {{modifications}} and hydrophobicity on the morphology and mechanical {{properties of the}} biomedical TPU nanocomposites was studied. We show that incorporating nanofillers with higher hydrophobicity promotes better dispersion of <b>nanofiller</b> in TPU matrix due to greater interaction between the <b>nanofiller</b> and the hydrophobic PDMS soft segment in this ElastEon TPU system. The nanocomposite with the most hydrophobic surface modification demonstrates the best <b>nanofiller</b> dispersion and intercalation and hence resulted in an overall best mechanical and thermomechanical properties when incorporated in 2 wt%.

30|$|However, it {{is noted}} that the flame {{retarding}} efficiencies of these <b>nanofillers</b> in thermosetting resins are not pronounced as theirs in thermoplastic resins. In our previous work, graphene oxide (GO) was incorporated to epoxy resin (EP), and the resultant nanocomposites only exhibited a decrease of 16 % on the PHRR at the 1  wt% content of GO compare to that of EP [14]. Guo et al. showed the similar phenomenon in graphene/EP, which had a decrease of 23 % on the PHRR of epoxy at the 1  wt% content of graphene compare to that of EP. The reasons behind this phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} effect of <b>nanofillers</b> on the crosslinking structure as well as the roles of <b>nanofillers</b> on combustion of polymer. On the one hand, due to the comparatively high crosslinking densities of thermosetting resins, the addition of <b>nanofillers</b> is difficult to significantly change the crosslinking density which plays a determinate role in improving the flame retardancy [15, 16]. On the other hand, the mechanism of <b>nanofillers</b> on flame retardancy of polymer is singular, which mainly depend on their barrier effect [17, 18] and then hard to exert high modified efficiency. Obviously, comparing with these attractive progresses in thermoplastics, the modified efficiencies of <b>nanofillers</b> in thermosetting resins needed to be further enhanced. Many efforts have been dedicated in modifying <b>nanofillers</b> with other flame retardants [12, 19].

Molecular dynamics simulation method was used to investigate the effect of <b>nanofillers</b> on fracture strength and energy dissipation of polymers, including <b>nanofillers</b> contents, interaction strength between the <b>nanofillers</b> and polymer chains, relaxation time and geometry of the <b>nanofillers.</b> Molecular dynamics simulation results revealed that the addition of layered silicate can improve the fracture strength of polymers.

For these polymers, which Tgs are lower than room temperature, such as polyurethane, or nearby (or equal to) room temperature, such as Nylons, the nanoplatelets can always enhance the mechanical properties. However, for these polymers, which Tgs are higher than room temperature, such as epoxy and polystyrene, the addition of the nanoplatelets does not work well for toughening these polymers. If one wants the nanoplatelets to be working for toughening these polymers, it is necessary to build up a stress relaxation interface between the polymer matrix and the nanoplatelets, such as the modification of the surfaces of <b>nanofillers</b> using coupling agents. When the relaxation time of the polymer is long enough, the incorporation of <b>nanofillers</b> into the polymer will cause the polymer to become more brittle. This result explains why the toughness of epoxy/ clay nanocomposites becomes poor. The simulation results clearly revealed that' the orientation of nanoplatelets is reversible at low strain of 50...|$|R
