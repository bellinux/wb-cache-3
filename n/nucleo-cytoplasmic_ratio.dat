40|$|Graduation date: 1974 During {{karyokinesis}} in the ciliate, Tetrahymena pyriformis, strain GL-I, an extranuclear chromatin body (ECB) {{is frequently}} formed as an excluded mass {{between the two}} dividing daughter macronuclei. The formation and fate of ECB's were followed by means of Feu lgen, toluidine blue 0, and euchrysine staining and autoradiography (³H-thymidine). The following results were obtained: 1) Fifty-one percent of the dividing cells in a log growth phase culture produce one (43 %) or more (8 %) ECB's. 2) Newly formed ECB's respond to stains and extractions as do macronuclei. 3) Single ECB's assort randomly into either daughter cell. 4) By the completion of cytokinesis, most newly formed ECB's have undergone changes in morphology and stainability. 5) The ECB's gradually disappear during the cell cycle: the percentage of daughter cells with recently formed ECB's remains relatively constant at 30 % for the first 35 minutes and then decreases gradually to about 10 % just before division 2 (at 205 minutes). 6) The remaining ECB's are carried through division 2, and are found in 5 % of the subsequent G₁ cells. 7) Most of these ECB's disappear during the next cell cycle, although some are carried into division 3. 8) ECB's once formed do not incorporate labeled thymidine {{at any time in}} the cell cycle. ECB's in log growth phase G₁ cells placed into starvation medium (inorganic salts) disappear rapidly and almost completely (from 30 % at division to 1 % by 90 minutes as compared to 30 % to 15 % in cells maintained in nutrient medium). Almost all (88 %) heat synchronized cells form at least one ECB at the first synchronized division (21 % form two), resulting in 48 % of the daughter cells with an ECB. This value drops rapidly to 8 % within 80 minutes and to 5 % just prior to the second synchronized division (at 105 minutes) and then rises to 55 % following this division. The extra percent of ECB's is due to the small carryover from the first division. The loss of ECB's probably results from intracellular digestion with subsequent reincorporation or elimination of the breakdown products. These and other data suggest that ECB formation is a factor in the maintenance of some optimum <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> mass <b>ratio</b> which may be involved in the control of the cell cycle...|$|R

The knowledge of morphological characteristics of exfoliative cells in gastric cancer has been analysed in more details, however, the classification of cytodiagnosis depends upon routine morphological findings, which is different in different individual experiences of cytology. The {{is the reason why}} the objectivity of classification is required. The present study was aimed to the statistical approach for the purpose of establishment of standardization in cyto{{diagnosis of}} gastric cancer. Materials were obtained from resected stomach of 140 cases of gastric cancer, 140 cases of peptic ulcer, 20 cases of gastric polyp and 30 cases of gastritis. Three smear specimens were made in each case and stained by Papanicolaou's method. In the statistical analysis of morphological findings of exfoliative celles of these cases, the results as follows were obtained. 1 As the criteria of malignancy, following twelve findings were usefull and highly significant; crowding of cells and nuclei, irregularity of pattern, anisokaryosis, pleomorphism of nuclei, large cytoplasmic vacuolization, enlargement of nuclei, increase of <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio,</b> irregularity in nuclear outline, thickening of nuclear membrane, chromatin condensation, enlargement of nucleoli, increase of nucleoli. 2 There were no statistically significant cytological findings between early cancer and advanced cancer. 3 Statistically, the difference of mean numbers of cytological findings between cancer group and benign group was significant. 4 When trial statistic diagnosis by the use of above mentioned twelve findings was performed, the frequency of incorrect diagnosis were 2. 1 % in likelihood method, 3. 3 % in discriminant function method and 2. 7 % in simple mumbering method of cytological findings, respectively. 5 The most relevant combination of cytological findings was nuclear pleomorphism and increase of <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio.</b> 6 The source of incorrect diagnosis or borderline cases were mainly narrow exposed carcinoma simplex or early cancer.

40|$|In Xenopus embryos, {{cell cycle}} {{elongation}} and degradation of Cdc 25 A (a Cdk 2 Tyr 15 phosphatase) occur naturally at the midblastula transition (MBT), {{at which time}} a physiological DNA replication checkpoint {{is thought to be}} activated by the exponentially increased <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio.</b> Here we show that the checkpoint kinase Chk 1, but not Cds 1 (Chk 2), is activated transiently at the MBT in a maternal/zygotic gene product-regulated manner and is essential for cell cycle elongation and Cdc 25 A degradation at this transition. A constitutively active form of Chk 1 can phosphorylate Cdc 25 A in vitro and can target it rapidly for degradation in pre-MBT embryos. Intriguingly, for this degradation, however, Cdc 25 A also requires a prior Chk 1 -independent phosphorylation at Ser 73. Ectopically expressed human Cdc 25 A can be degraded {{in the same way as}} Xenopus Cdc 25 A. Finally, Cdc 25 A degradation at the MBT is a prerequisite for cell viability at later stages. Thus, the physiological replication checkpoint is activated transiently at the MBT by developmental cues, and activated Chk 1, only together with an unknown kinase, targets Cdc 25 A for degradation to ensure later development...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} HMG-D, an {{abundant}} chromosomal protein, {{is associated with}} condensed chromatin structures {{during the first six}} nuclear cleavage cycles of the developing Drosophila embryo and that histone H 1 is absent from these same structures. As H 1 accumulates from nuclear division 7 onwards, the nuclei become more compact and transcriptionally active. This compaction is paralleled by a reduction in size of mitotic chromatin. In addition, we find a striking correlation between the switch in HMG-D:H 1 ratios and the changes that occur between nuclear cycles 8 and 13 that are collectively termed the mid-blastula transition. This transition is characterized by an increase in the nuclear cycle times, a change in the <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio,</b> and a 5 - to 20 -fold decrease in nuclear volume. We propose that this is a direct consequence of a re-organization of chromatin from a less condensed state with HMG-D to a more condensed state with H 1. We argue that HMG-D, either by itself or in conjunction with other chromosomal proteins, induces a condensed state of chromatin that is distinct from, and less compact than the H 1 -containing 30 nm fibre and that this state of chromatin could facilitate rapid nuclear cycles...|$|E

Methods and results: WHO criteria were applied to bone marrow biopsy specimens by two pathologists who then reclassified 127 cases as 102 ET (80. 3 %), 18 prefibrotic–early PM (14. 2 %) and seven fibrotic PM (5. 5 %). In 45 cases (35 %), the final diagnosis was only reached by consensus. The megakaryocytic criteria that best discriminated between ET and prefibrotic–early PM were an increased <b>nucleo–cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio,</b> presence of cloudlike nuclei, hyperchromatic-dysplastic nuclei, paratrabecular megakaryocytes and tight clusters. A histological score discriminated between ET (score ≤ 3) and PM (score ≥ 6), but 21 cases showed an intermediate ambiguous score. No significant differences were observed at diagnosis and at follow-up (median time 93  months) for thrombosis, major haemorrhage, laboratory data, transformation into overt myeloid metaplasia and survival.

Vitellocytes are randomly distributed into the vitellarium, although fully mature vitellocytes are found {{in the center of the}} follicle. During maturation, the <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases, whereas synthetic activity increases.

Oocyte maturation takes place in four stages: oogonia, primary oocytes, developing oocytes, and mature oocytes. Developing oocytes enter the zygotene-pachytene stage of the first meiotic division recognizable by the presence of synaptonemal complexes in the nucleoplasm. The low protein composition of mature oocytes associated with the large nutrient content of vitellocytes of C. metoecus enables us to consider that oocytes do not take part of the nutrition of the future embryo of the miracidium.

Methods 4 groups of 10 images each were selected at random from 68 consensus images coming from 80 archival cervical biopsies, normal (n = 10), CIN 1 (n = 10), CIN 2 (n = 10), CIN 3 (n = 10). Representative images of lesions were captured from the microscopic slides and {{were analyzed using}} mathematical morphology, with special reference toVoronoï tessellation and Delaunay triangulation. Epithelium surface, nuclear and cytoplasm area, triangle edge and area, total and upper nuclear index were precisely measured in each lesion, and discriminant coefficients were calculated therewith.

A histogram ratio was also automatically established between total nuclei and upper nuclei on top of differentiated epithelium. With the latter two ratios added to the <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio,</b> a cervical score able to classify CIN is proposed.

After TSH injection, the relative volume of the thyroid parenchyme was enhanced by 45 % compared to that in untreated dwarf mice, and the radius of the follicles and follicular lumina increased by 50 % and 48 %, respectively. The major effect of TSH was an increase in cellular volume (+ 93 %), and the mean number of cells in the average follicle was doubled, without a {{reduction in the number of}} follicles. GH had almost the same effect as TSH on the relative volume of the parenchyme and caused the radius of follicles and of the follicular lumina to increase by 61 % and 69 %, respectively. However, GH did not influence cellular volume. Its primary effect was to stimulate cellular division (cells were increased about 5 times in the average follicle) and to reduce the number of follicles. The <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio</b> increased with GH but decreased with TSH. T 4 serum levels increased to a much lesser extent with GH than with TSH, while normal values were obtained with both hormones together.

40|$|Abstract Background The cell {{cycles of}} the Xenopus laevis embryo undergo {{extensive}} remodeling {{beginning at the}} midblastula transition (MBT) of early development. Cell divisions 2 – 12 consist of rapid cleavages without gap phases or cell cycle checkpoints. Some remodeling events depend upon a critical <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio,</b> whereas others rely on a maternal timer controlled by cyclin E/Cdk 2 activity. One key event that occurs at the MBT is the degradation of maternal Wee 1, a negative regulator of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity. Results In order to assess the effect of Wee 1 on embryonic cell cycle remodeling, Wee 1 mRNA was injected into one-cell stage embryos. Overexpression of Wee 1 caused cell cycle delay and tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdks prior to the MBT. Furthermore, overexpression of Wee 1 disrupted key developmental events that normally occur at the MBT such as the degradation of Cdc 25 A, cyclin E, and Wee 1. Overexpression of Wee 1 also resulted in post-MBT apoptosis, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdks and persistence of cyclin E/Cdk 2 activity. To determine whether Cdk 2 was required specifically {{for the survival of}} the embryo, the cyclin E/Cdk 2 inhibitor, Δ 34 -Xic 1, was injected in embryos and also shown to induce apoptosis. Conclusion Taken together, these data suggest that Wee 1 triggers apoptosis through the disruption of the cyclin E/Cdk 2 timer. In contrast to Wee 1 and Δ 34 -Xic 1, altering Cdks by expression of Chk 1 and Chk 2 kinases blocks rather than promotes apoptosis and causes premature degradation of Cdc 25 A. Collectively, these data implicate Cdc 25 A as a key player in the developmentally regulated program of apoptosis in X. laevis embryos. </p...|$|E

No squamous differentiation was noted, and the squamous epithelium immediately adjacent to the adenocarcinoma showed slight perinuclear halos suggestive of PV-related changes. The tumor cells showed diffuse staining for A 1 -A 3 pan-keratins, but staining for keratin 7 (CK 7) clearly separated the adenocarcinoma from the adjacent non-neoplastic squamous epithelium. Keratin 19, keratin 20 and MUC- 5 AC were negative. Immunohistochemical staining performed with a monoclonal antibody against papillomaviruses evidenced a strong nuclear immunoreactivity only in glandular epithelium similarly to CK 7. DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue was tested by PCR using degenerated primers (FAP 59 - 64), amplifying common gene region of papillomaviral L 11. The PCR result was an amplicon of 480 bp. Sequence similarity analysis with the BLAST tool of the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Papillomavirus Episteme tool showed that this fragments belongs to new putative PVs, not yet characterized for rhinoceros. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} case of Papillomavirus-Associated non-salivary gland-type adenocarcinoma arising in the base of the tongue in a captive white rhinoceros...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To prospectively {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cellularity in lung cancer. METHODS: Sixty patients histopathologically confirmed with lung cancer (41 men, 19 women) underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the chest (with b values of 50 and 1000 s/mm 2). The median mean ADC (ADC mean) value and median minimum ADC (ADC min) value within each primary tumour were calculated and compared with the median <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio</b> (NCR), which was selected to represent the cellularity. The correlation between the NCR and ADC mean/ADC min was calculated with SPSS 18. 0 software. RESULTS: The mean ADC mean values, ADC min values and median NCR were (1. 07 ± 0. 12) × 10 (- 3) mm 2 /s, (0. 86 ± 0. 14) × 10 (- 3) mm 2 /s, and (14. 9 ± 2. 6) %, respectively, in adenocarcinoma; (0. 88 ± 0. 10) × 10 (- 3) mm 2 /s, (0. 73 ± 0. 12) × 10 (- 3)) mm 2 /s, and (20. 6 ± 4. 4) %, respectively, in squamous cell carcinoma; and (0. 89 ± 0. 13) × 10 (- 3) mm 2 /s, (0. 67 ± 0. 13) × 10 (- 3) mm 2 /s, and (18. 3 ± 3. 5) %, respectively in small cell lung cancer. The NCR of squamous cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer is greater than that of adenocarcinoma (P < 0. 01 and P = 0. 002, respectively). There was an inverse relationship between ADC mean/NCR and ADC min/NCR (r = - 0. 60, P = 0. 001 and r = - 0. 47, P < 0. 001, respectively). CONCLUSION: There is a significant inverse relationship between tumour cellularity and ADC in lung cancer. However, tumour cellularity most likely is not the sole determinant of the ADC...|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{measurement}} of epithelium differentiation and classification of cervical intraneoplasia by computerized image analysis Michel Jondet*, Régis Agoli-Agbo and Louis Dehennin Background: The feasibility of evaluating an objective grading of cervical intraneoplasia lesions (CIN) is attempted using an automatic computerized system able to measure several valuable parameters with special reference to epithelium differentiation. Methods: 4 groups of 10 images each were selected at random from 68 consensus images coming from 80 archival cervical biopsies, normal (n = 10), CIN 1 (n = 10), CIN 2 (n = 10), CIN 3 (n = 10). Representative images of lesions were captured from the microscopic slides and {{were analyzed using}} mathematical morphology, with special reference toVoronoï tessellation and Delaunay triangulation. Epithelium surface, nuclear and cytoplasm area, triangle edge and area, total and upper nuclear index were precisely measured in each lesion, and discriminant coefficients were calculated therewith. A dilation/erosion coefficient was automatically defined using triangle edge length and nuclear radius {{in order to measure}} the epithelium ratio of differentiation. A histogram ratio was also automatically established between total nuclei and upper nuclei on top of differentiated epithelium. With the latter two ratios added to the <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio,</b> a cervical score able to classify CIN is proposed. Results: There is a quasi-linear increase of mean cervical score values between normal epithelium and CIN 3 : (27) for normal epithelium, (51) for CIN 1, (78) for CIN 2 and (100) for CIN 3, with significant differences (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Our results highlight the possibility of applying a cervical score for the automatic grading of CIN lesions and thereby assisting the pathologist for improvement of grading. The automatic measure of epithelium differentiation ratio appears to be a new interesting parameter in computerized image analysis of cervical lesions...|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} experimental {{data on the}} impact of psychoemotional stress on cytological, morphometric, immunological and biochemical indicators in 7 – 11 year old children. We examined 100 children of primary school age, who were divided into the main group (50 children who had been resettled from the war zone in Eastern Ukraine) and the control group (50 children, who live in Ivano-Frankivs’k). We used morphological (light-optical and electromicroscopic) and mor phometric analysis of buccal epithelium and peripheral blood erythrocytes, biochemical methods for identifying the products of peroxidation of lipids, ceruloplasmin and ferritin according to widely used methods. Morphological methods revealed that under psychoemotional stress, the size of the nuclei and buccal epithelial cells significantly decreases, and their <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio</b> changes towards increase in the share of cytoplasm, and the indicators of coefficient of buccal epithelial cell shape indicate significant deformation of those cells. Similar changes were observed in the erythrocytes of peripheral blood. In the blood, we observed an increase in the CD 95 + concentration of lymphocytes. Clearly manifested changes in morphological and morphometric indicators of buccal epithelium and erythrocytes when there is an increase in the CD 95 + level of lymphocytes indicate the development of a systematic apoptosis reaction of the studied cells in the condition of psychoemotional stress. Also we observed clearly manifested changes in the coefficient of erythrocytes’ shape, their size and perimeter, {{increase in the number of}} reversibly and irreversibly changed cells, which with increase in free radical oxidation, indicates disorders in the organism’s antioxidant protection system in general and requires a pathogenically grounded programme of treating complications related to psychoemotional stress among 7 – 11  year old children who were resettled fom the combat zone in Eastern Ukraine...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{autophagy}} involves {{the formation of}} autophagosomes, double-membrane structures that encapsulate cytosol. Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC 3) was the first protein shown to specifically label autophagosomal membranes in mammalian cells, and subsequently EGFP-LC 3 {{has become one of}} the most widely utilized reporters of autophagy. Although LC 3 is currently thought to function primarily in the cytosol, the site of autophagosome formation, EGFP-LC 3 often appears to be enriched in the nucleoplasm relative to the cytoplasm in published fluorescence images. However, the nuclear pool of EGFP-LC 3 has not been specifically studied in previous reports, and mechanisms by which LC 3 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm are currently unknown. In this study, we therefore investigated the regulation of the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of EGFP-LC 3 in living cells. By quantitative fluorescence microscopy analysis, we demonstrate that soluble EGFP-LC 3 is indeed enriched in the nucleus relative to the cytoplasm in two commonly studied cell lines, COS- 7 and HeLa. Although LC 3 contains a putative nuclear export signal (NES), inhibition of active nuclear export or mutation of the NES had no effect on the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of EGFP-LC 3. Furthermore, FRAP analysis indicates that EGFP-LC 3 undergoes limited passive nucleo-cytoplasmic transport under steady state conditions, and that the diffusional mobility of EGFP-LC 3 was substantially slower in the nucleus and cytoplasm than predicted for a freely diffusing monomer. Induction of autophagy led to a visible decrease in levels of soluble EGFP-LC 3 relative to autophagosome-bound protein, but had only modest effects on the <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio</b> or diffusional mobility of the remaining soluble pools of EGFP-LC 3. We conclude that the enrichment of soluble EGFP-LC 3 in the nucleus is maintained independently of active nuclear export or induction of autophagy. Instead, incorporation of soluble EGFP-LC 3 into large macromolecular complexes within both the cytoplasm and nucleus may prevent its rapid equilibrium between the two compartments...|$|E
40|$|The spinal {{delivery}} of the cholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine yields analgesia and augments the analgesic effect of alpha- 2 (- 2) agonist. To assess its activity, histological and pharmacological studies were designed to define its effect in two species; rats and cats. Pharmacological assessment of intrathecally injected (it) neostigmine in cats showed a gradual increase in mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) at doses 2 ­ 16 g /kg while a decrease in MBP and HR occurred at doses 32 ­ 64 g /kg. The intrathecal injection of atropine and phentolamine abolished the increase in MBP and HR produced by (it) neostigmine (4 g /kg). In spinal cat preparation (it) neostigmine produced rapid rise in MBP at small (4 g /kg) and large doses (64 g /kg). In this study neostigmine counteracts the hypotensive effect and bradycardia produced by intrathecal injection of - 2 agonist clonidine. Histological study was performed on rats. They were divided into 5 groups representing control and 4 groups treated by neostigmine at 25, 50, 75 and 100 g/kg. After each injection, the animals were assessed for general behavior, and function. Arousal, motor coordination and motor tone measurement (A, MC and MT) revealed that Intrathecal injection of neostigmine resulted in dose-dependent decreased arousal, and motor coordination, and dose-dependent increase in motor tone. The quantitative histological and cytochemical data demonstrated an initial increase in the <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio</b> of the anterior horn cells up to 75 ug/kg followed by a decline in 100 ug/kg- treated animals. The cytoplasmic RNA content of the anterior horn cells showed {{an increase in the}} optical density that reached a maximum at 50 ug/kg followed by a decline at higher doses. The Golgi bodies increased in the cytoplasm of 25 ug/kg treated animals, the level became constant up til 75 ug/kg, and started to decline at 100 ug/kg. There was no change in the quantity of the myelinated nerve fibers, however, there was a dose dependent decline in their stainability with silver. In conclusion:These results provide an evidence that the adverse events from neostigmine injected intrathecally appear to be affected by the dose injected which could be important in clinical practic...|$|E
40|$|The primary gene defects of {{hereditary}} neuromuscular disorders have not, as yet, been determined. Research {{has contributed}} much {{to our understanding}} of many aspects of these diseases, but since this has been directed towards the secondary phenomena, the exact role of the nucleus in the pathogenesis of these genetic disorders remains unclear. It was felt that a study of the motor neurone and muscle nucleus in development and disease might reveal the extent of its participation in some of these disease processes. 1. A quantitative histochemical and histometric study of the developing anterior horn cell nucleus during fetal life was undertaken. The result suggested that the 12 th to 14 th week period is critical for the differentiation of the spinal motor neurone. 2. In contrast to this, a similar study of the deve¬ loping muscle cell nuclei revealed no major changes in muscle nuclear size or composition. During normal post-natal muscle growth {{an increase in the number}} of nuclei per muscle fibre seems to be responsible for the maintenance of a constant <b>nucleo-cytoplasmic</b> <b>ratio.</b> 3. The nuclear size of multinucleated myoblasts arising from both normal and dystrophic muscle in tissue culture was measured. Myoblasts from dystrophic muscle exhibited larger nuclei than those from normal muscle. 4. An increase in muscle nuclear size was also detected in a number of muscle samples from male fetuses at risk for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Both of these findings suggest possible changes in the nucleo-cytoplasmic relationship. 5. In an attempt to elucidate the extent of the parti¬ cipation of the muscle nucleus in the pathogenic process of a number of characteristic neuromuscular disorders, the nuclear size and/or the number of nuclei per cross-sectioned muscle fibre, were estimated. An increased nuclear size was observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and an increase in the number of nuclei was detected in chronic neurogenic atrophies, in diabetic neuropathy and in myotonic dystrophy. Such a finding would seem to indicate a fundamental difference in the response of the muscle fibre nucleus to the neurogenic and myopathic processes. 6. In addition, the growth of the human cervical vertebral canal and spinal cord during normal fetal development was studied. The results suggested that these two parts of the developing body exhibit the same developmental pattern. The rate of this parallel growth is lower than that of the body as a whole, but similar to that reported for the brain. In conclusion, although the techniques used did not reveal a direct relationship in the developmental pattern of anterior horn cell nuclei and myonuclei, they did provide normal values for comparison with data obtained from diseased neural and muscle tissue. The finding that in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (from tissue culture, fetuses at risk and juvenile biopsies) the muscle nuclei are enlarged, points to an underlying difference from various neuropathies in which the nuclei are increased in number...|$|E
