40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve the availability of phosphorus (P) from rock phosphate (RP) through feeding, mixing and composting manure. The experiment was conducted as a 3 × 2 split-plot design. Manure was collected from 12 Boran steers (200 ± 4. 5 kg live weight) fed a basal diet of Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) at 2. 5 % body weight on a dry matter (DM) basis. The main plot treatments were (i) manure from steers supplemented with 113 g Busumbu rock phosphate (BRP) per day (FBRP), (ii) manure from steers not supplemented with BRP, feces mixed with 113 g BRP per day (MBRP) and (iii) manure from steers not supplemented with BRP and feces not mixed with BRP (CONT). The sub-plots comprised composting the manure either (i) mixed with 440 g of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw per kg fresh feces (WS) or (ii) without straw (WOS). The manure was composted in 200 L plastic bins for 90 days. After 90 days, P availability was evaluated (i) by aerobic laboratory incubation at 25 °C for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks and (ii) by greenhouse agronomic evaluation study using maize (Zea Mays L.) as the test crop in either a humic <b>Nitosol</b> or an Andosol. In the laboratory incubation study, resin P was higher (p FBRP-WS, <b>Nitosol</b> > MBRP-WS, Andosol > MBRP-WS, <b>Nitosol</b> > FBRP-WOS, Andosol > FBRP-WOS, <b>Nitosol.</b> In the greenhouse evaluation, maize crops in the WS compost had higher (p < 0. 05) biomass yield than the reference fertilizer, triple super phosphate, (173 % versus 196 %; Andosol and <b>Nitosol,</b> respectively). The biomass yield and P uptake relative agronomic effectiveness (RAE) for WS compost was also higher (p < 0. 05) than that of WOS compost (184 versus 3 ± 0. 8 and 242 versus 162 ± 0. 2, WS and WOS, biomass yield and P uptake, respectively). <b>Nitosol</b> biomass yield and P uptake RAE were also higher (p < 0. 05) than for the Andosol (99 versus 88 ± 0. 8 and 332 versus 72 ± 0. 2, <b>Nitosol</b> and Andosol, biomass yield and P uptake, respectively). The results show that P-enriched composting in the presence of wheat straw significantly increased P availability and increased plant growth. However, in terms of plant growth, there was no additional benefit of first feeding the RP to steers before composting the manure because most of the RP fed seem to have been utilized by the animal...|$|E

The total porosity increased from the cultivated land followed by the forest land to the grazing land and decreased along the soil depths of the study area. This trend could be attributed to the low OM content of the cultivated land and the subsurface soil depth and the increase in bulk density with soil depth, respectively. Finding reported by Negassa (2001) also indicated lower total porosity in the cultivated land and subsoil depths was a result of low OM in the Dystric <b>Nitosols</b> of Bako area.

The experiment was carried Out under field conditions on a Rhodic <b>Nitosol,</b> in Botucatu, São Paulo State, Brazil. Three doses of single superphosphate (0, 40 and 80 kg. ha(- 1) of P(2) O(5)) and three of potassium chloride (0, 20 and 40 kg ha(- 1) of K(2) O) were tested as a factorial (3 x 3), in a randomized complete block design, with four replicates. The fertilizers were applied in the sowing row. Ammonium sulphate was supplied for all plots (20 kg ha(- 1) of N applied at sowing and 30 kg. ha(- 1) after tillering stage). The concentrations of Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in the flag leaf and the P and K concentrations in the grain were increased by phosphate fertilizer application. The potassic fertilization {{had no effect on}} the concentrations of nutrients in the flag leaf and grains of black-oat...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi determinar a mobilidade do herbicida sulfentrazone em duas classes de solos (Nitossolo Vermelho e Neossolo Quartzarênico), em função de índices pluviométricos crescentes, sendo, portanto, influenciado pelas propriedades químicas e físicas dos solos com diferentes teores de ferro. Em tubos de PVC de 10 cm de diâmetro por 50 cm de comprimento, preenchidos com os solos e saturados com água a 65 % (p/p), foi aplicado o sulfentrazone (800 g ha- 1). Na seqüência, foram simuladas chuvas diárias de 10 mm até atingir os índices pluviométricos de 30, 60 e 90 mm. Os tubos de PVC foram então desmontados - semeando-se Sorghum bicolor nas profundidades correspondentes de 2, 5; 7, 5; 12, 5; 17, 5; 22, 5; e 30, 0 cm da superfície do tubo - e mantidos em casa de vegetação por 15 dias, para avaliação da germinação e do crescimento inicial das plântulas. No final do experimento foram avaliadas as alterações morfofisiológicas que caracterizavam os efeitos tóxicos do produto, além de se medir o comprimento da parte aérea até a última lígula visível e a fitomassa seca das plantas. Quando sob precipitação de 90 mm no Neossolo Quartzarênico, o sulfentrazone formou uma banda de arraste de até 12, 5 cm e, no Nitossolo Vermelho, até os 7, 5 cm. The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} mobility of sulfentrazone in two soil classes (Red <b>Nitosol</b> and Quartzarenic Neosol), as a function of increasing rainfall indices, being the herbicide was influenced by the chemical and physical properties of the soils with different iron contents. Sulfentrazone (800 g ha- 1) was applied on 10 cm diameter x 50 cm long PVC tubes, filled with the soils and saturated with water at 65 % (w/w). Subsequently, 10 mm rainfall events were simulated daily until 30, 60 and 90 mm rainfall indices were reached. The PVC tubes were then disassembled and Sorghum bicolor seeds were sowed on soil at depths of 2. 5; 7. 5; 12. 5; 17. 5; 22. 5 and 30. 0 cm from the tube surface and maintained in a greenhouse for 15 days for germination and initial growth evaluation. In the end of the experiment the morphophysiological changes, which characterized the toxic effects of the product, were evaluated. The length of the shoot, up to the last visible ligule and the plant dry biomass were also measured. When submitted to a 90 mm rainfall in the Quartzarenic Neosol, sulfentrazone formed a band that percolated down to 12, 5 cm and in the Red <b>Nitosol,</b> down to 7, 5 cm...|$|E
40|$|This work studied {{alterations}} {{of physical}} properties of a distroferric red <b>nitosol</b> due to millet (Pennisetum americanum) covering, {{with or without}} liming, in a no-tillage system during the agricultural years of 1999 / 2000 and 2000 / 2001, using soybean and corn as culture succession. 6 m× 10 m plots, with and without millet as vegetal covering, received only one initial superficial application of limestone, 3. 1 t ha- 1 {{in the first half}} of each plot in order to obtain 70 % base saturation (V), after the desiccation of the millet. Some physical properties as soil density, aggregate stability, > 2 mm aggregate proportion, macro and micro porosity were analyzed whereas the chemical analysis determined Ca and Mg macro nutrients, organic matter, soil pH and H+Al. Millet vegetal residues and surface liming did not alter soil density nor the average weight diameter (AWD), > 2 mm aggregate, soil macro porosity and organic matter content, twenty-four months after the no-tillage system implantation for studied experimental conditions. Soil micro porosity was significantly affected in layers deeper than 0. 20 m, in treatment with millet and limestone. Calcium, magnesium and H + Al contents and the soil pH values suffered significant alterations in superficial layer, between 0 - 0. 05 m...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{techniques}} and tools can assist {{not only in}} the prediction of soil properties, such as soil moisture, but also in planning the use and management of areas for agriculture and, or, environmental purposes. In this sense, this work aimed to study wetness indexes methods, defining the spatial resolution and selecting the estimation method that best correlates with water content data measured in the field, evaluating even moisture at different soil depths and seasons. This study was developed in a landscape with strongly undulated relief and covered with <b>Nitosols</b> at the summit and upper middle third, and Argisols at the low middle third, ranging in altitude from 845 to 890 m, located in the southern state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. It were performed analyses of Pearson linear correlation between soil moisture determined in the field, at depths of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 100 cm and the water storage in 0 - 100 cm depth, and the topographic and SAGA wetness indexes, TWI and SWI, respectively, obtained from digital elevation models at different spatial resolutions. In most studied conditions, the TWI with resolution of 10 m provided better results, particularly for the dry season. In this study, only the depth of 100 cm resulted in a significant and positive correlation, suggesting that the moisture levels are suitable for water dynamic studies in the subsurface, assisting in studies of hydrological dynamics and planning the soil use and management, especially for perennial plants with deeper root systems...|$|R
40|$|The Guarani Aquiferous System is Latina America’s biggest strategical {{freshwater}} {{reserve and}} one of the world’s biggest aquifer systems, with approximately 70 % of its area located in Brazil. The recharging areas and adjacent areas are regions of natural water infiltration, with high vulnerability. In these areas there are different agricultural production systems {{and some of them are}} intensive systems. The objective of this work was to evaluate the land suitability of the watershed of the Espraiado stream, Ribeirão Preto-SP, located on the recharging area of the Guarani Aquifer, considering the potentialities of lands and waters in the studied region. The area of the watershed is approximately 4, 131 ha, with predominance of sugar cane culture. The data base project was constructed in the Geographic Information System (GIS) Idrisi 32. The land suitability evaluation was done considering the intensive agricultural production system predominant in the watershed, adjusted for the vulnerability of the areas of recharge and for the methodology of SIG. In the watershed, Oxysols and <b>Nitosols</b> are dominant, with good or regular aptitude for cultures in intensive agricultural systems. The presence of Quartzipsamments is also observed, and it occurs in small band. These soils play an important role in the direct recharge of the water-bearing due to its high water permeability. The land suitability evaluation in Guarani Aquifer must consider the soils potentialities and the impact the agricultural use can cause in the quantity and the quality of the infiltrated water...|$|R
40|$|There is {{comparatively}} limited {{information in}} the humid tropics {{on the surface and}} sub-surface permeability of: (i) forests which have been impacted by multi-decades of human occupancy and (ii) forestation of land in various states of degradation. Even less is known about the dominant stormflow pathways for these respective scenarios. We sampled field saturated hydraulic conductivity, K* at 23 sites at four depths (0 m, n = 166), (0. 10 m, n = 139), 0. 45 – 0. 60 m, n = 117, (1. 35 – 1. 50 m, n = 117) under less disturbed forest (Forest), disturbed production forest of various local species (Degraded Forest) and tree-plantations (Acacia auriculiformes, 7 – 10 years old, Tectona grandis, � 25 – 30 years old, Casuarina equisetifolia, 12 years old) in the Uttar Kannada district, Karnataka, India, in the Western Ghats. The sampling strategy was also undertaken across three physiographic blocks and under three main soil types. Subsequently the determined K* were then linked with rainfall intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) characteristics to infer the dominant stormflow pathways. The Degraded Forest shows an order of magnitude decline in K* at the surface as result of human impacts at decadal to century time scales. The lowest surface permeability is associated with the Degraded Forests over the Laterite (Eutric <b>Nitosols</b> and Acrisols) and Red soils (Eutric <b>Nitosols)</b> and infiltration-excess overland flow, IOF probably occurs. Further there is a progressive decline in K* with depth in these soils supporting Degraded Forests. The A. auriculiformes plantations over the Red and Lateritic soils are progressively restoring the near-surface K*, but their K* still remain quite low when compared to the less disturbed forest permeability. Consequently these plantations still retain the ‘memory’ from the previous degraded state. In contrast the permeability of the Black soils (Vertisols) are relatively insensitive to T. grandis plantations and this soil group has a very low K*, irrespective of land cover, so that IOF likely prevails. Overall, the Laterites are the most variable in K* when compared to the other soil groups. Thus when compared to other studies, IOF is probably more prevalent in this region. More especially so, when taking into account the marked reduction in surface K* during the wet season when compared to dry season measurements. In addition, we have demonstrated the potential for the ‘infiltration – trade-off’ hypothesis to be realized in this landscape under certain conditions of land degradation and restoration. It is most relevant to the combination of degraded sites and A. auriculiformes plantations on Red or Laterite soils using the less disturbed forests as the baseline. The intensity of forest use and effects of monoculture plantations on soil ecology (relative to native, mixed forests) {{is likely to be the}} critical factor in affecting surface K* over time. Predicted changes in the intensity of rain events in the future is likely to enhance overland flow on degraded sites on all soils and especially on Black soils, and restoration efforts by all stake-holders, preferably using native or non-invasive species, are needed to address this concern...|$|R
