It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear." [...] She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately {{decided to take the}} part. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, series co-creator Ryan Murphy stated that he had told Connie Britton, early on, that her character Vivien would die in the first season. [...] "We've really had the whole season mapped out from the beginning," [...] he said.

So, yes, I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series." ...|$|E
