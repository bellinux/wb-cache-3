In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki forgoes {{traditional}} screenplays in his productions, instead {{developing the}} film's narrative as he designs the storyboards. [...] "We <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the story will go {{but we just}} keep working on the film as it develops," [...] he said. In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods, drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in several of his later films, beginning with Princess Mononoke, to [...] "enrich the visual look", though he ensures that each film can [...] "retain the right ratio between working by hand and computer ... and {{still be able to}} call my films 2D". He oversees every frame of his films.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kissinger, Brezhnev {{also brought}} up [...] "his pet scheme of nuclear {{condominium}} between the United States and the Soviet Union" [...] during negotiations. Kissinger described the American position as one [...] "determined {{to avoid any}} impression of a Soviet-American condominium", although Ford tempered this stance to a declaration of [...] "we <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we might go".|$|E

2500|$|Donovan was a {{versatile}} attacker {{known for his}} pace and stamina as well as intelligence and technical skill, allowing him to play at various forward and midfield positions at different points of his career. His longtime international and club manager Bruce Arena was once quoted as saying, [...] "the problem with Landon is that he's your best player at so many positions that you <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to put him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Rosebud is the {{district}} where bones turn to stone. [...] Even in recent years, {{as when the}} father of Crazy Horse went to examine his son’s tomb, the custom of Indians in old times, he sound the skeleton had petrified. [...] He had placed the body in a secret cave so that white men could <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> his body was or contaminate it by so much a white man’s touch. [...] Past He Dog’s Village; past one-room log cabins with broken and rusted farm implements strewn about, mostly with a tepee on the outside, ground uncultivated and dead; nothing green. [...] Past a little church once painted white, cross on a low steeple, and set {{in a field of}} little white crosses, reminder of sad ending of babies and youth unable to survive in the environment denominated “reservation” by a “charitable” government. [...] Even jack rabbits and birds were absent in this long desolation. [...] But it was good enough for Indians by the white man’s laws. [...] Miles and miles, and finally a little creek bed was crossed to a service pump, and tiny store, it was Brennan, P.O., and just at the rear was the little monument {{at the head of the}} trench where the soldiers who murdered them, buried the frozen bodies of men, women and children to the number of two hundred and ninety, shot down with machine guns to let lie for two days in sub-zero storms (90 men 200 women and children). In one pile of bodies were two mothers whose babes were clasped close to the breast and within their heavy blanket shawls. [...] When tearing the heap of frozen dead apart to be loaded into army wagons for transport to the big ditch, the two babes were found to be alive.” [...] “This was the ‘revenge’ of the troops for the wiping out of Custer’s army at the Little Big Horn fourteen years before, but it was a discreditable show for the great United States Army to thus turn Hotchkiss machine guns on a crowd of starving and helpless and wholly harmless women and children! [...] History has not, even to this late day, justified it. [...] Many of the former acquaintances and friends of the writer were present, and some of them were killed.” [...] “It was a depressing sight for the writer who could in memory review the surrounded band in rags, shivering in cold and weak from irrepressible hunger over months of fruitless search for game to supply them what was denied them by crooked agents and grafting politicians, and had been trailed like wild animals by the relentless army, and finally driven, like cattle to the slaughter, at the unattractive fields we gazed upon.” ...|$|E
60|$|FRANKLYN [cutting {{in before}} Burge can proceed--as he evidently intends--to answer his own question] I will tell you. He has ascertainable beliefs and {{principles}} to offer.

6000|$|LIEUTENANT (looking {{about him}} {{on his way to the}} inner door). By the way, General, did I give you my sword or did I not? Oh, I {{remember}} now. (Fretfully.)

5000|$|Rabbi Eric Yoffie, President of the Jewish Reform movement, wrote that, [...] "Rosner {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{interesting}} commentators on this well-worn subject (Israel-Diaspora relations). While he trends conservative, he has an original, quirky, iconoclastic approach, and one <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> he will end up." [...] This introduction was followed by strong criticism of Rosner's views.|$|R
60|$|So Richard {{sent word}} to the {{governor}} of the Tower, and the governor commissioned a priest to take up the bodies secretly, and inter them again in a more suitable manner. This priest soon afterward died, without revealing the place which he chose for the interment, and so it was <b>never</b> <b>known</b> <b>where</b> the bodies were finally laid.|$|R

60|$|Then {{there was}} a sudden clamour, and as the Canarios ran forward Jefferson {{struggled}} vainly. Austin <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> his strength came from, but in another moment the pistol slipped from his comrade's hand, and, reeling backwards, he struck the deck-house. Austin stood in front of him, with hands clenched, and the veins swollen high on his forehead, panting hard.|$|R

60|$|The house {{must be in}} good style, {{something}} that would always be certain to command a price, something unique, like that last house of Parkes, which had a tower; but Parkes had himself said that his architect was ruinous.

5000|$|The song is a duet {{featuring}} elliptical lyrics, {{which appear}} {{to be about the}} magic of life and the fact that one <b>never</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> one is going.
