2500|$|The first Tropaeolum {{species was}} {{imported}} into Spain by the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes. He published an account in 1569 entitled Joyful <b>News</b> <b>out</b> of the Newe Founde Worlde {{in which he}} described, among other things, the plants and animals discovered in South America. The English herbalist John Gerard reports having received seeds of the plant from Europe in his 1597 book Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes. Tropaeolum majus was named by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, who chose the genus name because the plant reminded him of an ancient custom: After victory in battle, the Romans erected a trophy pole (or tropaeum, from the Greek tropaion, source of English [...] "trophy") on which the vanquished foe's armour and weapons were hung. The plant's round leaves reminded Linnaeus of shields, and its flowers of blood-stained helmets.|$|E

60|$|On {{the third}} day after (September 10th), Bevern, having {{finished}} packing, took the road for Schlesien; Daun and Karl attending him; nothing left of Daun and Karl in those Saxon Countries,--except, at Stolpen, out Dresden-wards, some Reserve-Post or Rear-guard of 15,000, should we chance to hear of that again. And {{from the end of}} September onwards, Bevern's star, once somewhat bright at Reichenberg, shot rapidly downwards, under the horizon altogether; and there came, post after post, such <b>news</b> <b>out</b> of Schlesien,--to say nothing of that Stolpen Party,--as Friedrich had never heard before.|$|E

60|$|The <b>news</b> <b>out</b> of Silesia are ominously doubtful, bad at the best. Duke Bevern, once Winterfeld was gone, had, as we observed, {{felt himself}} free to act; unchecked, but also unsupported, by {{counsel of the}} due heroism; and had acted unwisely. Made direct for Silesia, namely, where are meal-magazines and strong places. Prince Karl, they say, was also unwise; took no thought beforehand, or he might have gained marches, disputed rivers, Bober, Queiss, with Bevern, and as good as {{hindered}} him from ever getting to Silesia. So say critics, Retzow and others; perhaps looking too fixedly {{on one side of}} the question. Certain it is, Bevern marched in peace to Silesia; found it by no means the better place it had promised to be.|$|E
