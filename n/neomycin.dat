5|$|The {{antibiotics}} <b>neomycin</b> and metronidazole {{are other}} antibiotics {{used to treat}} hepatic encephalopathy. The rationale of their use {{was the fact that}} ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by intestinal bacteria, and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products. <b>Neomycin</b> was chosen because of its low intestinal absorption, as <b>neomycin</b> and similar aminoglycoside antibiotics may cause hearing loss and kidney failure if used by injection. Later studies showed that <b>neomycin</b> was indeed absorbed when taken by mouth, with resultant complications. Metronidazole, similarly, is less commonly used because prolonged use can cause nerve damage, in addition to gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, several reports {{enumerated}} {{the numerous}} abnormalities reported previously, and confirmed the previously enunciated theory that metabolic impairment and portosystemic shunting are the underlying mechanism behind hepatic encephalopathy, {{and that the}} nitrogen-rich compounds originate from the intestine. Many of these studies were done by Professor Dame Sheila Sherlock (1918–2001), then at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London and subsequently at the Royal Free Hospital. The same group investigated protein restriction and <b>neomycin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin may be {{recommended in}} addition to lactulose for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to <b>neomycin</b> or metronidazole. Due to the long history and lower cost of lactulose use, rifaximin is generally only used as a second-line treatment if lactulose is poorly tolerated or not effective. When rifaximin is added to lactulose, the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately. Rifaximin is more expensive than lactulose, but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{regulation}} of translation is less prevalent than control of transcription or mRNA stability but is occasionally used. Inhibition of protein translation {{is a major}} target for toxins and antibiotics, so they can kill a cell by overriding its normal gene expression control. Protein synthesis inhibitors include the antibiotic <b>neomycin</b> and the toxin ricin.|$|E
25|$|H. larsenii is {{resistant}} to the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, <b>neomycin,</b> penicillin G, rifampicin, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The organism is sensitive to bacitracin and novobiocin. Antibiotic sensitivity and resistance was determined using the agar diffusion test in which paper discs saturated with antibiotics were placed on agar plates.|$|E
25|$|It was at Rutgers that Selman Waksman (1888–1973) {{discovered}} several antibiotics, including actinomycin, clavacin, streptothricin, grisein, <b>neomycin,</b> fradicin, candicidin, candidin, and others. Waksman, {{along with}} graduate student Albert Schatz (1920–2005), discovered streptomycin—a versatile antibiotic {{that was to}} be the first applied to cure tuberculosis. For this discovery, Waksman received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} methotrexate, so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, <b>neomycin</b> and paromomycin, have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.|$|E
500|$|Direct {{translation}} from DNA to protein {{has been}} demonstrated in a cell-free system (i.e. in a test tube), using extracts from E. coli that contained ribosomes, but not intact cells. [...] These cell fragments could synthesize proteins from single-stranded DNA templates isolated from other organisms (e,g., mouse or toad), and <b>neomycin</b> was found to enhance this effect. However, {{it was unclear whether}} this mechanism of translation corresponded specifically to the genetic code.|$|E

2500|$|Bacterial {{overgrowth}} {{is usually}} {{treated with a}} course of antibiotics although whether antibiotics should be a first line treatment {{is a matter of}} debate. Some experts recommend probiotics as first line therapy with antibiotics being reserved as a second line treatment for more severe cases of SIBO. Prokinetic drugs are other options but research in humans is limited. A variety of antibiotics, including tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, [...] metronidazole, <b>neomycin,</b> cephalexin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and nitazoxanide have been used; however, the best evidence is for the use of rifaximin.|$|E
2500|$|From 1979 to 1987, {{according}} to Clancey, he “managed research on <b>Neomycin</b> (one {{of the first}} second-generation expert systems) {{and a variety of}} associated explanation, instructional, and learning programs funded by the Office of Naval Research and the McDonnell Foundation.” He also designed “the instructional program GUIDON for teaching medical diagnostic strategy.” In his own words, he “developed some of the earliest AI programs for explanation, the critiquing method of consultation, tutorial discourse, and student modeling. My work on 'heuristic classification' and 'model construction operators' has been influential in the design of expert systems and instructional programs.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Surgical {{treatment}} is best, {{when it can}} be performed. [...] Pressure within the portal vein is measured as the shunt is closed, {{and it must be}} kept below 20cm H2O or else portal hypertension will ensue. [...] Methods of shunt attenuation should aim to slowly occlude the vessel over several weeks to months in order to avoid complications associated with portal hypertension. These methods include ameroid ring constrictors, cellophane banding, intravascular or percutaneous silicone hydraulic occluders. The most common methods of attenuation used by veterinarians are ameroid ring constrictors and cellophane banding. Both methods have reportedly good outcomes in both cats and dogs, although the true composition of readily sourced cellophane {{has been found to be}} made from plastics (inert) and not cellulose (stimulates a fibrous reaction). Recently, a commercial supplier of regenerated cellulose based cellophane for veterinarians has been established for use of [...] Complete closure of extrahepatic shunts results in a very low recurrence rate, while incomplete closure results in a recurrence rate of about 50 percent. [...] However, not all dogs with extrahepatic shunts tolerate complete closure (16 to 68 percent). [...] Intrahepatic shunts are much more difficult to surgically correct than extrahepatic shunts due to their hidden nature, large vessel size, and greater tendency toward portal hypertension when completely closed. [...] When surgery is not an option, PSS is treated as are other forms of liver failure. [...] Dietary protein restriction is helpful to lessen signs of hepatic encephalopathy, and antibiotics such as <b>neomycin</b> or metronidazole and other medicines such as lactulose can reduce ammonia production and absorption in the intestines. [...] The prognosis is guarded for any form of PSS.|$|E
5000|$|Standard grade <b>neomycin</b> is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} related compounds including <b>neomycin</b> A (neamine), <b>neomycin</b> B (framycetin), <b>neomycin</b> C, and a few minor compounds found in much lower quantities. <b>Neomycin</b> B is the most active component in <b>neomycin</b> followed by <b>neomycin</b> C and <b>neomycin</b> A. <b>Neomycin</b> A is an inactive degradation product of the C and B isomers.

50|$|The {{three main}} active {{ingredients}} in Neosporin are <b>neomycin</b> sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and bacitracin zinc. One {{of the main}} components of Neosporin is <b>Neomycin</b> Sulfate which is a type of antibiotic discovered in 1949 by microbiologist Selman Waksman at Rutgers University. <b>Neomycin</b> is a type of aminoglycoside antibiotic that fights against Gram positive and gram negative bacteria. <b>Neomycin</b> is often used in order to prevent risk of bacterial infections. Aminoglycosides such as <b>Neomycin</b> are known for their ability to bind to RNA and to change the proteins being produced by the bacteria with little to no effect on DNA. <b>Neomycin</b> kills bacteria as a result of irregular protein production in the bacterial cell. When the cell can no longer produce the correct proteins, its membrane will be damaged. Like <b>Neomycin,</b> Polymyxin B is an antibiotic. Polymyxin B alters the bacterial cell wall causing the cellular insides to leak out resulting in cell death. This antibiotic also interferes with the production of tetrahydrofolic acid by altering an enzyme. Without the tetrahydrofolic acid, the bacteria can no longer produce proteins necessary for survival. Pramoxine is used to temporarily reduce pain from burns, insect bites, and minor cuts. It works like an anesthetic by decreasing the permeability of neuron membranes. This blocks the ability of pain neurons in the area to send signals which results in numbness.|$|E

50|$|<b>Neomycin</b> {{resistance}} is conferred by {{either one of}} two aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes. A neo gene is commonly included in DNA plasmids used by molecular biologists to establish stable mammalian cell lines expressing cloned proteins in culture; many commercially available protein expression plasmids contain neo as a selectable marker. Non-transfected cells will eventually die off when the culture is treated with <b>neomycin</b> or similar antibiotic. <b>Neomycin</b> or kanamycin {{can be used for}} prokaryotes, but geneticin (G418) is, in general, needed for eukaryotes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neomycin</b> is {{typically}} {{used as a}} topical preparation, such as Neosporin. It can also be given orally, where it is usually combined with other antibiotics. <b>Neomycin</b> is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and {{has been used as}} a preventive measure for hepatic encephalopathy and hypercholesterolemia. By killing bacteria in the intestinal tract, it keeps ammonia levels low and prevents hepatic encephalopathy, especially prior to GI surgery. It has also been used to treat small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. It is not given via injection, as <b>neomycin</b> is extremely nephrotoxic (causes kidney damage), even when compared to other aminoglycosides. The exception is when <b>neomycin</b> is included, in very small quantities, as a preservative in some vaccines - typically 25 mg per dose.|$|E
