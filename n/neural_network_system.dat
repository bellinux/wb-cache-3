The subnet in the third level consists of two types of neural net models. A high-order neural net ascertains the conditions for adjusting the gradient magnitude and determines the amount of adjustment to the gradient magnitude. A semilinear feedforward net is used to compute the new adjusted gradient magnitude and determines if the element of interest is to be an edge element or a non-edge element.
