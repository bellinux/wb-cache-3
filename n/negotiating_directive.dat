40|$|At {{least as}} far as the British side were concerned, the Brexit process had been stagnating ever since Theresa May had invoked Article 50 on 29 March. There was even a sense of anti-climax. The UK gave no {{official}} reaction to the publication by the European Council of its guidelines for Brexit on 29 April or to the settling of the detailed <b>negotiating</b> <b>directives</b> of the European Commission on 22 May. The general election of 8 June, therefore, has delivered some shock therapy...|$|R

In November 2000, at the Zagreb Summit, the SAP was officially endorsed by the EU and the Western Balkan countries (including Albania). 2001 was {{the first year of}} the new CARDS programme specifically designed for the SAP countries. In June 2001 the Commission recommended the undertaking of negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Albania. The Göteborg European Council (June 2001) invited the Commission to present draft <b>negotiating</b> <b>directives</b> for the negotiation of a SAA.

In December 2005 the Council made the decision on the principles of a revised European Partnership for Albania. On 12 June 2006 the SAA was signed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of mandate was nominated the Parliament’s rapporteur to write and <b>negotiate</b> the <b>directive</b> preventing the entrance of false medicines into legal distribution. A business that generates more than €400 billion per year for the counterfeiting networks and puts at risk the life of patients. The proposed <b>directive,</b> and <b>negotiated</b> for almost two years, with the parliamentary groups and the governments, would be approved in 2011. Marisa Matias {{was the second time}} since Portugal’s entrance at the EU a Portuguese MEP, which led the process of a framework-directive, a law that will be transposed to the judicial system of each of the 28 member States until 2016.|$|R
40|$|As {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s largest trading block, the European Union (EU) has {{committed}} itself to an ambitious strategy of enhancing trade with its strategic partners through the conclusion of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). The launching of negotiations between the EU and the United States for {{the conclusion of a}} Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Agreement is part of this strategy. Understanding the EU 2 ̆ 7 s law and practice in the negotiation and conclusion of such agreements is essential for the Union 2 ̆ 7 s negotiating partners, who have often been puzzled by its decision-making complexity. Following a systematic presentation of the EU 2 ̆ 7 s institutions and their legal functions in the making of trade agreements, this Article provides an in-depth and step-by-step analysis of the EU 2 ̆ 7 s inter-institutional and legal practice in the negotiation and conclusion of international trade agreements. As such, this Article also constitutes a thorough assessment of the changes brought by the Treaty of Lisbon in the trade policy field. After almost three years of practice, it can be concluded that the enhanced role of the European Parliament in the making of trade agreements is the Lisbon Treaty 2 ̆ 7 s most important change in this area. Far from being the disruptive element that a number of prominent legal scholars had predicted. Parliament has not only brought a much needed element of democratization and open political debate in EU trade policy making, it has also delivered proof of its added value, notably by reinforcing the preservation of fundamental rights. The next step should be for Parliament to gain a formal role in the determination of the EU 2 ̆ 7 s <b>negotiating</b> <b>directives...</b>|$|R
40|$|Commission {{proposal}} for a Regulation to replace Council Directive 91 / 414 /EEC is currently being <b>negotiated.</b> The current <b>Directive</b> provides the framework for the authorisation and marketing of agricultural pesticides. The Regulation will update the human and environmental safety ‘cut off’ criteria by which plant protection products are approved. This may result in the prohibition of {{a significant number of}} synthetic chemical pesticide products. Various non-chemical control methods can make valuable contributions to crop protection. The aim of this briefing note is to provide information on technologies that complement, or can be used as alternatives to, the application of synthetic chemical pesticides...|$|R
