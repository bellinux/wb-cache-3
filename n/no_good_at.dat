5|$|The game {{started with}} both teams exchanging several punts {{in the first}} quarter. Maryland gained good field {{position}} after Lauricella kicked a short punt. Running backs Ed Modzelewski and Ed Fullerton then led an 11-play, 56-yard rushing drive for a touchdown. On the kickoff, Bob Ward hit Lauricella and forced a fumble that Maryland recovered on Tennessee's 13-yard line. After four plays, Jack Scarbath pitched to Fullerton who then threw a six-yard forward pass to Bob Shemonski {{in the end zone}} and expanded the Maryland lead to 14–0. Scarbath then engineered a 48-yard drive and ran it in himself for the Terrapins' third touchdown within seven minutes. Late in the second quarter, Tennessee back Bert Rechichar caught a four-yard pass for a touchdown, but the extra point was <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of the first}} half, Maryland had stunned Tennessee by gaining a 21–6 lead. In the fourth quarter, Fullerton intercepted a pass and returned it 46 yards for a touchdown. In the final minutes, Tennessee's goal-line quarterback Herky Payne ran it in from the one-yard line. Maryland won the game with a final result of 28–13.|$|E
25|$|Explicit {{extrinsic}} {{rewards and}} punishments {{have been found}} to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E

500|$|The {{diplomatic}} philosophy {{behind the}} League represented {{a fundamental shift}} from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious Great Powers of World War I (France, the UK, Italy and Japan were the {{permanent members of the}} executive Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting Red Cross medical tents, Benito Mussolini responded that [...] "the League is very well when sparrows shout, but <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all when eagles fall out." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{begins with}} [...] "Phases and Stages/Washing the Dishes", {{with the woman}} tired of caring for her unfaithful husband, {{emphasizing}} her domestic chores. This is followed by [...] "Phases and Stages/Walkin'" [...] where, after consideration, she leaves her husband at night, saying [...] "Walkin' is better than runnin' away, and crawlin' ain't <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all". In [...] "Pretend I Never Happened", she advises him to forget her and continue with his life. In [...] "Sister's Coming Home/Down at the Corner Beer Joint", her [...] younger sister describes the woman moving back home and sleeping late. Eventually, she overcomes her grief and begins a social life at the corner beer joint, representing her liberation with the lyrics [...] "(she's) dancin' on a hardwood floor, her jeans fit a little bit tighter than they did before". The final song of side one depicts the woman falling in love again but reluctant to admit it because she fears that her story will be repeated.|$|E
500|$|In the verses, Spears sings {{about being}} {{in love with a}} bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as [...] "He is a hustler / He's <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" [...] and [...] "He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain't smart". During the chorus, she pleads to her mother not to worry in lines such as [...] "But mama I'm in love with a criminal" [...] and [...] "Mama please don't cry / I will be alright." [...] Andrew Leahey of The Washington Times and Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly {{compared}} the lyrics to those of Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), while David Bunachan compared them to Coolio's [...] "Mama I'm in Love Wit' a Gangsta" [...] (1994). The words in the chorus end in 'al's syllables, as evident in lyrics such as [...] "And this type of love isn't rational / It's physical". Keith Caufield noted that they were an unintentional nod to Supertramp's [...] "The Logical Song" [...] (1979). Thompson stated that Spears's vocals are less processed than {{on the rest of the}} album, while according to Amy Sciarretto they are [...] "heavily auto-tuned and studio-treated, [...] she delivers her lines in a monotone, robotic fashion." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "How I Roll" [...] is {{the fifth}} track, {{produced}} by Bloodshy, Henrik Jonback and Magnus, where Spears [...] "pirouettes from a gulping in-and-out breath effect", and {{was described as a}} [...] "bubbly, playful pop song". Spears' voice is heavily altered, with her voice being put through many distorters, filters, and blenders. The song uses constant rushed handclaps, with elements which were compared to Janet Jackson's [...] "Strawberry Bounce". The sixth and seventh tracks [...] "Drop Dead (Beautiful)" [...] and [...] "Seal It With a Kiss" [...] were commented as [...] "fillers" [...] by Christopher Kostakis of Samesame.com.au. [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is Femme Fatales eighth track, and it was said that it [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". The song was further noted as being catchy, but repetitive by Idolator. [...] "Trouble for Me", the ninth song on the album, features a pre-chorus filled with [...] "melting, wheezing synths" [...] likened to a [...] "Wiley grime wobble," [...] segueing into a [...] "Janet Jackson vocal." [...] Spears' voice had been Auto-Tuned, but her voice was described as [...] "raw" [...] and the tones and wines as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "one of a kind". [...] "Criminal", the last track on the album's standard edition, is a guitar-driven midtempo song, which incorporates a folk-style flute melody. Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly said the song [...] "takes a breather from aggressive, wall-to-wall synths, driven instead by a steady guitar rhythm and an oddly Asian folky-sounding flute melody." [...] In the verses, Spears sings about being in love with a bad boy and outlaw, in lyrics such as [...] "He is a hustler / He's <b>no</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" [...] and [...] "He is a bad boy with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain't smart".
