40|$|<b>Nickel</b> <b>matte</b> is a <b>nickel</b> sulfide {{concentrate}} {{produced by}} smelting. It consists mainly of two components: a nickel-copper alloy and heazlewoodite (Ni 3 S 2); but also contains varying amounts of djurleite, Cu 1. 96 S. There are several hydrometallurgical routes for processing <b>nickel</b> <b>matte.</b> The most recent of these involves an oxidative leach in acid chloride or sulfate solution. Nickel is subsequently recovered fiom the leach solution by electrowinning or by hydrogen reduction. In the work {{described in this}} thesis, {{various aspects of the}} acid leaching of <b>nickel</b> <b>matte</b> are investigated using mostly electrochemical methods. The first section concerns the use of copper(II) as an oxidant for the alloy component of <b>nickel</b> <b>matte.</b> In this cementation reaction, nickel goes into solution while copper is deposited on the dissolving metal swf 8 ce. The same reaction is important in removing traces of copper present in the nickel solution. Here nickel powder is added to the process liquor. A survey of the literature pertaining to the cementation of copper by nickel shows that there is considerable dispute as to the conditions under which cementation takes place. Evans' diagrams for the cementation reaction were constructed by superimposing the polarisation curves for the oxidation of nickel and the reduction of copper. It was found that cementation occurred provided that the two polarisation curves intersected in the region of active nickel dissolution. Outside this region, a copper deposit could not be seen. The second part of the thesis presents some investigations into the electrochemistry of nickel sulfides and <b>nickel</b> <b>matte,</b> and compares both chloride and sulfate media. Oxidation and dissolution rates of <b>nickel</b> <b>matte</b> powders using copper(I 1) as an oxidant were also carried out. Dissolution was chemically controlled and so the rate was very dependent upon temperature and solution potential. Displacement of copper(II) from solution to form copper sulfide was also found to be important. In addition to the above studies, which relate directly to the oxidative leaching of <b>nickel</b> <b>matte,</b> an investigation of the oxidation of HzS to sulfur in acidic solution was carried out. Sulfer deposition was found to be strongly dependent on substrate and pH. Under some conditions, two types of sulfur were deposited, with the more crystalline sulfer being reduced at the more negative potential...|$|R

A combination of plant sample analysis, high-temperature laboratory experiments, and thermodynamic modeling was carried out to identify process conditions in the converter and to investigate the effect of slag composition on the chemical behavior of the system. The high-temperature experiments involved re-equilibration of industrial matte-slag-lime samples at 1498 K (1225 °C) and P(SO) = 0. 12 atm on a magnetite/quartz substrate, rapid quenching in water, and direct measurement of phase compositions using electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) and laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} as {{a portfolio of}} peer-reviewed publications. For many geochemical systems, reaction kinetics determines the system's current status and evolution. It might also {{be the key to}} unraveling their thermal history. In metal sulfide systems, kinetic studies have been carried out on four sets of solid-state transitions/transformations in Fe-Ni-S and Ni-S systems. In this work, a new kinetic model, the Refined Avrami method, has been developed to account for reactions involving changes in reaction mechanisms. Nonstoichiometric compounds are commonly present in these reactions. The exsolution of pentladite from the monosulfide solid solution (mss) is an important reaction in the formation of nickel ores. For near equimolar mss compositions, the reaction rate is rapid even in the low temperature ranges. For bulk composition Fe₀. ₇₇ Ni₀. ₁₉ S, the experimental results show the reaction rates (mss → pentlandite) vary from 1. 6 x 10 ⁻⁵ to 5. 0 x 10 ⁻⁷ s⁻¹ at 200 °C and from 9. 4 x 10 ⁻⁵ to 4. 1 x 10 ⁻⁷ s⁻¹ at 300 °C. The activation energy, E [subscript a], varies during the course of reaction from 49. 6 kJ. mol⁻¹ at the beginning of reaction (nucleation mechanism is dominant) to 20. 7 kJ. mol⁻¹ at the end (crystal growth mechanism is dominant). Monosulfide solid solution (mss) is a common intermediate phase observed during the oxidation of nickel ores, such as violarite and pentlandite. The investigation of mss oxidation is of benefit in understanding the thermal behavior of economically important metal sulfides during smelting. The oxidation products of mss vary in our samples depending on their compositions. Apart from the common oxidation products hematite and Ni₁ ₇ S₁₈, Fe₂ (SO₄) ₃ was observed during the oxidation of Fe₇. ₉ S₈ and pentlandite for Fe₆. ₁ ₅Ni₁. ₅₄ S₈. The activation energy was determined using a model-free method. The oxidation of Fe₆. ₄ Ni₁. ₆ S₈ exhibited a higher E [subscript a] than Fe₆. ₁ ₅Ni₁. ₅₄ S₈ {{over the course of the}} reaction. The E [subscript a] increases with reaction extent (y) from 67. 1 to 103. 3 kJ. mol⁻¹ for mss composition Fe₆. ₁ ₅Ni₁. ₅₄ S₈ and from 76. 1 to 195. 0 kJ. mol⁻¹ for Fe₆. ₄ Ni₁. ₆ S₈. The kinetic study of the α - Ni₁₋ ₓ S → β - NiS transition shows that initial compositions of α - Ni₁₋ ₓ S plays an important role in the kinetics of the transition. The activation energy (E [subscript a]) for this α - to β - phase transition is 16. 0 (± 0. 5) kJ. mol⁻¹ for NiS in the temperature range 70 to 150 °C, and 13. 0 (± 0. 5) kJ. mol⁻¹ in the temperature range 250 to 350 °C. For Ni₀. ₉₇ S, however, E [subscript a] deceases from 73. 0 (± 0. 5) to 17. 0 (± 0. 5) kJ. mol⁻¹ over the course of the reaction in the temperature range 300 to 320 °C. The relationship between E [subscript a] and extent of transition (y) for the initial bulk Ni₀. ₉₇ S was derived using the Refined Avrami method. For Ni deficient compositions, α - Ni₁₋ₓ S, the transformation to β-NiS is accompanied by the exsolution of either a progressively more Ni deficient α-Ni₁₋ₓ S and Ni₃ S₄, and the reactions become more sluggish for more metal deficient compositions. The study of oxidation kinetics of α-NiS is of metallurgical interest, as α-NiS related phases may occur when nickel ores are flash smelted to produce <b>nickel</b> <b>matte.</b> In an open air environment, the oxidation mechanisms of α-NiS are constant at 670 and 680 °C, dominated by the direct oxidation of α-NiS → NiO. The dominant oxidation mechanism changes to a chain reaction : α-NiS → [superscript k] ₁ Ni₃ S₂ → [superscript k] ₂ NiO at 700 °C. Therefore, different kinetic models need to be applied to these two distinct reaction mechanisms. Activation energy for the oxidation, α-NiS → NiO, in the temperature range 670 to 680 °C was calculated to be 868. 2 kJ. mol⁻¹ using Avrami/Arrhenius method. Rate constant k₁ and k₂ are approximated to be 3 x 10 ⁻⁴ s⁻¹ and 5 x 10 ⁻⁴ s⁻¹ for the first part and second part of the chain reaction respectively at 700 ° C. The study of the variation in reaction rate with oxidation time illustrates the optimum oxidation time zone for each temperature, where NiO can be produced at the fastest rate. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The investigations show that not only does the laser treatment remove the tin contamination but it also removes the P-rich surface film. The lasered samples also showed a very coarse grain structure close to the Ni film which indicates a temperature-induced recrystallization effect. These results correlate with the mechanical investigations: At a depth of 50 nm to 200 nm significant lower indentation hardness was measured in the lasered specimen compared to the non-lasered specimen as detected by CSM nanoindentation measurements as well as standard nanoindentation measurements...|$|R
40|$|Four {{sulphide}} minerals – pyrite (FeS 2), pyrrhotite (Fe 1 –xS), pentlandite ([Ni,Fe] 9 S 8), and chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) – {{contain the}} base metals {{and most of}} the iron in concentrates of platinum group metals (PGMs). In the pyrometallurgical processing of PGM concentrates these sulphides form a matte during smelting, and iron and sulphur are removed from the matte during the converting process. This paper discusses the roasting of Merensky concentrate in air before smelting, with the purpose of reducing the matte load to the converter. Roasting tests were conducted in a bench-scale rotary kiln at temperatures from 350 °C to 700 °C. The concentrate tested contained 17. 4 % sulphur and consisted of 23 % pyrrhotite, 16 % pentlandite, 11 % chalcopyrite, and 2 % pyrite. The particles were fine (d 50 = 22 μm), and all the sulphide particles were liberated. Roasting in air at 550 °C and 650 °C for 20 minutes removed respectively 60 % and 70 % of the sulphur. The iron in the sulphides was oxidized to Fe 3 O 4 (magnetite) at temperatures below 500 ⁰C and to Fe 2 O 3 (haematite) at temperatures above 550 ⁰C. At 700 ⁰C the bed sintered and copper oxides formed. At temperatures below 450 °C oxidation was incomplete: pyrrhotite remained and only 30 % of the sulphur was removed. Smelting tests were conducted to assess matte fall and the deportment of copper and <b>nickel</b> to <b>matte.</b> It was evident that roasting resulted in lower matte falls (a drop of approximately 60 %) compared with matte falls from unroasted concentrate. The iron and sulphur levels in the matte were reduced to below 3. 5 % and 22 % respectively. This paper also briefly describes the mechanisms by which pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and pentlandite are oxidized during roasting. For chalcopyrite, the mechanism proceeds through an intermediate solid solution phase, which extends from Cu 1. 02 Fe 1. 04 S 2 to Cu 2. 04 Fe 0. 72 S 2 to a copper-rich solid solution of bornite (Cu 4 Fe 1. 4 S 4 –Cu 2 S). The oxidation of pentlandite proceeds through a monosulphide solid solution (Ni 0. 39 Fe 0. 53 S–Ni 0. 74 Fe 0. 15 S) to a solid solution of heazlewoodite ([Ni,Fe] 3 ±xS 2). These mechanisms are explored in relation to chemical thermodynamics and microstructures. This paper was first presented at the, Platinum Conference 2014, 20 – 24 October 2014, Sun City South Africa.

40|$|In a {{first stage}} {{atmospheric}} leach {{in a typical}} Sherritt Ni-Cu matte leach process, a Ni-Cu-Fe-S Peirce Smith converter matte is contacted with recycled copper spent electrolyte (an aqueous copper sulphate/sulphuric acid solution) at 85 °C {{with the purpose of}} dissolving nickel, while simultaneously removing copper from solution. In the PGM industry, copper removal is also important because it serves as a leading indicator in the removal of Ir, Rh, and Ru from the spent electrolyte. The matte mainly consists of heazlewoodite, chalcocite/djurleite, a Ni-Cu alloy phase and inert spinel minerals (magnetite and trevorite). Nickel is leached from the matte by two mechanisms: (i) leaching by sulphuric acid and oxygen; and (ii) an anaerobic metal exchange reaction (cementation and metathesis) between cupric ions in solution and <b>nickel</b> in the <b>matte,</b> which is also responsible for the removal of copper from solution. This study investigates the oxidative and non-oxidative leaching of converter matte in a laboratory batch reactor, with attention specifically being given to the effects of initial copper and acid concentrations and their effects on leaching kinetics. Experimental conditions were varied based on a 2 N experimental design. The availability of oxygen for acid-leaching reactions was found {{to be the most important}} factor influencing copper removal and nickel extraction. A 63 % nickel extraction could be achieved during oxidative tests vs. 22 % in a non-oxidative test. This also indicates that cementation did not take place to a significant degree and that nickel leaching mostly took place via leaching by acid and oxygen. It is suspected that the low degree of copper removal can be attributed to the solids/reactants ratio was employed in tests. The initial copper and acid concentrations did not have a significant effect on the rate of nickel extraction or the total amount of nickel extracted. The rate of copper removal was not significantly influenced by the initial copper concentration, but copper removal was affected by the initial acid concentration. In oxidative tests with high initial acid concentrations, the rate at which copper was leached from the matte was faster than the rate of cementation. The results suggest that operating under high initial acid conditions could interfere with copper removal with no significant benefit in terms of nickel extraction. The results allow the regression of rate expressions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Article in Pres...|$|R
