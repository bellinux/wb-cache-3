5000|$|This {{species is}} almost {{identical}} to its relatives the <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> and autumnal moth and {{it is almost impossible}} to identify them without examination of the genitalia. In general, although melanism occurs regularly in this species it is less prevalent than in the <b>November</b> <b>moth.</b> The pale <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> flies at night from September to November [...] and is attracted to light.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> and pale <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> and {{identification}} is usually only possible by examining the genitalia. In general this is the least variable of the three with melanic forms occurring less often. It is also usually on the wing earlier in the year, flying in September and October , although the flight seasons of all three species overlap.|$|E
50|$|The foliage is {{sometimes}} eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, <b>November</b> <b>moth,</b> pale <b>November</b> <b>moth,</b> mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, double square-spot, black and brown hairstreaks, hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella) and the case-bearer moth Coleophora anatipennella. Dead blackthorn wood provides {{food for the}} caterpillars of the concealer moth Esperia oliviella.|$|E

50|$|In <b>November</b> 2010, Gipsy <b>Moth</b> IV {{was bought}} by new owners Rob Thompson and Eileen Skinner. The boat is managed by UKSA and {{alongside}} attending events throughout the year, will be used by UKSA to promote their charitable activities.|$|R
40|$|The Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa) migrates {{annually}} {{to the highest}} peaks in the Southern Alps where millions spend the hot summer months aestivating in deep, dark crevices in rock caves among granite boulders. Parliament House disrupts the flight of the moths, writes Bill McCormick, and acts as a giant light trap for moths migrating through the Canberra area during October and <b>November.</b> The <b>moths</b> treat the building as a temporary camp and it is often necessary to reduce the building 2 ̆ 7 s lighting to allow the moths to continue their migration south...|$|R
50|$|The pale <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> (Epirrita christyi) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is a fairly common species in Western Europe {{including}} the British Isles.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> (Epirrita dilutata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. The species {{can be found in}} the Palearctic ecozone in Western Europe from Central Scandinavia to the Mediterranean the Caucasus and Western Russia.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 38-44 mm, the forewings being variably {{marked with}} alternating pale and dark bands.The forewing ground colour is pale with darker grey and tinted brown. It has wavy lines.The hindwing is white-grey with 2 lines. The distal fascia points {{in to the}} discal spot. Melanism is common and in some locations all-dark individuals make {{up the majority of}} the population. The species is extremely similar to two of its relatives, the pale <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> and autumnal moth, and they cannot usually be separated without examination of the genitalia. The <b>November</b> <b>moth</b> flies at night from September to November and is attracted to light and sometimes to nectar-rich flowers.|$|E
40|$|Cydia toreuta {{population}} densities, prolonged diapause behavior, parasitism {{and adult}} emergence patterns were examined {{over four years}} at two red pine locations in Wisconsin. Last-instar densities ranged from 0. 54 to 3. 18 per cone. This was considered a wide range for this species in red pine. Population clumping was evident at last-instar densities below 2. 90, however no consistent pattern was evident between years. Clumping disappeared at populations greater than 2. 90 last-instars. Prolonged diapause varied from 7. 8 to 38. 9070. Parasitism rates var­ ied from 10. 9 to 46. 6 %. Phanerotoma toreuta (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was the most abundant parasite at both sites and emerged in unison with male C. toreuta. Estimation of percent of last-instars undergoing prolonged diapause prior to spring emergence can be accomplished using forced emergence though cones should be collected after 31 January. Estimation of percent parasitism can be made as early as <b>November.</b> Resident <b>moth</b> populations could be estimated prior to spring flight utilizing this information. Emergence occurred over an approximately 2 week period between mid-May and early June. The majority of male moths emerged prior to females...|$|R
50|$|If {{the weather}} is too dry, the plums will not develop past a certain stage, but will fall from the tree while still tiny, green buds, {{and if it is}} unseasonably wet or if the plums are not {{harvested}} as soon as they are ripe, the fruit may develop a fungal condition called brown rot. Brown rot is not toxic, and very small affected areas can be cut out of the fruit, but unless the rot is caught immediately, the fruit will no longer be edible. Plum is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera, including <b>November</b> <b>moth,</b> willow beauty and short-cloaked moth.|$|E
