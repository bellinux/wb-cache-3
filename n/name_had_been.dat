5|$|John Gould {{and other}} early writers {{referred}} to the species as the black-and-white fantail, although did note the current name. However, willie wagtail rapidly became widely accepted sometime after 1916. Wagtail is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins of willie are obscure.

This was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf planet, because there is already an asteroid with that name, 399 Persephone.|$|E
5|$|Her keel {{was laid}} on 13 September 1943 by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company at its {{facility}} in Newport News, Virginia.

The last ship to bear the <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a training ship in 1905. The new carrier was launched on 14 December 1944 and she was christened by Ruth D. Overton, the daughter of U.S. Senator John H. Overton. The ship's cost is estimated at $68,000,000 to $78,000,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1916 the Russian {{government}} decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the Baltic and Black Seas. As Japan and Russia were allies during the war, the Japanese government sold Tango {{and some other}} ex-Russian warships back to Russia in March. The battleship arrived at Vladivostok on 2 April and {{was turned over to}} the Russians on either 3 or 4 April. Her former <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given to the new dreadnought battleship Poltava, so Tango was renamed Chesma, after the 1770 Battle of Chesma. She departed Vladivostok on 2 July and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 19 September.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{known as}} Cann Valley Road, the Victorian section was {{designated}} as a highway in 1960, and received the name Cann Valley Highway. The Monaro Highway name {{was applied to the}} road within Victoria in 1996. Within NSW, the highway was created in 1938 and designated as State Highway 19 within the Department of Main Roads. In 1958, It was named the Monaro Highway in both NSW and the ACT, though the same <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in use by the Snowy Mountains Highway until 1955. The Monaro Highway has more recently had a grade-separated dual carriageway extension constructed within Canberra, as part of the Eastern Parkway construction project.|$|E
5|$|With investigatory focus {{turned to}} Stella Nickell, detectives {{uncovered}} more circumstantial evidence pointing {{to her as}} the culprit. Nickell had taken out {{a total of about}} $76,000 in insurance coverage on her husband's life, with an additional payout of $100,000 if his death was accidental. She was also known to have, even before Susan Snow's death, repeatedly disputed doctors' ruling that her husband had died of natural causes. Further FBI investigation showed that Bruce Nickell's purported signatures on {{at least two of the}} insurance policies in his <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> forged.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications {{during the}} Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese {{government}} sold Tango {{back to the}} Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed Chesma (Чесма) as her former <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given to a new ship. En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but {{made no effort to}} resist when the British decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Hancock's <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{proposed}} {{several times}} for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health. Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including Thomas A. Hendricks, Allen G. Thurman, Stephen Johnson Field, and Thomas F. Bayard. Hancock's neutrality on the monetary question, and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, {{more than any other}} candidate, had nationwide support. When the Democratic convention assembled in Cincinnati in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority. By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and William Hayden English of Indiana was chosen as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1791 by French mycologist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard, who called it Boletus suberosus. However, this <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used previously by Carl Linnaeus (for a species {{now known as}} Polyporus suberosus), and so Bulliard's name was an illegitimate homonym. In 1821, Elias Magnus Fries published the species as Polyporus nidulans. In 1881, Petter Karsten transferred it to its current genus, Hapalopilus, as the type species. The fungus has been shuffled to several genera throughout its taxonomic history, including Boletus (Kurt Sprengel, 1827), Inonotus (Petter Karsten, 1881), Phaeolus (Narcisse Théophile Patouillard, 1900), Polystictus (François-Xavier Gillot and Jean Louis Lucand, 1890), and Agaricus (Ernst Hans Ludwig Krause, 1933).|$|E
5|$|Triaenops menamena is a bat in {{the genus}} Triaenops found on Madagascar, {{mainly in the}} drier regions. It was known as Triaenops rufus until 2009, when it was {{discovered}} that that <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> incorrectly applied to the species. Triaenops rufus is a synonym of Triaenops persicus, a Middle Eastern species closely related to T.menamena— the Malagasy species had previously been placed as a subspecies of T.persicus by some authors. Triaenops menamena is mostly found in forests, but also occurs in other habitats. It often roosts in large colonies and eats insects such as butterflies and moths. Because of its wide range, common occurrence, and tolerance of habitat degradation, it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E

5|$|When first {{described}} by the naturalist George Perry in 1810, the brolga was misclassified as a species of Ardea, the genus that includes the herons and egrets. It {{is in fact a}} member of the Gruiformes—the order that includes the crakes, rails, and cranes, {{and a member of the}} genus Antigone. The ornithologist John Gould used the name Grus australasianus when he wrote about it and noted it to be widespread in the north and east of Australia. He also recorded that it was easy to tame, and that James Macarthur had kept a pair at his home in Camden. Calling it the Australian Crane, he mentioned that its early colonial <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Native Companion. The Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union made brolga, a popular name derived from Gamilaraay burralga, the official name for the bird in 1926.|$|E
5|$|During 1982, the U.S. Army {{initiated}} the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) {{program with the}} aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, during 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter. During October 1988, it was revealed that two separate teams, these being Boeing–Sikorsky and Bell–McDonnell Douglas, received contracts to proceed with further development work upon their submitted concepts. During the 1990s, it was announced that the program's <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). During April 1991, the U.S. Army decided to select the design proposal produced by the Boeing–Sikorsky team as the contest winner; shortly thereafter, the team received a contract for the construction of four prototypes, which were intended to be operated in an extended demonstration and evaluation phase. It was in that same month that the helicopter received its official designation, that being RAH-66 Comanche, issued by the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|While at Oxford, Tarr {{had served}} in the Officers' Training Corps, {{reaching}} the rank of cadet sergeant. In 1911, he joined the Territorial Force, serving with the 1/4th Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment, as a second lieutenant. In 1913, he was promoted to lieutenant and when war was declared the following year, Tarr enlisted almost immediately, becoming the regiment machine-gun officer. His battalion was deployed to the Western Front with the 46th (North Midland) Division and landed at le Havre, France, on 3 March 1915. Following the Second Battle of Ypres, the battalion's dugouts were located between Lake Zillebeke and the Ypres–Comines railway line south-east of Ypres, Belgium. On the afternoon of 18 July 1915, Tarr, who was the acting adjutant of his battalion and whose <b>name</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> put forward for promotion to captain, had gone to the dugouts of the 5th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, towards Zillebeke, to liaise with the adjutant. While the Germans were shelling the position, Tarr put his head out to tell some men to remain under cover when a splinter from a shell struck him in the face, killing him. If it had struck any other part of his body, he would have survived.|$|E
