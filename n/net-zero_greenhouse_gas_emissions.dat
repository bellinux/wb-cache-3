They supported a long-term goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, to preserve oceans and save low-lying island nations from rising sea levels. Ten companies associated with The B Team set aspirations {{for their own}} organisations to reach <b>net-zero</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> by 2050, including the French apparel and accessories group Kering; the US electricity company NRG Energy; the Kenyan mobile network operator Safaricom; the global enterprise cloud computing company Salesforce.com; the internationally renowned jeweler Tiffany & Co; the Chinese construction company BROAD Group, the African telecommunications group Econet, the Brazilian cosmetics manufacturer Natura, the consumer goods company Unilever, and the international investment group Virgin Management. The B Team leaders called on governments {{around the world to}} adopt Net-Zero by 2050 as a long-term goal in the COP21 agreement. The B Team worked as part of the We Mean Business coalition, alongside partners like Ceres and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, to drive bold climate action by business in 2015.|$|E
30|$|The {{hydrogen}} fuel cells {{have been considered}} the most promising for automotive application, but the guidelines for the hydrogen storage, safer operation and transportation are quite rigorous [7]. The fossil fuel processing unit could produce the high purity of hydrogen [8, 9], but the external energy supply and large carbon emissions are not avoided. If biomass can replace fossil fuels as the feedstock, the <b>net-zero</b> <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> (GHG) <b>emissions</b> of hydrogen production systems can be achieved.

40|$|Life cycle {{assessments}} of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> {{have been developed}} for analyzing products "from cradle to grave": from resource extraction to waste disposal. Life cycle assessment methodology has also been applied to economies, trade between countries, aspects of production and to waste management, including CO 2 capture and sequestration. Life cycle {{assessments of}} <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> are often part of wider environmental assessments, which also cover other environmental impacts. Such wider ranging assessments allow for considering "trade-offs" between (reduction of) <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> and other environmental impacts and co-benefits of reduced <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions.</b> Databases exist which contain estimates of current <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> linked to fossil fuel use and to many current agricultural and industrial activities. However these data bases do allow for substantial uncertainties in emission estimates. Assessments of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> linked to new processes and products are subject to even greater data-linked uncertainty. Variability in outcomes of life cycle assessments of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> may furthermore originate in different choices regarding functional units, system boundaries, time horizons, and the allocation of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> to outputs in multi-output processes. Life cycle assessments may be useful in the identification of life cycle stages that are major contributors to <b>greenhouse</b> <b>gas</b> <b>emissions</b> and of major reduction options, in the verification of alleged climate benefits and to establish major differences between competing products. They may also be helpful in the analysis and development of options, policies, and innovations aimed at mitigation of climate change.
