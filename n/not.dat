5|$|Ain't is a {{contraction}} for am <b>not,</b> is <b>not,</b> are <b>not,</b> has <b>not,</b> {{and have}} <b>not</b> {{in the common}} English language vernacular. In some dialects ain't is also used as a contraction of do <b>not,</b> does <b>not,</b> and did <b>not.</b> The development of ain't for {{the various forms of}} to be <b>not,</b> to have <b>not,</b> and to do <b>not</b> occurred independently, at different times. The usage of ain't for the forms of to be <b>not</b> was established by the mid-18th century, and for the forms of to have <b>not</b> by the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does <b>not</b> adhere to normal scientific standards—that it is <b>not</b> genuinely scientific. It {{is argued that}} evolutionary biology does <b>not</b> follow the scientific method and therefore should <b>not</b> be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E
