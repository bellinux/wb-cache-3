The SWNTs modified by interactions with bacteriorhodopsin membrane patches have been characterized by UV-vis steady state, Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and by atomic force and transmission electron microscopy. The investigation shows that the membrane protein patches wrap the carbon walls by tight chemical interactions undergoing a conformational change; such chemical interactions increase the mechanical strength of the SWNTs and promote charge transfers which p-dope the nano-objects. The functionalization, as well as the SWNT doping, is favoured in acid and basic buffer conditions; such buffers make the nanotube walls more reactive, thus catalysing the anchoring of the membrane protein.

The program was modified for use on the Naval Postgraduate School (NTS) mainframe (IBM 360. 67) in 1979 by Lawrence B. Elliott, Lieutenant Commander, U. S. N. The modified version was called CALNPS. In 1982, Warren L. Roberts, Lieutenant, U. S. <b>N.,</b> <b>integrated</b> the Finite Element Analysis Program (FEAP) with CALNPS. This provided a means for the solution of linear and nonlinear, two and three dimensional, and, steady state and transient heat conduction problems. Roberts also generated an interactive "HELP" facility and the code for terminal graphics displays of heat transfer and structural analysis meshes. Since then, changes to the NTS computer system and transition of CALNPS to the VAX computer system have rendered CALNPS unusable in many ways. The "HELP" facility is obsolete. The purpose of this thesis was to bring CALNPS back up to date, rewrite the "HELP" facility, and make the program "user friendly". Also several modifications were added to CALNPS. The graphics capabilities were expanded to include hardcopy options using the Plot 10 and Disspla graphics libraries. Two display size options are now available and the user now has the capability to plot curves from data files from within the CALNPS domain. As CALNPS {{is a very large}} program, several of the functions available had not been tested completely and as a result did not work at all or did not work in the manner described in the user's manual. This thesis work included the testing of every command and verifying that they work in accordance with the user's manual. Several problems were discovered and corrected by either changing the FORTRAN code or the instructions or both. The work was focused around use of the VAX computer system.

Social–ecological frame-works represent a promising approach for addressing the human dimension of environmental problems. Speci-fically, a social–ecological framework is a conceptual model used to examine complex interactions between people and ecological entities and processes. Social– ecological frameworks identify how social factors influ-ence biodiversity, community structure, and ecosystem processes, {{as well as how}} ecological change affects social systems through ecosystem services (Figure 1). There is growing appreciation that the integration of social and natural sciences is essential for understanding environ-mental issues and managing ecosystem services (Grimm et al. 2000; Collins et al. 2011).
