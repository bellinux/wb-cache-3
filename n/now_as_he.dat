500|$|On July 1, Emery {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent as his injury deemed him unable to play until he recuperates. In August, {{he was given}} the go ahead to begin the grueling and tedious workout and rehabilitation process. In November 2010, TSN visited Emery during an on-ice workout and were surprised to see him get down into the butterfly position and play {{for the first time since}} surgery. Emery stated that he did not [...] "care if [...] walk in seven years," [...] and he [...] "just [...] to play." [...] To the surprise of his doctors and trainers, Emery has been doing better than expected. In January 2011, Emery began skating with an OHL team, taking shots and training with Eric Lindros, working with personal trainer Matt Nichol and goalie coach Eli Wilson. According to Wilson, Emery was [...] "as sharp and ready <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was the summer before Ottawa's Stanley Cup Final run." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth Deller of {{entertainment}} website Lowculture commented on Paul stating: [...] "He's {{always been a}} bit of a ladies' man and has had an eye for a business deal and has always struggled with whether to be good Paul or bad Paul. Ramsay Street's most prolific marry-er and father-er." [...] She also criticises the fact Paul's false leg is never shown on-screen adding: [...] "Paul has a wooden leg, which sometimes causes him to limp, when he remembers about it." [...] Holy Soap have said that Paul starting the Lassiter's fire and killing Gus during his 2004 return, was one of soap opera's greatest comebacks. They also branded him a [...] "legendary figure" [...] of Neighbours. Josephine Monroe in her book Neighbours: The first 10 years, names Paul one of soap opera's most enduring characters. An Inside Soap writer opined that [...] "slimy seducer" [...] Paul remained the same [...] "eighties smooth operator", observing [...] "he's certainly not short of a slick chat-up line or two. He's as skilled a lothario <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> always was." ...|$|E
500|$|Loup is a left-handed pitcher, or southpaw. He {{struggled}} {{at first}} with pitching until minor league pitching instructor Dane Johnson and Dunedin pitching coach Darold Knowles {{told him to}} lower his arm and {{become more of a}} sidearm pitcher. <b>Now,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pitches, he tracks a plane from his ear to his shoulder, which also helped his effectiveness against left-handed batters. His slider and fastball improved drastically, but his changeup continued to struggle, and Loup says that he is still a little inconsistent with it. He can throw a low-90s [...] "breaking" [...] fastball that is just as effective against right-handed batters as left-handed batters. John Farrell, a previous Toronto Blue Jays manager, said that it was [...] " [...] poise and his presence that allows him to maintain not only composure, but the ability to execute." [...] Blue Jays' bullpen coach Pat Hentgen says that Loup [...] "keeps things simple, he doesn't over-think. He stays aggressive. He's got a lot of guts, goes right after hitters and you combine all those things and you're going to have the success that he's had." [...] One reporter compared Loup to Bran Flakes, stating that [...] "ou know exactly what you're going to get from him every time he takes the mound and he's not going to add any excitement to any situation." ...|$|E
