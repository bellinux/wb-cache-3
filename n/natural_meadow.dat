2500|$|In 1670, the [...] "three mile" [...] or [...] "woods division" [...] was made. This divided {{common land}} located [...] from the Stratford meeting house and {{included}} land up to [...] away from it. The common land grants {{were laid out}} in a fashion so that each tract had a share of a run of water, woods, <b>natural</b> <b>meadow,</b> plains, swamp and ledge. The grants were often {{a quarter of a mile}} north to south and one mile in length east to west, about [...] of land. Each freeman received division land according to his right or rank in the township, and many exchanged or sold their grant after receiving it.|$|E
60|$|At {{the foot}} of a tall butte Curtis turned his team and struck into a road leading to the left. This road at once descended upon a crescent-shaped, <b>natural</b> <b>meadow</b> {{enclosed}} by a small stream, like a babe in a sheltering arm. All about were signs of its use as a camping-ground. Sweat lodges, broken tepee-poles, piles of blackened stones, and rings of bowlders told of the many fires that had been built. Willows fringed the creek, while to the south and west rose a tall, bare hill, on which a stone tower stood like a sentinel warrior.|$|E
60|$|Next morning I {{was early}} afield, {{heading for a}} ridge where I thought the deer of the {{neighborhood}} might congregate {{with the intention of}} yarding for the winter. At the foot of a wild little <b>natural</b> <b>meadow,</b> made centuries ago by the beavers, I found the trail of two deer which had been helping themselves to some hay that had been cut and stacked there the previous summer. My big buck was not with them; so I left the trail in peace to push through a belt of woods and across a pond to an old road that led for a mile or two towards the ridge I was seeking.|$|E

6000|$|We {{pass over}} the details of {{assembling}} the council. The spot was not exactly on the prairie, but {{in a bit of}} lovely [...] "Opening" [...] on its margin, where the eye could roam over a wide extent of that peculiar <b>natural</b> <b>meadow,</b> while the body enjoyed the shades of the wood. The chiefs alone were in the circle, while the [...] "braves" [...] and the [...] "young men" [...] generally formed a group on the outside; near enough to hear what passed, and to profit by it, if so disposed. The pipe was smoked, and all the ordinary customs observed, when Bear's Meat arose, the first speaker on that momentous occasion.|$|E
60|$|The first prairie we {{had ever}} seen {{was on the road}} between Detroit and Kalamazoo; distant from the latter place only some eight or nine miles. The axe had laid the country open in its neighborhood; but the spot was easily to be {{recognized}} by the air of cultivation and age that pervaded it. There was not a stump on it, and the fields were as smooth as any on the plains of Lombardy, and far more fertile, rich as the last are known to be. In a word, the beautiful perfection of that little <b>natural</b> <b>meadow</b> became apparent at once, though seated amid a landscape that was by no means wanting in interest of its own.|$|E
60|$|The {{country was}} wooded {{everywhere}} {{except at the}} bottom of the valley to the northward, where there was a small <b>natural</b> <b>meadow,</b> through which flowed a stream scarcely visible from the valley's rim. This open ground looked hardly larger than an ordinary door-yard, but was really several acres in extent. Its green was more vivid than that of the inclosing forest. Away beyond it rose a line of giant cliffs similar to those upon which we are supposed to stand in our survey of the savage scene, and through which the road had somehow made its climb to the summit. The configuration of the valley, indeed, was such that from this point of observation it seemed entirely shut in, and one could but have wondered how the road which found a way out of it had found a way into it, and whence came and whither went the waters of the stream that parted the meadow more than a thousand feet below.|$|E

60|$|Major Dunwoodie had {{received}} from his scouts all the intelligence concerning his foe, which was necessary to enable him to make his arrangements. The bottom of the valley was an even plain, that fell with a slight inclination from {{the foot of the}} hills on either side, {{to the level of a}} <b>natural</b> <b>meadow</b> that wound through the country on the banks of a small stream, by whose waters it was often inundated and fertilized. This brook was easily forded in any part of its course; and the only impediment it offered to the movements of the horse, was in a place where it changed its bed from the western to the eastern side of the valley, and where its banks were more steep and difficult of access than common. Here the highway crossed it by a rough wooden bridge, as it did again at the distance of half a mile above the Locusts.|$|E
6000|$|The outer, or ocean side of {{this low}} and narrow bank of sand, is a smooth and regular beach, like that seen {{on most of the}} Jersey coast, while the inner is indented, in a manner to form several {{convenient}} anchoring-grounds, for ships that seek a shelter from easterly gales. One of the latter is a circular and pretty cove, in which vessels of a light draught are completely embayed, and where they may, in safety, ride secure from any winds that blow. The harbor, or, as it is always called, the Cove, lies {{at the point where the}} cape joins the main, and the inlet just named communicates directly with its waters, whenever the passage is open. The Shrewsbury, a river of the fourth or fifth class, or in other words a stream of a few hundred feet in width, and of no great length, comes from the south, running nearly parallel with the coast, and becomes a tributary of the Bay, also, at a point near the Cove. Between the Shrewsbury and the sea, the land resembles that on the cape, being low and sandy, though not entirely without fertility. It is covered with a modest growth of pines and oaks, where it is not either subject to the labors of the husbandman, or in <b>natural</b> <b>meadow.</b> But the western bank of the river is an abrupt and high acclivity, which rises to the elevation of a mountain. It was near the base of the latter that Alderman Van Beverout, for reasons that may be more fully developed as we proceed in our tale, had seen fit to erect his villa, which, agreeably to a usage of Holland, he had called the Lust in Rust; an appellation that the merchant, who had read a few of the classics in his boyhood, was wont to say meant nothing more nor less than 'Otium cum dignitate.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{there the}} analogy stopped. It hardly applied even so far. [...] Between {{us and the}} rough dark-skirted {{wilderness}} of the high forests on Montserrat the infant frost had never trodden; all basked in the equal heat of the perpetual summer; awaiting, it may be, in ages to come, a civilisation higher even than that whose decay Shelley deplored as he looked down on fallen Italy. No clumsy words of mine can give an adequate picture of {{the beauty of the}} streams and glens which run down from either slope of the Northern Mountain. The reader must fancy for himself the loveliest brook which he ever saw in Devonshire or Yorkshire, Ireland or Scotland; crystal-clear, bedded with gray pebbles, broken into rapids by rock-ledges or great white quartz boulders, swirling under steep cliffs, winding through flats of <b>natural</b> <b>meadow</b> and copse. Then let him transport his stream into the great Palm-house at Kew, stretch out the house up hill and down dale, five miles in length and two thousand feet in height; pour down on it from above a blaze which lights up every leaf into a gem, and deepens every shadow into blackness, and yet that very blackness full of inner light--and if his fancy can do as much as that, he can imagine to himself the stream up which we rode or walked, now winding along the narrow track a hundred feet or two above, looking down on the upper surface of the forest, on the crests of palms, and the broad sheets of the balisier copse, and often on the statelier fronds of true bananas, which had run wild along the stream-side, flowering and fruiting in the wilderness {{for the benefit of the}} parrots and agoutis; or on huge dark clumps of bamboo, which (probably not indigenous to the island) have in like manner spread themselves along all the streams in the lapse of ages.|$|E
50|$|The area’s {{farmers have}} taken their cattle and sheep to graze in the <b>natural</b> <b>meadows</b> {{at the bottom of}} the valley. The grass in these meadows was also {{sometimes}} mowed, stored in barns and used as feed for livestock. Bears and eagles tended to prey on sheep.

40|$|Following on {{from the}} large scale loss of {{seagrass}} in Cockburn Sound and extensive transplanting of Posidonia australis which had taken place on Southern Flats, assessment of {{the recovery of the}} seagrass benthic infauna ecosystems was undertaken. Samples from the outer, middle and centre edge zones of four different density transplant plots (1 m, 0. 5 m, 0. 25 m and 0. 125 m spacing) located within a larger transplantation meadow were compared against two <b>natural</b> <b>meadows</b> and a bare sand site. Four years after transplantation the 0. 25 and 0. 125 m Plots had shoot densities comparable to those of the natural seagrass sites with a two-way ANOVA revealing significant effects of site and edge zone on the seagrass shoot density. Total infauna abundance and infauna assemblages within the 0. 25 and 0. 125 m Plots had reached equivalent level to the <b>natural</b> <b>meadows</b> but not at the 1 and 0. 5 m Plots. A two-way ANOVA showed {{a significant difference in the}} total infauna abundance between the different sites but no significant edge effect was detected. Eusiridae, Solecurtidae, Diogenidae, Columbellidae, Fissurellidae, Oweniidae and Ischnochitonidae were found to occur in the two <b>natural</b> <b>meadows</b> and in the 0. 25 and 0. 125 m Plots and may be climax or K-species indicating the recovery of the transplanted seagrass to natural levels. The transplanted seagrass was also found to support small numbers of pipefish, seahorses and a sea lion. From this study it can be seen that the shoot densities and infauna abundances and assemblages of the 0. 25 and 0. 125 m Plots have reached levels comparable the nearby <b>natural</b> <b>meadows</b> and that those of the 1 and 0. 5 m Plots are likely to reach comparable level another in one to two years...|$|R

50|$|The lake covers {{approximately}} 115 ha, {{with another}} c. 100 ha hectares of reedbeds and meadows. Access {{to the lake}} is restricted in most places, as the wet meadows at the lake brinks are reserved for grazing cattle. The grazing helps to restrict the growth of shrubs and woody plants and maintain a <b>natural</b> <b>meadow</b> habitat. It also increases the biodiversity. The amount {{of water in the}} lake, varies a great deal (by design) with weather and season, but under normal conditions, the average depth is about 1 m. Water levels can rise by an additional meter or more. The lake contains a number of fish species, fishing is prohibited however, as is swimming.|$|E

50|$|Near {{the mouth}} of the river is the Pack River Flats Wildlife Management Area managed by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, located 9 mi east-northeast of the town of Sandpoint and 4 mi {{northwest}} of the town of Hope. The Pack River Flats is home {{to a wide variety of}} wildlife. Canada geese nest on the platforms in the marsh. Geese, swans, and ducks congregate here in spring and fall during their migration. This area also provides public access to wildlife viewing, hunting, and fishing. The Pack River Flats is important ecologically to moose, deer, elk, and waterfowl. Although there is currently no active eagle nesting here, eagles come to the area in the winter to feed on carrion and waterfowl. Before completion of Albeni Falls Dam on the Pend Oreille River in 1952, the lake level dropped after the spring runoff. Pack River Flats was a <b>natural</b> <b>meadow</b> then, and archaeological evidence suggests that it was historically an important site for Native Americans.|$|E
5000|$|On the Kola {{peninsula}} in European Russia, Sami {{people were}} displaced from their traditional territories during the Cold War. The greatest single displacement took place when Sami fishermen were evacuated from the coastline {{in order to}} make way for secretive naval installations. Meanwhile, reindeer herders were dispossessed from their territories along a 200-mile zone adjacent to the border with Finland and Norway. This border was soon closed, effectively shutting communication and movement between Sami peoples in Finland, Norway, and Sweden with those on the Russian Kola.Further displacement was caused by the arrival of increased heavy industry and natural resource extraction such as forestry and mining during Soviet times. Hundreds of thousands of workers from other areas of the USSR arrived, many of whom were forcibly interned as workers in the Gulags. This industrialization disrupted reindeer herding livelihoods, and led in part to the settlement of Sami into Soviet-designed urban areas such as Lovozero. Today, most Russian Sami live in extreme poverty and poor housing conditions.Acid rain is a major concern on the Kola peninsula, where it has caused severe damage to thousands of square kilometres of tundra and taiga. The ecological balance of the peninsula has been adversely affected by mining operations, which has contributed to atmospheric pollution, damage to forests and <b>natural</b> <b>meadow</b> lands, and groundwater depletion and pollution. According to ZumBrunnen, between 1964 and 1986 approximately 11,000 containers of [...] "dangerous wastes" [...] were dumped into the Kara and Barents seas. Nuclear waste dumping is believed to have occurred in Arctic waters nearby, and, as of 1997, many ships anchored near shore either stored or contained radioactive waste along the coastlines which had once been inhabited by evacuated Sami fishermen.|$|E
