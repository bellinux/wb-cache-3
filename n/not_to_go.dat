5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E

5|$|I {{asked him}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into that field, {{that you were}} going there.

I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses.

Across southern India, the cyclone damaged 749houses and destroyed 81more, but no deaths were reported in the country.|$|E
