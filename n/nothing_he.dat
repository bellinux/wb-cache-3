5|$|Brassey {{had other}} ideas which were {{ahead of his}} time. He tried to {{interest}} {{the governments of the}} United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had no success.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a {{favourite}} {{architect of}} Catherine's. Like Bullant, {{he became a}} more fantastical designer with time. <b>Nothing</b> <b>he</b> built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau. In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France, a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine. His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Krycek, who {{has beaten}} Dmitri into telling {{him what he}} saw, orders his Russian colleagues to infect him with the black oil. Back in the United States, Werber {{introduces}} Mulder to the wheelchair-bound Cassandra, who considers him a hero of hers. She claims that the aliens {{are in a state}} of upheaval and that she will be abducted by them again. Mulder tells Cassandra there is <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> can do for her and leaves.|$|E

5|$|This little work, if Mary {{had never}} {{produced}} any thing else, would serve, with persons of true taste and sensibility, {{to establish the}} eminence of her genius. The story is <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> that looks into the book only for incident, will probably lay it down with disgust. But the feelings are of the truest and most exquisite class; every circumstance is adorned with that species of imagination, which enlists itself under the banners of delicacy and sentiment.|$|E
5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology and said there was <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> could do.|$|E
5|$|At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler {{attempts}} to assassinate the President of the United States but fails and escapes. Meanwhile, Wolverine explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in Alberta {{for clues to}} his past, but finds <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> returns to Professor Xavier's school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using Cerebro. Xavier and Cyclops go to question the imprisoned Magneto about the attack, while X-Men Storm and Jean Grey retrieve Nightcrawler. Meanwhile, military scientist Colonel William Stryker approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. Colossus leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro escape, and Stryker's assistant Yuriko Oyama captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack Wolverine confronts Stryker, who knows him by name.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the Bourbon Restoration, Lafayette lent his support to a number of conspiracies in France and other European countries, all of which came to <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> was {{involved}} in the various Charbonnier plots, and agreed to go to the city of Belfort, where there was a garrison of French troops, and assume a major role in the revolutionary government. Warned that the royal government had found out about the conspiracy, he turned back on the road to Belfort, avoiding overt involvement. More successfully, he supported the Greek Revolution beginning in 1821, and by letter attempted to persuade American officials to ally with the Greeks. Louis' government considered arresting both Lafayette and Georges Washington, who was also involved in the Greek efforts, but were wary of the political ramifications if they did. Lafayette remained a member of the restored Chamber of Deputies until 1823, when new plural voting rules helped defeat his bid for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Jameson did {{not regard}} this {{ambiguity}} as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further {{word from the}} king. After standing by for the specified two days and receiving <b>nothing,</b> <b>he</b> correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time {{to distance himself from}} his former capital. Jameson therefore made good on his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff. This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached. Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon III {{had tried}} to secure {{territorial}} concessions from both sides {{before and after the}} Austro-Prussian War, but despite his role as mediator during the peace negotiations, he ended up with <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> then hoped that Austria would join in a war of revenge and that its former allies—particularly the southern German states of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria—would join in the cause. This hope would prove futile since the 1866 treaty came into effect and united all German states militarily—if not happily—to fight against France. Instead of a war of revenge against Prussia, supported by various German allies, France engaged in a war against all of the German states without any allies of its own. The reorganization of the military by von Roon and the operational strategy of Moltke combined against France to great effect. The speed of Prussian mobilization astonished the French, and the Prussian ability to concentrate power at specific points—reminiscent of Napoleon I's strategies seventy years earlier—overwhelmed French mobilization. Utilizing their efficiently laid rail grid, Prussian troops were delivered to battle areas rested and prepared to fight, whereas French troops had to march for considerable distances to reach combat zones. After a number of battles, notably Spicheren, Wörth, Mars la Tour, and Gravelotte, the Prussians defeated the main French armies and advanced on the primary city of Metz and the French capital of Paris. They captured Napoleon III and took an entire army as prisoners at Sedan on 1 September 1870.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said George, [...] "I believe not. An author must be <b>nothing</b> if <b>he</b> do {{not love}} truth; a {{barrister}} must be <b>nothing</b> if <b>he</b> do." [...] Harcourt was no whit annoyed by the repartee, but having given his warning, went {{his way to}} his work.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must humour him though,' cried old Arthur; 'he {{must have}} his way--a wilful man, as the Scotch say--well, well, they're a wise people, the Scotch. He {{will talk about}} business, and won't give away his time for <b>nothing.</b> <b>He's</b> very right. Time is money, time is money.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Kate gave it an {{emphasis}} {{that might have}} appeared to leave him <b>nothing</b> more; and <b>he</b> might in fact well have found <b>nothing</b> if <b>he</b> hadn't presently found: [...] "But what if she doesn't accept me?" ...|$|R
5|$|OKW {{operations}} chief Alfred Jodl {{was present}} for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, Karl Koller, {{at a meeting}} a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason {{if he tried to}} take power. On the other hand, if he did <b>nothing,</b> <b>he</b> feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and Hans Lammers, the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead. He was also motivated by fears that his rival, Martin Bormann, would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.|$|E

25|$|A {{few minutes}} before, a flame-throwing squad had blasted fire into the position. Near the entrance, {{two of the}} enemy lay dead. 1stLt Rouh could hear <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> stepped over the pair, and into the dark interior, his carbine ready. Creeping along the wall, he could see stores of supplies. He saw no life.|$|E

25|$|In 1699, Father Guy Tachard again went to Siam, {{and managed}} to enter the country. He met with Kosa Pan, now Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the new King Phetracha, but the meeting {{remained}} purely formal and led to <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> apparently kept insisting on {{the establishment of a}} French fort in Tenasserim, with the effect that negotiations were broken off without any result.|$|E
25|$|Julian soon {{discovered}} that wealthy merchants were causing food problems, apparently by hoarding food and selling it at high prices. He hoped that the curia would {{deal with the issue}} for the situation was headed for a famine. When the curia did <b>nothing,</b> <b>he</b> spoke to the city's leading citizens, trying to persuade them to take action. Thinking that they would do the job, he turned his attention to religious matters.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to prove the press and public furor over the 2007 UK child benefit data scandal was a fuss about <b>nothing,</b> <b>he</b> {{published}} his own bank account number and sort code, together with {{instructions on how to}} find out his address, in The Sun newspaper, expecting nobody to be able to remove money from his account. He later discovered that someone had set up a monthly direct debit for £500 to Diabetes UK.|$|E

25|$|Garrincha {{is renowned}} for his {{remarkable}} ball control, imagination, dribbling skills and feints on the wing, {{as well as}} his ability to create chances out of <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> also possessed a powerful shot with either foot and was a gifted set piece specialist known for free kicks and corners taken with the outside of his foot. However, it was his dribbling skills he was most famous for, a skill he retained throughout his career.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{argues that}} this is only true for an {{observer}} outside of the room. The {{whole point of the}} thought experiment is to put someone inside the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} at {{approximately}} 10:15, Nalls circled around the block looking for the Hudson, but observed <b>nothing.</b> <b>He</b> parked, first on Lincoln (the {{north side of the}} apartments), then {{on the west side of}} Lexington, at the northwest corner of Lexington and Lincoln, and remained in his car while watching Coulter and St. Paul Police detective Henry Cummings, pull up, park, and enter the building. Ten minutes later, by Nalls's estimate, Van Meter parked a green Ford coupe on the north side of the apartment building.|$|E
