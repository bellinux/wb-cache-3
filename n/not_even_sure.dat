According to an important research by Wilhelm Hallwachs, ozone played {{an important part in}} the phenomenon. However, other elements enter such as oxidation, the humidity, the mode of polish of the surface, etc. It was at the time <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> that the fatigue is absent in a vacuum.|$|E

He was a Christian Scientist and Sean Ely believed his father suffered from skin cancer.|$|E
500|$|Reeve Robert Williams {{suggested}} {{ferns and}} flowers indigenous to British Columbia {{would be brought}} in, and planted around the statue. Williams insisted the flora would not obscure anatomy. Township Council voted to place the statue in a [...] "suitable place" [...] in the yet-to-be-opened municipal offices. The sculptor suggested that he was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what a fig leaf looked like, an often suggested addition, and no coverage was requested during the commission.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Howard-Snyder and Paul Moser, in the {{introduction}} to a volume of papers on the idea of divine hiddenness as evidence against theism, cite Nietzsche's question as anticipating this contemporary theme: [...] "a god who is all-knowing and all-powerful and who does <b>not</b> <b>even</b> make <b>sure</b> his creatures understand his intentions — could that be a god of goodness?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Spit & Eggs" [...] {{features}} the reveal that Mercer Hayes, played by Ryan Devlin, is the Hearst serial rapist. Devlin was unaware {{that he would}} be the perpetrator until reading the episode's script; he stated, [...] "To tell you the truth, I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> the writers knew where my story was headed. But I was happy to do it – it's way more fun being bad than good!" [...] The episode also marks the final appearance by Ed Begley, Jr., after his character is killed. The mystery surrounding his murder would be the next major story arc.|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} {{with the}} characters' reaction to Lori opting for an abortion. Halden criticized the character's opposing {{views on the}} matter, and stated that their reasonings were invalid. Halden wrote. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> {{it would be possible}} for her to abort the pregnancy at this point, but the show's working on the assumption that having a child in a world where death literally lurks around every corner is an unequivocal good. The only person who’s been anti-pregnancy is Lori, and the show hasn't managed to cast her in a very good light, so it’s not like her arguments hold much water—which is also ridiculous, because ultimately, her opinion {{is the only one that}} matters." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall reflected similar thoughts, and stated that Rick's arguments against Lori's attempts were obsolete.|$|E
500|$|Famed author Clive Cussler and his NUMA {{organization}} also {{attempted to}} solve the mystery, searching for the aircraft in Maine and in Newfoundland. They made multiple visits in the 1980s, and interviewed dozens of elderly witnesses: hunters, fishermen and others who said they had seen or heard the aircraft pass by in 1927. The NUMA expedition was named [...] "Midnight Ghost", after Lindbergh's quote in his book The Spirit of St. Louis, where he said that Nungesser and Coli had [...] "vanished like midnight ghosts". In 1992, divers traveled to Newfoundland and attempted to locate and search Great Gull Pond for a wreck, but found nothing, and were <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> that they had located the right lake. Other lakes were also searched, from Machias, Maine, to Chesterfield, Maine.|$|E

6000|$|The Bow Street runners ceased out of {{the land}} soon after the {{introduction}} of the new police. I remember them very well as standing about the door of the office in Bow Street. They had no other uniform than a blue dress-coat, brass buttons (I am <b>not</b> <b>even</b> now <b>sure</b> that that was necessary), and a bright red cloth waistcoat. The waistcoat was indispensable, and the slang name for them was [...] "redbreasts," [...] in consequence.|$|R
500|$|In {{a review}} of the Family Guy, Volume Four DVD collection, Mike Drucker of IGN singled out [...] "Peterotica" [...] and [...] "PTV" [...] as [...] "new classics." [...] In {{a review of}} the episode, Bob Sassone of TV Squad commented on the scene where Peter acts as a {{landlord}} over a rat, writing, [...] "to be honest, I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what the hell was going on there, it was so disturbing." [...] Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews criticized the episode, writing that [...] "the story is thin and the laughter absent." [...] The episode sparked controversy over a depiction of the Charwoman cleaning character, a character used by Carol Burnett [...] in The Carol Burnett Show that was used in the episode without her consent. Burnett sued, but the case was later dismissed.|$|E
500|$|Azaria {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the 2004 short film Nobody's Perfect, which won the Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Short at the US Comedy Arts Festival. In January 2007, he was confirmed to be directing Outsourced, a film about two American workers who journey to get their jobs back, after their factory is moved to Mexico. In 2009, Azaria told Empire he was instead focusing on making a documentary about fatherhood. Two years later he told the Los Angeles Times that this project was [...] "half-complete" [...] and was [...] "forever looking for financing to finish it." [...] It eventually began in 2014, airing on AOL as an online series titled Fatherhood. According to AOL, the series of short episodes documents Azaria's [...] "touching, humorous, and often enlightening journey {{from a man who}} is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> he wants to have kids, to a father going through the joys, trials and tribulations of being a dad." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] from the album She's So Unusual (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't be scared of anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what it is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter what anyone says, the bad people that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E

2500|$|I think I {{agree with}} your [...] order for reading the books more than with your mother's. The series was not planned {{beforehand}} as she thinks. When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more. Then I wrote P. Caspian as a sequel and still didn't {{think there would be}} any more, and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last, but I found I was wrong. So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them. I’m <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published.|$|E
2500|$|The Dragon {{version of}} OOTS {{featured}} the same main cast of six adventurers, but saw them adventuring in an unspecified underground location. None of the villains or supporting characters from the online strip appeared, {{with the exception}} of Mr. Jones and Mr. Rodriguez, who appeared together twice. Burlew has stated that the events of the Dragon strips take place in an alternate universe from the online strip, and events in one storyline do not affect the other. This status quo was broken {{for the sake of a}} joke, however, when a character in the online strip referred to the July 2006 Dragon strip by claiming that [...] "I told you that in one of the Dragon Magazine comics, so I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> that's the same continuity." ...|$|E

60|$|The man {{was less}} {{brilliant}} than several she had met.

Yet he was different from those other men, though, since the difference {{was by no means}} altogether in his favor, it was almost irritating that her thoughts should dwell upon him, to the exclusion of the rest. There was presumably a reason for this, but she made a little impatient movement, and resolutely put aside the subject as one suggested itself. It was, she decided, altogether untenable, and, in fact, preposterous.|$|R
60|$|That we {{are under}} great {{distress}} for change, and that Mr. M'Culla's copper notes, on supposition {{of the metal}} being pure, is less liable to objection than the project of Wood, may be granted: but such a discount, where we are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>even</b> of our twentypence a pound, appears hitherto a dead weight on his scheme.|$|R
2500|$|Rebecca Harms, Green/EFA {{member of}} the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, said: [...] "In the next 50 years, nuclear fusion will neither tackle climate change nor {{guarantee}} the security of our energy supply." [...] Arguing that the EU's energy research should be focused elsewhere, she said: [...] "The Green/EFA group demands that these funds be spent instead on energy research that is relevant to the future. A major focus should now be put on renewable sources of energy." [...] French Green party lawmaker Noël Mamère claims that more concrete efforts to fight present-day global warming will be neglected {{as a result of}} ITER: [...] "This is not good news for the fight against the greenhouse effect because we're going to put ten billion euros towards a project that has a term of 30–50 years when we're <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> it will be effective." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Barker of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "Ditching the hangovers, the backward structure, the fleshed-out characters and {{any sense of}} debauchery or fun, this installment instead just thrusts its long-suffering protagonists into a rote chase narrative..." [...] Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Young viewers looking for unbridled raunch will be sadly disappointed, and so will other moviegoers expecting {{more than a few}} wan chuckles." [...] Steven Holden of The New York Times called The Hangover Part III [...] "a dull, lazy walkthrough that along with The Big Wedding has a claim to be the year's worst star-driven movie." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "I'm not sure who let the dogs out this time, but they should be made to pay." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Director Todd Phillips delivers a film so different from the first two, I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> it's supposed to be a comedy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Derek Chavis of the Baltimore Sun {{gave the}} episode a more {{negative}} review, saying [...] "While {{it seems the}} productions of each number are getting bigger, the show’s spirit gets smaller. Does Ryan Murphy think that because American Horror Story is amazing he can slack off on Glee? I hope not. It was officially announced recently that Glee will end after next season (Season 6) so let’s end this show as great as we started it, shall we?" [...] Lauren Hoffman of Vulture gave the episode a 2 out of 5, signaling mixed to negative reviews, saying [...] "The main problem with last night’s episode is that “Are you a Katy or a Gaga?” isn’t a particularly interesting question. I’m <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what that question is asking. Lady Gaga and Katy Perry certainly aren’t the same , but they’re not exactly polar opposites." [...] Despite negative reviews of the episode's theme, she did comment positively on Adam Lambert's role, calling his audition [...] "undeniably great." ...|$|E

5000|$|As in Verne's novel, {{the main}} {{character}} is Hector Servadac, however, instead of being stranded on the comet while serving in the French Algerian army, his father is a supporter of a doomsday cult and Servadac is stranded on a splinter of the shattered Earth when the planet is destroyed by a comet. Roberts described the central metaphor as [...] "the trope that the world might end and that we might <b>not</b> <b>even</b> be <b>sure</b> it has happened. We surely wouldn't be wholly oblivious (this {{is the end of}} the world we're talking about, after all!) But we might not be wholly certain, either. There would be a lengthy transition period during which we would become increasingly convinced that something substantial had changed in our lives." ...|$|R
2500|$|Other {{than what}} is learned of his {{character}} from the novels themselves, very {{little is known about}} Perry Mason. [...] His family, personal life, background, and education are not depicted, although according to the first chapter of The Case of the Sleepwalker's Niece (1935), his astrological sign was Leo. Mason has a professional relationship with Paul Drake, although after The Case of the Velvet Claws fees are seldom discussed. Della Street is Mason's only (unacknowledged) romantic interest. It is known that he lives in an apartment because he is occasionally awakened from sleep to go to his office; he does not entertain anyone at home. His tastes in food are known because many scenes take place in restaurants, and that he is an excellent driver is shown by his participation in the occasional car chase. Other than those sketchy facts, there is so little physical description of him that the reader is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> what he looks like.|$|E
2500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko voiced {{their opinion}} within an {{interview}} regarding Shyamalan writing, directing, and producing the film. The two displayed much enthusiasm over Shyamalan's {{decision for the}} adaptation, stating that they admire his work and, in turn, he respects their material. Producer Frank Marshall explained that they have high hopes to stick to a PG rating. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>sure</b> {{we want to get}} in the PG-13 realm. Furthermore, Shyamalan said, [...] "A lot of the inspiration for the direction we took comes from a friend of mine. A Nathan Blackmer helped shape this Idea into the film it became. I took away {{a little bit of the}} slapsticky stuff that was there for the little little kids, the fart jokes and things like that...We grounded Katara's brother...and that really did wonderful things for the whole theme of the movie." [...] Paramount's president Brad Grey said that despite the director's career being inconsistent, he [...] "believed in [...] vision and that he could execute it," [...] adding that [...] "It's a bold step because he had to create a potential new franchise." [...] The studio was willing to spend $250 million in a trilogy of films, one for each season. The Last Airbenders budget wound up being $150 million, with later over $130 million being spent on marketing costs, making it Shyamalan's most expensive film. During production, the name Avatar was removed from the title to avoid confusion with the highly-successful 2009 film Avatar.|$|E
