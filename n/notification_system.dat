5|$|The HTC Dream (also {{known as}} the T-Mobile G1 in the United States of America and parts of Europe, and as the Era G1 in Poland) is a {{smartphone}} developed by HTC. First released in September 2008, the Dream was the first commercially released device to use the Linux-based Android operating system, which was purchased and further developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance to create an open competitor to other major smartphone platforms of the time, such as Symbian operating system, BlackBerry OS, and iOS. The operating system offers a customizable graphical user interface, integration with Google services such as Gmail, a <b>notification</b> <b>system</b> that shows a list of recent messages pushed from apps, and Android Market for downloading additional apps.|$|E
5|$|The {{consistent}} {{variation in}} the path of Claudette caused uncertainty over the strength and location of its final landfall. On July 13, two days prior to Claudette's eventual landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch between Brownsville and Port O'Connor, Texas. By the next day, a hurricane warning existed from Baffin Bay to High Island, Texas, while a tropical storm warning extended from High Island to Intracoastal City, Louisiana. When it became apparent that Louisiana would not be affected significantly by the storm, the state's tropical storm warnings were canceled. In Texas, Galveston County officials recommended evacuations for western Galveston Island and Jamaica Beach, 24hours prior to Claudette's projected landfall. The Emergency Phone <b>Notification</b> <b>System</b> notified citizens in the evening to avoid evacuating during the night. Many citizens heeded the evacuation suggestion, some of whom remembered the flooding from Tropical Storm Frances five years before.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem was}} that the NASA Fire and Emergency Services did not know if the current {{emergency}} <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> on the NASA White Sands Test Facility were appropriate for alerting the employees of an emergency. The purpose of this Applied Research Project was to determine if the current emergency <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> of the White Sands Test Facility are appropriate for alerting the employees of an emergency. This was a descriptive research project. The research questions were: 1) What are similar facilities using to alert the employees of an emergency?; 2) Are the current emergency <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> suitable for the community hazards on the NASA White Sands Test Facility?; 3) What is the NASA Fire and Emergency Services currently using to measure the effectiveness of the emergency notification systems?; and 4) What are the current training methods used to train personnel to the emergency <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> at the NASA White Sands Test Facility? The procedures involved were to research other established facilities, research published material from credible sources, survey the facility to determine the facility perception of the emergency <b>notification</b> <b>systems,</b> and evaluate the operating elements of the established emergency <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> for the facility. The results were that the current systems are suitable for the type of hazards the facility may endure. The emergency <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> are tested frequently to ensure effectiveness {{in the event of an}} emergency. Personnel are trained and participate in a yearly drill to make certain personnel are educated on the established systems. The recommendations based on the results were to operationally improve the existing systems by developing and implementing one system that can overall notify the facility of a hazard. Existing procedures and training should also be improved to ensure that all personnel are educated on what to do when the emergency <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> are activated...|$|R

5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A <b>notification</b> <b>system</b> displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar across the top of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E

40|$|<b>Notification</b> <b>systems</b> {{are growing}} in use {{from home to}} the workplace. They are used to monitor stock prices, {{navigate}} in a vehicle, and to encourage collaboration at a job, among countless other applications. These systems must be developed and tested, but existing usability evaluation methods are not always useful. They fail to consider systems used in divided-attention tasks and the impact on primary tasks. Thus {{there is a need}} for usability evaluation methods that are adapted specifically for <b>notification</b> <b>systems.</b> Being able to find more usability problems with the adapted methods than the existing methods will aid in not only evaluations, but iterative design as well. Since there has already been much work on developing usability evaluation methods, those can be used as a basis for creating methods to work with <b>notification</b> <b>systems.</b> Since heuristic evaluation is a popular method with low cost, it is a good choice for adaptation. So a new set of heuristics for <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> is created and tested against a standard set of heuristics. Applying these adapted heuristics against a standard set resulted in the adapted method performing slightly better than the standard method. They showed promise in identifying valid usability problems along with applying directly to <b>notification</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{economy is}} under the player's control {{throughout}} the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting which percentage of a given resource is transported to a given building. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a fishery, and the building is still empty {{despite the presence of}} idle settlers, a fishing rod will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith. The game also uses a <b>notification</b> <b>system</b> that alerts the player if a building cannot be occupied either {{due to a lack of}} the right tool or the absence of available settlers.|$|E

500|$|The Dream was {{released}} to mixed reviews. The {{design of the}} Dream {{was considered to be}} solid and robust; Joshua Topolsky of Engadget considered its hardware design a contrast to that of the iPhone, due to its numerous navigation buttons (in comparison to just a home button) and its [...] "charming, retro-future look; like a gadget in a 1970's sci-fi movie set in the year 2038." [...] The Dream's keyboard, as the only method of text input prior to Android 1.5's introduction of a virtual keyboard, was considered to be sufficient, although some felt that its keys were too small. Its display was considered sufficient for a phone of its class, but John Brandon of TechRadar felt that it was not good enough for watching videos due to its poor contrast and small size in comparison to the iPhone. Android itself was considered to still be in its infancy (primarily due to its bare-bones functionality in certain areas, limited application catalog, lack of multitouch gestures, or syncing with certain enterprise platforms), but showed promise through its customizable interface, increased flexibility over iOS, its <b>notification</b> <b>system,</b> ability to display security permissions when downloading apps, and its heavy integration with Google services.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{approach}} {{the challenge of}} educating undergraduate and graduate students in human-computer interaction (HCI) of <b>notification</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Notification</b> <b>systems</b> are software and physical interfaces that deliver information of interest to users engaged in other activities. Often, such systems support educational activities and facilitate groupwork, but their range of use extends far beyond these domains and design challenges hinge on effective multitasking and attention management approaches. We have created a framework for developing <b>notification</b> <b>systems</b> that helps HCI researchers and practitioners appreciate these challenges, articulate their system goals in a common representation, and leverage development resources. Through this framework, resources that include information and interaction design guidelines, existing system examples, specific prototyping techniques, and evaluation approaches are accessible to a system developer. We present the outcomes of an instructional approach founded on various educational theories that integrates the framework to present key phases of system design and evaluation.
