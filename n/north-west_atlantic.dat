60|$|About {{the middle}} of the Miocene period, as well as I can now {{remember}} (for I made no note of the precise date at the moment), my islands first appeared above the stormy sheet of the <b>North-West</b> <b>Atlantic</b> as a little rising group of mountain tops, capping a broad boss of submarine volcanoes. My attention was originally called to the new archipelago by a brother investigator of my own aerial race, who pointed out to me on the wing that at a spot some 900 miles {{to the west of the}} Portuguese coast, just opposite the place where your mushroom city of Lisbon now stands, the water of the ocean, as seen in a bird's-eye view from some three thousand feet above, formed a distinct greenish patch such as always betokens shoals or rising ground at the bottom. Flying out at once to the point he indicated, and poising myself above it on my broad pinions at a giddy altitude, I saw at a glance that my friend was quite right. Land making was in progress. A volcanic upheaval was taking place on the bed of the sea. A new island group was being forced right up by lateral pressure or internal energies from a depth of at least two thousand fathoms.|$|E

40|$|Measurements from July 4 to July 8, 2005 {{by a high}} {{resolution}} visible radiometer, a Raman lidar, a ground particulate matter sampler, and ground meteorological sensors have been combined in synergy to infer the intrusion over south-east Italy, of air masses from <b>north-west</b> Sahara, the <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean, and the continental Europe. It is shown that backscatter coefficient, depolarization-ratio, and lidar ratio vertical profiles represent the best tools to detect the intrusion of long range transported air masses and to monitor their effects on the vertical distribution of aerosol optical and microphysical properties. High resolution radiometers are instead important tools to monitor changes on columnar aerosol properties and size distributions. Backscatter coefficient, depolarization-ratio, and lidar ratio vertical profiles have revealed that aerosol optical and microphysical properties significantly changed with time and space during African dust outbreaks: the intrusion of dust particles that at first occurred above 2 km of altitude extending up to 6 km, affected the all aerosol load down to ground within few hours. Aerosol size distributions showed during dust events a clear bimodality with an accumulation mode maximum at 0. 24 µm and a coarse mode maximum at 0. 94 μm. Conversely, {{we have found that}} during the advection of air masses from the Atlantic and continental Europe, aerosol particles were mainly located below 2 km, their optical and microphysical properties were affected by smaller changes in time and space, and were characterized by depolarization ratios rather close to those due to a pure molecular atmosphere. In this case bimodal size distributions with an accumulation mode showing two sub-modes at 0. 16 μm and 0. 24 μm, respectively and a coarse mode centred at 0. 94 μm have also been observed...|$|R

During the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including Greenland halibut, yellowtail flounder, Atlantic halibut, haddock, spiny dogfish, while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, witch flounder, and redfish. Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance. 31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.In 1497 John Cabot became the first to explore mainland North America {{and one of his}} major discoveries was the abundant resources of Atlantic cod off Newfoundland. Referred to as [...] "Newfoundland Currency" [...] this discovery supplied mankind with some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock, mackerel, and lobster. From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species. It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as redfish, Greenland halibut, witch flounder, and grenadiers. Overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on international waters, it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made. In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. The population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process, including American plaice, redfish, and Greenland halibut, together with flounder and grenadier.|$|E

40|$|Following {{upon the}} Third Conference on the Law of the Sea begun in 1973, the {{principal}} maritime States {{of the world}} assumed exclusive national jurisdiction over a 12 - mile zone extending from their coastlines and a 188 -mile economic zone beyond territorial waters. Together they constitute the more familiarly referred to «  200 -mile zone ». This new practice radically changed the political geography of the oceans, lessened the area within which {{the freedom of the}} seas exists, diminished by more than a third the surface area of the high seas and dealt a heavy blow to the fishing xpeditions of foreign trawlers. Canada is one of the principal users {{and one of the most}} vigourous defenders of the 200 -mile principle for geographical reasons as much as for economic or political ones. The excessive exploitation of the seabed has been felt to be a threat for a portion of the population of the Eastern part of Canada. A firm policy criticized for being somewhat unilateral has enabled Canada to eliminate foreign fleets from its 200 -mile zone. Over a period of 30 years the International Commission for <b>North-West</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Fisheries (ICNAF) attempted to introduce a positive international cooperation in order to eliminate the anarchic excessive exploitation.

Variability of the NWAHC is investigated in the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset and the HadGEM 2 climate modeL Precipitation is assessed using satellite and gauge-based observations, including the Trinidad gauge network, the ERA-Interim reanalysis and HadGEM 2 climate model. Analyses of the recent variability of the NWAHC in the HadGEM 2 simulations indicate an overestimation of intensity by up to - 10 x 1010 kg/so There is anomalous southward displacement of the equatorward edge with concomitant anomalous widths in the model, by up to - 12 °. The reanalysis precipitation is excessive, simulating around twice as much precipitation as the observations during both the wet season Gune to December) and dry season Ganuary to May), throughout the Tl'̇WA. Interannual precipitation variability is influenced by SST anomalies in the tropical Atlantic (TA) and Equatorial Eastern Pacific (EEP), which produce changes in the atmospheric circulation. In the EEP positive SST anomalies result in precipitation decreases during both seasons in the TNWA. Positive SST anomalies in the west TA and the north TA result in precipitation increases in the CAR and SCA region.

40|$|Summary. Geomagnetic {{variations}} {{recorded on}} {{the deep sea}} floor of the <b>North-west</b> <b>Atlantic</b> basin have been combined with simultaneous data recorded at nearby land stations to deduce the electrical resistivity structure to depths of several hundred kilometres. Over a period interval between about 30 min and one day, vertical gradients of the geomagnetic field variations are simply interpreted as induction from a plane two-layer structure with resistivity of about 7 - 20 S 2 m in the upper 100 km, increasing to> 20 S 2 m below. The lack of suitable high-frequency data precluded resolution of structures within the upper 30 - 50 km.

40|$|Seabirds {{and other}} marine animals {{are at risk}} from {{anthropogenic}} activities that target them directly and those that can harm them incidentally. We integrate year-round tracking and vessel studies to assess risks for a globally important seabird population in the <b>North-West</b> <b>Atlantic.</b> The eastern Canadian Grand Bank has a rich and diverse food web that supports an abundance of apex predators. Major resource extraction industries (hydrocarbon production and fisheries) operate in the area, and, in addition to shipping and hunting, pose risks for marine birds. Understanding the relative risks has been hampered by poor information on bird distribution at sea. Here, we deployed global location sensors (loggers or geolocators) on common murres Uria aalge at Funk Island, the species' largest North American breeding colony. Adults (n= 10) were resident on the Grand Bank and in adjacent pelagic waters year round. Within 10 days of leaving the colony, males dispersed offshore (< 50 degrees W), southsouth-east of Funk Island. Females departed later and spent 10 - 47 days in coastal waters before moving offshore. All birds were {{in the vicinity of}} offshore oil platforms during November and December, but remained outside the area of the coastal Newfoundland and Labrador murre hunt. Three of six tracked females, but only one of four tracked males moved closer to shore during January and February where vulnerability to the hunt may have increased. Vessel-based surveys confirmed the importance of offshore, shelf-edge habitats for murres in winter. Our results highlight the relative risk to wintering murres from different human activities, providing a sound scientific rationale for focusing conservation and management actions. This information is particularly timely given the continued expansion of deep-water drilling in the <b>North-West</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and increasing risk of oil pollution for seabirds attracted to platforms...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 120 -day {{ensemble}} intergrations {{of a general}} circulation model, designed {{to assess the impact}} of geographically localized sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in both the tropics and extratropics, are described.
