50|$|In 2003, forest {{products}} accounted for $269 million in export value, providing {{the third most}} important source of foreign revenue after cocoa and petroleum products. The major export markets were Italy, Spain, Germany, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, India, Ireland, Senegal, and Morocco. The total 2003 roundwood harvest was 11,615,000 cu m. Tropical hardwood production primarily consists of logs, 70 percent; lumber, 20 percent; and veneer and plywood, 10 percent. At one time, mahogany was the only wood exploited, but now more than 25 different types of wood are utilized commercially. The major species planted are teak, frake, framire, pine, samba, cedar, gmelina, <b>niangon,</b> and bete. The increasing scarcity of forest resources is adversely impacting value-added industries, leaving lumber and veneer production in a steady state of decline.|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises {{the results}} of a study on the growth of 17 timber species that are {{commonly}} logged in African rainforest areas: aningre (Aningeria altissima), obeche (Triplochiton scleroxylon), bosse clair (Guarea cedrata), dabema (Piptadeniastrum africanum), dibetou (Lovoa trichilioides), iroko (Milicia excelsa), kosipo (Entandrophragma candollei), kotibe (Nesogordonia papaverifera), limba (Terminalia superba), longhi (Gambeya boukokoensis), moabi (Baillonella toxisperma), <b>niangon</b> (Heritiera utilis), okoume (Aucoumea klaineana), sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum), sipo (Entandrophragma utile), tali (Erythrophleum ivorense) and tiama (Entandrophragma angolense). The data are compared with {{the results of}} growth ring analyses carried out in Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Gabon. The data were collected in a series of sampling trips to measure trunk girths in tree plots (Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ghana and Gabon). They will provide a basis for calculating rotations between potential successive logging operations within the framework of forest development projects...|$|E
40|$|In the forested {{countries}} around the Gulf of Guinea, enrichment planting in dense forests with few naturally occurring commercial species began in the 1920 s. It is clearly necessary to offset forest losses from logging by conducting silvicultural operations to reconstitute a forest's initial composition using suitable species. Such a strategy, which is sometimes strongly opposed but would convert wild forests into forests with greater potential value, can only be applied {{with a view to}} the long term. And this is only possible if the means provided to foresters are guaranteed over the long term. Enrichment planting is justified by the small number of commercial forest species, which will still be the same species in fifty years' time because they have the best technical properties. A for¬est enriched with okoumé, limbo and <b>niangon</b> to produce 50 or 60 commercially valuable trees per hectare will therefore always have more value than a wild for¬est. Enrichment is also justified by the increasing rarity of the most sought-after species, which cannot regenerate under dense cover. For example, we know that the abundance of okoumé in certain areas is the result of early human settlements that have since disappeared. Enrichment is also justified as a means of preventing logging from encroaching into the entire forest and gradually destroying it. Sawmills often decimate the forest surrounding them, and forest roads contribute to its fragmentation until crop fields take over the soil entirely. With no listing of protected forests and no silviculture, within just a few decades {{there would be no more}} economically viable forestry and no more forest industries manufacturing timber products for export.
