40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} major birth defects diagnosed by 6 years of age in all births and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly conceived by assisted reproductive technology (when this included intracytoplasmic sperm injection and in vitro fertilization [IVF]) and the remainder of nonassisted reproductive technology-conceived children born in Western Australia from 1994 to 2002. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data linkage between three population-based registers (Reproductive Technology Register, Western Australian Register of Developmental Anomalies, and Midwives' <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birth</b> System) to identify all assisted reproductive technology (n= 2, 911) and nonassisted reproductive technology (n= 210, 997) births with and without birth defects diagnosed by age 6 and all terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. RESULTS: A major birth defect was diagnosed in 8. 7 % of assisted reproductive technology and 5. 4 % of nonassisted reproductive technology singletons (odds ratio [OR] 1. 53, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 30 - 1. 79), as well as 7. 1 % of assisted reproductive technology twins and 5. 9 % of nonassisted reproductive technology twins of unlike sex (OR 1. 08, 95 % CI 0. 77 - 1. 51). The prevalence of birth defects in assisted reproductive technology singletons and twins decreased markedly over the study period. This change was evident across all three clinics contributing data over the whole study and was particularly marked for children conceived {{as a result of}} IVF. CONCLUSION: There has been a decrease in the prevalence of birth defects over time in children born as a result of assisted reproductive technology in Western Australia; however, the prevalence of major birth defects in assisted reproductive technology singletons remains increased compared with nonassisted reproductive technology singletons.

40|$|This {{database}} {{has been}} constructed {{to support a}} program of work designed to untangle genetic and environmental contributions to the risk for schizophrenia and other adverse outcomes in the offspring of mothers with schizophrenia and other severe mental illness. To do this, it utilises Western Australian whole-population health and social services databases. Records on the Western Australian psychiatric case register {{have been linked to}} Midwives’ <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Birth</b> records and to Registrations of Births (for paternal links) as well as to other data sets. Maternal links identify women with psychosis who gave birth in Western Australia between 1980 and 2001. Comparison mothers are those with no record of psychiatric illness who gave birth in Western Australia over the same period. The study database comprises 246, 873 mothers and 467, 945 children: 889 mothers with schizophrenia (1, 672 children); 1, 644 mothers with bipolar disorder (3, 358 children); 4, 200 mothers with unipolar major depression (8, 864 children); 775 mothers with other psychoses (1, 592 children); and 239, 365 comparison mothers (452, 459 children). Full psychiatric histories for mothers, fathers and children have been extracted. At the time of the most recent update to the psychiatric data on children, 33, 363 children had a history of psychiatric illness; 5, 500 of these had had at least one contact with mental health services at which a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder had been recorded. Data have also been collected on obstetric complications and a range of infant and childhood morbidities including birth defects, intellectual disability, educational achievement, childhood abuse, criminal offending. The program aims are to: (i) determine the frequency and distribution of obstetric complications in women with schizophrenia compared to a non-psychiatric comparison group of mothers; (ii) explore the spectrum of outcomes for the children born to women with schizophrenia compared to comparison children, and to assess the specificity of these findings to maternal schizophrenia compared to maternal bipolar disorder, unipolar major depression and other psychotic illness; and (iii) examine the relationship between familial psychiatric status, obstetric complications and mental health outcomes for children. The data sit in an Ingres relational database. A full description of the database and its elements has been published [1].

40|$|While {{the infant}} welfare {{movement}} {{and its consequences}} have been wellcovered by social and demographic historians, {{little attention has been}} paid to the development of programmes at a local level. Yet it was at the municipal level that most initiatives emerged prior to the passing of the Maternity and Child Welfare Act of 1918.

The authors of the Huddersfield Scheme, Benjamine Broadbent, Chairman of the Health Commitee, and Dr S. G. H.

25|$|In 1906, {{children}} {{were provided with}} free school meals. However, many local councils ignored this system, as it was not compulsory for them to provide the free meals and {{the cost to the}} council was far greater than was subsidised for. The provision of free school meals was made compulsory in 1914, in which year fourteen million meals per school day were served (compared with nine million per school day in 1910), most of which were free. In 1912, half of all councils in Britain were offering the scheme. Recruitment for the Second Boer War demonstrated the undernourishment and illness among the working classes, and there were fears over future generations being unable to maintain military control of Britain's empire. Also, following an unfavourable report by the Board of Education's inspectors on infant education in 1906, school provision for children under five was restricted (previously, the normal age for the entry of working-class children into full-time education had been three). In 1907, the <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Births</b> Act came into being, which sought to quantify and analyse the causes of (and ultimately further reduce) infant mortality.|$|R
40|$|Background: This article investigates whether {{reading and}} writing skills among {{children}} of equivalent perinatal characteristics differ by neighbourhood socioeconomic status and maternal factors. Methods: <b>Notifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>births</b> for all non-Aboriginal singletons born in 1990 - 1997 in Western Australia subsequently attending government primary schools were linked to the State literacy tests in grade three and with information on socioeconomic status {{of the school and}} the residential area. Using multilevel modelling, the associations between birth characteristics (gestational age, intrauterine growth, birth order and Apgar score at 5 minutes) and literacy attainment in grade three were examined in models that included socioeconomic and demographic factors of the child, mother and community. Results: Higher percentages of optimal head circumference and birth length and term birth were positively and independently associated with literacy scores. A higher percentage <b>of</b> optimal <b>birth</b> weight was associated with higher reading scores especially for children born to mothers residing in educationally advantaged areas. First birth was positively associated with {{reading and writing}} attainment: this association was stronger for children born to single mothers and additional advantage in writing was also associated with first birth in children living in disadvantaged areas. Conclusions: These findings suggest that having sub-optimal growth in utero oran older sibling at birth increases vulnerability to poor literacy attainment especially among children born to single mothers or those in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. These data provide evidence for advocating lifestyles compatible with optimum fetal growth and socioeconomic conditions conducive to healthy lifestyles, particularly during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} aggregated, locally collected birth notification data to examine trends in birth-weight specific survival for singleton and multiple births. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 171, 527 notified births and subsequent infant survival data derived from computerised community child health records. Validation of data completeness and quality was undertaken by comparison with birth and death registration records for the same period. SETTING: <b>Notifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>births</b> in 1989 - 1991 to residents of the North Thames (East) Region (formerly North East Thames Regional Health Authority). OUTCOME MEASURES: Birthweight specific stillbirth, neonatal, and postneonatal death rates. RESULTS: There was close correspondence between the notification and registration data. For 96 % of the registered deaths a birth notification record was identified and {{for the majority of}} these the death was already known to the Community Child Health Computer. Completeness of birth-weight data, particularly {{at the lower end of}} the range, was substantially better in birth notification data. Comparison with the most recent published national data relating to birthweight specific survival of very low birthweight singleton and multiple births suggests that the downward trend of mortality is continuing, at least in this Region. CONCLUSIONS: The use of routinely collected aggregated birth notification data provides a valuable adjunct to existing sources of information about perinatal and infant survival, as well as other information regarding process and outcome of maternity services. Such data are required for comparative audit and may be more complete than that obtained from registration or hospital generated data...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of one centralised National Livestock Database (NLD) for {{the islands of}} Malta and Gozo was of crucial importance in the identification and traceability of bovines from 2002 to date. It was also important in covering legal obligations following Malta’s accession to the European Union (EU) in May 2004. This thesis describes how the processes of identification, registration and traceability of bovines have changed following Malta’s accession to the EU. The validation and integration of data originating from the different departmental sections such as the Identification and Registration section, the slaughterhouse and the National Veterinary Laboratory ensures that any discrepancies are highlighted and can be investigated. The various events recorded on the database allow for the cross-checking of compliance and eligibility of bovine producers applying for EU benefits. The main drawbacks and weak points of the system include financial costs for the government department, potentially late <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>births</b> and deaths <b>of</b> new born calves and the insufficient uptake {{in the use of}} the latest technology by bovine producers for the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> events such as births, deaths and movement of bovines. The fact that the NLD is a computerised and centralised system has made collection, management and analysis of data possible. As a result principles of data mining have been used in this thesis to study in detail ten year trends in the number of bovine dairy holdings together with the bovine population on these holdings and to compare these trends with those reported in other European countries. Six trends related to the number of bovine dairy holdings and their bovine population were analysed in the study: the trend in the number of dairy holdings on the Maltese Islands; the trend in the total number of bovines on dairy holdings; the trend in the number of female bovines over two years of age (F> 2 y); the trend in the average bovine population (average herd size) on dairy holdings; the trend in the average number of female bovines over two years of age; the trend in the number of female and male bovines and their ratios. The general trends showed that there was a significant decrease in the number of dairy holdings, in the bovine population and in the number of female bovines greater than 2 years of age on dairy holdings during the study period. The average herd size and the average number of females greater than 2 years of age on the individual dairy holdings showed no statistically significant changes. On the other hand, a significant increase in the ratio of female to male bovines was registered on these holdings. In the final part of this thesis, data on calf deaths was used to determine the overall mortality rates of live born calves up to 180 days of age in dairy herds on the islands of Malta and Gozo. This is the first time that data using the NLD is being used to determine the calf mortality rates from the whole dairy population of Malta and Gozo. Furthermore, five risk factors namely the island <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> sex <b>of</b> calf, average herd size, the year and the season <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> were also studied. The data set used in the study consisted of a total of 44, 078 calves born between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2011. From this dataset, 28, 848 calves were born in Malta and 15, 230 in Gozo. In total 2, 821 calves were registered as having died before reaching 180 days of age. The overall calf mortality rate in live born calves up to 180 days of age was found to be 7. 08...|$|R

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 19 AUG 2005 Objectives To describe {{the impact of}} rubella immunisation on the incidence of rubella, congenital rubella syndrome and rubella-related terminations of pregnancy in South Australia, and to identify factors associated with a re-emerging problem. Design and Methods A population-based descriptive study using data from South Australian <b>notifications</b> <b>of</b> disease, <b>births</b> and terminations <b>of</b> pregnancy, the rubella immunisation programme, antenatal rubella antibody screening and paediatric hospital case records. Setting South Australia (population 1. 48 million people; 20, 000 births per year). Main outcome measures Incidence of rubella (age-sex specific), congenital rubella syndrome and rubella-related terminations of pregnancy; antenatal rubella sero-positive rates; rubella immunisation uptake rates. Results Rubella notification rates in 1990 – 1996 were significantly higher for males than females for ages 15 – 34 years. There were five cases of congenital rubella syndrome notified in 1980 – 1996 compared with at least 20 confirmed or compatible cases in 1965 – 1979. Rubella-related terminations of pregnancy are now rare, with the last termination for maternal rubella being in 1993. The antenatal rubella sero-positive rate in 1995 was 96. 7 %, but was significantly lower among Asian women born overseas (78. 6 % among those 30 years or older). Vaccination uptake rates in schoolgirls decreased between 1990 and 1994 (91. 2 % to 86. 9 %). Conclusions Since the introduction of rubella immunisation, the incidence of rubella infection among women of reproductive age, and of rubella-related terminations, has fallen. Congenital rubella syndrome has not been notified since 1990 but its risk persists with a recent increase in rubella notifications, a fall in school immunisation rates, a relatively low antenatal sero-positive rate among older Asian women born overseas and the trend towards giving birth at older ages. Effective immunisation programmes must be maintained, particularly in schools and for young children and migrant women. Tracy Cheffins, Annabelle Chan, Rosemary J Keane, Eric A.
