40|$|AbstractHow are {{numerical}} operations implemented {{within the}} human brain? It {{has been suggested}} that {{there are at least three}} different codes for representing number: a verbal code that is used to manipulate number words and perform mental numerical operations (e. g., multiplication), a visual code that is used to decode frequently used visual number forms (e. g., Arabic digits), and an abstract analog code that may be used to represent numerical quantities [1]. Furthermore, each of these codes is associated with a different neural substrate [1 – 3]. We extend these studies using dense-sensor event-related EEG recording techniques to investigate the temporal pattern of notation-specific effects observed in a parity judgement (odd versus even) task in which single numbers were presented in one of four different <b>numerical</b> <b>notations.</b> Contrasts between different notations demonstrated clear modulations in the visual evoked potentials (VEP) recorded. We observed increased amplitudes for the P 1 and N 1 components of the VEP that were specific to Arabic numerals and to dot configurations but differed for random and recognizable (die-face) dot configurations. These results demonstrate clear, notation-specific differences in the time course of numerical information processing and provide electrophysiological support for the triple-code model of numerical representation...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of static output {{feedback}} control of a linear system is considered. The existence of a static output feedback control law is given {{in terms of the}} solvability of two coupled Lyapunov inequalities which result in a non-linear optimisation problem.

The class of plants considered is those which are minimum phase with a full row rank Markov parameter. The method is extended to incorporate H ∞ performance objec-tives. This results in a sub-optimal static H ∞ control law found by non-iterative means.

40|$|Using the Material Engagement Theory of Cognitive Archaeologist Lambros Malafouris as its framework, {{the thesis}} offers a unique {{synthesis}} {{of data from}} neuroscience, ethnography, linguistics, and archaeology to outline how number concepts are realized, manipulated, and elaborated. The process is described as an interactivity of psychological processes like numerosity, behaviors that manipulate objects into concept-generating stimuli, and material objects with semiotic qualities distinct from those of language and agency distinct from that of brains and bodies. The counting technologies of the Ancient Near East (ANE) are then analyzed through archaeological and textual evidence spanning the late Upper Paleolithic to the Bronze Age, from the first realization of number concepts in a pristine original condition to their elaboration {{into one of the}} ancient worldâs greatest mathematical traditions, a foundation for mathematical thinking today. Insights from the way numbers are realized through psychologicalâbehavioralâmaterial interactivity are used to challenge three dominant conceptualizations of ANE numbers: first, the idea that the ANE numerical lexicon would have counted only to very low numbers; second, that Neolithic tokens were the first counting technology; and third, that numbers were âconcreteâ before they became âabstractâ. Considering archaeological evidence from the Epipaleolithic Levant and drawing on linguistic and ethnographic evidence to characterize the regional prehistory, the thesis suggests that the numerical lexicon would have included relatively high numbers prior to the Neolithic; that finger-counting (linguistically attested) and tallies (archaeologically attested) would have preceded tokens; and that numbers are âabstractâ concepts whose content changes in conjunction with the incorporation and use of different material forms. The evidence provided to support these alternatives implies that numbers may have originated in the late Upper Paleolithic and arithmetic early in the Neolithic, pushing the onset of these capabilities further back than is commonly held. In addition to tallies and tokens, the thesis explores fingers and <b>numerical</b> <b>notations</b> as material artifacts, enabling an analysis of how materiality might structure numerical concepts, influence a number systemâs capabilities, limitations, and elaboration potential, and affect brains and behavior over cultural spans of time. Insights generated by the case study are then applied to the role of materiality in cognition more generally, including how concepts become distributed across multiple material forms; the reasons why materiality might be transparent (or invisible) in cognition; and the differences between thinking through and thinking about materiality. </p...|$|R

Methods published to date generally assume a system initially at equilibrium. This paper proposes a technique for modelling an initial state using a hypothetical ‘pre-record sequence’. Owing to the approximations needed to accurately accommodate noise sequences, {{it is necessary}} to linearize problems about some nominal solution; this paper proposes a least-squares solution to a zero-uncertainty non-invalidation problem.

40|$|Classical {{continuum}} mechanical theories {{operate on}} three-dimensional Euclidian space using scalar, vector, and tensor-valued quantities usually {{up to the}} order of four. For their numerical treatment, it is common practice to transform the relations into a matrix–vector format. This transformation is usually performed using the so-called Voigt mapping. This mapping does not preserve tensor character leaving significant room for error as stress and strain quantities follow from different mappings and thus have to be treated differently in certain mathematical operations. Despite its conceptual and notational difficulties having been pointed out, the Voigt mapping remains the foundation of most current finite element programmes. An alternative is the so-called Kelvin mapping which has recently gained recognition in studies of theoretical mechanics. This article is concerned with benefits of the Kelvin mapping in numerical modelling tools such as finite element software. The decisive difference to the Voigt mapping is that Kelvin’s method preserves tensor character, and thus the <b>numerical</b> matrix <b>notation</b> directly corresponds to the original tensor notation. Further benefits in numerical implementations are that tensor norms are calculated identically without distinguishing stress- or strain-type quantities, and tensor equations can be directly transformed into matrix equations without additional considerations. The only implementational changes are related to a scalar factor in certain finite element matrices, and hence, harvesting the mentioned benefits comes at very little cost. Germany.

40|$|Parsing {{a mental}} {{operation}} into components, characterizing the parallel or serial {{nature of this}} flow, and understanding what each process ultimately contributes to response time are fundamental questions in cognitive neuroscience. Here we show how a simple theoretical model leads to an extended set of predictions concerning the distribution of response time and its alteration by simultaneous performance of another task. The model provides a synthesis of psychological refractory period and random-walk models of response time. It merely assumes that a task consists of three consecutive stages-perception, decision based on noisy integration of evidence, and response-and that the perceptual and motor stages can operate simultaneously with stages of another task, while the central decision process constitutes a bottleneck. We designed a number-comparison task that provided a thorough test of the model by allowing independent variations in number <b>notation,</b> <b>numerical</b> distance, response complexity, and temporal asynchrony relative to an interfering probe task of tone discrimination. The results revealed a parsing of the comparison task in which each variable affects only one stage. Numerical distance affects the integration process, {{which is the only}} step that cannot proceed in parallel and has a major contribution to response time variability. The other stages, mapping the numeral to an internal quantity and executing the motor response, can be carried out in parallel with another task.
