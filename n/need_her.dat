Now that she has no {{intention}} of honouring the agreement of her passport, which was to return to South Africa within a year, she openly introduces herself as Burger's daughter. This attracts the attention of the media and she attends several political events. At one such event, Rosa sees Baasie, but when she tries to talk to him, he starts criticising her for not knowing his real name (Zwelinzima Vulindlela). He says that there is nothing special about her father having died in prison as many black fathers have also died there, and adds that he does not <b>need</b> <b>her</b> help. Rosa is devastated by her childhood friend's hurtful remarks, and overcome with guilt, she abandons her plans of going into exile in France and returns to South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Sarita began turning villainous on the June 25 {{episode of}} Xplosion, when she {{interfered}} and helped Wilde defeat Daffney {{to end the}} team's long losing streak. The following week, when Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained {{that she did not}} want to win by cheating, Sarita claimed that she was a winner and, unlike Wilde, did not <b>need</b> <b>her</b> tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde came to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. On the July 1 episode of Impact!, Sarita cemented her villainous turn by attacking Wilde after she had lost her match against the Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne, proclaiming she was sick of losing matches. Sarita and Wilde faced each other on the following episode of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by putting her feet on the ropes for leverage. On the July 15 episode of Impact!, Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight. At the July 26 tapings of Impact!, Stock tore her triceps and was expected to miss two months of in-ring action. She returned at the September 6 tapings of Xplosion, defeating Daffney.|$|E

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{praised the}} April and Andy {{relationship}} and the subplot with Ron and Mark, although he claimed Ron was the funnier of the duo and Mark's character is too normal and boring for the show. Fowler {{also liked the}} way Leslie's political ambition conflicted with her conscience in the episode. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell praised the main plotline with Leslie and the performances by Pratt and Offerman, particularly praising the jokes surrounding Ron's woodworking hobby. Kandell pointed out the episode did not suffer from Ann's absence and suggested although Rashida Jones is charming, the show does not <b>need</b> <b>her.</b> Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club said the episode's main story was [...] "a bit of a trifle" [...] and the subplots were lacking, but that [...] "The Possum" [...] included several laughs and demonstrated Ron and Leslie's opposing attitudes about local government.|$|E

500|$|After {{failing to}} cross a musical and {{colorful}} bridge, the gang falls into a pit where sticky material becomes their zombie-like doppelgangers and moves to chase them. They escape through a Super Mario World-like environment {{and go to the}} house of a toy dog, where they are set up for a trap to eat crumpets with sleeping powder. Mac does not eat the crumpets (since the sleeping powder was thought to be powdered sugar, and he can't eat sugar without temporarily losing his mind) and is able to save the others. As they try to escape, they discover that the heroic man and several others they have met on their journey are all controlled by a single face—World—who can animate and control seemingly anything he latches onto. World is trapped on an apple and the gang leaves it at a desert; but latches on a horse, truly the guise of Mac and the gang rides by, and World is able to move once more. It gallops off to the castle, where the gang find Frankie and attempt to save her. However, Frankie reveals that World never kidnapped her, she was staying of her own free will and is happy to be away from the work at Foster's and Mr. Herriman's constant nagging. The friends then plead with Frankie to come home insisting that they <b>need</b> <b>her</b> to take care of them. She believes their pleas to be selfish and storms off as she is [...] "sick of taking care of everyone and everything without never even receiving a word of thanks, an ounce of help, or a tiny little smidgen of respect". They attempt to console her, but World gasses them and they fall asleep. When they awaken, they find themselves in a fake version of Foster's created by World, who shrank them into it.|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to <b>need</b> <b>her</b> now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to bring us back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall.

500|$|One {{day in the}} mid-1990s, Smith was at {{her home}} talking {{to one of her}} {{daughter}}s on the phone. After telling her mother {{what she was going to}} that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn't have to worry about her. After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn't <b>need</b> <b>her</b> own children worrying about her at the start of their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart (whom she later married in 1997), acting as the album's main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self-titled studio album. Consisting of ten tracks, nine of them were co-written by both Smith and Stuart. Although the album attracted little attention, it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff of the book Country Music: The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded [...] "far gutsier than anything in the Reba and Garth mainstream". Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the release four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a solid effort", also commenting, [...] "...it stands head and shoulders over most of the stuff that's come out of Nash Vegas in over a decade. Even if it doesn't sell a copy, it's a triumphant return for Smith. She hasn't lost a whit of her gift as a singer or as a writer." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an {{audience}} surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type {{to that of}} 2005–06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): [...] "She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who {{at the same time}} embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. [...] Her distinct role within the team {{stems from the fact that}} [...] "she's there for the people", who she feels [...] "instinctive and passionate" [...] about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more [...] "human empathy" [...] than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be [...] "technology-and-alien-obsessed". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: [...] "she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a [...] "fantastic policewoman" [...] prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to [...] "open up by making them feel comfortable". Myles perceived Gwen to be [...] "the heart and emotion of Torchwood", and [...] "Torchwood's social worker" [...] who can [...] "run and fight and stand in her own corner and win". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they <b>need</b> <b>her,</b> just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances [...] "takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged [...] "physically", [...] "mentally" [...] and [...] "morally" [...] through portraying the character.|$|E
