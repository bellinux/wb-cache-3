While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E

500|$|Dunn {{trained and}} rode his first World Grand Championship {{on the bay}} {{stallion}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held {{in front of a}} record crowd of 28,000. [...] "Rebel" [...] was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the [...] "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, [...] "I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> That made it twice as good. It's nice to know that I've got that many friends and supporters." [...] The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{is legal}} to possess a bat'leth on private property; however, they may be seized if they are {{considered}} to be [...] "potential evidence of a criminal lifestyle." [...] They are classed as weapons, which makes it illegal to carry one in a public place. A replica bat'leth was surrendered to Gloucestershire Constabulary as part of the 2006 knife amnesty in the UK. In 2008, a miniature bat'leth was seized in Oxford after a 17-year-old was caught trying to smuggle it into a College. Police described the weapon as [...] "most horrendous". The person was arrested and sentenced to six months in a young offenders' institution. In 2009, a man from Billingham, County Durham, was arrested for possession of a miniature bat'leth in a public street. In the court documents, it was referred to as a [...] "multi-bladed sword", and the judge said [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in my life before." [...] The accused pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court, and he was later sentenced to thirteen weeks in prison. The court ordered that the bat'leth was to be forfeited and destroyed. A custom-made bat'leth was seized in 2009 in Accrington, Lancashire.|$|E

Once you're inside you really can't tell where you are - what's north, south, east or west. The way it's designed, it's an interesting kind of setup," [...] Nolan said. [...] "Because of the high value of targets they have there – on a world scale, whether it be a drug cartel or terrorists – they are as concerned with someone trying to get in to break someone out as much as they are about inmates trying to escape. The protection around the prison is pretty remarkable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kimmel's biggest {{influences}} in comedy are David Letterman and Howard Stern.

[...] Kimmel has often joked that the only reason he got into show business was just so he can be friends with Letterman, he has also questioned why anybody would watch his show instead of Letterman's. Kimmel wrote a piece for Time writing his love for Letterman by saying, [...] "As I write this, there are only 10 shows left before the funniest, most inventive and smartest man who ever wore an Alka Seltzer suit goes fishing for good. None of us who discovered Dave on our own and claimed him as our own {{will ever be able to}} satisfactorily explain to the younger people who didn’t what he did, what he meant and what he means.

2500|$|The first {{reports that}} Jackson had {{suffered}} a cardiac arrest then that he had died came from the Los Angeles-based celebrity news website TMZ.
