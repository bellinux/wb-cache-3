5|$|The note {{appears to}} have {{originally}} been signed, but the name was torn off or burned off so that her body could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified.</b> When the announcement was printed in the local newspaper, The Cambrian, therefore, it did not refer to Imlay specifically.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rifle, {{without the}} {{silencer}} or sights attached, {{was lying on}} her body pointing up at her neck. June's Bible {{lay on the floor}} to the right of Sheila. It was normally kept in a bedside cupboard. June's fingerprints were on it, as were others that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified,</b> including one made by a child.|$|E

5|$|A {{memorial}} at St Magnus' Cathedral {{in nearby}} Kirkwall displays a plaque dedicated {{to those who}} lost their lives, beneath which a book of remembrance lists their names. This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. Each week a page {{of the book is}} turned. The ship's bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, was added to the memorial in St Magnus'. A number of bodies, including some that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified,</b> were interred at the naval cemetery in Lyness.|$|E
5|$|A partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, {{the first}} ever for a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on {{the portion of the}} braincase {{articulated}} with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> for certain.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. The coin, which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of the coin. The symbols could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> as {{the upper part of the}} coin was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed into}} the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 local time. Countless {{people in the streets}} of New York City witnessed the strike, but few video recordings captured the moment. Documentary film maker Jules Naudet captured the only known footage of the initial impact from start to finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began to report on the incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse 102minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the recovery effort at the World Trade Center site, workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight11 victims, but many body fragments could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified.</b>|$|E
5|$|Charles Doolittle Walcott {{found in}} the Burgess Shale nine almost {{complete}} fossils of Opabinia regalis {{and a few of}} what he classified as Opabinia media, and published a description of all of these in 1912. The generic name is derived from Opabin pass between Mount Hungabee and Mount Biddle, southeast of Lake O'Hara, British Columbia, Canada. In 1966–1967 Harry B. Whittington found another good specimen, and in 1975 he published a detailed description based on very thorough dissection of some specimens and photographs of these specimens lit from a variety of angles. Whittington's analysis did not cover Opabinia media: Walcott's specimens of this species could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> in his collection. In 1960 Russian paleontologists described specimens they {{found in the}} Norilsky region of Siberia and labelled Opabinia norilica, but these fossils were poorly preserved, and Whittington did not feel they provided enough information to be classified as members of the genus Opabinia.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to racial}} {{segregation}} at the time, the coffins provided {{were used for}} the white victims, most of whom received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach. The bodies of the African Americans who were killed and some of those whose race could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> were disposed of by other means. Some were burned in funeral pyres, while many were placed into mass graves, including about 1,600 in Port Mayaca, 674 at the pauper's cemetery, at least 22 in Miami Locks (now known as Lake Harbor), 28 in Ortona, and 22 in Sebring. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies buried at Loxahatchee. After the burials were complete, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith proclaimed an hour of mourning on October1 for those who died during the storm. A funeral service was hosted by several local clergymen and attended by about 3,000people, including educator Mary McLeod Bethune. A memorial was placed at Woodlawn Cemetery in memory of the victims of the storm, but no such marker was placed at the pauper's cemetery.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office {{investigated}} Borislav Pelević, {{a former}} SDG member {{and a member}} of the Serbian National Assembly. The investigation was ultimately dropped due to lack of evidence. In 2012, former SDG member Srđan Golubović was arrested in Belgrade at the request of the Prosecutor's Office. Golubović was charged with an indictment listing the names of 78 victims. Clint Williamson, the lead prosecutor, said that other members of the SDG could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> because their faces had been covered with masks. As of October 2014, closing arguments had been concluded in the trial of Karadžić, the former President of Republika Srpska, for the massacre, and other crimes against humanity committed in Bijeljina, among other areas, as well as for the genocide at Srebrenica. The ICTY is expected to deliver judgment in Karadžić's case in the first quarter of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance by Junkers Ju 86 {{aircraft}} {{had identified}} the airfields as fighter bases. The high altitude and poor {{resolution of the}} photographs meant the aircraft on the ground could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> properly and the Germans mistakenly believed them to be fighter fields. In fact, none of the airfields belonged to Fighter Command. Gosport housed a torpedo development unit, Thorney Island housed No. 59 Squadron RAF and No. 235 Squadron RAF with Bristol Blenheims assigned to RAF Coastal Command. Ford was a naval air station and housed No. 829 Squadron Fleet Air Arm which was working up with Fairey Albacore aircraft at the time. These targets were given to Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (StG 77 or Dive Bombing Wing 77). The Geschwader committed 109 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers to the raid. It was the largest concentration of Ju 87s to operate over Britain to date.|$|E
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified,</b> though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E

5|$|Several {{thousand}} animal {{bones were}} discovered in Mummy Cave. While {{the large majority of}} the bones could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified,</b> researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were able to determine the biological origins of over two thousand bones. As at many other archeological sites in the region, significant numbers of Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and deer from the genus Odocoileus were identified. Of particular interest to biologists was the much larger number of sheep than deer: eighty-eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified. Such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in the region, because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such as the one in which Mummy Cave is located. This anomaly has led researchers at UTEP to propose that the site was used as a home base for hunters to operate at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 Okeechobee {{hurricane}} caused {{at least}} 2,500deaths, {{most of which}} were migrant, black farmer workers around Lake Okeechobee. Due to racial segregation at the time, the coffins provided were used for the white victims, most of whom received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach. The bodies of the black people who were killed, and some of those whose race could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified,</b> were disposed of by other means.

5|$|Triaenops goodmani is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Triaenops. It is known from three lower jaws {{collected}} in a cave at Anjohibe in 1996, and described as a new species in 2007. The material is at most 10,000 years old. A bat humerus (upper arm bone) from the same site could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> as either T.goodmani or the living T.menamena. T.goodmani is identifiable {{as a member of}} Triaenops or the related genus Paratriaenops by a number of features of the teeth, such as the single-cusped, canine-like fourth premolar and the presence of a gap between the entoconid and hypoconulid cusps on the first two molars. T.goodmani is larger than the living species of Triaenops and Paratriaenops on Madagascar, and on the first molar the protoconid cusp is only slightly higher than the hypoconid, not much higher as in the other species.|$|E

5|$|Unbinilium has not {{yet been}} synthesized, despite {{multiple}} attempts from German and Russian teams. One 2011 attempt from the German team had a suggestive but not conclusive result suggesting the possible production of 299Ubn, but there were several inconsistencies with the theoretically expected decay energies and half-lives of 299Ubn and its daughters and the implanting compound nucleus and evaporation residue could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> with certainty. Planned attempts from Russian, Japanese, and French teams are scheduled for 2017–2020. Experimental evidence from these attempts show that the period 8 elements will likely be far more difficult to synthesise than the previous known elements, and that unbinilium may even be the last element that can be synthesized with current technology. Its position as the seventh alkaline earth metal suggests that it would have similar properties to its lighter congeners, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbinilium is expected to be less reactive than barium and radium and be closer in behavior to strontium, and while it should show the characteristic +2 oxidation state of the alkaline earth metals, it is also predicted to show the +4 oxidation state unknown in any other alkaline earth metal.|$|E
