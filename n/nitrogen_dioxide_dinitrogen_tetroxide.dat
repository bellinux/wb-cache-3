5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dioxide</b> (NO2), and <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>dioxide</b> is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. <b>Dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s.

One such process is eliminating the use of NaNO3 from the process. The addition of persufate (S2O82−) ensures the complete oxidation and exfoliation of graphite to yield suspensions of individual graphite oxide sheets. The elimination of nitrate is also advantageous as it stops the production of gases such as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dioxide</b> and <b>dinitrogen</b> tetraoxide.|$|R

They also hypothesized water molecules promote the ionization of N2O5 to NO2+NO3−.When NO2 reacts with HCl (in the form of NO2+NO3−), it creates ClO and HNO3, and when N2O5 reacts with HCl, it forms ClNO2 and HNO3.|$|R

40|$|The drug {{molsidomine}} is metabolized by hepatic esterases to SIN- 1 {{that further}} reacts with molecular oxygen to yield nitric oxide and superoxide. Both radicals can recombine {{to give the}} harmful entity peroxynitrite. Consequently, SIN- 1 is frequently used in cell culture studies as (an extracellularly operating) peroxynitrite generator. However, {{little is known about}} the nature of the reactive species produced intracellulary from SIN- 1. In the present study I demonstrated that SIN- 1 can easily penetrate cell membranes as exemplified with L- 929 mouse fibroblasts. Intracellularly decaying SIN- 1 partly generates nitric oxide as monitored by two independent methods, i. e. the fluorescent nitric oxide scavenger FNOCT- 1 and the nitric oxide electrode. Moreover, reactive nitrogen-oxide species (e. g. peroxynitrite, <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dioxide,</b> <b>dinitrogen</b> trioxide) were intracellularly formed as detected with the scavenger DAF- 2. Laser scanning microscopy revealed that in L- 929 cells SIN- 1 -derived species initially oxidized the major fraction of the NAD(P) H within the cytosol and the nuclei, whereas the mitochondrial level of NAD(P) H was somewhat increased. This opposite behavior is conclusively explained by the capabilities of SIN- 1 to simultaneously generate reactive nitrogen-oxide species (like peroxynitrite and dinitrogen trioxide) and freely diffusing nitric oxide in the intracellular milieu. These observations may lead to the conclusion that SIN- 1 penetrated in vivo its target cells in order to stimulate the release of freely diffusing NO. Nitric oxide as well as RNOS decisively affect cellular metabolism, a fact that should be examined in cell culture systems by detecting the NAD(P) H level. In any case care should be taken in experimental systems to apply SIN- 1 as an exclusively peroxynitrite-generating compound...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{reversible}} {{gas phase}} reaction <b>dinitrogen</b> <b>tetroxide</b> to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dioxide</b> is very suitable for an integrated physical chemistry project incorporating thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, spectroscopy, and kinetics. Furthermore, nitrogen oxides are molecules of current interest given their important role in atmospheric chemistry. Only relatively common equipment and chemicals are required for the experiment. It consists of the synthesis of NO 2 and {{of the study of}} the UVvis electronic absorption spectrum of the NO 2 /N 2 O 4 gas mixture as a function of temperature. From the analysis of the spectra, the absorption spectra of the pure constituents are obtained as well as the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant of the reaction. From this dependence, the enthalpy and the entropy of the reaction are obtained. The values are analyzed and compared with statistical mechanical calculations. The kinetics of the reaction is also discussed.
