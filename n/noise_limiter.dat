50|$|Dynamic <b>noise</b> <b>limiter</b> (DNL) is {{an audio}} noise {{reduction}} system originally introduced by Philips in 1971 {{for use on}} cassette decks. Its circuitry is also based on a single chip.|$|E
40|$|A blanker {{system that}} may be used with audio <b>noise</b> <b>limiters</b> or {{automatic}} <b>noise</b> <b>limiters</b> was described. The system employs a pair of silicon diodes and two RC filters connected across the feedback impedance of an operational amplifier so as to counteract impulse noise interference caused by local spherics activity or 60 Hz harmonics radiated from ac motor control systems. The following information is given: circuit diagram and description, operating details, evaluation, discussion of other noise blanking methods...|$|R
5000|$|The beacons {{that are}} between 510 kHz and 530 kHz can {{sometimes}} be heard on AM radios that can tune below {{the beginning of the}} Medium Wave(MW) broadcast band. Frequencies close to the MW band, like 515 kHz, may be within the receive bandwidth of some AM radios. However, reception of NDBs generally requires a radio receiver that can receive frequencies below 530 kHz (the longwave band). A NDB in Miramichi, New Brunswick once operated at 530 kHz as [...] "F9" [...] but had later moved to 520 kHz. Most so-called [...] "shortwave" [...] radios also include mediumwave and longwave, and they can usually receive all frequencies from 150 kHz to 30 MHz, which makes them ideal for listening to NDBs. Whilst this type of receiver is adequate for reception of local beacons, specialized techniques (receiver preselectors, <b>noise</b> <b>limiters</b> and filters) are required for the reception of very weak signals from remote beacons.|$|R
50|$|Foster-Seeley discriminators are {{sensitive}} to both frequency and amplitude variations, unlike some detectors. Therefore a limiter amplifier stage must be used before the detector, to remove amplitude variations in the signal which would be detected as <b>noise.</b> The <b>limiter</b> acts as a class-A amplifier at lower amplitudes; at higher amplitudes it becomes a saturated amplifier which clips off the peaks and limits the amplitude.|$|R
50|$|Philips {{developed}} an alternative noise reduction system known as Dynamic <b>Noise</b> <b>Limiter</b> (DNL) {{which did not}} require the tapes to be processed during recording; {{this was also the}} basis of the later DNR noise reduction.|$|E
50|$|A sound limiter or <b>noise</b> <b>limiter</b> is {{a digital}} device {{fitted with a}} {{microphone}} to measure the sound pressure level of environmental noise, expressed by the decibel logarithmic unit (dB). If the environmental noise level {{as measured by the}} microphone exceeds a pre-set level for {{a certain amount of time}} (e.g. 5 seconds), the limiter’s circuitry will cut the power supply to the musical equipment and PA system for a brief amount of time.|$|E
50|$|The SX-117 was {{a triple}} {{conversion}} {{intermediate frequency receiver}} designed to cover the 10 meter to 80 meter amateur radio bands with an additional band switch setting for WWV on 10 MHz. The first and third conversion oscillators were crystal-controlled. The second was variable from 6 to 6.5 MHz. Introduced in 1962 at a price of $379.95, it had a product detector for SSB, a notch filter, and selectable bandwidth of 0.5, 2.5, and 5 KHz. In addition to the ham bands, general coverage was possible for most frequencies in 500 kHz segments from 85 kHz to 30 MHz with appropriate crystals. For frequencies below 3 MHz, the HA-10 LF/MF converter was an optional accessory costing $24.95. The receiver featured 13 vacuum tubes plus solid state rectifiers and a <b>noise</b> <b>limiter.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a simple nonlinear model of economics to which strong multiplicative noise is added, and find two distinct generic control regimes. In {{the regime of}} noisy behavior, {{the application of the}} control is able to reduce noise only if the underlying periodicity is correctly taken into account. In the chaotic regime, a shift of the optimal control point relative to the noise-free control point is observed, scaling linearly with the noise strength. The best control results emerge for unstable orbits of period-one, which suggests, that economic systems should preferably be controlled on these states. control, simple <b>limiter,</b> <b>noise,</b> chaos, nonlinear system...|$|R
40|$|A {{signal-to-noise}} ratio (SNR) determination of an input is described, having signal components {{within a given}} frequency range and noise components, without actual measurement of the <b>noise</b> components. Bandpass <b>limiter</b> having a constant signal plus noise output level {{is connected to the}} output of the first filter, the {{signal-to-noise ratio}} of the input to the bandpass limiter being linearly related to the dbm level of signal components at the output. Calibration is connected to the bandpass limiter and is responsive to the signal components at the output to derive the SNR of the input to the determination circuit. The SNR determination circuit is disclosed for use in a diversity receiver having a plurality of input channels...|$|R
25|$|FM is {{also used}} at {{intermediate}} frequencies by analog VCR systems (including VHS) to record the luminance (black and white) portions of the video signal. Commonly, the chrominance component is recorded as a conventional AM signal, using the higher-frequency FM signal as bias. FM is the only feasible method of recording the luminance ("black and white") component of video to (and retrieving video from) magnetic tape without distortion; video signals have a large range of frequency components – from a few hertz to several megahertz, too wide for equalizers to work with due to electronic noise below −60dB. FM also keeps the tape at saturation level, acting {{as a form of}} <b>noise</b> reduction; a <b>limiter</b> can mask variations in playback output, and the FM capture effect removes print-through and pre-echo. A continuous pilot-tone, if added to the signal – as was done on V2000 and many Hi-band formats – can keep mechanical jitter under control and assist timebase correction.|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} phase preserving amplitude <b>noise</b> <b>limiter</b> {{suitable for}} constant envelope phase-modulated signals is experimentally demonstrated for 10 -Gb/s differential phase-shift-keying (DPSK) signals exploiting injection locking in Fabry–Pérot lasers. The limiter operates successfully over a 16. 4 -nm tuning range leading to 12 dB of power penalty reduction for 10 ^- 3 of bit-error-rate (BER) performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{reliability}} of electronic device is threatened in high power microwave (HPM) environment. In {{accordance with the}} situation that the emulation is ineffective in evaluating the accuracy and precision of the HPM effect to electronic de-vice, the experimental method is used to resolve the problem. Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) and Limiter are selected as the objects for the experiments, the structural characteristic of the front-end of radar receiver is described, the phe-nomena and criterion are elaborated and analyzed using injection method due to its ability to get an accurate threshold avoiding the complex coupling, the basic principle of injection experiment is demonstrated, and the method and process of effect experiment about Low <b>Noise</b> Amplifier and <b>Limiter</b> are also explained. The experimental system is established, and the system is composed of low power microwave source such as TWT, test equipment for obtaining the effect pa-rameters, and some of auxiliary equipments as camera, optical microscope or electron microscopy, attenuator, detector, and directional coupler etc. The microwave delivered from source is adjusted to the power infused by attenuator, and pour in the decanting point of effecter via directional coupler, then the couple signal created by directional coupler is input to the recording instrument after detecting by detector, finally the power of effecter is obtained. The value of power, which damages the effecter in the microwave pulse environment, is classified at the index of sensitivity, and the threshold is obtained by power diagnose and wave test.
