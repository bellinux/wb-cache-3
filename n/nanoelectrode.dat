50|$|In synthesizing {{core shell}} nanoparticles, {{scientists}} have studied and found several wet chemical methods, such as chemical precipitation, sol-gel, microemulsion and inverse micelle formation. Those {{methods have been}} used to grow core shell chalcogenide nanoparticles with an emphasis on better control of size, shape, and size distribution. To control the growth of nanoparticles with tunable optical properties, supporing matrices such as glasses, zeolites, polymers or fatty acids have been used. In addition, to prepare nanoparticles of sulfides, selenides and tellurides, the Langmuir-Blodgett film technique has been used successfully. In comparison to wet chemical methods, electrochemical synthesis is more desirable, {{such as the use of}} aqueous solvents rather than toxic organic solvents, formation of conformal deposits, room-temperature deposition, low cost, and precise control of composition and thickness of semiconductor coating on metal nanoparticles. However, owing to the difficulty of preparing electrically addressable arrays of nanoparticles, the use of electrochemical techniques to produce core-shell nanoparticles was difficult. Recently, Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) and Copper iodide (CuI) was electrochemically grown on a 3-D <b>nanoelectrode</b> array via layer-by-layer depositing of alternating layers of nanoparticles and Polyoxometalate(POM).|$|E
50|$|Recently, a {{great deal}} of {{progress}} has been made in the development of reliable conductance-measuring techniques. These techniques can be divided into two categories: molecular film experiments, which measure groups of tens of molecules, and single-molecule-measuring experiments.==Molecular film experiments== Molecular film experiments generally consist of the sandwiching of a thin layer of molecules between two electrodes which are used to measure the conductance through the layer. Two of the most successful implementations of this concept have been the bulk electrode approach and in the use of nanoelectrodes. In the bulk electrode approach, a molecular film is typically immobilized onto one electrode and an upper electrode is brought into contact with it allowing for a measure of current flow as a function of applied bias voltage. The <b>nanoelectrode</b> class of experiments, in creatively utilizing equipment such as atomic force microscope tips and small-radius wires, are able to perform the same sorts of current versus applied bias measurements but on a much smaller number of molecules as compared to bulk electrode. For instance, the tip of an atomic force microscope can be used as a top electrode and, given the nano-scale radius of curvature of the tip, the number of molecules measured is drastically cut. The difficulties encountered in these experiments have come mainly in dealing with such thin layers of molecules which often results in problems with short-circuiting the electrodes.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} {{approximation}} of electroneutrality is inappropriate for analyzing the voltammetric response of <b>nanoelectrodes.</b> Therefore, the microelectrode theory for extracting the standard rate constant k(0) for electron transfer from steady-state voltammograms is invalid for <b>nanoelectrodes.</b> Unlike previous approaches, we considered {{the influence of}} the interfacial potential distribution caused by the absence of electroneutrality. We estimated the magnitude of the error at low overpotential incurred as a result of ignoring the absence of electroneutrality and found that it was small. In this region, electrochemical reaction appears to be limited by the rate of electron transfer. Under these conditions, k(0) can be obtained from steady-state voltammogram data in a low overpotential region according to an approximate form of the Butler-Volmer equation. This procedure can greatly simplify analysis and calculation of the rate constant k(0) at <b>nanoelectrodes.</b> Steady-state voltammogram of equal-concentration hexacyanoferrate(III) /(II) (Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) /Fe(CN) (6) (4 -)) and ferrocenylmethyltrimethylammonium(III) /(II) (FcTMA(2 +) /FcTMA(+)) redox couples were investicated at Pt-Ir <b>nanoelectrodes</b> {{in the presence of a}} support electrolyte. k(0) for Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) /Fe(CN) (6) (4 -) and FcTMA(2 +) /FcTMA(+) at Pt-Ir <b>nanoelectrodes</b> were evaluated...|$|R
