5|$|In United States v. Phillips (1832), the Court {{dismissed}} {{a criminal}} action, on {{the motion of}} the Attorney General, pursuant to the district prosecutor's filing of a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> motion (a motion by the prosecutor to dismiss the case) in the trial court, even though the <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> motion was filed after the writ of error issued from the Supreme Court. Phillips has been cited as an early example of judicial recognition of the norm of prosecutorial enforcement discretion and as an example of mootness (although the Phillips Court did not use that term). The underlying case had involved the prosecution of Zalegman Phillips, a prominent Philadelphia attorney, for interfering with diplomatic immunity, as protected by the Crimes Act of 1790, by filing a lawsuit against a former diplomat. The question certified was whether the provision extended to former diplomats.|$|E

25|$|After Camp {{was arrested}} for murder, his bail was posted by several former Unionists, among them future Knoxville Journal editor William Rule. Knoxville's pro-Democratic newspaper, the Daily Press and Herald, dubbed Camp a cold-blooded killer, while the city's pro-Republican paper, the Knoxville Whig, hailed him as a hero. The county's acting {{district}} attorney eventually issued a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi,</b> and Camp was never prosecuted for the killing. Henry Marshall Ashby was buried in Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson Davis {{was imprisoned}} at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until his {{release on bail}} on May 13, 1867. During his confinement, the United States Government {{prepared}} {{to bring him to}} trial for treason and for complicity in the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. He could not be tried in Virginia until the Federal court was reestablished there, {{but by the time the}} circuit judges were prepared in May 1867, the United States Government decided the outcome of a trial before a local jury was far too uncertain and dropped the proceedings. In November 1868, Davis was brought to trial under a new indictment, but the judges disagreed and the case was referred to the Supreme Court. President Johnson issued a general amnesty in December 1868 and the Supreme Court entered a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi,</b> thus freeing Davis.|$|E
25|$|Functions of {{the state}} and federal attorneys-general include the {{administration}} of the selection of persons for nomination to judicial posts, and authorizing prosecutions. In normal circumstances, the prosecutorial powers of the Attorney-General are exercised by the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff; however, the Attorney-General maintains formal control, including the power to initiate and terminate public prosecutions and take over private prosecutions. Statutory criminal law provides that prosecutions for certain offences require the individual consent of the Attorney-General. This is generally for offences whose illegality is of a somewhat controversial nature or where there is perceived to be a significant risk that prosecutions of a political nature may be embarked upon. The Attorney-General also generally has the power to issue certificates legally conclusive of certain facts (e.g., that the revelation of certain matters in court proceedings might constitute a risk to national security); the facts stated in such certificates must be accepted by the courts and cannot legally be disputed by any parties. The Attorney-General also has the power to issue a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> with respect to a case, which authoritatively determines that the state (in whose name prosecutions are brought) does not wish to prosecute the case, so preventing any person from doing so.|$|E
500|$|The most noted {{prerogative}} {{power that}} affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy, which has two elements: the granting of pardons and the granting of <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi.</b> Pardons may eliminate the [...] "pains, penalties and punishments" [...] from a criminal conviction, though they do not remove convictions themselves. This power is commonly exercised {{on the advice of}} the Secretary of State for the Home Department; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use. Exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations, a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced, on certain conditions. The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review, as confirmed by Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof, as in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley. Granting <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales (or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland) {{in the name of the}} crown, to stop legal proceedings against an individual. This is not reviewable by the courts, as confirmed by R v Comptroller of Patents, and does not count as an acquittal; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date.|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 1863, at the Court's suggestion, the {{government}} filed a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> motion and Jackalow was discharged. Jackalow was admonished {{to leave the}} country and never return, and he complied. Three years after Jackalow's first trial, {{the government}} was unable to locate witnesses for a retrial and persisted in [...] Justice Grier, again riding circuit, reportedly stated: [...] "If the Supreme Court of the United States can't make up its mind whether the place where the murder was committed was within the jurisdiction of the states or on the high seas, I am not going to come so near committing judicial murder as to set twelve men guessing at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevenson was {{a leading}} member of the legal team {{assisting}} Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller during the failed prosecution of alleged serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams in 1957. The prosecution's conduct of the trial has been heavily criticised, and its decision to drop a second murder charge via a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> was scathingly described by the trial judge, Patrick Devlin, as [...] "an abuse of process". Stevenson was {{of the opinion that}} had he been allowed to, he [...] "could have successfully prosecuted Adams on six murder counts". Journalist Rodney Hallworth reports that Stevenson said of Adams' decision not to give evidence in court [...] "I firmly believe justice is not served by the present law. It should be possible for the prosecution to directly examine an accused... It was a clear example of the privilege of silence having enabled a guilty man to escape." [...] In Stevenson's opinion Adams [...] "was so incredibly lucky to have literally got away with murder".|$|E
2500|$|... "The use of <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> {{to conceal}} the {{deficiencies}} of the prosection was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that {{there might have been}} something in the talk of mass murder after all" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Elizabeth [...] "Lily" [...] Shields — Mitchell's housekeeper. She {{was named}} by Weir as having {{provided}} the getaway car {{for those who}} attacked McArdle's Bar and Donnelly's Bar. Charges were later brought against her for withholding information regarding the latter attack. However, the trial judge and DPP brought a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> against the charge in April 1981.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{not guilty}} verdict on {{the count of}} murdering Morrell, the normal process {{would have been to}} bring the {{indictment}} regarding Mrs Hullett to trial, either a full trial or, in view of the acquittal in Mrs Morrell's case, so that Adams would plead not guilty, the Attorney-General would offer no evidence and the judge would direct the jury to bring in a not guilty verdit, the course Devlin expected. However the Attorney-General, as a minister of the Crown had the power to suspend an indictment through a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi,</b> something which Devlin said had never been used to prevent an accused from an acquittal, suggesting this was done because Manningham-Buller did not want a second acquittal and the loss of both the cases he had indicted. <b>Nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> could legitimately be used in cases to protect a guilty person granted immunity to turn Queen's evidence [...] or to save the lives of the innocent, or sometimes on compassionate grounds.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{members of}} Carbajal's group, led by Major Alfred Norton and A.J. Mason, {{conducted}} an armed raid in Carbajal's name on Reynosa on March 25, 1853. General William S. Harney had Carbajal {{and some of}} his associates arrested and indicted [...] on March 31 by U.S. District Attorney William Pitt Ballinger. <b>Nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> (unwilling to pursue) was entered in the case in June 1855.|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{was acquitted}} {{on the first}} count of murder, and the second charge was {{controversially}} dropped via a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> – an act by the prosecution that was later called by Devlin an [...] "abuse of process". Adams was thought by pathologist Francis Camps to have murdered up to 163 patients. Historian Pamela Cullen and the assistant investigating officer, Charles Hewett suspected political interference to ensure his acquittal.|$|E
2500|$|Laurence McClure — a UVF {{volunteer}} and RUC SPG officer, having joined the Armagh SPG in May 1975. He {{was a close}} neighbour of James Mitchell and owned a repair garage adjacent to the farm. McClure was named by Weir as having taken part in several sectarian attacks including those at Donnelly's Bar and the Rock Bar, the latter {{for which he was}} convicted and received a two-year sentence, suspended for three years. Weir alleges that McClure had helped assemble the bombs used in Dublin. McClure admitted being a getaway driver for those involved in the Donnelly's Bar bombing and to have waited in the car with Lily Shields; the two acting as a [...] "courting couple". McClure was charged with withholding information in relation to the attack on [...] Donnelly's Bar. The barrister for the UDR and the police ... said he had obtained a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> sentence, a Latin legal phrase meaning [...] "to be unwilling to pursue" [...] (amounting to [...] "do not prosecute") against the charge. The only person who can authorise a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> is the Attorney General.|$|E
2500|$|On May 6, 1922, Shea, Murphy, Jerry Horan, {{and five}} other labor leaders were {{arrested and charged with}} the murder of a Chicago police officer.

She was arraigned for the crime." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{pre-trial hearing}} began on 19 December 1990 in the Supreme Court of South Australia, with Justice Duggan as the {{presiding}} judge. The prosecution decided after Justice Duggan's findings {{two days earlier}} to have Einem tried separately for the murders of Alan Barnes and Mark Langley. Justice Duggan ruled that the evidence relating to the Richard Kelvin murder and from the various associates of Einem and hitchhikers was inadmissible, although he did rule that [...] "B"'s evidence could be heard, but with the defence allowed to question the evidence as it was being given. This was a shattering blow for the prosecution's case, and on 21 December 1990, on advice from the Attorney-General of South Australia, prosecutors withdrew the charge {{for the murder of}} Mark Langley. The prosecution tried to continue with the charge for the murder of Alan Barnes, however with the problems of getting enough evidence admitted into court from associates about von Einem picking up hitchhikers to convict Einem still too great, the final charge was withdrawn on 1 February 1991. The prosecution, on the advice of the Attorney-General, then entered a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> for the Alan Barnes murder charge.|$|E
2500|$|The Attorney General also superintends the Government Legal Department and the Serious Fraud Office. The Attorney General {{also has}} powers to bring [...] "unduly lenient" [...] {{sentences}} and points of law to the Court of Appeal, issue writs of <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi</b> to cancel criminal prosecutions, supervise other prosecuting bodies (such as DEFRA) and advise individual ministers facing legal {{action as a}} result of their official actions. He is responsible for making applications to the court restraining vexatious litigants, and may intervene in litigation to represent the interests of charity, or the public interest in certain family law cases. He or she is also officially the leader of the Bar of England and Wales, although this is merely custom and has no duties or rights attached to it. The Attorney General's duties have long been considered strenuous, with Sir Patrick Hastings saying that [...] "to be a law officer is to be in hell". Since the passing of the Law Officers Act 1997, any duties of the Attorney General can be delegated to the Solicitor General for England and Wales, and his or her actions are treated as coming from the Attorney General.|$|E
2500|$|In view of {{the general}} {{election}} at the accession of George III, Lucas published in November 1760 a pamphlet entitled Seasonable Advice to the Electors... of Ireland in general, to those of Dublin in particular. In the same month he determined to offer himself {{as a candidate for}} the city of Dublin, notwithstanding the consequent loss of his practice in London. After assuring himself that the electors of Dublin [...] "were warmed with the same sentiments in which he left them," [...] he obtained a personal interview with the king in order to petition for pardon, and being favourably received was enabled to return to Dublin, 15 March 1761, on a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi.</b> His return was the occasion of great popular rejoicing; the order for his disfranchisement was annulled at the midsummer assembly of the corporation; and in July the degree of Doctor of Physic was conferred upon him by Trinity College, Dublin. During the election Lucas's colleague, Colonel Dunn, withdrew his candidature in order to insure Lucas's return, which was strongly opposed by the aldermanic party. After a thirteen days' poll he and Recorder Grattan, father of Henry Grattan, were elected, and he continued to represent Dublin City till his death in 1771.|$|E

Ask anyone at the Drones, and they will tell you that it was a black day for the dear old club when this chap Glossop somehow wriggled into the list of members.

As for de Guerchy, he resigned (1767), and presently died of sheer annoyance, while his enemy, the Chevalier, stayed in England as London correspondent of Louis XV. He reported, in 1766, that Lord Bute was a Jacobite, and de Broglie actually took seriously the chance of restoring, by Bute's aid, Charles III., who had just succeeded, by the death of the Old Chevalier, to 'a kingdom not of this world.' ...|$|E
60|$|Henry Devarges looked speechlessly {{upon his}} companion. Her voice trembled, {{there were tears}} in her eyes, that had {{replaced}} the burning light of womanly indignation. He had come there knowing her to have been doubly treacherous to her husband and himself. She had not denied it. He had come there to tax her with an infamous imposture, but had found himself within the last minute glowing with sympathetic condemnation of his own brother, and ready to accept the yet unoffered and perfectly explicable theory of that imposture. More than that, he began to feel that his own wrongs were slight in comparison with the injuries received by this superior woman. The woman who endeavours to justify herself to her jealous lover, always has a powerful ally in his own self-love, and Devarges was quite willing to believe that even if he had lost her love, he had never at least been deceived. And the answer to the morality of this imposture was before him. Here was she married to the surviving brother of the girl she had personated. Had he--had Dr. Devarges ever exhibited as noble trust, as perfect appreciation of her nature and sufferings? Had they not thrown away the priceless pearl of this woman's love through ignorance and selfishness? You and I, my dear sir, who are not in love with this most reprehensible creature, will be quick to see the imperfect logic of Henry Devarges, but when a man constitutes himself accuser, judge, and jury of the woman he loves, he is very apt to believe he is giving a verdict when he is only entering a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi.</b> It is probably that Mrs. Conroy had noticed this weakness in her companion, even with her preoccupied fears of the inopportune appearance of Victor, whom she felt she could have accounted for much better in his absence. Victor was an impulsive person, and there are times when this quality, generally adored by a self-restrained sex, is apt to be confounding.|$|E
6000|$|He {{commenced}} {{what might}} be called a campaign of attack in 1720, with the publication of his tract entitled, [...] "A Modest Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufactures." [...] As has been pointed out in the notes prefixed to the pamphlets in the present volume, England had, apparently, gone to work systematically to ruin Irish manufactures. They seemed to threaten ruin to English industries; at least so the people in England thought. The pernicious legislation began in the reign of Charles II. and continued in that of William III. The Irish manufacturer was not permitted to export his products and found a precarious livelihood in a contraband trade. Swift's [...] "Proposal" [...] is one of retaliation. Since England will not allow Ireland to send out her goods, let the people of Ireland use them, and let them join together and determine to use nothing from England. Everything that came from England should be burned, except the people and the coal. If England had the right to prevent the exportation of the goods made in Ireland, she had not the right to prevent the people of Ireland from choosing what they should wear. The temper of the pamphlet was mild in the extreme; but the governing officials saw in it dangerous symptoms. The pamphlet was stigmatized as libellous and seditious, and the writer as attempting to disunite the two nations. The printer was brought to trial, and the pamphlet obtained a tremendous circulation. Although the jury acquitted the printer, Chief Justice Whitshed, who had, as Swift puts it, [...] "so quick an understanding, that he resolved, if possible, to outdo his orders," [...] sent the jury back nine times to reconsider their verdict. He even declared solemnly that the author's design was to bring in the Pretender. This cry of bringing in the Pretender was raised on any and every occasion, and has been well ridiculed by Swift in his [...] "Examination of Certain Abuses and Corruptions in the City of Dublin." [...] The end of Whitshed's persecution could have been foretold--it fizzled out in a <b>nolle</b> <b>prosequi.</b>|$|E

'Entered a nolle' means, have entered on the knowledge, got a scent; you see it is law English; 'pro' means 'how,' and 'sequi,' 'to give chase.'
