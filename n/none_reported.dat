5|$|Initially, {{the path}} of Emmy was {{uncertain}} whether it would affect the Lesser Antilles. As a result, officials issued a hurricane watch for the northeastern Leeward Islands. The warning was cancelled when the storm turned more to the north, with the outer fringes of the hurricane slightly impacting Antigua. Several ships experienced rough seas and strong winds from Emmy, though <b>none</b> <b>reported</b> any damage. After Emmy turned to the west for the final time, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center considered the hurricane not a real threat to land, though they indicated it had a remote chance to affect land masses. The hurricane also posed {{a threat to the}} island of Bermuda initially, though it remained away from the island. Two days before Emmy passed through the Azores, the National Hurricane Center advised citizens there to closely monitor the progress of the storm. No damage reports exist from the Azores, though it was likely not severe.|$|E
500|$|All of the {{officers}} and troopers of Forbes' column had high praise for Burnham's actions, and <b>none</b> <b>reported</b> any doubts about his conduct even decades later. One member of the column, Trooper ME Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald in 1944 that once Commandant Piet Raaff took over command from the disgraced Major Forbes it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: [...] "I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion." [...] For his service in the war, Burnham was presented the British South Africa Company Medal, a gold watch, and a share of a 300-acre (120ha) tract of land in Matabeleland. It was here that Burnham uncovered many artifacts in the huge granite ruins of the ancient civilization of Great Zimbabwe. Matabeleland {{became part of the}} Company domain, which was formally named Rhodesia, after Rhodes, in 1895. Matabeleland and Mashonaland became collectively called Southern Rhodesia.|$|E

One member of the column, Trooper ME Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald on 22 December 1944 that once Commandant Raaff took over command it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: [...] "I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion." [...] Burnham proceeded to become a key figure {{for a number of}} commanding officers, including Frederick Carrington, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Roberts. Carrington called him [...] "the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa. He was my Chief of Scouts in '96 in Matabeleland and he was the eyes and ears of my force". The US President Theodore Roosevelt described him in 1901 as [...] "a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter... the ideal scout." [...] While fighting with the British Army in the Second Boer War, Burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, then Britain's second highest military honour.|$|E

[...] The 29 meta-analyses included 11 from general medicine journals; 15 from specialty medicine journals, and 3 from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author conflict of interest disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties {{with one or more}} authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and <b>none</b> <b>reported</b> RCT author-industry ties.

2500|$|The {{original}} {{cars for}} the Market Street subway, numbered 1-135 and later designated as Class A-8 by SEPTA's predecessor, the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), were {{built by the}} Pressed Steel Car Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. between 1906 and 1911. [...] An additional set of cars, numbered 136-215, were built by the J.G. Brill Co. of Philadelphia, Pa. between 1911 and 1913. [...] The Frankford Elevated portion opened in 1922 along with another set of cars, numbered 501-600, also built by Brill that year, later receiving the designation Class A-15. [...] The two rail lines were soon merged, resulting in a combined fleet of 315 cars (215 Market Street cars, 100 Frankford cars). [...] By 1960, when the PTC began replacing the cars, the Market Street cars had been in operation for 56 years, thus having the longest lifespan of any Philadelphia subway cars, surpassing that of the original Broad Street subway fleet, which had 54 years of operation. The Frankford cars phased out at 38 years of operation. [...] After retirement, two of the [...] "Market" [...] cars (cars 69 and 163) and six of the [...] "Frankford" [...] cars were retained as work train cars (Cars #532, 551, 559, 583, 585, and 589) for some time.

[...] Under Hillenkoetter the ORE split into Global Survey, Current Intelligence, and Estimates. [...] The sharp focus on the grind of Current Intelligence, with its popular, widely distributed products continued to dominate the ORE leaving little room for the other sections to grow, but it did lead to slow improvements, and the ORE increased the number of products it offered, adding [...] "Situation Reports" [...] that would be used as handbooks for individual countries, and the monthly [...] "Review of the World Situation". [...] Like other organs of the CIA, the ORE received a regular stream of requests {{from the rest of the}} Government, including the NSC, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), Department of State, and branches of the military. [...] Problems with the early ORE recognized within the CIA itself were that, of its eleven regular publications, only one of them addressed strategic, or national intelligence questions, and that most of the sources of information relied on to produce ORE products were [...] "open source", the CIA itself had little capability to produce intelligence on which to base its own reports and estimates.
