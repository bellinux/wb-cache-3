5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses <b>neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E

Research where <b>Neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> was administered intracerebroventricularly showed that it was important in consolidation of memory because it increased immediate and long-term forgetting. The antagonizing of a subtype of receptor for <b>Neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> caused the opposite effects- it decreased the likelihood that a fearful memory would be forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Neuroendocrine dysregulation: altered {{signalling}} of peptides {{that facilitate}} {{communication between the}} gut, brain and adipose tissue, such as ghrelin, leptin, <b>neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> and orexin, {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa by disrupting regulation of hunger and satiety.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin and {{synthetic}} ghrelin mimetics (growth hormone secretagogues) increase body weight and fat mass by triggering receptors in the arcuate nucleus {{that include the}} orexigenic <b>neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons. Ghrelin-responsiveness of these neurons is both leptin- and insulin-sensitive. Ghrelin reduces the mechanosensitivity of gastric vagal afferents, so they are less sensitive to gastric distension.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{circuits}} in {{the brain}} stem are able to control acceptance or rejection of sweet or bitter foods, and can be modulated by satiation or physiological hunger signals. Signals from the tongue, stomach, small intestine and liver are received by the area postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract, which then send information to many regions of the forebrain that control food intake. The lateral hypothalamus contains two sets of neurons that increase eating and decrease metabolic rate by secreting the peptides orexin and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH). <b>Neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> (NPY) in the lateral hypothalamus induces ravenous eating; neurons that secrete NPY are targeted by ghrelin in the hypothalamus. Leptin desensitizes the brain to hunger signals and inhibits NPY-secreting neurons.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance {{develops}} {{rapidly to}} the sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines. The anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant effects {{last for a}} few weeks before tolerance develops in most individuals. Tolerance results in a desensitization of GABA receptors and an increased sensitization of the excitatory neurotransmitter system, glutamate such as NMDA glutamate receptors. These changes occur {{as a result of the}} body trying to overcome the drug's effects. Other changes that occur are the reduction of the number of GABA receptors (downregulation) as well as possibly long-term changes in gene transcription coding of brain cells. The differing speed at which tolerance occurs to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines can be explained by the speed of changes in the range of neurotransmitter systems and subsystems that are altered by chronic benzodiazepine use. The various neurotransmitter systems and subsystems may reverse tolerance at different speeds, thus explaining the prolonged nature of some withdrawal symptoms. As a result of a physical dependence that develops due to tolerance, a characteristic benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome often occurs after removal of the drug or a reduction in dosage. Changes in the expression of neuropeptides such as corticotropin-releasing hormone and <b>neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> may play a role in benzodiazepine dependence. Individuals taking daily benzodiazepine drugs have a reduced sensitivity to further additional doses of benzodiazepines. Tolerance to benzodiazepines can be demonstrated by injecting diazepam into long-term users. In normal subjects, increases in growth hormone occurs, whereas, in benzodiazepine-tolerant individuals, this effect is blunted.|$|E

50|$|Many {{populations of}} neurons have {{distinctive}} biochemical phenotypes. For example, in one subpopulation of about 3000 neurons in the arcuate {{nucleus of the}} hypothalamus, three anorectic peptides are co-expressed: α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), galanin-like peptide, and cocaine-and-amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and in another subpopulation two orexigenic peptides are co-expressed, <b>neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> and agouti-related peptide (AGRP). These {{are not the only}} peptides in the arcuate nucleus; β-endorphin, dynorphin, enkephalin, galanin, ghrelin, growth-hormone releasing hormone, neurotensin, neuromedin U, and somatostatin are also expressed in subpopulations of arcuate neurons.

It has been used to demonstrate a role for the Y2 subtype as a presynaptic autoreceptor limiting further <b>neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> release, as well as modulating dopamine and acetylcholine release. It has also been shown to produce several behavioural effects in animals, including reducing alcohol consumption in addicted rats and anxiolytic effects, although while selective Y2 agonists are expected to be useful as anorectics, BIIE-0246 did not appear to increase appetite when administered alone.|$|E

50|$|Leptin binds to <b>neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> (NPY) neurons in the {{arcuate nucleus}} {{in such a}} way as to {{decrease}} the activity of these neurons.

A learned form can be established using methods similar to the learning principle of conditioned inhibition, and has been demonstrated in rats.|$|E
50|$|CaMKK2 regulates {{production}} of the appetite stimulating hormone <b>neuropeptide</b> <b>Y</b> and functions as an AMPK kinase in the hypothalamus.
