In experiment one, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats (190. 92. 0 g) were fed one of four protein-free diets, based on cornstarch, sucrose and soybean oil that contained 0, 20, 30, or 40 g kg 1 of water-extractable soluble <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharides.</b> In experiment two, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats (204. 31. 6 g), were randomly allotted to one of four protein-free diets in a 2 x 2 factorial design with the diets containing 30 g kg 1 of either water-extractable or alkali-extractable soluble <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharides.</b> The diets were fed with or without xylanase (2500 FTU/g) added at the expense of cornstarch. Chromic oxide (6 g kg 1 diet) was included in all diets as an indigestible marker. Both experiments lasted 8 d.

Putrescine and spermine levels in the ileum increased (linear and quadratic effect; p< 0. 05) as the level of water-extractable soluble <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> in the diet increased.

The addition of xylanase significantly decreased ileal endogenous amino acid loss in rats. The overall results of these experiments indicate that the presence of soluble <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> increases endogenous amino acid loss at the terminal ileal, which may explain the reduction in the digestibility of crude protein and amino acids commonly observed in animals fed diets containing a high concentration of soluble <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharides...</b>|$|R

Initially, corn samples were collected from 34 separate lots and analyzed to find representatives of normal and drought-stressed corn. These same lots were also used in a separate experiment measuring the impact of drought stress on diet manufacturing characteristics. The lot selected to represent the normal corn had a test weight of 55. 9 lb/bu, 0. 24) between corn source and enzyme inclusion. Overall (d 10 to 35), there was no effect on ADG or ADFI, but enzyme inclusion tended to improve (P = 0. 09) F/G, which was primarily driven by the improved (P = 0. 04) feed efficiency of pigs fed Roxazyme G 2 G in Phase 1 (d 10 to 25 postweaning). In conclusion, drought stress did not alter the <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> concentration of corn. Because <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> substrates were similar across treatments, it was not surprising that enzyme inclusion showed little benefit to nursery pig growth performance; however, improved feed efficiency of pigs fed diets containing Roxazyme G 2 G from d 10 to 25 postweaning warrants further investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{endogenous}} <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> hydrolysing enzymes on flour non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) was investigated. Straight dough bread-making experiments were performed with three flour samples (cvs. Skirlou, Estica and Soissons) varying in endogenous NSP hydrolysing enzyme activities and/or <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> contents and structures. Part of the water-unextractable NSP became extractable during the mixing (7 to 12 %) and baking(14 to 15 %) phases. For all three flours, very low levels (0 to 5 %) of water-unextractable NSP were solubilised during fermentation. Since two wheat flours with varying endogenous activities behaved similarly {{it is not}} clear whether this solubilisation was enzymic. Changes in molecular weight distribution of the arabinoxylans during fermentation can in part be ascribed to enzymic hydrolysis. Difficulties associated with the isolation of pure arabinoxylan from dough and bread samples suggest that other phenomena, such as interaction and association with proteins and/or other wheat components, are in play.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} and compare energy, protein, <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide,</b> and fluid intakes of a care home population consuming a texture modified diet (TMD) with those {{on a standard}} diet and also to evaluate the role of snacks in individuals' diets. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Care homes. Participants: Thirty residents (n = 15 requiring standard diet: n = 15 requiring TMD). Measurements: Dietary intakes were assessed using a 3 -day weighed plate-wastage method. All snacks and drinks consumed were observed and recorded. Weights of standard portions and volumes {{were used to determine}} actual amounts consumed of these items. Estimated intakes were converted to energy and nutrient intakes using WinDiets Dietary analysis software. Results: Residents on a TMD had significantly lower intakes of energy (1312 [326] kcal versus 1569 [260] kcal, P <. 024), <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> (6. 3 [1. 7] g versus 8. 3 [2. 7] g, P <. 02) and fluid (1196 [288] mL versus 1611 [362] mL, P <. 002) when compared with residents on a standard texture diet. Snacks provided significantly less energy (13 % or 173 kcal versus 22 % or 343 kcal, P =. 001) and <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> (P <. 001) in those requiring the TMD. Conclusions: These results suggest that dietary and fluid intakes of older adults in care homes requiring a TMD are significantly less than individuals on a standard texture diet. These are unlikely to be meeting individuals' dietary and nutritional needs. Strategies that maximize provision of appetizing energy and nutrient-dense foods (including snacks) and fluids of suitable textures require further investigation. © 2011 American Medical Directors Association...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of feeding diets based on cereals with different <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> content on colonization with the intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira intermedia in experimentally infected laying hens. The diets were based on wheat, barley, or barley and sorghum, all with or without supplementation with exogenous dietary enzymes. Six groups of 12 individually caged laying hens were fed the respective diets for 2 weeks, and then challenged at 20 weeks of age by crop tube with 108 to 10 9 colony forming units of active motile spirochaetes on five successive days. Eggs were collected daily. The birds were weighed weekly, and caecal faeces collected for assessment of water content. Every 3 to 4 days cloacal swabs were collected and subjected to culture and subsequent polymerase chain reaction for B. intermedia. The birds were killed at 27 weeks of age. Caecal contents were cultured for spirochaetes, and the viscosity of the ileal and rectal contents assessed. Dietary soluble <b>non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> content was not a consistent predictor of viscosity in the ileum, {{and the addition of}} enzymes did not significantly reduce the viscosity. A dietary influence on colonization was observed, with birds fed wheat having significantly more colonization than the birds fed the other diets.

In experiment 1, 3, 200 Cobb 500 broilers were allocated to 5 treatments with 16 replicates for 39 days. The experiment consisted of a nutritionally complete positive control, AME reduced negative control (NC), NC + <b>Non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> degrading enzyme (NSPase) containing xylanase, ?-glucanase, ?-galactosidase, NC + an enzyme combination of xylanase, amylase, protease (XAP), and NC + NSPase + XAP. Apparent metabolizable energy in the NC was reduced by 55 kcal/kg in the starter phase and 88 kcal/kg in the finisher and withdrawal phases. Energy reduction in the NC significantly decreased average BW and significantly increased FCR through the starter and finisher phase. <b>Non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> degrading enzyme inclusion increased average BW significantly compared to the negative control at levels {{similar to that of}} the positive control during the starter and finisher phases. <b>Non-starch</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> degrading enzyme significantly reduced FCR compared to the NC at levels that were similar to the positive control. Inclusion of XAP resulted in BW similar to the PC at d 14 and 27, and reduced (P< 0. 05) FCR from d 1 to 27. The combined inclusion of NSPase + XAP resulted in no further benefit beyond individual inclusion of each enzyme combination. In experiment 2, 2, 590 Cobb 500 broilers were allocated to 7 treatments with 10 replicates for 41 d. Treatments consisted of a nutritionally complete reference diet, and 6 AME reduced (- 88 kcal/kg) treatments composing a 2 X 3 factorial of phytase and XAP inclusion. Phytase was included at 600 (low) and 1, 200 (high) FTU/kg, with XAP included at 1, 200 (low), 1, 800 (medium), and 2, 400 (high) XU/kg. High phytase x low XAP and high phytase x medium XAP both resulted in similar cumulative FCR compared to the reference diet. Factorial analysis indicated high phytase compared to low phytase significantly reduced starter FCR and elevated finisher mortality. During the starter phase, medium XAP inclusion resulted in a significantly lower rate of feed consumption compared to the low XAP. Inclusion of medium XAP significantly reduced cumulative FCR from d 15 to 41 compared to low level XAP.
