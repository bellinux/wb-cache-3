Dual-band antennas with reconfigurable Dual-band antennas with reconfigurable lower band, higher band and dual-band are designed in this thesis. The dual-band antenna consists of two radiating branches generating the frequency bands at around 2. 4 GHz and 3. 5 GHz for the WiMAX system. Varactors are placed on the corresponding branches for continuously tuning of the operating bands for different WiMAX standards. For frequency tuning of the lower band or higher band, simple and novel DC biasing circuits without requiring any soldering wire are proposed to bias the varactor on a radiating element. While for simultaneous frequency tuning of the two individual bands, simple and novel DC biasing circuits requiring two soldering wires are proposed to bias the varactors on the radiating elements. Both simulation and measurement {{results show that the}} DC biasing circuits designed have very little affects on the antennas performances. The design of a monopole ultra-wide band (UWB) antenna with a reconfigurable <b>notch</b> <b>band</b> is presented. The antenna employs a vertical-ellipse radiator to achieve an UWB. A compact defected-ground structure (DGS) is used to create a <b>notch</b> <b>band</b> for the antenna. To frequency tune the <b>notch</b> <b>band,</b> a varactor is placed on the DGS to control the resonance frequency. The tuning performance, in terms of reflection coefficient, radiation pattern, efficiency and gain, of the antennais studied using simulation and measurement. Results show that the <b>notch</b> <b>band</b> can be tuned continuously from 5. 2 to 6. 32 GHz for the WLAN bands. In the measurement of a monopole antenna with a small ground plane, the feeding cable used to connect the antenna to the measurement equipment Satimo Starlab system causes discrepancies between the simulated and measured radiation patterns, efficiencies and peak gains at lower frequencies. In the designs of antennas in this thesis, the cable effects are studied by modeling the feeding cable using the EM simulation tool CST. Results show that, by using the cable model, the simulated and measured results agree very well. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A new {{miniaturized}} ultra-wideband {{bandpass filter}} with embedded reconfigurable multiband frequency notch function {{was designed and}} implemented by embedding all the passive components into {{a printed circuit board}} with a high dielectric constant. The proposed filter consists of compact 2 U-shaped DGS resonators shunt connected to parallel coupled lines to achieved frequency notch. To tune the <b>notched</b> <b>band,</b> suitable capacitor elements within the inner/outer U-DGS and RF PIN diode within the outer U-DGS are integrated. A curve fitting formula is derived to show the effect of the capacitor value on the center frequency of the <b>notched</b> <b>band,</b> which is decreased by 56. 7 %. These capacitors improved the quality factor and have the effect of reducing the filter size by 72 % as compared to other filters. The RF PIN diode in the outer U-DGS acts as a switch to exhibit a <b>band</b> <b>notch</b> covering the bandwidth of the WLAN for IEEE 802. 11 a/h at 5. 5 GHz and RFID ISO 18000 series pars 5 in microwave (MW) which is set at 5. 8 GHz, 6. 1 GHz and 6. 8 GHz, and the other bands. RF PIN diodes control the <b>notched</b> <b>band</b> and raises it from 5. 25 GHz to 6. 85 GHz (27 %) or remove the <b>band</b> <b>notched</b> according to its positions. In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed structure, UWB BPF with center frequency of 6. 85 GHz is designed, fabricated, and measured. The filter has passband from 3. 2 GHz to 10. 7 GHz and <b>notched</b> <b>band</b> designed to generate stop band from 5. 25 to 6. 85 GHz, and the two transmission zeros are observable at 2 GHz and 12. 5 GHz, respectively by measurement.

40|$|In this letter, a planar {{slot antenna}} with dual-band-notch {{characteristics}} is proposed for ultrawideband application. The basic antenna comprises a rectangular tuning stub and a ground plane with a tapered-shape slot. To create a <b>notched</b> <b>band</b> for WiMAX, one angle-shaped parasitic slit is etched out {{along with the}} tuning stub, while for WLAN, two symmetrical parasitic slits are placed inside the slot of the ground plane. By properly adjusting the size and location of the parasitic slits, {{it is found that}} the proposed antenna can achieve ultrawide operating band with dual-notched band without altering the overall antenna size. These <b>notched</b> <b>bands</b> will help to mitigate the possible interference between UWB and these narrow bands...|$|R
