40|$|Rotordynamic {{and thermal}} {{analyses}} of compliant flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings were performed. First, compliant flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings with pad radial compliance (CFTPBs) were introduced and designed for high-speed oil-free micro turbomachinery. The pad radial compliance was for accommodation of large rotor growth at high speeds. Parametric studies on pivot offset, preload, and tilting stiffness were performed using non-linear orbit simulations and coast-down simulations for an optimum design. Second, coast-down tests for imbalance response {{and stability of}} typical rotor-bearing system with a rigid rotor and two CFTPBs designed from the above design studies were conducted over operating speeds up to 55 krpm. Prediction of synchronous rotordynamic responses was made in terms of critical speed for various imbalance modes by using a rotordynamic analysis software (XLTRC), combined with dynamic force coefficients from the perturbation analysis. For stability analyses, a generalized orbit simulation program was developed considering both the translational and angular rotor motions with two different bearings. Linear stability analyses for the conical vibration mode were also performed by using XLTRC and the perturbation analysis based on the Lund method. Predictions of whirl speed showed good agreement to the tests, but the estimated onset speed of instability appeared lower than the measured instability. Finally, a new thermo-hydrodynamic analysis model of a typical rotor-bearing system with CFTPBs was presented, accompanying linear perturbation analyses to investigate thermal effects on the rotordynamic performance. A numerical procedure was established for solving the generalized Reynolds equation, the 3 -D energy equation, and the associated boundary conditions at the pad inlet flow and solid walls (rotor and pad) simultaneously. Parametric studies were conducted on <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> and external load. <b>Nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> showed significant influence on temperature fields, and external load had uneven thermal effects among pads. Case studies with heat flux and temperature boundary conditions on the rotor end surface were performed to simulate various working conditions of the bearing. Large rotor thermal growth due to the high rotor temperature showed noticeable influence on rotordynamic performance by increasing direct stiffness and damping coefficients...|$|E
40|$|The {{geometry}} of joint implants is surely {{one of the}} factors that mostly influence the wear process, as it directly affects contact and lubrication conditions. Usually only the implant size and the <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> are considered in the literature. However, as recently demonstrated by the authors for reverse shoulder implants [1] the dimensional tolerance can play a major role. Nevertheless, the real implant geometry is generally not reported in research studies or in standards. The present study aims to investigate the sensitivity of wear and, particularly, of the wear coefficient (k) to implant dimensional tolerance. Five samples of shoulder prosthesis were tested in a joint simulator [2, 3]. The initial and worn {{geometry of}} components were measured using a coordinate measuring machine. The wear model presented in [1, 2] was used to estimate specific k according both to the Archard law and to the wear law for UHMWPE. Experimental and numerical wear maps were compared in order to validate the wear laws, a point still largely debated in the literature. Preliminary results suggest that the dimensional tolerance can explain the high dispersion (up to 25...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{performance}} map {{calculations and}} stage scannings {{were carried out}} on a highly loaded three-stage axial-flow compressor. In the process, the radial clearance between the rotor tip and housing is increased from the <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> s = 0. 3 mm (Clearance 0) in three steps to 1. 0 mm (Clearance 3). In addition to this, a fourth clearance configuration with axially increasing clearance width is measured (Clearance 4). As compared to the nominal performance map, the operating range of the compressor continually decreases as the clearance is increased, and has less than 80 % of its original size for Clearance 3. The reasons for this are a shift of the stability limit {{to the right and}} a reduced total pressure build-up. Increasing the clearance promotes suction-side flow separation in this region. The stable operating range is restricted. The clearance influence on the total pressure ratio is a maximum at the stability limit and decreases as the mass flow increases. The characteristic lines converge at the choking limit. Based on a vectorial representation of the absolute and relative velocities downstream of the rotors, the interaction between clearance, wake, secondary and core flows is investigated. (orig.)

The accumulated tolerances of two serial chains of the parts are modeled by a hyper-ellipsoid in an augmented space.

40|$|The {{leakages}} and {{the dynamic}} characteristics of six types of spiral grooved seals are experimentally investigated. The {{effect of the}} helix angle of the seal is investigated mainly under {{the condition of the}} same <b>nominal</b> <b>clearances,</b> land and groove lengths, and groove depths. The dynamic characteristics are measured for various parameters such as preswirl velocity, pressure difference between inlet and outlet of the seal, whirling amplitude, whirling speed, and rotating speed of the rotor. The results are also compared with leakage increases with the increase of the helix angle, but as the rotating speed increases, the leakages of the larger helix angle seals quickly drop. The leakage of the smooth-stator (SS) /smooth-grooved rotor (SGR) seal drops faster than that of the spiral-grooved stator (SGS) /smooth-rotor (SR) seal. It is found that a circumferential flow can be produced by the flow along the helix angle direction, and this circumferential flow acts as a negative swirl. For the present helix angle range, there is an optimum helix angle with which the seal has a comparatively positive effect on the rotor stability. Compared with the SGS/SR seals, the SS/SGR seal has a worse effect on the rotor stability...|$|R
40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) {{with low}} levels of {{external}} pressurization and poor end sealing are prone to air entrapment, thus reducing the damping capability. Furthermore, existing predictive models are too restrictive. Single frequency, unidirectional load and centered circular orbit experiments were conducted on a revamped SFD test rig. The damper journal is 1 " in length and 5 " in diameter, with <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> of 5 mils (0. 127 mm). The SFD feed end is flooded with oil, while the discharge end contains a recirculation groove and four orifice discharge ports to prevent air ingestion. The discharge end is fully sealed with a wave-spring that pushes a seal ring into contact with the SFD journal. The measurements conducted without and with lubricant in the squeeze film lands, along with a frequency domain identification procedure, render the mechanical seal dry-friction force and viscous damping force coefficients as functions of frequency and motion amplitude. The end seal arrangement is quite effective in eliminating side leakage and preventing air entrainment into the film lands. Importantly enough, the dry friction force, arising from the contact forces in relative motion, increases significantly the test element equivalent viscous damping coefficients. The identified system damping coefficients are thus frequency and amplitude of motion dependent, albeit decreasing rapidly as the motion parameters increase. Identified force coefficients, damping and added mass, for the squeeze film damper alone agree very well with predictions based on the full film, short length SFD model...|$|E

The Rotor Alone Nacelle (RAN) system, developed at GRC by the Engineering Design and Analysis Division (EDAD) and the Acoustics Branch, used nacelle-mounted lasers and an automated control system to maintain concentricity as thermal and thrust operating loads displace the fan relative to the nacelle. This effort was critical to ensuring rig/facility safety and experimental consistency of the acoustic data from a statorless, externally supported nacelle configuration. Although the tip clearances were originally predicted to be about 0. 020 in. at maximum rotor (fan) operating speed, proximity probe measurements showed that the <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> was less than 0. 004 in. As a result, the system was optimized through control-loop modifications, active laser cooling, data filtering and averaging, {{and the development of}} strict operational procedures. The resultant concentricity error of RAN was reduced to +/- 0. 0031 in. in the Y-direction (horizontal) and + 0. 0035 in. /- 0. 001 3 in. in the Z-direction (vertical), as determined by error analysis and experimental results.

40|$|Hydrodynamic flexure pivot {{tilting pad}} gas {{bearings}} (FPTPGBs) can enable successful operation of oil-free microturbomachinery. This work presents the experimental and analytical study of such bearings with different damper configurations. A test rig was constructed that could safely operate a ~ 28. 6 mm, 0. 8 kg rotor beyond 120 krpm. A time domain orbit simulation, which integrates nonlinear {{equations of motion}} for the rotor-bearing elements, was implemented as the primary analysis tool to predict rotor-bearing responses to imbalance, the presence and location of critical speeds, etc. Complementary analyses were also performed with a model that uses linear bearing impedance coefficients to predict system natural frequencies. Imbalance response testing verified that the rotor-bearing system behaved linearly in the region above the critical speed, and orbit simulations predicted the response to a calibrated imbalance with notable agreement. Viscoelastic dampers added behind the FPTPGB pads delayed the onset of subsynchronous vibrations (from 43 krpm without damper to above 50 krpm with damper) of the system with bearing clearance increased by shims. Midrange subsynchronous vibrations initiated at ~ 20 krpm were eventually suppressed by ~ 25 krpm due to the stabilizing effect of rotor centrifugal growth. The viscoelastic dampers had a negligible effect on suppressing these midrange subsynchronous vibrations in experiments, {{but this was not}} demonstrated in simulations, presumably due to much lower stiffness contribution of the damper at lower frequencies. The ideal, perfectly aligned models in the simulations were able to tolerate shims up to only 10 % of <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance,</b> but the test rig exhibited surprising stability with shims as much as 200 % of nominal clearance; this increase may be caused by imposed eccentricities due to misalignments in the test rig. FPTPGBs supported by compliant bump foils can have the ability to tolerate rotor misalignments and shock loading like foil gas bearings. Simulation studies on imbalance response characteristics for several bearing shell mass and support stiffness configurations present initial design guidelines for the application. Namely, results showed that FPTPGBs favored large bearing shell mass and large support stiffness, while FPTPGBs with radial compliance favored small bearing shell mass with large support stiffness...|$|E

Analysis were performed to determine the cost variation in design, manufacture, and test that would occur between unshrouded and shrouded impellers. An impeller, representative of typical rocket engine impellers, was modified by removing its front shroud to permit variation of its blade clearances.

The 3 D numerical model developed in ANSYS CFX to simulate the flow through the inducer with 2 different clearances under different operating conditions is illustrated. The internal flow fields and hydraulic performance predicted by the CFD model under different operating conditions are compared with the corresponding experimental data obtained from the inducer tests.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The present investigation advances the analysis and experimental validation of simple gas bearing configurations with static and dynamic force characteristics desirable in high-speed turbomachinery. Comprehensive experiments and analysis were conducted on a small rotor supported on three lobed hybrid (hydrostatic/hydrodynamic) rigid gas bearings. The rigid bearings are made up of preloaded 120 ? lobes with minute feed holes for external pressurization that are fed, for example, by bleed off from a turbocharger compressor outlet. The bearing <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> and dimensionless preload are 66 microns and 0. 33, respectively. The test rotor, weighing 827 grams, integrates a DC motor and can achieve speeds as large as 100, 000 rpm. For various imbalance conditions, coast down tests from 60, 000 rpm characterize the rotor response on its bearings. As the supply pressure rises, the rotor response shows an increase in critical speed and a noticeable reduction in damping ratio. Threshold speeds of instability also increase with increasing supply pressures, and whirl frequency ratios range from nearly 50 % of rotor speed for a purely hydrodynamic condition to 25 % for a pressure supply five times ambient conditions. Bearing transmitted loads closely follow the rotor imbalance responses with large peak values while traversing the critical speeds. Similar imbalance response measurements were conducted with the test rotor supported on hybrid pressure dam gas bearings and on HyPad? tilting pad gas bearings. A linear rotordynamics model accounts for the rotor and gas hybrid bearings. A FE laminar flow model for hybrid gas bearing analysis predicts frequency dependent stiffness and damping force coefficients at the operating speeds and levels of feed pressure tested. The eigenvalue analysis forwards natural frequencies in agreement with the measurements. Estimated whirl frequency ratios are typically 50 % of rotor speed, thus predicting sub synchronous instabilities at lower rotor speeds than found experimentally when increasing the magnitude of feed pressurization...|$|E
40|$|Induction cores {{are used}} to {{accelerate}} heavy ion beam array, which are built around the outer diameter of the cryostat housing the superconducting quadruple array. Compact cryostat is highly desirable {{to reduce the cost}} of the induction cores. Recent experiences in fabrication of a cryostat for single beam transport revealed {{that it is possible to}} reduce the spacing in the cryostat vacuum jacket by using low-emissivity thermal insulation material instead of conventional MLI. However, it is labor-intensive to install the new type of insulation as compared with using MLI. It is promising to build a cost-effective compact cryostat for quadruple magnet array for heavy ion beam array transport by using low-emissivity material combined with conventional MLI as radiation insulation. A matrix of insulation designs and tests will be performed as the feasibility study and for the selection of the optimal thermal insulation as the Phase I work. The selected mixed insulation will be used to build prototype compact cryostats in the Phase II project, which are aiming for housing quadruple doublet array. In this STTR phase I study, a small cryostat has been designed and built to perform calorimetric characterization of the heat load in a liquid helium vessel insulated with a vacuum layer with a <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> of 3. 5 mm. The vacuum clearance resembled that used in the warm-bore beam tube region in a prototype cryostat previously built for the heavy ion beam transport experiment. The vacuum clearance was geometrically restricted with a heater shell with the temperature controlled at near 300 K. Various combinations of radiation and thermal shields were installed in the tight vacuum clearance for heat load measurements. The measured heat loads are reported and compared with previous test result using a compact vacuum layer. Further developments of the thermal insulations used in the present study are discussed. The compact cryostat with foil and MLI insulation may be used in the superconducting magnets for a wide range of applications including particle accelerators, fusion energy research, NMR, NMI, laboratory high field experiments and industrial magnets, compact feed through for general-purpose cryostat, etc. Combination of low emissivity thermal insulation material with the conventional MLI has a great potential to build cost-effective compact cryostats for heavy ion fusion beam array transport and other more general-purpose applications...|$|E
40|$|Circumferential grooves are {{machined}} {{into the}} rotor surface of liquid annular seals to reduce leakage. Analyses {{in the literature}} regarding rotordynamic coefficients for smooth stator/grooved rotor (SS/GR) seals are scarce, and measured results are absent despite the significant effect of these annular seals on pump rotordynamics. Furthermore, few annular seal test rigs can impose and measure pre-swirl. Consequently, this study aims to quantify the effect of pre-swirl and operating static eccentricity on measured static and dynamic characteristics of the SS/GR seal. The test seal has a nominal minimum radial clearance of Cr = 203. 2 ?m (8 mil) and the length-to-diameter ratio of L/D = 0. 5. The rotor surface has 15 square grooves with a depth of 1. 524 mm (60 mils). This geometry is based on measured dimensions in an Electrical Submersible Pump. The author conducts tests at speeds of 2, 4, 6, and 8 krpm, axial pressure drops of 2. 07, 4. 14, 6. 21, and 8. 27 bar (30, 60, 90, and 120 psi), and eccentricity ratios up to ? 0 = 0. 80. Pre-swirl is imposed and varied over low, medium, and high values. The lubricant is ISO VG 2 oil at 46. 1 ?C (115 ?F) to ensure turbulent flow at all operating conditions. Measured grooved seal results are compared to results of a smooth seal of equal length, diameter, and <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance.</b> Note that no published predictions for this seal exist, precluding measurement-versus-prediction comparisons. Static measurements include leakage rate, applied static load, eccentric position, pre-swirl ratio (PSR), and outlet swirl ratio (OSR). At 2 krpm and 8. 27 bar, the SS/GR seal leakage rate {{is lower than the}} smooth seal by a factor of 0. 7 for a total reduction of 19 LPM. However, at high speeds and low pressures, grooved seal leakage is 0. 8 to 0. 9 times that of the smooth seal with reductions in leakage rate on the order of 2 LPM. Consequently, adding rotor grooves to restrict leakage is more advantageous at high pressure drops and low speeds. Outlet swirl is measured {{for the first time in}} a liquid-annular-seal test rig. Contrary to expectation, measured OSR is generally lower than 0. 5, possibly due to the axial and radial location of the pitot tube within the outlet chamber. Dynamic measurements include rotor-stator relative displacement, stator acceleration, and applied dynamic excitations. The author calculates dynamic-stiffness values, rotordynamic coefficients, whirl frequency ratio, and effective damping. Most notable of the dynamic results is the negative direct stiffness of the SS/GR seal. Negative direct stiffness would have a detrimental effect on pump rotordynamics, lowering both the natural frequency and the onset speed of instability. Calculated whirl frequency ratio is generally high (? 0. 5) with values up to 1. 2 for the grooved seal. Finally, effective damping is lower for the grooved seal than the smooth seal indicating that the SS/GR seal has worse stability characteristics than a comparable SS/SR seal. Overall, increases in PSR have a detrimental effect on SS/GR seal rotordynamic performance leading to modest decreases in direct stiffness, increases in the magnitude of cross-coupled stiffness, and increases in whirl frequency ratio. Additionally, operation at high eccentricity ratios for the SS/GR seal has negative effects. Leakage increases, and direct stiffness decreases as eccentricity ratios approach 0. 80...|$|E

40|$|Static {{characteristics}} and rotordynamic coefficients were experimentally determined for a four-pad tilting-pad journal bearing with ball-in-socket pivots in loadbetween- pad configuration. A frequency-independent [M]-[C]-[K] model fit the measurements reasonably well, {{except for the}} cross-coupled damping coefficients. Test conditions included speeds from 4, 000 to 12, 000 rpm and unit loads from 0 to 1896 kPa (0 to 275 psi). The test bearing was manufactured by Rotating Machinery Technology (RMT), Inc. Though it has a nominal diameter of 101. 78 mm (4. 0070 in.), measurements indicated significant bearing crush with radial bearing clearances of 99. 6 ?m (3. 92 mils) and 54. 6 ?m (2. 15 mils) in the axes 45 ? counterclockwise and 45 ? clockwise from the loaded axis, respectively. The pad length is 101. 6 mm (4. 00 in.), giving L/D = 1. 00. The pad arc angle is 73 ?, and the pivot offset ratio is 65 %. The preloads of the loaded and unloaded pads are 0. 37 and 0. 58, respectively. A bulk-flow Navier-Stokes model was used for predictions, using adiabatic conditions for the bearing fluid. Because the model assumes constant <b>nominal</b> <b>clearances</b> at all pads, {{the average of the}} measured clearances was used as an estimate. Eccentricities and attitude angles were markedly under predicted while power loss was under predicted at low speeds and very well predicted at high speeds. The maximum detected pad temperature was 71 ?C (160 ?F) and the rise from inlet to maximum bearing temperature was over predicted by 10 - 40 %. Multiple-frequency force inputs were used to excite the bearing. Direct stiffness and damping coefficients were significantly over predicted, but addition of a simple stiffness-in-series model substantially improved the agreement between theory and experiment. Direct added masses were zero or negative at low speeds and increased with speed up to a maximum of about 50 kg; they were normally greater in the unloaded direction. Although significant cross-coupled stiffness terms were present, they always had the same sign. The bearing had zero whirl frequency ratio netting unconditional stability over all test conditions. Static stiffness in the y direction (obtained from steadystate loading) matched the rotordynamic stiffness Kyy (obtained from multiple-frequency excitation) reasonably at low loads but poorly at the maximum test load...|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} turbomachinery often experiences severe {{dynamic loads}} that produce large amplitude rotor motions. Well-engineered squeeze film dampers (SFDs) provide adequate damping to ameliorate rotor vibrations {{and to ensure}} system reliability. Open ends SFDs are prone to air ingestion during large amplitude rotor whirl motions and high excitation frequencies, all the while demanding of a significant flowrate, an undesirable operating feature. Piston ring (PR) end seals are commonly installed in SFDs in aircraft engines to amplify the available damping while reducing the demand of oil flowrate and also to avoid air ingestion. This dissertation investigates experimentally the dynamic forced performance of a SFD with a short land length (L/D= 0. 2), <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> 0. 254 mm and lubricant supplied via three orifice feed holes (?= 2. 5 mm). There are two configurations, one has its ends open to ambient while the other has sealed ends with PRs. The dynamic load tests are of three types (single frequency, sine-sweep frequency dynamic loads and impact loads). Single frequency dynamic load tests reveal that the piston ring end seals effectively reduce leakage through {{the ends of the}} film land; thus the sealed SFD provides 11 - 13 times more damping coefficient and eleven times more added mass coefficients than those provided by an open ends SFD configuration. Further tests of two PR sealed ends SFDs (one with a seal flow conductance = 0. 56 LPM/bar, and the other with = 0. 89 LPM/bar) operated at a supply pressure Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg, show that small differences on their damping and added mass coefficients are within the measurement uncertainty range. The second pair of piston rings (Cave-S 2 >Cave-S 1) has a larger slit gap than the first pair, hence providing a lesser flow resistance. The effect of lubricant supply pressure on the sealed ends SFD force coefficients is also quantified experimentally by increasing the lubricant supply pressure by a factor of four (Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg?Pin- 2 ~ 2. 76 barg). For the sealed ends SFD with Cave-S 1 and Pin- 2 ~ 2. 76 barg, both the damping and added mass coefficients show a ~ 20 % increase compared to those coefficients from the damper supplied with a low oil feed pressure (Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg). Further experiments with the sine-sweep frequency dynamic load tests aim to validate the SFD force coefficients identified from a single-frequency dynamic load. The estimated SFD damping and inertia force coefficients from a sine-sweep frequency load tests with a low time rate of change in sine-sweep excitation frequency ?= 6. 5 Hz/s agree with the coefficients obtained from a single-frequency dynamic load over the same test conditions while substantially reducing the time of data collection. Furthermore, single impact load tests are performed to quantify their effect on the response of an elastically supported open ends SFD and sealed ends SFD. Test system transient responses due to a single impact show the peak amplitude of motion (ZMAX) is proportional to the magnitude of applied load (FMAX). The identified system damping ratio (?) is proportional to the peak dynamic displacement as a linear system shows.

The {{results of the investigation}} indicate that the stage work distribution closely approximates design, the actual distribution being 44. 1, 33. 4, and 22. 5 percent for the first, second, and third stages, respectively. The first-, second-, and third-stage efficiencies were 0. 894, 0. 858, and 0. 792, respectively. The first and second stages exhibited loss regions near the hub and tip at the rotor blade outlets. The hub loss region is attributed to stator secondary flows, and a contributing factor to the tip loss region may be the high design diffusion on the rotor blade suction surface near the tip. The loss in the third stage is appreciably greater than that in the first or second stage. The fact that the third rotor is unshrouded and has a <b>nominal</b> tip <b>clearance</b> of 0. 120 inch may contribute to the higher loss in the tip region of the third stage...|$|R

The improvements achieved by HRAM stem from lower terrain clearance coupled with accurately positioned, real-time differential navigation on closely spaced flight grids. In field cultural noise filtering, advanced data processing, imaging and improved interpretation techniques enhance data information content. Development of HRAM approaches might also contribute to mitigate environmental hazards present throughout the Italian territory. Hence an HRAM field test was performed in July 2000 in Friuli, North-Eastern Italy to assess the capabilities and limitations of HRAM over a buried pipeline and a domestic waste site.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{vibration}} characteristics of rotor displacement signals in a magnetic bearing system under conditions when rotor contact with auxiliary bearings is possible. Since these signals {{may be used}} for feedback control, it is necessary to determine how they may affect the ability of the controller to regain rotor levitation. An experimental system is used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the rotor non-linear dynamic behavior to unbalance, which is sufficient to cause contact during rotor run up through rigid body and flexural mode critical speeds. Complex rotor dynamics may involve contact with more than one auxiliary bearing or bush. Application of appropriate rotating forces to the rotor through a magnetic bearing is also shown to induce similar contact dynamics. Thus an alternative procedure for assessing the non-linear rotor dynamic behavior is established with the potential for identification of appropriate control forces. The contact dynamics are also considered in the presence of auxiliary bearing misalignment. Misalignment may arise through physical translation of a housing or through steady state offset errors in sensor measurements. A misalignment of 50 % of the <b>nominal</b> radial <b>clearance</b> is applied at an auxiliary bearing. Various contact modes are evident as the rotor is run up in speed. During run down different contact dynamics may be encountered and the level of such hysteresis is assessed...|$|R
40|$|Current {{technologies}} for smart {{sheet metal part}} production base upon adhesive bonding of piezo-patches to the surface. A novel concept and process chain is the assembly of piezoceramic micro parts into local microstructures of metal sheets and subsequent joining by forming. This results in a full functional integration of the piezoceramic in the metal for sensor and actuator purposes. Mechanical coupling is non-positive without elastic interlayers and the electrical coupling {{is characterized by the}} metal being the ground electrode of the sensor. The paper describes the design, methods and tolerance management to overcome the challenges for reliable parallel microassembly and joining of prefabricated batches of 10 piezoceramic fibers with dimensions of 0. 267 × 0. 250 × 10 mm 3 and <b>nominal</b> assembly <b>clearances</b> of ± 0. 018 mm. The prefabrication of the batches is achieved by stacking and dicing of piezoceramic plates. Both the principles of precision machining and elastic averaging are applied for reliable production and joining of the batches. In experiments, equally spaced piezoceramic fibers within the batches were achieved. Prototypes were assembled and joined by forming achieving functional piezo-metal composites. With the given tolerances of the parts and the microstructure a statistical tolerance analysis has been performed {{in order to determine the}} maximum allowable position uncertainty of the microassembly system. An assembly yield of > 95 % is expected for future scaled up high volume assembly of piezo-metal composites...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} {{three types of}} approximation used for the discretization of contact surface profiles. The assembly under study corresponds to a hub-shaft connection, which is commonly used for the transmission of rotational motion. The profiles that are analyzed are 2 D axisymmetric and represent the surfaces of the mechanical elements. The analysis process consists of: a) simulating the ideal <b>nominal</b> geometry without <b>clearances</b> in the contact region, b) obtaining a convergence of contact stresses for the nominal geometry ring-shaft interface, and c) adding clearances to the geometry {{and changes in the}} profile contact, at the surface waviness level. The variations of the profile are obtained from measurements of the diameter of the connecting elements within the regions of interest. The study focuses on the analysis of variations of contact stresses generated by different representations of the discrete surfaces. For this analysis, variations in diameter measurements are considered, as are Bezier and spline curve fitted to these variations. The influence of the approximations on the discretization of the contact zones of the finite element models is indicated...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Results are presented from tests conducted with straight-bore and convergent tapered-bore honeycomb annular gas seals. The test seals had a 114. 3 mm bore with an L/D = 0. 75 and a <b>nominal</b> radial <b>clearance</b> of 0. 19 mm. The honeycomb cell depth for both seals was 3. 1 mm and the cell width was 0. 79 mm. Static and dynamic measurements are reported with air at three speeds out to 20, 200 rpm, three supply pressures out to 17. 2 bar, and with exit-to-inlet pressure ratios of 40 % and 60 %. The results demonstrated that the convergent tapered-bore honeycomb seals exhibited significantly larger (73 %) effective stiffness and had significantly less effective damping (71 %) compared to the straight-bore honeycomb seals. The convergent tapered-bore honeycomb seals leaked an average of 48 % more than the straight-bore honeycomb seals. The dynamic impedance measurements show that the honeycomb seals do not fit the conventional frequency-independent model for annular gas seals. Numerical predictions from a computer program incorporating the new two-control-volume model of Kleynhans and Childs (1997) correlate well with both measured seal leakage and dynamic impedance for the honeycomb seals. Predicted leakage rates varied less than 11 % and 18 % of the measured straight-bore and convergent tapered-bore honeycomb seal leakage measurements respectively. In general, impedance predictions correlated well with both honeycomb seals across all of the test cases. Better correlation was observed at higher speed and higher inlet pressure for both honeycomb seals, with the straight-bore honeycomb seal predictions correlating best with the measured data...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{bearings}} enable successful {{applications in}} high speed oil-free microturbomachinery. This thesis presents analysis and experiments {{of the dynamic}} performance of a rotor supported on Rayleigh step gas bearings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Rayleigh step hybrid gas bearings exhibit adequate stiffness and damping capability in a narrow range of shaft speeds, up to ~ 20 krpm. Rotor coastdown responses were performed for two test bearing sets with <b>nominal</b> radial <b>clearance</b> of 25. 4 ?m and 38. 1 ?m, respectively. A near-frictionless carbon (NFC) coating was applied on the rotor to reduce friction against its bearings at liftoff and touchdown. However, the rotor still experienced dry friction at low shaft speeds (below ~ 4, 000 rpm). Experiments show that the supply pressure raises the rotor critical speed and decreases the system damping ratio. The geometry of the Rayleigh steps distributed on the rotor surface generates a time varying pressure field and results in a sizable 4 X super synchronous component of bearing transmitted load. The external supply gas pressure affects slightly the onset speed of instability of the rotor-bearing system. The unstable whirl frequencies are nearly fixed at the system natural frequency (~ 120 Hz). Analysis with a finite element model predicts the stiffness and damping force coefficients for the bearing accounting for a purely hydrodynamic operation condition. Predictions show the synchronous stiffness and damping coefficients decrease with shaft speed. Predicted threshold speeds of instability are lower, ~ 50 % or less than the measurement due to the analytical model limitations assuming a grooved stator. The predicted synchronous responses to imbalance correlate well with the measurements, however. The Rayleigh step gas bearing shows similar characteristics to the flexure pivot tilting pad bearing (FPTPB) tested in 2003. However, the test Rayleigh step gas bearings exhibit a much reduced stable operating speed range, below 20 krpm. The maximum speed achieved is much lower to that determined with an identical rotor supported on FPTPBs, i. e. rotor dynamically stable up to 100 krpm. The FPTPB is more reliable in high speed oil-free applications due to its excellent stability characteristics...|$|R

RF calculations have established that these resonances can be effectively mitigated {{by a series of}} suitably located electrically conducting contacts between the port and plug. These contacts must allow installation and removal of the antenna but must also make reliable electrical contact during antenna operation. In addition, the contacts must be compliant enough to survive deflection of the port during seismic and disruption events without transmitting large forces to the vacuum vessel. The distance to be spanned is subject to significant uncertainty, due to the large manufacturing tolerances of the surrounding components, and this also must be considered during the design process. This paper outlines progress made {{in the design of the}} grounding system, as well as detailing a number of concepts which have been investigated and abandoned, leading up to the current reference design. The current reference design is a simple and robust mechanical solution consisting of sprung Copper-plated Inconel flaps which use part of the range of the shimming system included in the antenna design as the actuation mechanism.

40|$|Squeeze Film Dampers (SFDs) aid to {{suppress}} rotor vibrations {{and enhance the}} stability of high-speed rotor-bearing systems. A SFD is a simple oil lubricated film between a stationary housing and a precessing (whirling) journal. Aircraft engines use SFDs as the only means to provide damping to otherwise rigid ball bearing supports. This thesis presents experimental results for the dynamic forced performance of a test open ends SFD operating with large amplitude whirl motions, centered and off centered within the bearing clearance. The test rig comprises of an elastically supported bearing with a damper section having two parallel film lands separated by a feed groove. A film land is 25. 4 mm long, with diameter 127 mm and <b>nominal</b> radial <b>clearance</b> c= 0. 251 mm. Two orthogonally placed shakers apply dynamic loads on the bearing to induce circular orbit motions at prescribed whirl frequencies. A static loader, 45 ? away from each shaker, pulls the bearing to a static eccentric position. Circular orbit tests were performed (10 ? 100 Hz frequency range) for eight increasing orbit amplitudes (r= 0. 08 c to ~ 0. 71 c) and under four static eccentricities (es= 0. 0 c to ~ 0. 76 c). An identification method estimates the test damper force coefficients from transfer functions in the frequency domain. The analysis shows that the SFD damping force coefficients increase with the static eccentricity (es) increase. On the other hand, the damper inertia coefficients decrease as the orbit amplitude (r) becomes large and also increase modestly with the static eccentricity (es). Predictions from a physical model show good agreement with the test dynamic force coefficients. The accuracy of the linearized SFD force coefficients (K, C, M) SFD is evaluated from comparing the differences in mechanical work performed by actual and linear SFD reaction forces. The difference in mechanical work (Ediff) increases with increasing static eccentricity (es) and orbit amplitude (r). However, for most test conditions (r/c? 0. 4,es/c? 0. 25), Ediff is less than ~ 5 %, thus showing the linearized SFD force coefficients represent well the forced response of the actual test SFD system. The test and predicted force coefficients {{as well as the}} analysis of the pressure fields contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the kinetics of SFDs operating with moderate tolarge amplitude size whirl motions, centered and off-centered...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to provide {{additional}} data to supplement the work reported in NASA/CR- 2015 - 218868 (Berdanier and Key, 2015 b). The aim of that project was to characterize the fundamental flow physics and the overall performance effects due to increased rotor tip clearance heights in axial compressors. Data have been collected in the three-stage axial research compressor at Purdue University with a specific focus on analyzing the multistage effects resulting from the tip leakage flow. Three separate rotor tip clearances were studied with <b>nominal</b> tip <b>clearance</b> gaps of 1. 5 percent, 3. 0 percent, and 4. 0 percent based on a constant annulus height. Overall compressor performance was previously investigated at four corrected speedlines (100 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent, and 68 percent) {{for each of the}} three tip clearance configurations. This study extends the previously published results to include detailed steady and time-resolved pressure data at two loading conditions, nominal loading (NL) and high loading (HL), on the 100 percent corrected speedline for the intermediate clearance level (3. 0 percent). Steady detailed radial traverses of total pressure at the exit of each stator row are supported by flow visualization techniques to identify regions of flow recirculation and separation. Furthermore, detailed radial traverses of time-resolved total pressures at the exit of each rotor row have been measured with a fast-response pressure probe. These data were combined with existing three-component velocity measurements to identify a novel technique for calculating blockage in a multistage compressor. Time-resolved static pressure measurements have been collected over the rotor tips for all rotors with each of the three tip clearance configurations for up to five loading conditions along the 100 percent corrected speedline using fast-response piezoresistive pressure sensors. These time-resolved static pressure measurements reveal new knowledge about the trajectory of the tip leakage flow through the rotor passage. Further, these data extend previous measurements identifying a modulation of the tip leakage flow due to upstream stator wake propagation. Finally, a novel instrumentation technique has been implemented to measure pressures in the shrouded stator cavities. These data provide boundary conditions relating to the flow across the shrouded stator knife seal teeth. Moreover, the utilization of fast-response pressure sensors provides a new look at the time-resolved pressure field, leading to instantaneous differential pressures across the seal teeth. Ultimately, the data collected for this project represent a unique data set which contributes to build a better understanding of the tip leakage flow field and its associated loss mechanisms. These data will facilitate future engine design goals leading to small blade heights in the rear stages of high pressure compressors and aid in the development of new blade designs which are desensitized to the performance penalties attributed to rotor tip leakage flows...|$|R
40|$|Squeeze Film Dampers (SFD) provide {{viscous damping}} in rotor bearing systems to reduce lateral {{vibration}} amplitudes and to isolate mechanical components. Aircraft engine shafts, often supported on roller bearings, operate at high rotational speeds and {{are susceptible to}} large amplitude shaft whirl due to rotor imbalance. SFDs aid to reduce such large whirl amplitudes while also eliminating rotor instabilities. he current work quantifies experimentally the forced performance of two parallel squeeze SFDs separated by a central groove. Force coefficients are identified in a specialized SFD test rig constructed to undergo similar operating and loading conditions as in jet engines. Of interest is to quantify {{the effect of a}} central feed groove on the forced performance of SFDs and to validate predictions from a computational tool. The test rig comprises of an elastically supported bearing structure and one of two journals. Tests are conducted on two open ends SFDs, both with diameter D and <b>nominal</b> radial <b>clearance</b> c; each damper with two parallel film land lengths L= 1 / 5 D and 2 L, separated by a feed groove of width L and depth 3 / 4 L. ISO VG 2 grade lubricant oil flows into the central groove via 3 orifices, 120 degrees apart, and then through the film lands to finally exit to ambient. In operation, a static loader pulls the bearing to various static off center positions with respect to the stationary journal, and electromagnetic shakers (2, 200 N) excite the test system with single frequency loads over a frequency range to generate rectilinear, circular and elliptical orbits with specified motion amplitudes. A frequency domain method identifies the SFD mechanical parameters, viz., stiffness, damping, and added mass coefficients. The long damper generates 7 times more direct damping and 2 times more added mass compared to the short length damper. The damping coefficients are sensitive to the static eccentricity (up to 50 percent c) while showing lesser dependency on the amplitude of whirl motion (up to 20 percent c). On the other hand, added mass coefficients are nearly constant with static eccentricity and decrease with higher amplitudes of motion. The magnitudes of identified cross-coupled coefficients are insignificant for all imposed operating conditions for either damper. Large dynamic pressures recorded in the central groove demonstrate the groove does not isolate the film lands by merely acting as a source of lubricant, but contributes to the generation of large added mass coefficients. The recorded dynamic pressures in the film lands and central groove do not evidence lubricant vapor or gas cavitation for the tested static eccentricities and amplitudes of motion. The direct damping coefficients for both dampers are independent of excitation frequency over the frequency range of the tests. Predictions derived from a novel SFD computational tool that includes flow interactions in the central groove and oil supply orifices agree well with the experimental force coefficients for both dampers. The current work advances {{the state of the art}} in SFDs for jet engines...|$|R
40|$|Ships {{that operate}} in ice-infested waters often {{experience}} momentary increased propeller cavitation because ice pieces can block the How into the propeller. Model tests {{have shown that}} the presence of blockages in the flow field can lead to regions of violent cloud cavitation. For ducted propellers, this additional cavitation is more significant than it is for open propellers: ice pieces may become lodged against and within the duct and subject the propeller to longer periods of increased cavitation due to the blocked How. Associated with this cavitation is the possibility of cavitation erosion. [...] The extent and severity of cavitation erosion that a marine propeller may experience cannot presently be determined theoretically. To gain an understanding of how this phenomenon affects a full scale propeller, it is necessary to perform model tests. [...] This thesis presents the results of an erosion study that was completed in the cavitation tunnel at the Institute for Marine Dynamics (IMD), a facility of the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada. Paint tests provided the medium through which the erosion was studied. A limited number of tests were attempted with pressure sensitive films to estimate the intensity of the cavitation. Two model propellers, both having a diameter of 200 mm, were used. The first model, an open, fixed pitch propeller, was of the type that is fitted to the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) R-CIass (1200 -Scries) icebreakers. The second model, a variable pitch ducted propeller, was of the type that is fitted to the Canadian Marine Drilling (CANMAR) Lid. vessel MV Robert LeMeur. [...] During testing, a simulated ice blockage was installed upstream of the model such that the <b>nominal</b> blade/blockage <b>clearance</b> was approximately I nun. Experiments were completed over a range of advance coefficients for various test conditions, including tests at reduced pressure and at atmospheric pressure. The effects of changes in the proximity of the blockage were also examined. A lest was performed in open flow for each propeller to provide a baseline for the erosion results. For each experiment, the resulting types of cavitation and the erosion patterns were recorded. V 7 /. V video equipment and } 5 mm still photography were used lo document both the experiments and the results. In subsequent analysis, the areas of erosion were estimated using an image analysis program and comparisons between each test were made. [...] Generally, given the same test conditions, the dueled propeller experienced more erosion than the open propeller. Cavitation persisted longer on the ducted propeller due to the influence of the nozzle. [...] For both propellers, the amount of face erosion increased with increasing advance coefficient. Back erosion was minimally affected by changes in the advance coefficient. [...] Concerning proximity effects, erosion increased, for both propellers, as the blade/block clearance was increased, until it reached a peak. This peak occurred at a gap of 5 mm. Further increases in clearance resulted in reduced erosion. [...] Pressure sensitive film tests were unsuccessful as the films were torn from the blades by the violent cavitation. For future tests under such adverse conditions, a more robust fastening system is required...|$|R
40|$|Squeeze film dampers (SFDs) provide {{viscous damping}} to {{attenuate}} excessive vibrations and enhance system stability in turbomachinery. SFDs are of special importance in aircraft engines which use rolling element support bearings that, by themselves, {{do not provide}} enough damping to ensure safe operation. A modular test rig capable of simulating actual operating conditions in aircraft jet engines is used to test two centrally grooved, end sealed, SFDs. Both SFDs have diameter D and <b>nominal</b> radial <b>clearance</b> c and consist of two parallel squeeze film lands separated by a deep circumferential groove of length LG and depth dG. A short length damper with film land lengths L and a long damper with land lengths 2 L are tested. Piston rings seal the damper lands. An ISO VG 2 lubricant is supplied to the SFD via three radial holes that discharge lubricant into the central groove. The lubricant passes through the damper lands and across the piston ring seals to finally exit the damper at ambient pressure. Circular orbit tests of amplitude ~ 0. 5 c and for static eccentricities varying from 0 to ~ 0. 36 c are conducted on the two sealed dampers. The instrumental variable filter method (IVFM) serves to identify the SFD dynamic force coefficients. The parameter identification range is 50 Hz to 210 Hz for the short damper and 110 Hz to 250 Hz for the long damper. Large amplitude dynamic pressures measured in the central groove demonstrate that the central groove does not divide the damper in two separate film lands, but the lubricant in the groove interacts with the squeeze film lands, hence contributing significantly to the SFD forced response. Dynamic pressures in the film lands and in the central groove reveal that both dampers operate free of air ingestion or cavitation for the tested static eccentricities and amplitudes of motion. Comparisons to test results for the same SFD configurations but with open ends demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} end seals on increasing the direct damping coefficients. For the sealed ends short length damper, the added mass coefficients are ~ 2 times larger and the damping coefficients are ~ 3. 8 times larger than the respective coefficients of the open ends long damper. For the sealed ends long damper, the damping coefficients are ~ 2. 8 times, and the added mass coefficients are ~ 3. 1 times larger than coefficients from the open ends configuration. The identified SFD direct stiffness coefficients are nearly zero except at the maximum static eccentricity for the long damper. Predictions from a novel computational model that include the effects of the central groove, the lubricant feed holes and the end seals are in excellent agreement with results from the short length damper. For the long damper, the predicted damping coefficients are in good agreement with the test results, while the added mass coefficients are under predicted by ~ 25 percent. Experimental results from the two sealed SFD configurations lead {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of end seals as well as central feed groves on the SFD forced performance.

Overall compressor performance was investigated at four corrected speedlines (100 %, 90 %, 80 %, and 68 %) {{for each of the}} three tip clearance configurations using total pressure and total temperature rakes distributed throughout the compressor. The results have confirmed results from previous authors showing a decrease of total pressure rise, isentropic efficiency, and stall margin which is approximately linear with increasing tip clearance height. The stall inception mechanisms have also been evaluated at the same corrected speeds for each of the tip clearance configurations. Detailed flow field measurements have been collected at two loading conditions, nominal loading (NL) and high loading (HL), on the 100 % corrected speedline for the smallest and largest tip clearance heights (1. 5 % and 4. 0 %). Steady detailed radial traverses of total pressure at the exit of each stator row have been supported by flow visualization techniques to identify regions of flow recirculation and separation. Furthermore, detailed radial traverses of time-resolved total pressures at the exit of each rotor row have been measured with a fast-response pressure probe. These data have helped to quantify the size of the leakage flow at the exit of each rotor. Thermal anemometry has also been implemented to evaluate the time-resolved three-dimensional components of velocity throughout the compressor and calculate blockage due to the rotor tip leakage flow throughout the compressor. These measurements have also been used to calculate streamwise vorticity. Time-resolved static pressure measurements have been collected over the rotor tips for all rotors with each of the three tip clearance configurations for up to five loading conditions along the 100 % corrected speedline using fast-response piezoresistive pressure sensors. These time-resolved static pressure measurements, as well as the time-resolved total pressures and velocities have helped to reveal a profound influence of the upstream stator vane on the size and shape of the rotor tip leakage flow. Finally, a novel particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique has been developed as a proof-of- concept. In contrast to PIV methods that have been typically been utilized for turbomachinery applications in the past, the method used for this study introduced the laser light through the same access window that was also used to image the flow. This new method addresses potential concerns related to the intrusive laser-introducing techniques that have typically been utilized by other authors in the past.
