They recognized the prior neglect of the agricultural sector and called for redirecting public programs toward promotion of agricultural growth and reduction of rural poverty. Correspondingly, economic activity was to be decentralized to break down its high concentration in Lima, and within the cities resources were to be redirected away from the capital-intensive and import-intensive modern sector to the labor-intensive informal sector. A strategy of concertación (<b>national</b> <b>understanding)</b> with private business leaders on economic issues was to be used systematically to avoid disruptive conflict. Problems of external balance were to be answered both by restructuring production to lessen dependence on imports and by reorienting toward higher exports over the long-term.|$|E

Hanoch Dagan's Unjust Enrichment: A Study of Private Law and Public Values threatens to reverse the tide and make restitution interesting again. The book takes commonplace words such as "value" and "gain" and shows how they embody a society's underlying normative principles.

The author contrasts the ways in which a formal and elab-orate U.

I use the term Lao Isan to refer specifically to Isan people of Lao origin or ethnicity. Lao Isan are subject to complex and often competing notions of Isan-ness, Lao-ness and Thai-ness by insiders and outsiders. Using data derived from an ethnographic study of popular Thai television and Lao Isan youth (aged 17 – 25) {{living in the}} city of Khon Kaen and the town of Mahasarakham in northeast Thailand in 2002, this paper explores contemporary and co-existing interpretations of Isan identity or Khwampenisan among Lao Isan youth in relation to self-image and connections with <b>national</b> <b>understandings</b> of physical beauty as they are perpetuated in Thai-produced television programs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{discusses}} how {{international and}} <b>national</b> <b>understandings</b> {{of information and}} communication technology (ICT) and the knowledge economy inform contemporary higher education policies. Acknowledging that national educational policies in Latin America are increasingly influenced by the recommendations of international organizations (e. g. the World Bank, UNESCO, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), the article provides a clear example of the logics of policy transfer operating in the region. Challenging the interpretations that have tended to stress either the imposition and domination of international meanings and recommendations onto national policies or the total indifference of national reforms vis à vis those international views, this article contends that international policy narratives are locally appropriated and resignified. Specifically, the article deals with {{the ways in which}} higher education policy narratives on knowledge and information found in UNESCO’s publications are appropriated and reconstituted in Mexico’s policy documents...|$|R

The globally dispersed Turkish diaspora uses a variety of new technologies to keep in touch with family, friends, acquaintances and colleagues across the globe. The networks arising through such activities have come to complement and sometimes to replace the traditional importance of face-to-face communities in the establishment of feelings of community, inclusion and belonging. A current research project in Melbourne has been investigating the Turkish community's use of both old and new media to establish, assert and consolidate their own sense of community, beyond the limiting national frames of Turkish, Australian or even Turkish-Australian identity constructs...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{international}} regimes regulating {{maritime transport}} {{have aimed to}} develop uniform rules. However, these rules are relatively static and have been implemented differently based on different <b>national</b> <b>understandings</b> in a de-centralised, State-based manner. This article argues that greater global uniformity in maritime transport rules could be achieved through {{the framework of the}} World Trade Organization (‘WTO’). The WTO could update these rules dynamically, and could also enforce them. A WTO-based negotiating forum could generate substantive, uniform seaborne cargo rules in two ways. Through a selective referral approach, it could incorporate the existing rules — including the un-administered rules — within the WTO framework. It could also develop new uniform rules. The WTO also provides international communities with a quasi-judicial procedure — the WTO dispute settlement mechanism (‘dsm’) — which could also be used to protect and promote the global uniformity of seaborne cargo rules. Such an approach could further reduce divergent interpretations of uniform transport rules by providing a centralised system for the implementation of those rules...|$|R

It also helps us investigate significant differences in <b>national</b> <b>understandings</b> of the proper means towards this civic integration (whose content and goals are more or less shared) within the region. The Scandinavian countries may stand out in the Western world, but each country implements particular policies, each with its own conception of the functionality of civic integration – with the biggest contrast between Sweden and Denmark. Besides demonstrating this geographic variation in policy and discourse, and highlighting the countries’ contrasting integration philosophies, the article’s analysis of these developments over time suggests the usefulness of distinguishing between a series of stages in the rise and possibly fall (or crowding out) of civic integration concerns in family reunification policies. This concluding discussion examines each of these points in turn. What, to begin with, characterizes family reunification as a distinct policy area? [...]...|$|R

The Italian media discourse offers an interesting case study as national policy, public attitudes and political discourse in that country have been consistently pro-EU in the past decades. However, this article seeks to steer clear from facile claims that public discourse in a given country is clearly pro- or anti-EU.

40|$|Social {{work has}} had varying {{relationships}} with the nation state both over time and between different countries. From its early stages the occupation had both state sanctioned and voluntary streams. Its international dimension has been enhanced in the European context through policy and funding measures {{over the past few}} decades. During this period we have also seen the rise of globalising trends leading to questions about the ongoing powers of nation states. This paper examines some aspects of the relationship between social work and the state, taking into account the emergence of European and also international policies and frameworks. The paper focuses initially on migration {{as an example of a}} common trend; an area of policy with both national and European dimensions; and a field in which social professionals are engaged to varying degrees. Secondly, it considers the progress of the ‘professional project’ in Europe, using developments in five countries to illustrate some of the issues associated with ‘professionalization’. European and international frameworks may lead to some convergence in <b>national</b> <b>understandings</b> of the key roles of social workers and an enhanced sense of professional identity across nation states, despite very different starting points and current forms of organisation...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, most European {{states have}} begun to {{incorporate}} a broader understanding of security in their security documents and policies. As a result, security is understood in a more comprehensive way. This broader understanding of security includes, for example, issue-areas such as economics, human rights, and/or the environment. In this context, this study examines whether the adoption of the concept of a comprehensive security is leading to a convergence of the security cultures in Europe. This study examines, first, the concepts of comprehensive security and security culture. Then, using a method of structured, focused comparison, the guiding security policy documents and policies of Germany, Great Britain, and Switzerland are examined with a focus on questions related to multilateralism and use of force. Analyzing these key factors and their implementation results in a better understanding of what the concept of comprehensive security implies for Europe and whether this may lead to a rapprochement of the different national security cultures. This study demonstrates that even though Europe still displays considerable heterogeneity as to diverse <b>national</b> <b>understandings</b> of security, one finds a tendency toward convergence, which leads to a growing European security culture.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the decade}} {{following}} the Second World War, {{the process of}} reconstituting fractured and traumatized European communities was paralleled by the necessary task of physical reconstruction. In making decisions about what should be rebuilt and, in particular, about the aesthetic forms that such rebuilding should take, communities asserted their cultural identities and, implicitly, addressed local or <b>national</b> <b>understandings</b> of recent events. This paper examines one such example, the postwar reconstruction of the Benedictine monastery of Montecassino, which had been destroyed by Allied bombs {{during the winter of}} 1944. It argues that the postwar reconstruction of Montecassino to a near-replica of its prewar form expressed the popular narrative of a local history of suffering, martyrdom and rebirth, and so helped to restore a shattered space, to heal a demoralized society, and to rehabilitate a discredited political structure. During the Second World War and, in some cases, in its aftermath, nearly all European countries suffered large losses of life, the temporary or permanent dispersal of surviving populations, and the destruction of cities and towns, factories and homes. In the decades after the war, communities both national and local produced histories that purported to explain the events that had befallen them. Constructing such narratives was no simple matter, particularly in place...|$|R
