5000|$|In September 2005 a {{new system}} of short-notice {{inspections}} came into being. Under this system the senior leadership of each school were strongly encouraged to complete a Self Evaluation Form (SEF) on a continual basis, which required them to be aware of strengths and areas for development. Inspections were generally two- or three-day visits every three years, with two days' notice. They focussed on the [...] "central nervous system" [...] of the school - examining how well the school was managed, and what processes were in place to ensure standards of teaching and learning improve; the school leadership and management were expected to be aware of everything in the SEF. The SEF served as the main document when planning the inspection, and was crucial in evaluating the quality of leadership and management and the school's capacity to improve.After an inspection of a school, Ofsted published a report on the school on its website. In addition to written comments on a number of areas, schools were assessed on each area and overall on a 4-point scale: 1 (Outstanding), 2 (Good), 3 (Satisfactory) and 4 (Inadequate). Schools rated Outstanding or Good might not be inspected again for five years, while schools judged less favourably were inspected more frequently, and might receive little or no <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> visits.|$|E

5000|$|The 1000 page MSHA report {{dismissed}} Massey Energy's {{theory of}} a sudden surge of natural gas. It said 12 of its citations {{were related to the}} disaster, including 9 in the most severe [...] "flagrant" [...] category. Most important was failure to check for methane and failure to clean up coal dust. It recounted examples of a corporate culture more devoted to production than safety, and recounted examples of employees sanctioned for delaying production in order to resolve safety issues. While the investigation found the physical conditions that led to the coal dust explosion were the result of a series of basic safety violations at UBB, which PCC and Massey disregarded, the report cites unlawful policies and practices implemented by PCC and Massey as the root cause of the explosion --- including the intimidation <b>of</b> miners, advance <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspections,</b> and two sets of books with hazards recorded in UBB's internal production and maintenance book but not in the official examination book.

A first conclusion is that the studies do not {{provide us with a}} clear answer to the question <b>of</b> whether <b>inspection</b> visits have positive causal effects on quality of schools. Results of studies on publications of public performance indicators are more unambiguous. They lead us to draw the conclusion that, although principals and teachers believe performance indicators are important, parents and pupils take very little <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> these indicators when choosing schools. A third conclusion concerns the occurrence of side effects <b>of</b> school <b>inspections</b> and other control mechanisms in education. A number of the studies discussed clearly refer to the existence of these side effects, like 'window dressing' and other types of 'gaming'...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has highlighted an unprecedented {{increase in the}} scale, scope and intensity of regulation inside government in the UK, and growing concerns about its cost and effectiveness. Empirical analysis <b>of</b> 'BestValue' <b>inspections</b> <b>of</b> local government suggests that the processes <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> were transparent and applied in a reasonably consistent manner. However, the direct and indirect costs were high; the fragmented nature <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> regimes posed significant problems for inspected bodies; the adversarial nature <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> militated against self-assessment; and there was little meaningful involvement by service users...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} many goods and {{services}} may change randomly between the time of shipment and delivery, creating disputes over quality that can result in lemons-market equilibria. We investigate the potential <b>of</b> third-party <b>inspections</b> for such inefficiencies. We consider two types <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> ex post verification of quality in consignment contracts and ex ante certification in FOB contracts, which were instituted for fruits and vegetables in the U. S. when national markets were emerging. We show that both types <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> can counteract misallocations of quality found in lemons-market equilibria. Buyers prefer ex post verification to ex ante certification while sellers prefer the reverse. Government provision <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> services may be necessary for making provision <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> services economically viable, and may be desirable for reducing inefficiencies due to the costliness <b>of</b> <b>inspection.</b> The U. S. experience may provide lessons for developing countries in creating marketing institutions to foster economic growth. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{treatment}} of the inspection-system design problem when inspection is unreliable and subject to classification errors. Our approach, based on the theory of Error-Correcting Codes (ECC), leads to the development <b>of</b> a Self-Correcting <b>Inspection</b> (SCI) decision rule that does not require complete knowledge <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> error probabilities. We show that the proposed rule assures correct classification, if the number <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> errors {{is less than a}} certain number. We analyze the performance of the SCI decision rule under different inspection situations, including some situations that are uncommon in the field of error-correcting codes. Then, we show how the underlying mathematical structure can be applied to determine the number <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> and the level <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> reliability in order to minimize the sum of inspection-related costs. The practical contribution of this work lies in that it expands the ability of the designer <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> systems to deal with cases where there is very little or no information regarding the reliability <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> operations. 1.

40|$|Inspection {{has been}} an {{increasingly}} important feature of central monitoring {{of education in the}} 1990 s. This article examines the technical reliability <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> processes in initial teacher training, drawing extensively on methodology and procedures adopted by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) between 1996 and 1998. A definition of reliability is advanced and tested against the procedures <b>of</b> <b>inspection,</b> especially by examining the security of internal and external judgements at the pass/fail borderline and the moderation and training procedures deployed by OFSTED. The methodology <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> is found to be insufficiently reliable for the consequences which flow from it. Tensions are explored between the technicist model <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> underlying OFSTED initial teacher training procedures and the 'informed conoisseurship' model hitherto deployed by members of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. In consequence, there are unresolved tensions between the expressed aspiration for 'improvement through inspection' and the use <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> to police compliance...|$|R
