40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the theme of}} cross-cultural issues {{in the teaching of}} writing (Theme 4) through the cultural politics of knowledge and identity. Success in academic writing is dependent not merely on general competence, but also on an understanding of the constitutive cultural system of academic writing. In negotiating writing tasks, writers must also negotiate underlying assumptions of reader expectations and writing strategies which have decided cultural bases (Grabe and Kaplan 1996). What Canagarajah (2000) calls "the geopolitics of academic writing" (p. 85) arises from an asymmetry of power between academic writing and the Other discourses that it tends to <b>negate.</b> <b>To</b> perpetuate itself, academic writing conceals its own cultural roots which lie demonstrably in Western notions of rationality affiliated with the Enlightenment (Knoblauch and Brannon 1984). Thus what is, in fact, cultural is made to appear neutral.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study of}} the {{effectiveness}} of traditional water coupled and non-contact ultrasonic C-Scan systems for wet damaged Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composites has been performed. Long term immersion for up to 24 months, of impact damaged GFRP plates in hot water at 65 º C and 93 º C causes serious matrix degradation. Water diffusion is followed by water uptake measurements. The use of water coupled pulse-echo ultrasonics proved ineffective after long-term water immersion as damaged areas become ultrasound-invisible. The use of air-coupled through thickness ultrasonics is examined for damage detection and evaluation. The contrast between impact damaged areas and water diffused areas is restored. Calibrating the system to a dry condition specimen, a good qualitative and quantitative indication of the degraded state of specimens can be obtained. This monitoring system for the degradation process proves to be very promising. Introduction: For nearly 50 years now, Glass Fiber Reinforced Polyester (GFRP) composites have found wide acceptance and use by the Marine and process industry. The specific strength, the resistance to corrosion and fouling by the marine environment, which relates to very low maintenance costs, and the low cost compared to other composite systems, make this material system extensively used. The lack of long term design data and the absence of a validated residual strength predictive method tend to <b>negate</b> <b>to</b> some extent their merits because heav...|$|E
30|$|Specifically, the {{assessment}} {{of the impact of the}} vegetation’s location on the air temperature development in the urban canopy revealed that the proximity to “green” – vegetated space can decrease the urban heat island intensity during night-time and the maximum day-time air temperature. The marginal difference between the cases with a central allocation of the vegetated surface area and those were the vegetation was positioned at the outer border of the urban unit is an indication that the distance to a vegetated area is not enough to alone produce large cooling benefits during the day and attenuate the night-time urban heat island intensity. In Scenario 2 (amount of green-space), an increase to the urban unit’s permeable surface area showed a small decrease in the average air temperature across the urban unit. The case with the largest vegetated surface area had the lowest daily air temperatures. A shift was noted in the air temperature distribution towards a higher occurrence frequency of temperatures at the cooler end. The differences between the cases were more evident in the average surface temperatures. The results suggest that high percentages of vegetated space can reduce the surface temperatures within the cities. There were, however, also strong indications that in places with a humid sub-tropical climate such as Hangzhou, in the case of successive hot, dry summer days, a reduction in soil water content will <b>negate,</b> <b>to</b> a large extent, the cooling benefits of the added vegetation.|$|E

Reversible 'bilateral ovariectomy' can now in effect be achieved by 'high-dose' luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (LHRHAs). The harmful effects of such medical reversible bilateral ovariectomy, in particular the increased risks of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis, can in all likelihood be obviated by 'low-dose' oestrogen replacement therapy (ERT), specifically 0. 625 mg of conjugated equine oestrogens (CEE) for 21 days in each 28 -day treatment cycle, and such ERT use will only <b>negate</b> <b>to</b> a relatively small extent the beneficial effect of such bilateral ovariectomy on breast cancer risk. We calculate that such an LHRHA plus low-dose ERT regimen given to a premenopausal woman for 10 years will, {{in addition to being}} a most effective contraceptive, decrease her lifetime risk of breast cancer by more than 50 %. We calculate that such a 10 -year regimen will also decrease her risk of ovarian cancer by two-thirds. This regimen should leave endometrial cancer risk and bone metabolism unaltered, and may reduce the risk of heart disease. The addition of a 'low-dose' progestogen to the regimen for 12 days in each 28 -day treatment cycle would be beneficial to the endometrium, but it will adversely affect risk factors for heart disease and it may significantly reduce the benefit of the regimen as regards breast cancer. A satisfactory compromise may be to add a low-dose progestogen for 12 days at less frequent intervals. Another possibility may be to deliver a progestogen solely to the endometrium with an intra-uterine device; the benefits of such a regimen would be a significant reduction in the incidence of breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer...|$|E
40|$|Urban and {{building}} energy simulations are usually initiated with typical meteorological year weather data. However, the locations where these historical datasets were collected (usually airports) {{do not represent}} the local, site specific micro-climates that cities develop. An idealised “urban unit model” (250 m radius) has been developed for use with simulation modelling as a method for adapting commonly available weather data files to the local micro-climate. The idealised “urban unit model” presented in this work {{is based on the}} main thermal and morphological characteristics of nine sites with residential / institutional (university) use in Hangzhou, China. This newly introduced idealised “urban unit model” was implemented into micro-climatic simulations using a Computational Fluid Dynamics – Surface Energy Balance analysis tool (ENVI-met, Version 4). Following model validation, two scenarios were developed, one for assessing the impact of vegetated surface’s location on air temperature in relation to the air temperature measurement point (3. 5 m above ground) and a second one for analysing the effect of the vegetated surface area on the average urban unit (250 m radius) air and surface temperature. The performance of the “urban unit model” was deemed satisfactory and the performance evaluation indices were comparable to previously published work (RMSE: 1. 3; MAPE: 3. 1 %). The results of Scenario 1 (spatial distribution of green space in the urban unit) showed that the location of the vegetated surface had only marginal impact on the air temperature at the middle grid cell of the urban unit. As would be expected, the air temperature was lower for the case where the vegetation was at the centre of the model. Scenario 2 (changing the green space percentage in the urban unit) revealed that the increase of green space resulted in an increase in the occurrence frequency of air temperatures towards the cooler end of the temperature distribution. This study concluded that in places with a humid subtropical climate such as Hangzhou, for successive hot, dry summer days, the reduction in soil water content can <b>negate,</b> <b>to</b> a large extent, the cooling benefits of added vegetation. This work presents a methodology that addresses the implications of urban morphology representation for micro-climate modelling...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydration}} {{state of}} a series of [Ln(DO 2 A) (H 2 O) n]+ complexes in aqueous solution at pH = 6. 4 - 7. 0 was studied by measuring the lanthanide-induced 17 O shifts (LIS) of water [Ln includes elements from Ce to Yb; DO 2 A = 1, 7 -bis(carboxymethyl) - 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane]. Their contact contribution, obtained from Reilley plots, indicated a decrease in the inner-sphere water coordination number of the [Ln(DO 2 A) (H 2 O) n]+ complexes from n = 3 (Ce-Eu), to n = 2 (Tb-Yb). A temperature-dependent UV/Vis absorption study of the 578 - 582 nm 7 F 0 rarr 5 D 0 transition band of [Eu(DO 2 A) (H 2 O) n]+ in aqueous solution showed that this complex is present in an equilibrium between eight- and nine-coordinate species with n = 2 and n = 3, respectively. The hydration equilibrium parameters (2 harr 3), K 2 - 3298 = 4. 0 ± 0. 2, ΔH 2 - 30 = - 12. 1 ± 1  kJ mol- 1 and ΔS 2 - 30 = - 28. 9 ± 3 J mol- 1 K- 1,correspond to an average hydration number of 2. 65 - 2. 85 in the temperature range 273 - 363  K. A variable temperature, multiple field 17 O NMR study combined with direct EPR measurements of the transverse electronic relaxation rates has been used to obtain the parameters characterizing water exchange, rotation and electronic relaxation, all influencing the proton relaxivity of [Gd(DO 2 A) (H 2 O) 2 - 3]+. The small increase in the water exchange rate of [Gd(DO 2 A) (H 2 O) 2 - 3]+ (kex 298 = (10 ± 5) × 106 s- 1) relative to that of[Gd(DOTA) (H 2 O) ]- (4. 8 × 106 s- 1) is a consequence of an unfavorable interplay of charge and hydration equilibria. The value of τR 298 = 40 ± 1 ps is short, and the electronic relaxation rate (1 /T 2 e asymp 1. 2 × 1010 s- 1) is fast relative to [Gd(DOTA) (H 2 O) ]- (1. 3 - 2. 4 × 109 s- 1 for B = 0. 34 T).
