40|$|Abstract Background A common {{feature of}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{pathology}} is {{the abundance of}} activated microglia in <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques</b> containing amyloid-beta protein (Aβ) and associated molecules including heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Besides the role as pathological chaperone favouring amyloidogenesis, {{little is known about}} whether or not HSPG can induce microglial activation. Cultures of primary murine microglia were used to assess the effect of HSPG on production of proinflammatory molecules that are known to be present in <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques</b> of AD. Results HSPG stimulated up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and accumulation of TNF-α protein and nitrite (NO 2 -) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effects of HSPG were primarily due to the property of the protein core as indicated by the lack of microglial accumulation of TNF-α and NO 2 - in response to denaturated HSPG or heparan sulfate GAG chains (HS).

Objective: to determine the sensitivity and specificity of positron emission tomography imaging with flutemetamol injection labeled with radioactive fluorine 18 to detect β-amyloid in the brain using neuropathologically determined <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaque</b> levels as the standard of truth. Design, setting and participants: open-label multicenter imaging study that took place at dementia clinics, memory centers, and hospice centers in the United States and England from June 22, 2010, to November 23, 2011. Participants included terminally ill patients who were 55 years or older with a life expectancy of less than 1 year. Interventions: flutemetamol injection labeled with radioactive fluorine 18 (Vizamyl; GE Healthcare) administration followed by positron emission tomography imaging and subsequent brain donation. Main outcomes and measures: sensitivity and specificity of flutemetamol injection labeled with radioactive fluorine 18 positron emission tomography imaging for brain β-amyloid. Images were reviewed without and with computed tomography scans and classified as positive or negative for β-amyloid by 5 readers who were blind to patient information. In patients who died, neuropathologically determined <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaque</b> levels were used to confirm scan interpretations and determine sensitivity and specificity. Results: of 176 patients with evaluable images, 68 patients (38 %) died during the study, were autopsied, and had <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaque</b> levels determined; 25 brains (37 %) were β-amyloid negative; and 43 brains (63 %) were β-amyloid positive. Imaging was performed a mean of 3. 5 months (range, 0 to 13 months) before death. Sensitivity without computed tomography was 81 % to 93 % (median, 88 %). Median specificity was 88 %, with 4 of 5 of the readers having specificity greater than 80 %. When scans were interpreted with computed tomography images, sensitivity and specificity improved for most readers but the differences were not significant.

40|$|Abstract Background Overactivated {{microglia}} that cluster at <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques</b> constantly release neurotoxins, which actively {{contribute to}} progressive neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, attenuating microglial clustering can reduce focal neuroinflammation at <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques.</b> Previously, we identified CCL 5 and CCL 2 as prominent chemokines that mediate the chemotaxis of microglia toward beta-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates. Although transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) {{has been shown}} to down-regulate the expression of chemokines in activated microglia, whether TGF-β 1 can reduce the chemotaxis of microglia toward <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques</b> in AD remains unclear. Methods In the present study, we investigated the effects of TGF-β 1 on Aβ-induced chemotactic migration of BV- 2 microglia using time-lapse recording, transwell assay, real-time PCR, ELISA, and western blotting. Results The cell tracing results suggest that the morphological characteristics and migratory patterns of BV- 2 microglia resemble those of microglia in slice cultures. Using this model system, we discovered that TGF-β 1 reduces Aβ-induced BV- 2 microglial clustering in a dose-dependent manner. Chemotactic migration of these microglial cells toward Aβ aggregates was significantly attenuated by TGF-β 1. However, these microglia remained actively moving without any reduction in migration speed. Pharmacological blockade of TGF-β 1 receptor I (ALK 5) by SB 431542 treatment reduced the inhibitory effects of TGF-β 1 on Aβ-induced BV- 2 microglial clustering, while preventing TGF-β 1 -mediated cellular events, including SMAD 2 phosphorylation and CCL 5 down-regulation. Conclusions Our results suggest that TGF-β 1 reduces Aβ-induced microglial chemotaxis via the SMAD 2 pathway. The down-regulation of CCL 5 by TGF-β 1 at least partially contributes to the clustering of microglia at Aβ aggregates. The attenuating effects of SB 431542 upon TGF-β 1 -suppressed microglial clustering may be mediated by restoration of CCL 5 to normal levels. TGF-β 1 may ameliorate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in AD by preventing activated microglial clustering at <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques.</b> </p...|$|R

We evaluated the composition of aged canine vessel amyloid and preamyloid both biochemically and immunohistochemically. The vessel amyloid extended mainly to residue 40 (A beta 40), while preamyloid contained a mixture of A beta 17 - 42 and A beta 42, with minimal A beta 40. Our results suggest other factors besides A beta 42 are important for <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaque</b> formation...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer’s {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder, characterized by progressive decline in memory and in social performance. The morphological hallmarks of the disease are neuronal loss, loss of dendritic spines, neurofibrillary degeneration and <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques</b> mainly in the hippocampus and the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres. This study {{is based on the}} morphological analysis of the cerebellar cortices of eight brains, 4 patients suffered from Alzheimer’s disease and 4 normal controls, by Golgi method, as well as Nissl, Gallyas’, Bielschowsky’s, Methenamine Silver staining and Congo red methods. Although typical <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques</b> were not seen in the cerebellar cortex and the diffuse plaques found in the cerebellum in far smaller proportion than plaques in the prefrontal and parietal cortices of the same cases, Golgi impregnation technique revealed a loss of Purkinje cells and a marked decrease in the density of dendritic arborization...|$|R
50|$|The {{cholinergic}} {{hypothesis of}} geriatric memory dysfunction is an older hypothesis {{that was considered}} before beta-amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary tangles, or <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques.</b> It states that by blocking the cholinergic mechanisms in control subjects you can {{examine the relationship between}} cholinergic dysfunction and normal aging and memory disorders because this system when dysfunctional creates memory deficits.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Active or passive {{immunization}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients {{leads to}} targeting of beta-amyloid plaques by immunoglobulins (IgG) and their subsequent removal by microglia. Here, we investigate whether naturally occurring autoantibodies to beta-amyloid contribute to beta-amyloid plaque removal in nonimmunized AD patients. METHODS: We generated an AD tissue microarray with 2, 325 tissue specimens from 3 defined {{central nervous system}} regions of 48 AD patients and 48 age-matched control patients. Absolute quantification of beta-amyloid, beta-amyloid plaque-bound IgG, and phagocytic, resting, and activated microglia and microhemorrhages was done using a standardized, highly reproducible scoring system. RESULTS: The majority of <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques</b> are decorated by IgG. AD patients with prominently IgG-labeled <b>neuritic</b> <b>plaques</b> have a significantly reduced plaque burden {{and an increase in}} phagocytic microglia, yet no increase in microhemorrhages. INTERPRETATION: Autoantibodies directed against beta-amyloid are common in AD patients and may contribute in controlling plaque burden...|$|R
