50|$|Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, under Parvaiz, {{planned to}} set up 8800 MW <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in Pakistan.

5|$|Ikata is {{the site}} of Shikoku's only <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> The Ikata <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant</b> has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe Pressurized Water Reactor units with the Two Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the {{original}} Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi Pressurized Water Reactor unit with the Three Reactor Coolant Loop design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30, 1977 and March 19, 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15, 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{because of}} the {{implosion}} of the cooling tower at Trojan <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant,</b> a group got together in the South Park Blocks and brought down a 25-foot model tower to celebrate the implosion.|$|E
5|$|Other {{utilities}} {{are provided by}} private entities or South Korean government-owned companies. Seorabeol City Gas, an affiliate of GS Group, provides gas to the Gyeongju residents, while, electrical power is supplied by the public enterprises, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power via the Wolseong <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant.</b> The plant is known for the only <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> operating PHWRs (Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor) in South Korea and supplies about 5% of South Korea's electricity. The owner, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power began to build the Wolseong 1 in the districts of Yangnam-myeon, Yangbuk-myeon and Gampo-eup in 1976. Since 1983, the power plant has been providing commercial service and operating with the PHWRs that has a capacity of 678,000kW. As the construction of each Wolseong 2, 3 and 4 with a capacity of 70,000kW were completed respectively in 1997, 1998 and 1999, Wolseong <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> <b>plant</b> site has been successfully operating the four PHWRs plants. New project, Sinwolseong No. 1 and No. 2 are currently under construction which {{is estimated to be}} completed until 2011–12.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 Atommash re-initiated the {{manufacturing}} of equipment for <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> It is the Russia's monopolist for manufacturing of melt localization devices for <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
50|$|FirstEnergy's {{electric}} generation is primarily from coal and <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> The system also includes natural gas, oil, and hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> FirstEnergy operates the Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse, and Perry <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are {{considered}} to be targets for terrorist attacks. Even during the construction of the first <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> this issue has been advised by security bodies. Concrete threats of attack against <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> by terrorists or criminals are documented from several states. While older <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> were built without special protection against air accidents in Germany, the later <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> built with a massive concrete buildings are partially protected against air accidents. They are designed against the impact of combat aircraft at a speed of about 800 km / h. It was assumed as a basis of assessment of the impact of an aircraft of type Phantom II with a mass of 20 tonnes and speed of 215 m / s.|$|R
5|$|The {{focus of}} the company began to switch away from purely {{construction}} and towards more turnkey work and service provision, for example the 1961-3 Hilton Hotel, Athens, project. Most work was domestic, driven by Germany's strong economic growth, with a particular strength in power plant construction. This included {{the construction of the}} Federal Republic of Germany's first <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> Kahl <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant,</b> near Dettingen am Main. The construction contract had been awarded by AEG, which had been commissioned by the utility company RWE to build the plant. The plant began to feed its electricity to the grid in June 1961. By contrast, the first East German nuclear plant, at Rheinsberg, was connected to the grid in 1966.|$|E
5|$|A 2012 court {{decision}} concerning {{a state law}} attempting {{to shut down the}} Vermont Yankee <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plant</b> affirmed that the Act gives the federal government exclusive authority over safety at nuclear power plants. This allowed Vermont Yankee to continue operating until it was voluntarily shut down by the owner for economic reasons.|$|E
5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was to have {{some parts of the}} Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing a <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> {{typically}} have high capital costs for building the plant, but low fuel costs.

30|$|However, <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> {{may be very}} {{difficult}} and costly to build in the post-fossil fuels era, and by the early twenty-second century, we may see the last of these electricity producers as remaining plants are decommissioned.
