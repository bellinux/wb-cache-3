40|$|The RNA genome of the Moloney isolate of murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV) {{consists}} of two parts [...] a sarcoma-specific region with no homology to known leukemia viral RNAs, and a shared region present also in Moloney murine leukemia virus RNA. Complementary DNA was isolated which was specific for {{each part of the}} M-MSV genome. The DNA of a number of mammalian species was examined for the presence of <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> homologous with the two M-MSV regions. Both sets of viral <b>sequences</b> had homologous <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> present in normal mouse cellular DNA. MSV-specific sequences found in mouse cellular DNA closely matched those <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> found in M-MSV as seen by comparisons of thermal denaturation profiles. In all normal mouse cells tested, the cellular set of M-MSV-specific <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> was present in DNA as one to a few copies per cell. The rate of base substitution of M-MSV <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> was compared with the rate of evolution of both unique sequences and the hemoglobin gene of various species. Conservation of MSV-specific <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> among species was similar to that of mouse globin gene(s) and greater than that of average unique cellular sequences. In contrast, cellular <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> that are homologous to the M-MSV-murine leukemia virus "common" nucleotide region were present in multiple copies in mouse cells and were less well matched, as seen by reduced melting profiles of the hybrids. The cellular common <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> diverged very rapidly during evolution, with a base substitution rate similar to that reported for some primate and avian endogenous virogenes. The observation that two sets of covalently linked viral sequences evolved at very different rates suggests that the origin of M-MSV may be different from endogenous helper viruses and that cellular sequences homologous to MSV-specific <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> may be important to survival...|$|R
40|$|Recombination between viral and {{cellular}} genes can {{give rise to}} new strains of retroviruses. For example, Rous-associated virus 61 (RAV- 61) is a recombinant between the Bryan high-titer strain of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and normal pheasant DNA. Nucleic acid hybridization techniques were used to study the genome of RAV- 61 and another RAV with subgroup F specificity (RAV-F) obtained by passage of RSV-RAV- 0 in cells from a ring-necked pheasant embryo. The <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> acquired by these two independent isolates of RAV-F that were not shared with the parental virus comprised 20 to 25 % of the RAV-F genomes and were indistinguishable by nucleic acid hybridization. (In addition, RAV-F genomes had another set of <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> that were homologous to some pheasant <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> and also {{were present in the}} parental viruses.) A specific complementary DNA, containing only <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> complementary to those acquired by RAV- 61 through recombination, was prepared. These <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> were pheasant derived and were not present in the genomes of reticuloendotheliosis viruses, pheasant viruses, and avian leukosis-sarcoma viruses of subgroups A, B, C, D, and E. They were partially endogenous, however, to avian DNA other than pheasant. The fraction of these <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> present in other avian DNAs generally paralleled the genetic relatedness of these avian species to pheasants. However, there was a high degree of homology between these pheasant <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> and related <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> in the DNA of normal chickens as indicated by the identical melting profiles of the respective hybrids...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to a matrix method of {{comparative}} analysis of long <b>nucleotide</b> <b>sequences</b> {{by means of a}} presentation of each sequence in a form of three digital binary sequences.
