It is non-reactive, partly because of the {{strength}} of carbon–fluorine bonds, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. Where used as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. Also, it is frequently employed as coating on catheters; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause hospital-acquired infections.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwenty-six <b>non-stick</b> <b>coated</b> {{cookware}} {{samples were}} purchased covering {{a variety of}} products, coating/metal types and food contact applications. The polymer coatings were identified to be polyethersulphone, polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE), bisphenol A / epichlorohydrin and one coating for which no good match was obtained with infra-red library spectra. All of the products intended for stove-top use had a polymer coating containing PTFE. The coatings were analysed as purchased and after heating at 250 °C for 30 minutes to simulate actual conditions of use. Total solvent extractables were measured and the overall migration was determined into simulants. None of the products exceeded a draft overall migration limit of 10 mg/dm 2. Coating materials were analysed by headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), by liquid extraction followed by GC-MS, and by liquid extraction followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy with a particle-beam interface. Benzene was detected in two samples, at 1. 4 and 2. 4 µg/dm 2. These levels in the coatings are too low to give any detectable migration into foods. There was no detectable release of perfluorochemicals. Several other substances were identified and the worst case migration was calculated. The origin {{of many of the}} substances detected was considered to be by pick-up from the printed packaging materials that the cookware was sold in. Potential consumer exposure was calculated. None of the substances identified had the potential to exceed their tolerable daily intake (TDI) value. To confirm these worst-case calculations, the migration of certain phthalates and of bisphenol A was measured into food simulants. Migration levels were very low...|$|R
40|$|Hard {{coatings}} {{are often}} used for protection of tool surfaces due to coating properties like low friction and high wear resistance. Even though many of the hard coatings have been tested for wear, {{it is important to}} try new wear test setups to fully understand tribological mechanisms and the potential of hard coatings. Few experiments have been performed with dual-coated systems where the sliding contact surfaces are coated with the same, or different, hard coating. The dual-coated system could be the solution to many new technical devices and perhaps a further improvement of conventional coated systems. In this thesis, the wear tests of dual-coated systems were performed in dry reciprocating sliding mode at room temperature. This, quite off the ordinary, wear test setup was performed to study selected hard coatings and set focus on wear mechanisms in forthcoming future surface coating application areas like MEMS and orthopedic implants. Wear tests of four different PVD hard coatings, CrN, TiAlN, WC/C and diamond-like coating (DLC) were performed in a slider-on-flat-surface (SOFS) tribo-tester with reciprocation sliding mode at room temperature and dry sliding with TiAlN coated counter body. Wear mechanisms and the amount of wear were estimated, by investigation of the wear scars produced in SOFS, by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical profilometer (OP). Typical wear mechanisms found for coated surfaces in reciprocation sliding contact were crack formation, surface flattening for shorter sliding distance, elongation of surface defects, debris and thin film formation. Two types of film formation were found: tribo-oxidation film and formation of a self-lubrication film. The tribo-oxidation was the most evident for CrN and the formation of a self-lubrication film was revealed for DLC, where smearing of asperities were the initiation of the process. The DLC coatings showed lowest friction coefficient and worn volume of all the selected hard coatings. Adhesion measurements were performed for all coatings by AFM. Both the unworn and worn surface of each coating were investigated and two coatings, DLC and TiAlN, showed low adhesion forces, which indicated promising properties for small scale devices like MEMS and NEMS with <b>coated,</b> <b>non-sticking,</b> surfaces.

5000|$|Occasionally, the {{compression}} in the cylinder {{will cause a}} leak to form in the gasket and the gasket {{will have to be}} replaced, or severe damage can take place (a [...] "blown" [...] head gasket). This problem has been exacerbated by the use of aluminum rather than iron cylinder heads; while lighter than iron, aluminum has a much greater thermal expansion rate, which in turn causes a great deal more stress to be placed on the head gasket. Engine makers have responded to this by adding a <b>non-stick</b> <b>coating</b> such as Teflon {{to the surface of the}} head gasket.|$|E
50|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a {{synthetic}} fluoropolymer used in various applications including non-stick coatings. Teflon is {{a brand of}} PTFE, often used as a generic term for PTFE. The metallic substrate is roughened to promote adhesion, and layers of PTFE, from one to seven, are sprayed or rolled on, with {{a larger number of}} layers and spraying being better. The number and thickness of the layers and quality of the material determine the quality of the <b>non-stick</b> <b>coating.</b> Better-quality coatings are more durable, and less likely to peel and flake, and keep their non-stick properties for longer. Any PTFE-based coating will rapidly lose its non-stick properties if overheated; all manufacturers recommend that temperatures be kept below, typically, 260 C.|$|E
50|$|Traditional waffle irons are {{attached}} to tongs with wooden handles and are held over an open flame, or set on a stove. Most modern waffle irons are self-contained tabletop electrical appliances, heated by an electric heating element controlled by an internal thermostat. Professional waffle makers are usually made of cast iron whereas domestic models are often teflon coated. Many have a light that goes off when the iron is at the set temperature. Most modern waffle irons - particularly cast aluminum ones - are coated with a <b>non-stick</b> <b>coating</b> (e.g. teflon) to prevent the waffles from sticking to them. Cast-iron waffle makers are usually not coated and require seasoning like a cast-iron frying pan.|$|E
5000|$|A bread pan, {{also called}} a loaf pan, is a kitchen utensil {{in the form}} of a {{container}} in which bread is baked. Its function is to shape bread while it is rising during baking. The most common shape of the bread pan is the loaf, or narrow rectangle, a convenient form which enables uniform slicing. The bread pan is made from a conductive material such as metal which might be treated with a <b>non-stick</b> <b>coating.</b> It can also be made of heat resistant glass, ceramic, or a special type of paper that sticks to the dough but is easily removed, once cooked. Bread pans are found in a variety of designs and sizes providing the baker with different possibilities not only for baking bread, but also cakes and puddings.|$|E

50|$|The {{growth of}} diamond {{directly}} on a substrate allows {{the addition of}} many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond {{to be used as}} a heat sink. Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate. Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than Pyrex glass, a coefficient of friction close to that of Teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and strong lipophilicity would make it a nearly ideal <b>non-stick</b> <b>coating</b> for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.|$|E
50|$|Detergent, a {{replacement}} for soap, introduced in the postwar years, was used to keep clothes and dishes clean through the action of its active ingredient, tetrapropylene, a derivative of petroleum. The popular Tide brand became available in 1948. In 1964 permanent press fabrics were invented in the US by Ruth Rogan Benerito, a scientist at the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter. The press resulted from {{the treatment of the}} fabric with formaldehyde. Invented by DuPont scientist Dr. Roy J. Plunkett in 1938, polytetrafluoroethylene, a polymer considered the world’s most slippery substance, was introduced commercially as Teflon, in 1946 in the US. It is used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, including as a <b>non-stick</b> <b>coating</b> on the cooking surface of pots and pans and is manufactured in Canada by DuPont in Mississauga, Ontario. Krazy Glue (ethyl cyanoacrylate) was introduced to Canada in 1973.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium foil has a {{shiny side}} and a matte side. The shiny side is {{produced}} when the aluminium is rolled during the final pass. It is difficult to produce rollers with a gap fine enough {{to cope with the}} foil gauge, therefore, for the final pass, two sheets are rolled at the same time, doubling the thickness of the gauge at entry to the rollers. When the sheets are later separated, the inside surface is dull, and the outside surface is shiny. This difference in the finish has led to the perception that favouring a side has an effect when cooking. While many believe (wrongly) that the different properties keep heat out when wrapped with the shiny finish facing out, and keep heat in with the shiny finish facing inwards, the actual difference is imperceptible without instrumentation. Increased reflectivity decreases both absorption and emission of radiation. Foil may have a <b>non-stick</b> <b>coating</b> on only one side. The reflectivity of bright aluminium foil is 88% while dull embossed foil is about 80%.|$|E

5000|$|Adam Reid {{appears in}} most episodes {{as the host}} of the Equipment Corner segment. In this segment, he shows several brands of a piece of kitchen {{equipment}} and often asks Kimball, Lancaster or Davison to use several of the items or eat food prepared with different brands. In the end, he identifies the test kitchen's preferred brand and demonstrates its key features. For particularly expensive items, he often identifies a best buy: an item that was ranked highly but is significantly less expensive than the top brand. Throughout the show's run, items previously tested in other seasons have been retested as technology changes warrant; for instance, in season 8, garlic presses were retested due to the failure of the <b>non-stick</b> <b>coating</b> on the previous winning brand after heavy usage, and a new favorite brand was chosen. Occasionally the Equipment Corner segment does not focus on a single piece of equipment; instead, a [...] "buy it/don't buy it" [...] format is used to pick the best items among newer, trendier kitchen gadgets. One of Ried's favorite [...] "buy it" [...] gadgets was a timer that came with its own lanyard so cooks could wear it around their necks and not have to be in visual range of the oven timer; Ried revealed, however, that the timer was normally used to stay one step ahead of local traffic law enforcers by signaling {{that it was time to}} feed the meter or move the car.|$|E
