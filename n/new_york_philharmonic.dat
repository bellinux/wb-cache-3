5|$|During this period, Boult {{accepted}} {{some international}} guest conductorships, appearing with the Vienna Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, and <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> orchestras. In 1936 and 1937 he headed European tours with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, giving concerts in Brussels, Paris, Zurich, Budapest and Vienna, {{where they were}} especially well received. During his BBC years, Boult did not entirely lose contact {{with the world of}} opera and his performances of Die Walküre at Covent Garden in 1931 and Fidelio at Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1930 were considered outstanding.|$|E
5|$|For decades, Nielsen's music {{did not win}} {{recognition}} outside Denmark. The first recording was in 1933: Georg Høeberg {{with the}} Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra for Dancord. The first live recording was produced in 1950 with Erik Tuxen conducting the same orchestra at the Edinburgh Festival. An international breakthrough was made only when Leonard Bernstein recorded the symphony with the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra in 1962 for CBS. This recording helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country, and {{is considered one of}} the finest recorded accounts of the symphony.|$|E

5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E

5|$|For its 1908–09 {{season the}} Metropolitan {{management}} {{brought in the}} Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini to share duties with Mahler, who made only 19appearances in the entire season. One of these was a much-praised performance of Smetana's The Bartered Bride on 19 February 1909. In {{the early part of}} the season Mahler conducted three concerts with the New York Symphony Orchestra. This renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired him to resign his position with the opera house and accept the conductorship of the re-formed <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic.</b> He continued to make occasional guest appearances at the Met, his last performance being Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades on 5 March 1910.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, Takemitsu {{began to make}} use of {{traditional}} Japanese instruments in his music, and even took up playing the biwa—an instrument he used in his score for the film Seppuku (1962). In 1967, Takemitsu received a commission from the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra, to commemorate the orchestra's 125th anniversary, for which he wrote November Steps for biwa, shakuhachi, and orchestra. Initially, Takemitsu had great difficulty in uniting these instruments from such different musical cultures in one work. Eclipse for biwa and shakuhachi (1966) illustrates Takemitsu's attempts to find a viable notational system for these instruments, which in normal circumstances neither sound together nor are used in works notated in any system of Western staff notation.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Barbirolli, CH (2 December 189929 July 1970), né Giovanni Battista Barbirolli, was a British {{conductor}} and cellist. He {{is remembered}} above all as {{conductor of the}} Hallé Orchestra in Manchester, which he helped save from dissolution in 1943 and conducted {{for the rest of}} his life. Earlier in his career he was Arturo Toscanini's successor as music director of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic,</b> serving from 1936 to 1943. He was also chief conductor of the Houston Symphony from 1961 to 1967, and was a guest conductor of many other orchestras, including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, the Philharmonia, the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic, with all of which he made recordings.|$|E
5|$|The school's {{first class}} {{included}} nine students; the school now has 2,400 pupils drawn {{from all parts}} of Boston.

There are also several notable non-graduate alumni, including Louis Farrakhan, a leader of the Nation of Islam. Boston Latin admitted only male students at its founding in 1635. The school's first female student was admitted in the nineteenth century. In 1972, Boston Latin admitted its first co-educational class.|$|E

5|$|Wood {{declined}} the chief conductorships of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it {{his duty to}} serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals {{throughout the country and}} also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bohemia (then part of Austrian Empire) as a German-speaking Jew of humble circumstances, Mahler {{displayed}} {{his musical}} gifts {{at an early}} age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 {{as director of the}} Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York's Metropolitan Opera and the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1936, the {{management}} of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> was confronted with a problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame {{the management of the}} orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E

5|$|Ideas {{to produce}} a {{complete}} feature film were pursued in February 1938, when inquiries were made to extend Stokowski's contract. In August, Disney asked Stokowski's representative to have him return to the studios to select material for the new film, which was initially titled The Concert Feature. The pair further thought of presenting the film with an on-screen host to introduce each number in the program. Both had heard composer and music critic Deems Taylor provide intermission commentary during radio broadcasts of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic,</b> and agreed he would be most suitable for the role. Disney did contact Taylor about the project, but by then work on Pinocchio, Bambi, and development on his new Burbank studio kept him too busy {{to work on the}} new feature. In a change of plans, Taylor was asked during a call on September 3, 1938, leave to come to the studios as soon as possible. He left New York City for Los Angeles by train two days later for a month's visit.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{worked with}} his wife for many concerts, and was her piano accompanist at her recitals. In 1906, at the Norwich music festival he {{presented}} Beethoven's Choral Symphony and Bach's St Matthew Passion, {{with his wife}} among the singers. In December 1909, after a short illness, Olga Wood died. Cathcart took Wood away to take his mind off his loss. On his return, Wood resumed his professional routine, with the exception that, after Olga's death, he rarely performed as piano accompanist for anyone else; his skill in that art was greatly missed by the critics. In June 1911, he married his secretary, Muriel Ellen Greatrex (1882–1967), {{with whom he had}} two daughters. In the same year he accepted a knighthood, and declined the conductorship of the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra in succession to Mahler, as he felt it his duty to devote himself to the British public.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{his second}} effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars {{and take over}} a year to craft his second album. West was {{significantly}} inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Philharmonic</b> Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration. West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. Late Registration sold over 2.3million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.|$|E
