The discrete additive DBC and the group-additive DBC are IS-DBCs. This paper introduces an independent encoding scheme which employs permutation functions of the independent codes. This permutation <b>encoding</b> <b>approach</b> for the group-additive DBC is to employ group additions of the independent codes. This paper shows that the permutation <b>encoding</b> <b>approach</b> achieves the boundary of the capacity region for IS-DBCs, and yields a simple characterization of that capacity region.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{assigning}} labels to the nodes of the XML tree {{is called a}} labeling scheme. Based on the labels only, both ordered and un-ordered queries can be processed without accessing the original XML file. One more important point for the labeling scheme is the label update cost in inserting or deleting a node into or from the XML tree. All the current labeling schemes have high update cost, therefore {{in this paper we}} propose a novel quaternary <b>encoding</b> <b>approach</b> for the labeling schemes. Based on this <b>encoding</b> <b>approach,</b> we need not re-label any existing nodes when the update is performed.

The Berkeley architecture known as PRISM followed a block-based <b>encoding</b> <b>approach</b> with motion estimation module at decoder.

In the following section, we discuss the three main DVC architectures as mentioned above in more detail, namely PRISM (Puri and Ramchandran 2002), PDWZ (Aaron et al. 2002), and TDWZ (Aaron et al. 2002, 2004 b) codec.|$|R

30|$|The <b>encoding</b> <b>approach</b> that {{we propose}} takes {{inspiration}} from this work but provides two important novelties. It first extends {{the approach to}} a dynamical system to handle perturbations in the environment. It then exploits the GMM in a different way. In [21], each Gaussian {{is used as a}} parametric function to fit the local shape of a surface (as bell-shaped components), while it is used in our application to fit the joint distribution of the data. Combined with a regression approach, this allows us to exploit the statistical properties of the model if multiple demonstrations are available. Our work also differs {{in the sense that the}} analysis and encoding are not the final targets. Namely, we do not aim at classifying octopus movements or studying movements from a physiological perspective. Instead, we study the problem of designing technical approaches that could be used to transfer movement skills from biological systems to the STIFF-FLOP robot. This goal is reflected by the proposed <b>encoding</b> <b>approach</b> that has closer links to robotics systems, with a reversible representation with three Euler angles and a scalar offset, depending on two input variables (time and arm-index). The representation facilitates retargeting to the robot by representing the two agents as kinematic chains with Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.|$|R

The proposed method guarantees the minimum expected distortion for the decoded video, by optimally allocating the shape and texture coding parameters at the encoder. The resulting optimization problem is solved by Lagrangian relaxation and dynamic programming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has significant gains over the non network-adaptive method. 1...|$|R
