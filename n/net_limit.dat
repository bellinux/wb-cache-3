40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic liquidity provision process by informed and uninformed traders in the Taiwan index futures market, {{which is a}} pure limit order market. This paper provides empirical evidence in a natural market setting for the period January 2007 ‒December 2008. Several interesting empirical results are obtained. First, informed traders use relatively more limit orders than market orders. However, informed traders use relatively high percentage of market orders in the early trading session and switch to more limit orders {{for the rest of}} the day, except close to the end of the trading day. Liquidity provision by individual traders is just the reverse of that by informed traders during the trading day. Second, <b>net</b> <b>limit</b> order submissions by both informed and individual traders have positive relations with one-period lagged transitory volatility and negative relationship with informational volatility. Third, the <b>net</b> <b>limit</b> order submissions by informed traders have positive relationship with one period lagged spread; fourth, both the state of limit order book and order size have significant influence on all types of traders ’ strategy on submission of limit order versus market order during the intrada...|$|E
40|$|An {{unbiased}} {{search for}} debris discs around nearby Sun-like stars is reported. 13 G-dwarfs at 12 – 15 parsec distance were searched at 850 μm wavelength, and a disc is confirmed around HD 30495. The estimated dust mass is 0. 008 M ⊕ with a <b>net</b> <b>limit</b> 0. 0025 M ⊕ {{for the average}} disc of the other stars. The results suggest {{there is not a}} large missed population of substantial cold discs around Sun-like stars – HD 30495 is a bright rather than unusually cool disc, and may belong to a few hundred Myr old population of greater dust luminosity. The far-infrared and millimetre survey data for Sun-like stars are well fitted by either steady state or stirred models, provided that typical comet belts are comparable in size to that in the Solar system...|$|E

40|$|The author {{reviews the}} current state of affairs and {{thinking}} on external risk management for developing countries. He tries to identify the reasons behind the limited risk management by sovereigns. Perverse incentives arising from a too generous international safety <b>net,</b> <b>limited</b> access to international financial markets by developing countries arising from low creditworthiness, a limited supply of financial risk management tools suited to developing countries, and a poor supply of skills have inhibited risk management. Another constraint has been the limited attention given to the strategic objectives for risk management. Going forward, the author identifies actions by international financial markets, countries, and international financial institutions that can help improve risk management. These actions include GDP-indexed loans and efforts to develop price and weather indexes.

40|$|Norepinephrine (NE) {{transporters}} (NETs) terminate noradrenergic synaptic {{transmission and}} represent a major therapeutic target for antidepressant medications. NETs and related transporters are under intrinsic regulation by receptor and kinase-linked pathways, and clarification of these pathways may suggest {{candidates for the}} development of novel therapeutic approaches. Syntaxin 1 A, a presynaptic soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein, interacts with NET and modulates NET intrinsic activity. NETs colocalize with and bind to syntaxin 1 A in both native preparations and heterologous systems. Protein kinase C activation disrupts surface NET/syntaxin 1 A interactions and downregulates NET activity in a syntaxin-dependent manner. Syntaxin 1 A binds the NH 2 terminal domain of NET, and a deletion of this domain both eliminates NET/syntaxin 1 A associations and prevents phorbol ester-triggered NET downregulation. Whereas syntaxin 1 A supports the surface trafficking of NET proteins, its direct interaction with <b>NET</b> <b>limits</b> transporter catalytic function. These two contradictory roles of syntaxin 1 A on NET appear to be linked and reveal a dynami...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the consequences}} of an isolated, sudden and unexpected failure of a bank in alternative interbank payment system designs. We assess the exposures and the contagion by a counterfactual analysis assuming that payments currently settled by the pan-European large-value payment system, TARGET, are settled in alternative payment systems: an unsecured end-of-day net settlement system and a secured net settlement system with limits on intraday credit, with collateral and loss-sharing. The results indicate that systemic consequences of one bank's failure on the solvency of other banks can be rather low. If risk management techniques such as legal certainty for multilateral <b>netting,</b> <b>limits</b> on exposures, collateralisation and loss sharing are introduced, the systemic consequences can be mitigated to a high degree. How, and under which circumstances the analyzed failures would render other banks illiquid to meet their payment obligations is {{outside the scope of}} the paper.

40|$|The {{lack of a}} {{standard}} file format to represent Petri <b>net</b> <b>limits</b> the reuse of models among Petri net tools. In {{order to reduce the}} impact of this limitation the Petri Net Markup Language (PNML) has been proposed. PNML is an interchange file format for Petri nets based on XML. This paper presents a framework, called EZPetri, based on PNML. EZPetri is a perspective and a set of plug-ins of the Eclipse platform. The union of Eclipse and PNML has demonstrated itself to be an effective instrument for integrating Petri net tools and applications. The paper discusses the principles of the EZPetri, and presents one application integrated into the framework: Power Consumption Analysis Framework. Such application has been developed with no knowledge about EZPetri. This is a demonstration of the integration facilities provided by the framework. EZPetri is thus a fertile ground for combining existing Petri net tools and applications into a single environment, offering the Petri net community a new perspective of integration. 1...|$|R

40|$|Solar analogues {{approximately}} 100 Myr old {{may have}} dusty debris from collisions within evolving cometary belts, and such remnant discs {{might also be}} associated with earlier stellar-spin braking. We observed at 1. 2 mm wavelength a sample of 17 fast and slow rotators, mostly single K dwarfs, in the 100 Myr Pleiades cluster. No dust was detected for individual stars or the ensemble, {{so there are no}} cold massive debris discs nor any discernible relation of such distant material to stellar spin. The <b>net</b> <b>limits</b> from these data and our earlier far-infrared results imply that the typical Pleiades G/K dwarf has a relative disc-to-star luminosity ≲ 2 × 10 ^(− 4). Collisional evolution models have predicted greater luminosities at the 10 ^ 8 yr epoch, for debris discs evolving out of a proto-solar nebula. This suggests that substantial primordial discs such as that of the Sun are not the norm amongst young solar analogues, or that dynamical interactions with giant planets can remove much of the comet belt by as early as 100 Myr...|$|R

The solutions show behaviour of a laterally loaded pile is dominated by <b>net</b> <b>limiting</b> force per unit length (LFP) fully mobilised along the pile to a depth called slip depth. They are characterised by three parameters of Ng, ?o and n (to describe the LFP) and the soil shear modulus (Gs). Conversely, these parameters may be deduced by matching the predicted with measured response. To facilitate practical design, in this paper, the input values of Ng, ?o, n and Gs were deduced in light of measured response of 20 piles tested in sand. The result allows effect of pile types, installation action, and dry or submerged sand to be clarified. In addition, using analogy to pipeline-soil interaction, a new alternative expression described by the parameters kp, ?o and n is proposed to construct the LFP. The use of the previous parameter Ng and the new kp is discussed at length. Critical responses for typical deflection levels have also been provided. This back-analysis is elaborated via three typical cases. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
