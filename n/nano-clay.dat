An additional {{aim of this}} study was to observe the presence of <b>nano-clay</b> within both adhesive types using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Color, viscosity and the thermostability of these adhesives with <b>nano-clay</b> were also evaluated. First, AFM and TEM studies showed adequate dispersion and impregnation of <b>nano-clay.</b> The viscosity of PVAc adhesive was not affected by the incorporation of <b>nano-clay,</b> whereas the UF adhesive was. With both PVAc and UF adhesives, the presence of <b>nano-clay</b> increased the L∗ and b∗ color parameters, especially when 1. 5 wt% <b>nano-clay</b> was used. The incorporation of the <b>nano-clay</b> improved thermostability, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Finally, it was shown that the <b>nano-clay</b> incorporation improved SS and PWF. The highest values of SS were obtained when <b>nano-clay</b> was added at 1. 5 wt% concentration in the PVAc adhesive under dry conditions. SS was not affected by <b>nano-clay</b> addition in the UF adhesive under dry conditions. However, under wet conditions, both 1. 0 and 1. 5 wt% loadings of <b>nano-clay</b> increased SS with both adhesive types. The addition of <b>nano-clay</b> in both proportions increased PWF by approximately 15 % and between 20 - 30 % in dry and wet conditions, respectively, for the PVAc adhesive.

An effective stabilizing system for PVC/clay composites {{has been established in}} this work. Different types of stabilizers i. e. organo-tin, calcium/zinc, barium/zinc stabilizers and an epoxy co-stabilizer were investigated. It was found that the combination of the organo-tin stabilizer and the epoxy co-stabilizer was the most effective stabilizing system for PVC/clay composites. Different grades of Cloisite <b>nano-clays</b> supplied by Southern Clay Products Inc. were investigated. It was found that natural montmorillonite (Cloisite Na) did not cause premature degradation of PVC, however it was difficult to disperse in the PVC matrix due to its hydrophilicity. Ammonium modified <b>nano-clays</b> such as Cloisite lOA and Cloisite 30 B were compatible with PVC, and both <b>nano-clays</b> were much easier to disperse in PVC than Cloisite Na. Cloisite lOA seriously accelerated the degradation of PVC, but PVC/Cloisite 30 B system showed much better thermal stability. The effects of processing conditions on PVC/clay composite structure were investigated. The composite structure was characterized by both TEM and XRD. PVC/Cloisite Na nano-composites could not be successfully prepared no matter what processing conditions were used. Partially exfoliated and intercalated PVC/Cloisite 30 B nano-composites could be prepared by melt compounding. The particulate structure of PVC resin affected the distribution of clay, which could be improved by increasing the processing temperature. Almost fully exfoliated PVC/Cloisite 30 B nano-composites were successfully prepared by a solution process in tetrahydrofuran, and the plasticizer migration resistance ofthis composite was significantly improved. Phosphonium modified clays were also prepared successfully. They showed better thermal stability than ammonium modified clays, but the drying conditions still need to be optimized to produce a dispersable clay powder. Other commercial fillers for PVC such as calcium carbonate and hydrotalcite were compared with Cloisite 30 B. It was found that Cloisite 30 B provided the best improvement in plasticizer migration resistance, but decreased the tensile properties. Possible mechanisms were proposed. It is interesting to find that PVC crystallization in the clay galleries can occur during annealing that increased the clay gallery spacing.

Special attention was paid to specific parts of vehicle structures that are directly related to occupant and pedestrian safety concerns such as B-pillar, frontal bumper subsystem, and engine subframe. Two approaches were implemented to design composites and thermoplastic intensive vehicle components: experimental test and numerical simulation approaches. In experimental approach, experimental method was developed to establish reliable test procedure to characterize composite materials. Then, selected materials were manufactured and characterized under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. Furthermore, selected nano-modified composite materials were characterized to understand effect of presence of <b>nano-clays</b> into the matrix on the mechanical behavior of base material. On the other hand, thermoplastic material was modified with short glass fibers to improve its mechanical behavior for frontal vehicle system application. Besides, in this thesis adhesive joint was considered as alternative solution to achieve vehicle lightweight targets. Detailed material characterization and parametric study of hot melt adhesive (HMA) single lap joint were performed for bumper subsystem application. Accelerated ageing were also performed on selected HMA to represent the worst environmental condition in which the bumper subsystem could be exposed. Also, selected hot-melt adhesive was modified by nano-metal particles to obtain smart adhesive that allows bonded vehicle components to be easily detached during disassembly process. Particularly, simplified form of composite B-pillar (T-joint) was manufactured and quasi- static experimental tests were performed to validate the results obtained from numerical simulations.

Triethylamine (TEA) {{was used as the}} neutralizing agent. The polyester polyol segment consisted of neopentyl glycol (NPG), adipic acid, 1, 4 -cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid (1, 4 -CHDCA) and 2 -phosphonobutane- 1, 2, 4 -tricarboxylic acid (PBTCA), while the urethane hard segment consisted of toluene diisocyanate (TDI), dimethylolproponic acid (DMPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as a chain extender for increasing the hard segment content. Waxes and fillers were incorporated into the PU coating mixtures to investigate their effect on the barrier properties of the PU. Two types of fillers were used: nano-fillers and micro-fillers. The nano-fillers used included the Cloisite <b>nano-clays</b> NC 15 A, NC 93 A and NC 30 B, and the micro-fillers used included talc, kaolin clay and barium sulfate. Two different polyester polyols were synthesized: one containing a phosphate and the other containing no phosphate. The polyols were characterized in terms of their acid value, hydroxyl value and molecular mass. The PUs synthesized from the polyol containing no phosphate showed unfavourable barrier properties compared to results achieved with the phosphate-containing PU. The PU dispersions were applied to paperboard, and then dried at a maximum temperature of 130 oC for 15 to 60 seconds, depending on the coating volume. The PU-coated paperboard was characterized primarily by determining the moisture vapour transmission rate (MVTR), and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). PU films (stand alone, not supported by paper) were prepared by heating the concurrent PU dispersion in Teflon holders over three different temperature stages (60, 90 and 120 oC) for about 2 days. The dried films were then characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The PU coatings showed self-assembly properties, which were affected primarily by the ionic content (comprising of DMPA, PBTCA and excess TEA) and emulsion viscosity. These self-assembly properties were analyzed by static contact angle (SCA) and MVTR measurements. It was found that the final coating properties were affected by the self-assembly mechanism of the PU. Generally, the phosphated PU coatings had lower MVTR values than the non-phosphated PU coatings. SEM analysis showed that the phosphated PU coatings had no pinholes, while the non-phosphated PU coatings had pinholes. DMA analysis showed that the phosphated PUs had higher Tg values than the non-phosphated PUs. Further, the inclusion of the phosphate monomer increased the emulsion stability and the compatibility between the hard and soft segments of the PU. Also, the exfoliated PU nanocomposites at 1 % filler loading gave much better MVTR results compared to the PU microcomposites. It also rendered the coating to be non-blocking, with minimal change in MVTR...|$|R
40|$|Medical devices with {{embedded}} highly miniaturized microsystems {{are used}} as implants {{in the human body}} or as non-invasive devices for sensor applications outside the body. Those devices bear quite a lot of economic opportunities but they also do offer unique challenges compared to consumer or automotive applications. Medical applications need to provide biocompatibility, highest miniaturization, rough treatment, autoclave sterilization and harsh environment e. g. humidity, wax, dust, blood or urine to be applicable. And microelectronics packaging needs to protect the functional elements of the microsystem against these rigid conditions. And, with a different set of media, packaging needs to fulfill the same task for automotive applications, where a growing number of control units and sensor systems under the hood in the transmission oil or petrol can be found. For both markets low cost packaging concepts with high media resistivity is needed. Polymer materials - mainly epoxy resins - are widely used in microelectronics packaging. They are established in microsystem manufacturing, for adhesives as die attach glues or for encapsulants as molding compounds, glob tops or underfill materials. Low cost and mass production capabilities are the main advantages of these materials. But like all polymers they cannot provide a hermetical sealing due to their permeability properties. The susceptibility to diffusion of liquids and gases through the polymer and along the interfaces is a drawback for polymer materials in general, as water or other media inside a microelectronic package might lead to softening of the material and to a decreasing adhesive strength and resulting delaminations close to solder bumps or wire bonds reducing package reliability by decreasing the package structural integrity. Therefore, plastic packaging materials with enhanced humidity resistance allowing the manufacturing of miniaturized microsystems for demanding applications as e. g. medical devices would increase package reliability during assembly and lifetime ideally without cost increase and with no changes in processing. As filler particles have an important influence on the final material properties of microelectronic encapsulants, they are well suited for material modifications. Typically micro-sized silica particles are incorporated into the polymer matrix as the thermo-mechanical properties could be well adapted to reliable packaging demands. However, {{there are a lot of}} nano- and micro-sized filler particles with potential to enhance the humidity barrier properties of encapsulants. Working principles of these particles may range from large surface impact of nano-particles, barrier functionality due to stacked layer formation (<b>nano-clays),</b> highly hydrophobic particle surface and molecular water catcher function. Micro-and nano-sized SiO 2, bentonite, zeolites, Al 2 O 3, carbon black and carbon nano tubes have been selected for a systematic study. To evaluate the potential of such additives concerning moisture resistance particles are mixed with a microelectronic grade epoxy resin. Neat particles as well as formulations are characterized regarding their water absorption, diffusion and barrier properties. Additionally multi-layer encapsulants with highest humidity barrier properties are introduced. Here, the mechanical or thermo-mechanical functionality is separated from humidity barrier characteristic. Polymer layers are processed wet in wet resulting in a homogeneous encapsulation with gradient material properties. Different methods for characterization of the diffusion properties close to microelectronics application have been developed and applied for material analysis. The pros and cons of simple weight measuring for absorption testing, sorption analysis, TGA desorption measuring, dielectric spectroscopy and encapsulated humidity sensors are presented and discussed along testing results with formulations with the different filler particles. The results of the measurement allow a modeling of the diffusion behavior of the characterized encapsulants and therewith a forecast on the later reliability of the overall system...|$|R
40|$|Effects of <b>nano-clay</b> {{on weight}} loss of wood-plastic {{composites}} (WPC) by five fungi were studied. Nanoclay particles of 20 to 50 nm size were applied at 2, 4, and 6 % WPC of 0, 90 g/cm³ density. The white-rot fungi Physisporinus vitreus, Pleurotus ostreatus and Trametes versicolor {{as well as}} the brown-rot species Antrodia vaillantii and Coniophora puteana were used. Mass loss tests were conducted according to the European standard. The highest (3, 2 %) and lowest (0, 2 %) mass losses were produced by T. versicolor and P. vitreus in the control and 6 %-nanoclay treatments, respectively. Obviously the weight loss of WPC depends on the fungus species. Although weight losses were extremely low, <b>nano-clay</b> considerably inhibited the growth of wood-deteriorating fungi. Mass loss correlated with water absorption...|$|E

40|$|The {{superior}} {{material properties}} of polymer/clay nanocomposites have attracted much research {{interests in the}} past years. The hypothesis of polymer stiffening {{in the vicinity of}} the nano-c 1 ay described using the "core-shell" model has not been fully investigated yet. The investigation of the interfacial region by atomic force microscopy (AFM) has provided us with details of the physical state of this region. It was found that the polymer stiffening region could extend as far as 200 nm and 100 nm from the face and the edge of a <b>nano-clay</b> respectively. Two different degrees of polymer stiffening have been observed from AFM micrographs with the help of amplitude and phase contrasting techniques. The temperature dependant property of the stiffened polymer has been studied using a heating stage, which showed the stiffened polymer was softened with increasing temperature between the studied range, 60 °C and 91 °C. The relative polymer crystallinity derived from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data showed a general trend that increases with the clay content, regardless of the clay modification. However, an exception has been observed with the set of bi-axially drawn specimens, of which the highest polymer crystallinity was found to be the neat polymer when compared with the nanocomposites counterpart. It is believed that the presence of nano-c 1 ay particles restricted the reorientation of the polymer chains upon stress. From the in situ isothermal investigation of polymer crystal growth, it has been found the crystal grown from a <b>nano-clay</b> particle is larger than that from the bulk. This indicated that the crystallisation began at a lower temperature. The <b>nano-clay</b> and polymer crystal orientations have been further studied with X-ray texture analysis. It was found that the polymer chains were not completely aligned alone the extrusion direction as expected. Also, from the annealed specimens it was found that the orientation of the <b>nano-clay</b> particles had been influenced by the relaxation of the polymer chains.

40|$|The {{environmental}} degradation of synthetic polymers {{is enhanced by}} blending them with biopolymers such as starch, pro-oxidants (metal complexes, such as cobalt stearate and manganese stearate) and inorganic fillers. Recent {{studies have shown that}} <b>nano-clay</b> used to enhance the mechanical properties of polymers such as polyethylene also helps in polymer degradation (Lee et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2003). The present work aims to investigate the effect of montmorillonite <b>nano-clay</b> (MMT) on the photo-oxidation of polyethylene. The molecular weight changes of polyethylene in MMT/polyethylene nanocomposites upon UV irradiation were evaluated using rheological measurement and gel permeation chromatography. The molecular weight decrease for nanocomposites is found to be greater than that for the pure polyethylene. Furthermore, the increase in clay concentration also enhances the rate of photo-oxidation of the polymer. These results show that clay is acting as a self pro-oxidant during the photo-oxidation. The dynamic shear measurements show that both cross-liking and chain scission occur during the photo-oxidation but the latter seems to be dominant...|$|E
