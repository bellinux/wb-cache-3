5|$|The French Basque Country {{had been}} a {{favourite}} haven of ETA. Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership had lived there and {{used it as a}} base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. ETA commandos also operated from there, crossing the border into Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led to complaints in Spain that French authorities were <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> tackle ETA activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E

5|$|The {{violence}} and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government was <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising {{led by a}} vigilante group {{that came to be}} known as the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.|$|E
