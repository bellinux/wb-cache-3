50|$|The one-year {{delay in}} the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Act</b> and the Rules {{was the subject of}} {{considerable}} Parliamentary and political uproar in the winter session of the Indian Parliament in 2007. There was also mass protests across India demanding that the Act be notified in October 2007, and in November 2007 a week-long sit down protest took place in Delhi with the same demand.|$|R
50|$|After the government's {{plan to use}} the Royal {{prerogative}} (i.e., to {{give notice}} without explicit Parliamentary authority) was defeated in a court case, Parliament passed the European Union (<b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> Withdrawal) <b>Act</b> 2017, empowering the Prime Minister to invoke Article 50. The <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> withdrawal by a member state starts a negotiation period that is limited to two years, unless extended {{with the consent of}} all EU member states.

50|$|The role of Health Visitors {{was given}} greater weight {{following}} the <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> Births <b>Acts</b> 1907 and 1915 and the Maternity and Child Welfare Act 1918 which empowered local authorities to establish maternal and {{child welfare services}} {{and led to the}} first training courses for health visitors.

50|$|After a {{referendum}} on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union in June 2016 supported exiting the European Union, the Prime Minister Theresa May announced in October 2016 that Britain would invoke Article 50 by the end of March 2017. After the Supreme Court's ruling in Miller's case, followed by the passing of the European Union (<b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> Withdrawal) <b>Act</b> 2017, the prime minister sent the notification letter invoking Article 50 on 29 March 2017.|$|R
50|$|When the European Union (<b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> Withdrawal) <b>Act</b> 2017 {{was passed}} in March 2017, the terms of Britain's {{disengagement}} were unknown. The outlook was uncertain for patent protection of innovation and for the future funding of scientific research, and opinions differed on whether {{scientific research and development}} would be affected by a loss of mobility and international collaboration, or whether Britain's withdrawal from the European Union (EU) should be seen as an opportunity to expand scientific collaboration.|$|R

5000|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} the Miller case in January 2017 that the {{government}} needed parliamentary approval to trigger Article 50. [...] After the House of Commons overwhelmingly voted, on 1 February 2017, for the government's bill authorising the prime minister to invoke Article 50, the bill passed into law as the European Union (<b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> Withdrawal) <b>Act</b> 2017. Theresa May signed the letter invoking Article 50 on 28 March 2017, which was delivered on 29 March by Tim Barrow, the UK's ambassador to the EU, to Donald Tusk.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2016 the Conservative Prime Minister, Theresa May, {{announced}} that Article 50 would be invoked by [...] "the {{first quarter of}} 2017".

50|$|After the government's {{appeal was}} dismissed, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU {{formally}} introduced in parliament, on 26 January 2017, a bill that, on 16 March, was enacted without amendment as the European Union (<b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> Withdrawal) <b>Act</b> 2017. The act's long title is To Confer {{power on the}} Prime Minister to notify, under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, the United Kingdom's intention {{to withdraw from the}} EU. The act's two sections are to confer on the Prime Minister the power of giving the notice that the Treaty requires to be given when a member state decides to withdraw.|$|R
50|$|The Collective Redundancy (<b>Notification)</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1976 imposed an {{obligation}} on employers (who intend to collectively dismiss employees) “to give written notice of this intention to the relevant trade unions for consultation,” while {{that same year}} consultative works councils were replaced by powerful ones modelled after the German works councils.

50|$|Presently, {{there are}} 978 Employment Exchanges (EE) and University Employment Guidance Information Bureaus in India. These exchanges assist job seekers in finding jobs {{on the basis}} of their {{qualifications}} and experience. Prospective job seekers can pre-register themselves for various vacancies listed within the respective states. Registered candidates also have the option of updating their resume. Employers too can list their vacancies with the EEs and select candidates according to their requirement. The Employment Exchanges (Compulsory <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> Vacancies) <b>Act,</b> 1959, makes it compulsory for all establishments with 25 or more employees to notify their vacancies to the respective State EEs. Despite such provisions the exchanges fell short of catering to the rising and changing aspirations of the country’s youth. Caught in a vicious cycle of decreasing job seeker registrations and vacancy notifications by employers, these exchanges needed a transformation for better delivery of employment services.|$|R
50|$|The {{contentious}} trial {{begins with}} the introductory libellus of litigation and the citation and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> juridical <b>act.</b> The joinder <b>of</b> the issue occurs when {{the terms of the}} controversy are defined by the judge, through a decree of the judge. Further on, this part explains the trial of the litigation, especially the absence of a party, the intervention of a third person and the proofs. There are six kinds of proof: declarations of the parties, documents, testimonies, experts, judicial examination and inspection, and presumptions. After taking evidence the acts are published, the case concluded and then discussed. The case ends with the sentence of the judge. The sentence can be challenged by complaint of nullity and by appeal. Finally the res inducta and restitutio in integrum, the execution of the judgement, the judicial expenses and gratuitous legal assistance are regulated. As an alternative to this contentious trial there is the possibility of an oral contentious process.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to study whether {{and to what extent}} dismissal laws affect firm profitability. To achieve this goal, a within-country analysis was conducted into U. S. firms that were affected by the passage of the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining <b>Notification</b> <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> 1989 (the WARN Act) in the years between 1980 and 2000. The results show that the introduction of such dismissal law had a positive and statistically significant impact on firm profitability. Furthermore, this effect was particularly pronounced for those firms that invested in R&D expenditure...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I seek {{to provide}} a {{systematic}} record of the historical trajectory of the inclusion of accidents and violence as a legitimate issue of the health area. It will be shown that the process is not concluded, {{and that it is}} going on under the pressure of actors and by force of the circumstances. In the beginning, the issue finds a restricted space in the health agenda through the concepts "accidents, injuries and traumas". Since {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, the rights of different social subjects are incorporated, ranging from observation and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> violent <b>acts</b> against children, women, the elderly, to the discussion of social violence in its broadest sense, affecting the health of populations. In Brazil, this doubtlessly slow and intermittent process shows some attempts and a pioneer action of the Ministry of Health, carried out in cooperation with and under pressure of social, academic and professional movements: a diagnosis of morbidity and mortality from all kinds of violence, documenting a national policy towards reduction of accidents and violence on national level...|$|R

25|$|In 1906, {{children}} {{were provided with}} free school meals. However, many local councils ignored this system, as it was not compulsory for them to provide the free meals and {{the cost to the}} council was far greater than was subsidised for. The provision of free school meals was made compulsory in 1914, in which year fourteen million meals per school day were served (compared with nine million per school day in 1910), most of which were free. In 1912, half of all councils in Britain were offering the scheme. Recruitment for the Second Boer War demonstrated the undernourishment and illness among the working classes, and there were fears over future generations being unable to maintain military control of Britain's empire. Also, following an unfavourable report by the Board of Education's inspectors on infant education in 1906, school provision for children under five was restricted (previously, the normal age for the entry of working-class children into full-time education had been three). In 1907, the <b>Notification</b> <b>of</b> Births <b>Act</b> came into being, which sought to quantify and analyse the causes of (and ultimately further reduce) infant mortality.|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
