5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear,</b> and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield.

Equally, the mobility patterns of wealthier groups within any country are very different from those of poorer groups. Nevertheless, levels of development are not neatly correlated with particular volumes or types of migration.

40|$|Introduction: Electronic health {{records from}} primary care, are now {{aggregated}} {{in a number}} of large datasets from primary care settings, containing both coded data and free-text. Secondary users can easily undertake analyses using coded data. However although the balance of information between these codes and free text is variable, they rarely use the information contained in doctors’ free-text notes - because of their ‘messy’ nature and the costs of ensuring anonymity. Our epidemiological studies within the Patient Records Enhancement Project has demonstrated that free text contains important information, that is often ignored. Method: Human computer interaction (HCI) studies, using qualitative approaches, can help us understand the reasons for variability in the balance of coded and free text data. We undertook field studies in six GP surgeries which included observations of record use across the surgery, video analysis of real patient consultations and interviews with a range of surgery staff. We also undertook ‘simulated’ consultations, with two medical actors playing the part of the patient, allowing us to standarise the patient across doctors and software systems. Results: Preliminary results suggest several reasons for variation in data recording. Doctors create notes in order to best manage patients with little consideration for use by others, and reported limited awareness of secondary uses of the information. Doctors often record and “read” a picture painted by the overall record of a consultation or record symptoms and signs in free text notes, and choose not to code a definite diagnosis. If coding, they often choose a more general non specific code, even when they have inferred and acted on a clear diagnosis. These approaches reflect processes of progressing from differential to definite diagnosis, and the surgery’s administrative and consultation processes. Conclusion: Our findings may explain apparent delays in diagnosis often observed in epidemiological analyses. The picture portrayed within records may <b>not</b> be <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>clear</b> to researchers relying on coded data. Our results have implications for secondary users of data and assessment of data for quality of care.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{research}} on symbiotic nitrogen fixation of Pisumsativum and Rhizobium Leguminosarum. Nitrogen fixation {{takes place in}} the Rhizobium bacteroids which are located within root nodule cells. Two important proteins in nitrogen fixation are nitrogenase and leghemoglobin. Nitrogenase, the enzyme that reduces N 2 , is synthesized by Rhizobium. Leghemoglobin, which has a function in the O 2 supply of the bacteroids is synthesized by the plant. The molecular biology of symbiotic nitrogen fixation has hardly been the subject of investigation. The regulation of the synthesis in root nodules of e. g. nitrogenase and leghemoglobin is <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> completely <b>clear.</b> In this thesis some general aspects of nodule formation and the regulation of nitrogenase and leghemoglobin (Lb) synthesis have been studied. General aspectsThe transformation of Rhizobium bacteria into nitrogen fixing bacteroids was studied by investigating the DNA content of bacteroid cells by means of cytofluorometry (chapter I). Furthermore the RNA content {{and the quality of the}} RNA of R. leguminosarum (PRE) bacteroids were followed during pea development (chapter IV) and the protein synthesis in bacteroids and in the plant fraction of pea root nodules during nodule development was studied (chapter IV). The regulation of nitrogenase and leghemoglobin synthesis were studied in more detail. Regulation of nitrogenase and Lb synthesisNitrogenase and Lb synthesis were studied by 35 SO 4 2 -labeling of intact pea plants. Intact pea plants are a rather complicated system to study Lb or nitrogenase synthesis, but in more simple systems like e. g. detached root nodules, nitrogenase and Lb synthesis are repressed. We did not succeed in developing a more simple system suitable for studying nitrogenase or Lb synthesis (chapter VII). The regulation of nitrogenase and Lb synthesis were studied by culturing pea plants under conditions that diminished in vivo nitrogenase activity and by determining nitrogenase and Lb synthesis during nodule formation and development. Growth conditions used to diminish in vivo nitrogenase activity were: 1. the addition of NH 4 +to the growth medium (chapter II) and 2. waterlogging (chapter III). The synthesis of the two nitrogenase components and Lb during nodule formation and development was studied in two different ways: 1. the synthesis of these three proteins was followed by 35 SO 4 2 -labeling of pea plants of different ages, and analysis of bacteroid and plant proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (chapter IV), 2. the sequence of appearance of the two nitrogenase components and Lb during pea nodule formation was determined with specific radioimmunoassays for these three proteins (chapter V). In principle, turnover of proteins can be an important factor in the regulation of protein composition in the bacteroid or plant fraction of root nodules, e. g. during nodule development or after changes in the environmental conditions. Therefore turnover rates of bacteroid and plant proteins of pea root nodules, especially nitrogenase and Lb, were determined (chapter VI) ...|$|R
60|$|If you {{had heard}} the tone of mingled good-will, veneration, and condolence in which this {{greeting}} was uttered, even without seeing the face that completely harmonized with it, you would have no difficulty in inferring the ground-notes of Mr. Jerome's character. To a fine ear that tone said as plainly as possible--'Whatever recommends itself to me, Thomas Jerome, as piety and goodness, shall have my love and honour. Ah, friends, this pleasant world is a sad one, too, isn't it? Let us help one another, let us help one another.' And it was entirely owing to this basis of character, <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> from any <b>clear</b> and precise doctrinal discrimination, that Mr. Jerome had very early in life become a Dissenter. In his boyish days he had been thrown where Dissent {{seemed to have the}} balance of piety, purity, and good works on its side, and to become a Dissenter seemed to him identical with choosing God instead of mammon. That race of Dissenters is extinct in these days, when opinion has got far ahead of feeling, and every chapel-going youth can fill our ears with the advantages of the Voluntary system, the corruptions of a State Church, and the Scriptural evidence that the first Christians were Congregationalists. Mr. Jerome knew nothing of this theoretic basis for Dissent, and in the utmost extent of his polemical discussion he had not gone further than to question whether a Christian man was bound in conscience to distinguish Christmas and Easter by any peculiar observance beyond the eating of mince-pies and cheese-cakes. It seemed to him that all seasons were alike good for thanking God, departing from evil and doing well, whereas it might be desirable to restrict the period for indulging in unwholesome forms of pastry. Mr. Jerome's dissent being of this simple, non-polemical kind, it is easy to understand that the report he heard of Mr. Tryan as a good man and a powerful preacher, who was stirring the hearts of the people, had been enough to attract him to the Paddiford Church, and that having felt himself more edified there than he had of late been under Mr. Stickney's discourses at Salem, he had driven thither repeatedly in the Sunday afternoons, and had sought an opportunity of making Mr. Tryan's acquaintance. The evening lecture was a subject of warm interest with him, and the opposition Mr. Tryan met with gave that interest a strong tinge of partisanship; for there was a store of irascibility in Mr. Jerome's nature which must find a vent somewhere, and in so kindly and upright a man could only find it in indignation against those whom he held to be enemies of truth and goodness. Mr. Tryan had not hitherto been to the White House, but yesterday, meeting Mr. Jerome in the street, he had at once accepted the invitation to tea, saying there was something he wished to talk about. He appeared worn and fatigued now, and after shaking hands with Mrs. Jerome, threw himself into a chair and looked out on the pretty garden with an air of relief.|$|R
