50|$|Neighbourhood NoiseNSCA first co-ordinated a 'Noise Awareness Day' in 1997 - {{engaging}} around 50 {{local authorities}} in raising awareness of <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>noise</b> problems. During {{the following years}} the initiative gained increasing support - at its height attracting funding from all the UK government administrations, engaging at least 200 local authority participants and gaining national press coverage. To support the day and annual noise survey was undertaken, to guauge levels of noise complaint and views on effective solutions. During this time it expanded to Noise Action Week - which is still going strong, running in {{the third week of}} May. It receives increasing support from housing providers, alongside local authority noise teams, mediation services and schools.|$|E
50|$|TIDY Northern Ireland {{produces}} {{information on}} the cleanliness of Northern Ireland {{that is used to}} direct resources to prominent environmental quality issues. TIDY Northern Ireland has conducted campaigns and public information on litter including car litter, gum deposition, drug related litter, fast food litter, and youth litter. They have also campaigned on a number of other anti-social behaviour issues such as fly-tipping, dog fouling and <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>noise.</b> TIDY Northern Ireland endorses the government’s wider aim to deliver sustainable development. This work falls into three main areas: campaigning to get public action, the delivery of programmes to enable partners to deliver action in the community and the production of research and survey results to measure the quality of the local environment.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Noise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensive}} environmental factors affecting the general population. The present study is focused on the association between discomfort caused by noise and the incidence of certain diseases (ischaemic heart disease, stroke and hypertension). Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional questionnaire study, conducted in 10 cities in the Czech Republic, comprises two stages with 3592 obtained questionnaires in the first phase and 762 in the second phase. Twelve variables describe subjective responses to noise from different sources at different times of day. The intensity of the associations between variables was measured by correlation coefficient. Logistic regression was used for fitting models of morbidity, and confounders such as age and socio-economic status were included. The hypotheses from the first phase were independently validated using data from the second phase. Results: The general rates of noise annoyance/sleep disturbance had greater correlation with traffic noise variables than with <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>noise</b> variables. Factors significantly associated with diseases are: for hypertension − annoyance by traffic noise (the elderly, odds ratio (OR) 1. 4) and sleep disturbance by traffic and <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>noise</b> (the elderly, OR 1. 6); for ischaemic heart disease − the general rate of noise annoyance (all respondents, OR 1. 5 and the adults 30 – 60 years, OR 1. 8) and the general rate of annoyance and sleep disturbance (all respondents, OR 1. 3); for stroke − annoyance and sleep disturbance by traffic and <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>noise</b> (all respondents, OR 1. 8). Conclusion: Factors that include multiple sources of noise or non-specific noise are associated with the studied diseases more frequently than the source-specific factors...|$|E

40|$|Key {{ecosystem}} {{services provided by}} urban greenspace in the UK as identified by Davies et al. (2011) are valued using the benefit transfer method. These benefits include recreation, aesthetics, physical and mental health, <b>neighbourhood</b> development, <b>noise</b> regulation and air pollution reduction provided to local residents as a bundled good. A number of additional {{ecosystem services}} provided by urban greenspace are covered elsewhere. Sen et al. (2011) value recreational benefits of parks to non-residents via day trips, Mourato et al. (2011) cover domestic gardens, Termansen et al. (2011) considers the benefits of carbon stored by urban ecosystems and Morling (2011) treats biodiversity. Nevertheless, some services like the impact of urban greenspace on the reduction of downstream flooding risks are not covered. The values presented should therefore be treated as lower bound estimates. Based on a meta-analysis of economic studies valuing urban greenspace in the UK, marginal value functions of proximity to Formal Recreation Sites (FRS: parks, gardens, accessible recreation grounds and accessible woodlands of at least 1 ha) and City-Edge Greenspace are estimated. A marginal value function of General Greenspace (natural land cover) is derived from Cheshire and Sheppard (1995). For five UK cities these value functions are combine...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{associations}} of annoyance to noise {{and exposure to}} residential traffic with sociodemographic, socioeconomic and regional characteristics as well as housing conditions, a population-based sample of 7, 988 adults 18 – 79 years of age was studied in the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS 1). Annoyance to noise and exposure to residential traffic were assessed by self-administered questionnaires. A total of 6. 3 % of the participants reported a high to very high exposure to residential traffic noise, 3. 7 % to <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>noise</b> and 2. 1 % to aircraft noise. An excessive exposure to residential traffic was reported by 21. 3 % of the participants. A high annoyance to traffic and neighborhood noise {{was associated with a}} lower equivalised disposable income and poor housing conditions. Additionally annoyance to neighborhood noise was associated with low socioeconomic and occupational status. A high annoyance to aircraft noise was only associated with a low equivalised disposable income and living in apartment blocks. Exposure to residential traffic was associated with all investigated indicators. At present in Germany environmental exposures are social unequally distributed and may lead to negative health consequences in social disadvantaged groups...|$|E
40|$|Although in Germany {{there have}} been {{repeated}} noise prevention efforts since the 50 ies, strain on residential and working population due to noise has been growing steadily. Road traffic noise especially has increased to an extent that is hazardous to health. Municipal authorities of spas (health resorts) and recuperation areas are highly committed to preserving or restoring a calm environment and are therefore specially qualified {{to take the lead}} abatement effectuation. This documentation summarises the results of 56 studies and other publications (analyses of the level of noise pollution as well as integrated concepts for noise reduction), which have been written for the benefit of three participating case study municipalities: Bad Pyrmont, Bad Waldsee and Bad Woerishofen. The suggestions of the specialists are subdivided into 9 categories (land use planning, traffic noise, noise from construction sites, <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>noise,</b> low-noise product procurement, public relations work, etc.) and correspond to roughly 70 specific types of action. To render this documentation of particular value to planners, project examples from each of the three participating areas is given. Special emphasis is placed on the legal context, implementation difficulties and the financing of the measures. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceIn {{environmental}} epidemiology, studies {{rely on the}} quantification of subject'sexposures in {{a surface}} defined as the subject exposure area. For outdoor exposure, this area is often considered as the subject's neighbourhood. But, depending on the authors, the size {{and the nature of}} this neighbourhood differs, making difficult to compare results. In order to study the impact of the sampling surface on the noise exposure values affected to a subject, a high definition environmental noise model has been builton a middle-sized French city. Outdoor <b>neighbourhood</b> <b>noise</b> indices were computed at 10, 394 residential buildings, using eight different sizes of buffers defined by different radius values: 50 m, 100 m, 150 m, 200 m, 250 m, 300 m, 350 m and 400 m. For each buffer, noise indices correspond to the average noise level in the buffer's area, in LAeq 24 h. Results were first compared using Friedman's test. Post-hoc pairwise comparison were then conducted using Wilcoxon test and Siegel & Castelanne adjusted P-values. Indice differences between the smallest and the biggest size of buffer were compared for each building by subtracting 50 m buffer noise indice to 400 m buffer noise indice (? 400 - 50 =LAeq 24 h- 400 m - Laeq 24 h- 50 m). Influence of urban environmental factors (distance to main noise source, urban morphology and deprivation index) was analysed using a multilevel modelling. The means of the eight indices range between 49. 0 dB to 49. 4 dB, despite samples appears to be significantly different (P< 0. 05). The ? 400 - 50 values ranges between - 16. 1 dB to + 16. 9 dB, and are significantly associated with urban environmental factors (All P< 0. 01). The size of the sampled surface does not seem to influence the estimated average noise exposure. However, for each building, the size of the neighbourhood seriously influence the estimated values. The environmental composition also appears to be of important contribution and should be carefully considered in the choice of the neighbourhood size...|$|E
30|$|A {{large number}} of methods have been {{proposed}} for spatio-temporal noise reduction in TOF images and similar imaging modalities, based on other 3 D scanning techniques. Techniques based on non-local denoising [9, 10] were applied to sequences acquired using the structured light methods. For a given spatial neighbourhood, they find the most similar spatio-temporal neighbourhoods {{in other parts of}} the sequence (e.g., earlier frames) and then compute a weighted average of these <b>neighbourhoods,</b> thus achieving <b>noise</b> reduction. Other non-local techniques, specifically aimed at TOF cameras have been proposed in [8, 11, 12]. These techniques use luminance images as a guidance for non-local and cross-bilateral filtering. The authors of [12 – 14] present a non-local technique for simultaneous denoising and up-sampling of depth images.|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{processing}} of data from colour-coded range nder, an active computer vision system for 3 D reconstruction of a scene, we study the problems relative to monotonicity in interpolations and approximations. First part of the paper concentrates on interpolations, discusses their desired properties, such as linearity, smoothness or comonotonicity, and presents several interpolation methods. We deal with approximation to ensure (piecewise) monotonicity {{in the second part}} of the text. Previous works on monotone approximation are reviewed, a linear and nonlinear smoothing theories introduced after an analysis of the experimental data properties. Then we present an approximation method consisting of edge detection (to prevent inter-region smoothing) combined with approximation through weighted averaging in a locally adaptive <b>neighbourhood</b> (to remove <b>noise</b> and ensure monotonicity), and suggest areas for further research.

40|$|Motivated by {{processing}} {{data from}} rainbow range finder, an active {{computer vision system}} for 3 -D reconstruction of a scene, we need to approximate experimental, noisy data by a (piecewise) monotonically increasing function. This paper presents a solution consisting of edge detection (to prevent inter-region smoothing) combined with approximation through weighted averaging in a locally adaptive <b>neighbourhood</b> (to remove <b>noise</b> and ensure monotonicity). 1 Introduction It often happens in experiments that theoretically the data {{are known to have}} certain properties but when measured they behave in a different way. Frequently the misbehaviour is caused by noise present in the experiment, and we would like it to be removed by filtering. When designing the filter, it is highly advantageous to employ any knowledge we have on the desired data properties. For example, at one step of processing of experimental data from rainbow range finder, a system for 3 D reconstruction of a scene, the wavelengt [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Although accumulating {{evidence}} {{over the past}} thirty years indicates that noise is an environmental stressor in residential settings, much of the data emanated from studies in high-intensity, noise impact zones around airports or major roads. Little is known about religious noise, especially at night, which is increasingly a growing concern for both the general public and policy-makers in sub-Saharan Africa. Using geographical information systems (GIS), this study measured and mapped exposure to religious noise in a rapidly urbanising municipality in Ghana. Quantitative noise risk assessment was used to evaluate the risk of religious noise-induced hearing loss to residents in the exposed neighbourhoods. The results show that all neighbourhoods where churches were situated had at least one location with significant risk of noise-induced hearing loss. However, there was no statistically significant relationship between <b>neighbourhoods</b> where religious <b>noise</b> exposure was the highest and where noise annoyance was the highest. The magnitude of the noise values for night-time exposure is remarkable particularly given that excessive night-time noise exposure has the greatest detrimental effect on public health. There is the need to focus on vulnerable groups, sensitive hours of the night, and possible confounding with air pollution in order to wholly address this potential hazard...|$|R
40|$|Rarely do we {{know the}} {{perception}} toward neighbourhoods in people specifically with health conditions. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to understand the perception toward neighbourhoods among adults with a series of the existing health conditions in a country-wide and population-based setting. Data were retrieved from and analysed in Scottish Household Survey, 2007 – 2008. Information on demographics, self-reported health conditions and perception toward neighbourhoods and the surrounding facilities was obtained by household interview. Analysis including chi-square test, t test and logistic regression modelling were performed. Of 19, 150 Scottish adults (aged 16 – 80) included in the study cohort, 1079 (7. 7 %) people were dissatisfied with their living areas; particularly for those who experienced harassment (15. 4 %), did not recycle or with dyslexia, chest, digestive, mental and musculoskeletal problems. Twenty to forty per cent reported common <b>neighbourhood</b> problems including <b>noise,</b> rubbish, disputes, graffiti, harassment and drug misuse. People with heart or digestive problems were more dissatisfied with the existing parks and open space. People with arthritis, chest or hearing problems were more dissatisfied with the waste management condition. People with dyslexia were more dissatisfied with the existing public transportation. People with heart problems were more dissatisfied with the current street cleaning condition. People with hearing, vision, speech, learning problems or dyslexia were also more dissatisfied with sports and recreational facilities. People with heart, chest, skin, digestive, musculoskeletal, vision, learning, speech and mental disorders and dyslexia were more dissatisfied with their current neighbourhood environments.
