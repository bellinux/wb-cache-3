Styles, however, canceled an appearance in the Ring of Honor promotion on August20. He came back for a promotion on August27 at their Dragon's Gate Invasion event, losing a match to CIMA.|$|E

The filmmakers strove for authenticity and realism in the images, and as such little colouration was added after, and the natural contrast of colours between the locations in Washington and Morocco were allowed to show through.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} {{the ship was}} {{transferred}} to the 4th Battle Squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee, who inspected Collingwood on 8 August 1916. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.|$|E

5|$|Amy Dudley's death {{caused a}} scandal. Despite the inquest's outcome, Robert Dudley was widely {{suspected}} to have orchestrated his wife's demise, a view {{not shared by}} most modern historians. He remained Elizabeth's closest favourite, but with respect to her reputation she could <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> a marriage with him. A tradition that Sir Richard Verney, a follower of Robert Dudley, organized Amy Dudley's violent death evolved early, and Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious and influential libel of 1584 against Robert Dudley, by then Earl of Leicester, perpetuated this version of events. Interest in Amy Robsart's fate was rekindled in the 19th century by Walter Scott's novel, Kenilworth. The most widely accepted modern explanations of her death have been breast cancer and suicide, although a few historians have probed murder scenarios. The medical evidence of the coroner's report, which was found in 2008, is compatible with accident as well as suicide and other violence.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Ottoman fleet {{over the course}} of the decade following their arrival in November 1907. They took part in the first fleet maneuver conducted by the fleet in over twenty years in 1909. Neither ship saw action during the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, as Peyk-i Şevket had been interned at British-controlled Suez at the outbreak of war, and Berk-i Satvet was stationed with the reserve fleet in the Sea of Marmara, which did <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> confrontation with the significantly stronger Italian fleet. Both ships saw combat during the First Balkan War in 1913, primarily in supporting Ottoman forces ashore in East Thrace. The ships provided gunfire support to the Ottoman army holding the Çatalca line in defense of the capital at Constantinople. Berk-i Satvet also took part in two brief skirmishes with the Greek Navy.|$|E

5|$|By 10 October Toyoda's tour of {{the front}} was complete.

Toyoda could <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> a return trip home through a concentrated enemy carrier force that now embarked more than 1,000 aircraft, especially not after previous Combined Fleet commanders had been lost during aerial engagements. As a result, he was grounded far from Combined Fleet headquarters at a decisive moment. Out of position and with inadequate lines of communication, the response to such overwhelming enemy air power was left to Toyoda's Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka.|$|E

5|$|Fliegerkorps II sent 650 sorties against Pedestal from 11–14 August {{and claimed}} 12 {{aircraft}} shot down for 18 losses.

Royal Navy gunners and Fleet Air Arm fighters claimed 74 aircraft shot down but actually destroyed 42 Axis aircraft, 26 from the Regia Aeronautica and 16 Luftwaffe aircraft. The Fleet Air Arm lost thirteen aircraft on operations and sixteen Sea Hurricanes when Eagle was sunk, the RAF lost a Beaufighter and five Spitfires and a Sunderland was shot down by Giada. The Allies could <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> such losses again and another large convoy to Malta was not attempted until November 1942, when the re-capture of airfields in Egypt and Libya after the Second Battle of El Alamein made it much easier to provide land-based air cover.|$|E

5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, {{and it would}} never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenses enough that he did <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the fourth day, England set about extending their lead. Early in the innings, the capacity crowd encroached substantially onto the ground and the umpires spent eight minutes trying to force them back {{to the edge of the}} official playing area, but they again spilled over. Initially, Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously to see off the new ball before trying to lift the run rate. Lindwall's first two overs were maidens, but Hutton and Washbrook scored 21 runs from his next five overs, while taking only five from Miller's six overs. The English batsmen attacked the bowling and reinforced their aggressive strokeplay with quick running. England reached lunch at 72/0 with Hutton on 40 and Washbrook on 28. Washbrook was particularly confident and Bradman decided to <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> Johnson in the morning session.|$|E

Smith’s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> this.|$|E

5|$|Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed {{at least}} 64 {{artillery}} pieces {{on a narrow}} front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the artillery and infantry of the I Russian Corps. In the artillery barrage that lasted until 17:00, the forces of Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish artillery positions, but every time the charge was bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle {{all the way to}} Górce. Half of the Russian artillery fought an intense artillery duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences. Although the barrage prepared the field for yet another Polish counter-attack, Krukowiecki would <b>not</b> <b>risk</b> it.|$|E
