2500|$|Don Weatherburn of the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research {{has raised}} {{concerns}} that police are using future Court Attendance <b>Notices</b> instead <b>of</b> refusing <b>bail</b> {{as much as}} they were before. [...] Weatherburn noted that during the period when the new law was first introduced, there were [...] "fewer bail cases coming before the courts". [...] At around {{the same time as the}} new Bail Act commenced, the NSW Police Force put into practice a new custody system. According to some police officers this has made the bail assessment paperwork take three times as long as the previous system.|$|R
2500|$|The {{decision}} to set bail {{and the amount}} <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> to set are discretionary, and the central issue regarding bail is insuring the defendant's future appearances in court; factors {{to be taken into}} consideration are defined in [...] In practice, bail amounts are typically linked to charge severity rather than risk of failure to appear in court, judges overwhelmingly rely only on cash bail and commercial <b>bail</b> bonds instead <b>of</b> other forms <b>of</b> <b>bail,</b> and courts rarely inquire into the defendant's financial resources to understand what amount <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> might be securable by them.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} the law <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> has been used to criminalize dissent in Canada. Three case studies are analyzed to demonstrate how the law <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> has been applied to those arrested at global justice demonstrations associated with militant civil disobedience. The first case study examines the bail conditions imposed on protesters arrested at anti-APEC demonstrations in Vancouver 1997. These bail conditions were intentionally designed to prevent those arrested from attending the protests. The second case study focuses on the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty (OCAP), with an analysis <b>of</b> how the <b>bail</b> system has been used to criminalize its activism through a combination <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> conditions prohibiting public protest, pre-trial detention orders of its leaders, and prohibitions on association with OCAP. The final case study turns to arrests at demonstrations against the Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April 2001, documenting the intentional violation of the statutory right to a bail hearing within 24 hours, and the denial <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> to a perceived leader of the global justice movement. Viewed together, these case studies demonstrate that the law <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> has provided insufficient protections for civil liberties...|$|R

5000|$|The Court however {{upheld the}} portion of section 515(10)(c), which allows the denial <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> [...] "to {{maintain}} confidence {{in the administration of}} justice" [...] as it was a valid and just reason to deny bail.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various statutory presumptions surrounding bail and the risk <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> refusal. Method: A total 37, 165 cases where defendants were either granted or refused bail by a Local Court were analysed to determine what impact the presumptions surrounding bail had on the risk <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> refusal. Controls {{included in the analysis}} were age; gender; Indigenous status of the defendant; number of concurrent offences; the number of prior criminal convictions; whether the offender had a previous conviction for a breach offence; the number of days between the date of first court appearance and the date of finalisation; whether the defendant had legal representation in the current case; and the plea in the current case at time of finalisation. Results: After adjusting for the effects of other factors, the risk <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> refusal was found to be higher for those charged with offences where there was a presumption against bail or where bail should only be granted in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The risk <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> was also elevated for those with a larger number of prior convictions and/or concurrent offences. Three main anomalies were noted. Firstly, nearly half of those falling into the ‘exceptional circumstance’ category were on bail at their final court appearance. Secondly, factors such as prior criminal record, number of concurrent offences and delay in finalising a case, exert a much stronger influence on the risk <b>of</b> <b>bail</b> refusal than the presumptions surrounding bail. Thirdly, the bail refusal risk was higher for those charged with offences where there was no presumption for or against bail than for those charged with offences involving a presumption against bail. Conclusion: The NSW Bail Act may need some simplification and clarification...|$|R
