Other times, something will just grab me - a headline, or a conversation I've had with someone, or maybe just a goofy observation that I've made - and that in itself will inspire an entire song. Really for me it's just about observing life, my own life, too, and trying to be introspective and thoughtful about my own growth. I guess it's a type of journaling experience." ...|$|E

Anderson was {{inspired}} by a weekend of fun and adventure when his love for R/C planes and his son's love for Lego came together and they built and programmed a UAV driven by the Lego Mindstorms NXT.
