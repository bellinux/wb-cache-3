25|$|Due to {{the great}} number of {{historic}} bridges, arches, and gateways throughout the European continent, all the structures represented on the notes are entirely stylised illustrations of the relevant architectural styles, designed to evoke the landmarks within the European Union, representing various European ages and styles. For example, the 5 euro note has a generic rendition of Classical architecture, the 10 euro <b>note</b> <b>of</b> Romanesque architecture, the 20 euro <b>note</b> <b>of</b> Gothic architecture, the 50 euro <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the Renaissance, the 100 euro <b>note</b> <b>of</b> Baroque and Rococo, the 200 euro <b>note</b> <b>of</b> Art Nouveau and the 500 euro <b>note</b> <b>of</b> modern architecture. The initial designs by Robert Kalina were of actual bridges, including the Rialto Bridge in Venice and the Pont de Neuilly in Paris, and were subsequently rendered more generic. In 2011, Dutch artist Robin Stam {{and the town of}} Spijkenisse in the Netherlands built seven bridges of colored concrete after the designs on the seven euro banknotes.|$|R

5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range <b>of</b> <b>notes,</b> the lowest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest <b>note</b> <b>of</b> the oboe.|$|R
