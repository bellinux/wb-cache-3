She subsequently started taking further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends. Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine's Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded there was <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the shy and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E
5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does {{not like to be}} told what she can and cannot do. After it is confirmed that she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E

5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the book.|$|E

25|$|The {{radio range}} system had {{recently}} been calibrated twice and the commission found <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This {{would have made the}} beam north of the cone of silence twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's radio range equipment also lacked a marker beacon receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route instruction book, have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the let-down being started too early.|$|E

25|$|Hirschfeld {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in the Harden–Eulenburg affair of 1906-09, which turned to be the most explosive sex scandal of Imperial Germany. During the libel trial in 1907 when General Kuno von Moltke sued the journalist Maximilian Harden after the latter had run an article accusing Moltke of having a homosexual relationship with the politically powerful Prince Philipp von Eulenburg, who was the Kaiser's best friend, Hirschfeld testified for Harden. Hirschfeld in his role as an expert witness testified that Moltke was gay, and thus what Harden had written was true. The homosexual Hirschfeld — who passionately wanted to make homosexuality legal in Germany — believed that proving that Army officers like Moltke were gay would help his case for legalization, and as such he also testified that he believed there was <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> Moltke.|$|E

He finds her breaking up with her previous boyfriend, Ralph Mandy, to be with Dolarhyde; McClane grants Mandy's request for a final kiss goodbye. Enraged with jealousy, Dolarhyde kills Mandy. He kidnaps Reba and, having taken her to his house, sets the place on fire. He says he intends to kill her and then himself, but finds himself unable to shoot her. The shotgun fires, and a body hits the floor. Reba escapes just before the house explodes. Graham later comforts her, telling her that there is <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> her, and that the kindness and affection she showed Dolarhyde probably saved lives.|$|E
5000|$|Used {{exhibits}} - These are existing exhibit properties, usually {{older and}} sometimes worn (though not necessarily), originally built for another purpose, available for rental or purchase.

25|$|Over {{the next}} eight centuries, Irish, Scottish, and English missionaries reintroduced Christianity into the German territories. During {{the period of the}} Frankish Empire, the two most {{important}} of these missionaries were Columbanus, who was active in the Frankish Empire from 590, and St. Boniface, who was active from 716. The missionaries, particularly the Scottish Benedictines, founded monasteries (Schottenklöster, Scottish monasteries) in Germany, which were later combined into a single congregation governed by the Abbot of the Scots monastery at Regensburg. The conversion of the Germanic peoples began with the conversion of the Germanic nobility, who were expected to impose their new faith on the general population. This expectation was consistent with the sacral position of the king in Germanic paganism: the king is charged with interacting with the divine on behalf of his people. Hence the general population saw <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> their kings choosing their preferred mode of worship. The favoured method of showing the supremacy of the Christian belief was the destruction of the holy trees of the Germans. These were trees, usually old oaks or elm trees, dedicated to the gods. Because the missionary was able to fell the tree without being slain by the god, his Christian god had to be stronger.|$|E
25|$|The Red Devils' {{next game}} was against Arsenal the {{following}} Sunday, in a six-pointer that would either rule Arsenal {{out of the}} title race or bring them right back into it. A United win would put them six points ahead of their nearest league rivals, Chelsea, and nine ahead of Arsenal, and with Chelsea playing the following day, a win was essential {{to put pressure on}} the Blues. Arsenal started the match well, and looked to take the game to United through sheer brute force, attacking with pace and power. Indeed, they created the best chances of the half, United's best opportunity falling to Wayne Rooney, who refused to go down under the challenge of Kolo Touré, before seeing his shot saved by the foot of Jens Lehmann in a one-on-one situation. The first half finished goalless, but it was not long into the second half before the crowd saw the first goal of the game. It was a controversial goal, however, as it seemed that Emmanuel Adebayor had played Cesc Fàbregas' cross into the net with his left arm. Nevertheless, referee Howard Webb gave the goal, seeing <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> it. Just five minutes later, though, United hit back. Michael Carrick played the ball into the Arsenal penalty area, where it was handled by William Gallas, and the referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty. As expected, Cristiano Ronaldo took responsibility for the penalty, and coolly swept it into {{the left side of the}} net. However, he was made to take the kick again as Park Ji-sung was deemed to be encroaching on the penalty area before the kick. Fortunately, Ronaldo was just as successful with his second attempt, burying the ball in the bottom left-hand corner. In an attempt to force the issue by going for the winner, Alex Ferguson brought on Carlos Tevez and Anderson in place of Park and Scholes. The Reds were cutting it fine, as Van der Sar was forced to make two reflex saves from his own defenders, Wes Brown and Rio Ferdinand. Tevez then sent a warning shot across the Arsenal bow, shooting narrowly wide from 25yards. Then, with 20 minutes to go, Patrice Evra was brought down just outside the Arsenal box. With the Arsenal defence expecting a typical Ronaldo free-kick, they were caught off guard when Owen Hargreaves played an immaculate free-kick over the wall, dipping into the bottom left corner of the goal, leaving Lehmann rooted to his goal line. United continued to press, not giving Arsenal an inch, and though Van der Sar was called on to save a header from Nicklas Bendtner, the Red Devils managed to hold onto their lead and extend their lead at the top of the table. Chelsea, now the only team with a realistic chance of stopping United winning the title failed to reduce the lead to three points the following day, only managing a 1–1 draw at home to Wigan Athletic. They followed this up with a 1–0 win over Everton the following Thursday, reducing the lead to two points with just three games remaining, although United now had a game in hand.|$|E
