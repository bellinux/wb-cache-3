Swan comments: [...] "if you {{can drive}} it, fly it, or hitch it to a donkey, you'll find it in GURPS Vehicles, a staggeringly complete collection of conveyances for the GURPS game (but adaptable to other game systems with a little effort). New to this edition are the plethora of starships, a slew of new accessories, <b>and</b> all the <b>nips</b> <b>and</b> <b>tucks</b> necessary to ensure compatibility with GURPS Robots (also by Pulver).

500|$|Because of the DSi's {{additions}} to the DS Lite design, critics recommended the console {{to those who had}} not purchased a previous DS model. Pete Metzger of the Los Angeles Times considered the DSi to be [...] "more like version 2.5 than a total reboot", but called its new features [...] "worthwhile {{additions to}} an already great product." [...] Gladstone gave the DSi a score of 75/100, and said that Nintendo [...] "puts in smart <b>nips</b> <b>and</b> <b>tucks</b> to its already-svelte handheld while adding a raft of useful multimedia features." [...] Harris and Lowe defined the console's hardware redesign as [...] "evolutionary", rather than [...] "revolutionary". After the DSi was unveiled, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew J. Fassler called the DSi Shop a [...] "tangible early threat" [...] to big-box stores and retailers. Martin believed that the cameras and DSi Shop did not justify purchasing the DSi at launch, but, in line with the general consensus, saw potential in future software for the console.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>nip</b> <b>and</b> <b>tuck</b> {{across to}} the Contra Costa Hills, neither of us seeming to gain or to lose.

The single release received even further re-recordings, with frontman Gustav Wood explaining that the band still hadn't quite been happy with either of the prior versions, statingNow, we love our album to death, but we, like most bands, are perfectionists and knew {{that we could do}} the song a little more justice if we only had a tiny bit more time (especially if we were to release it as a single).

60|$|Then {{came the}} chase. It seemed it never would end. They raced {{us through the}} trees, the whole tribe of them, and nearly caught us.

60|$|Again I see {{the lantern}} {{come forward to}} the engine. But this time it comes conspicuously. A bit too conspicuously to suit me, and I wonder what is up. At any rate I have {{something}} else {{to be afraid of}} than the shack on the engine. The train pulls by. Just in time, before I make my spring, I see the dark form of a shack, without a lantern, on the first blind. I let it go by, and prepare to board the second blind. But the shack on the first blind has jumped off and is at my heels. Also, I have a fleeting glimpse of the lantern of the shack who rode out the engine. He has jumped off, and now both shacks are on the ground on the same side with me. The next moment the second blind comes by and I am aboard it. But I do not linger. I have figured out my countermove. As I dash across the platform I hear the impact of the shack's feet against the steps as he boards. I jump off the other side and run forward with the train. My plan is to run forward and get on the first blind. It is <b>nip</b> <b>and</b> <b>tuck,</b> for the train is gathering speed. Also, the shack is behind me and running after me. I guess I am the better sprinter, for I make the first blind. I stand on the steps and watch my pursuer. He is only about ten feet back and running hard; but now the train has approximated his own speed, and, relative to me, he is standing still. I encourage him, hold out my hand to him; but he explodes in a mighty oath, gives up and makes the train several cars back.|$|E
60|$|Daylight {{showed us}} {{that between the}} stern of the skiff and {{destruction}} {{was no more than a}} score of feet. And how it did blow! There were times, in the gusts, when the wind must have approached a velocity of seventy or eighty miles an hour. But the anchors held, and so nobly that our final anxiety was that the for'ard bitts would be jerked clean out of the boat. All day the sloop alternately ducked her nose under and sat down on her stern; and it was not till late afternoon that the storm broke in one last and worst mad gust. For a full five minutes an absolute dead calm prevailed, and then, with the suddenness of a thunderclap, the wind snorted out of the southwest--a shift of eight points and a boisterous gale. Another night of it was too much for us, and we hove up by hand in a cross head-sea. It was not stiff work. It was heart-breaking. And I know we were both near to crying from the hurt and the exhaustion. And when we did get the first anchor up-and-down we couldn't break it out. Between seas we snubbed her nose down to it, took plenty of turns, and stood clear as she jumped. Almost everything smashed and parted except the anchor-hold. The chocks were jerked out, the rail torn off, and the very covering-board splintered, and still the anchor held. At last, hoisting the reefed mainsail and slacking off a few of the hard-won feet of the chain, we sailed the anchor out. It was <b>nip</b> <b>and</b> <b>tuck,</b> though, and there were times when the boat was knocked down flat. We repeated the manoeuvre with the remaining anchor, and in the gathering darkness fled into the shelter of the river's mouth.|$|E
