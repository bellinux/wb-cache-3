40|$|The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is {{expanding}} {{into a new}} frontier {{in the delivery of}} measurement services. The Internet will be employed to provide industry with electronic traceability to national standards. This is a radical departure from the traditional modes of traceability and presents many new challenges. The traditional mail-based calibration service relies on sending artifacts to the user, who then mails them back to NIST for evaluation. The new service will deliver calibration results to the industry customer on-demand, in real-time, at a lower cost. The calibration results can be incorporated rapidly into the production process to ensure the highest quality manufacturing. The service would provide the US radiation processing industry with a direct link to the NIST calibration facilities and its expertise, and provide an interactive feedback process between industrial processing and the <b>national</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>standard.</b> Moreover, an Internet calibration system should contribute to the removal of measurement-related trade barriers.

40|$|Metrology is {{the science}} of measurement. It {{involves}} the formulation of the theoretical principles related {{to the definition of}} the International System of Units (Système International d Unités, SI) and the development of the technology for realising these units in practise. Reliable measurement is important all areas of human activity. Decisions are based on measurement results. Incorrect measurement results can lead to incorrect decisions, which may have significant health, economic or environmental consequences. Applications of sources of optical radiation are wide-ranging, including: medical treatment, diagnosis and sterilisation; quality control in production processes; stimulation of plant growth in agriculture; lighting and signalling for transport; interior and exterior lighting for buildings; solar power generation; and earth observation. The spectral power distribution of a source must often be known {{in order to ensure that}} the selected radiation source (and detector) is suitable for the intended purpose and to optimise process efficiency. Sometimes spectral measurements are required to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements (such as Occupational Health and Safety, Aviation Authority regulations, Emergency Lighting and Road Lighting regulations). Spectral measurements in the ultraviolet region are especially important due to its associated biological hazard. The accuracy of a measurement result can only be known if it is traceable to a <b>national</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>standard.</b> The National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA) realises and maintains the national measurement standards for South Africa. Sources of optical radiation can be calibrated in terms of spectral irradiance over the wavelength range 250 nm to 1 300 nm. The NMISA currently imports traceability for spectral irradiance by sending primary standard lamps to another National Metrology Institute (NMI) for calibration. The uncertainties of calibration are 4 % to 8 % (k = 2) over the wavelength range of 400 nm to 1 500 nm. A primary spectral irradiance facility is being developed, which will allow the NMISA to realise the scale independently, eliminating the need to import traceability. Through developing this facility, the NMISA aims to achieve an uncertainty of < 1 % over the visible wavelengths. Many NMIs realise the spectral irradiance scale by obtaining traceability from a primary standard cryogenic radiometer through calibrated filter radiometers. The filter radiometers are used to determine the temperature of a high temperature black body functioning as a reference source, which spectral radiance can be determined from Planck s equation. The uncertainty of the temperature measurement makes the most significant contribution to the uncertainty of realising the spectral irradiance scale. High temperature fixed points, above the copper point, can be used to improve these uncertainties. After more than ten years of research, results obtained on metal-carbon eutectic fixed points by several NMIs, showed that these novel high temperature fixed points could lead to significant improvements in high temperature metrology and could be considered as potential fixed points in a future International Temperature Scale. This dissertation describes the development and characterisation of high temperature metalcarbon fixed points at NMISA. It is demonstrated that these fixed points can be utilised as reproducible, stable reference standards for temperatures above the copper point. The melt temperature of Re-C cells was repeatable within 60 mK, which is equal to a relative spectral radiance value of 0, 02 % at 650 nm. The melt temperature of the d(MoC) -C cell was repeatable within 100 mK, which is equal to a relative spectral radiance value of 0, 03 % at 650 nm. Without implementing eutectics, NMIs typically achieve a best measurement capability of 3 K (k = 2) at 2 800 K, which contributes approximately 1 % to the overall spectral radiance measurement uncertainty. By using eutectics the reproducibility of spectroradiometric scales can be improved by a factor of 10. The NMISA result for Re-C (2 747, 51 K ± 2, 43 K, (k = 2)) is consistent with international values and agrees with the preliminary consensus value (2 747, 35 K ± 1 K, (k = 2)) within the stated uncertainties. Only one published result for d(MoC) -C eutectics could be found, which was by NMIJ (Japanese NMI). The NMISA result for d(MoC) -C (2 856, 76 K ± 2, 89 K, (k = 2)) corresponds with that published by NMIJ (2 856 K ± 4 K, (k = 2)) and compares well with the result of measurements performed at VNIIOFI (Russian NMI) (2 856, 40 K ± 2, 0 K, (k = 2)) on this particular cell. As far as can be ascertained, the most comprehensive study of d(MoC) -C was done by the NMISA. Once internationally agreed to melt temperatures for a selected set of high temperature eutectics are approved and incorporated into an updated mise en pratique for the definition of the kelvin, the NMISA could assign the international consensus value to its Re-C cells and re-realise its high temperature scale from 961, 78 ºC (the silver freeze point) up to 2 474 ºC (or higher) and immediately, in retrospect, realise the substantially reduced uncertainty of 1 % (k = 2).

40|$|Abstract: International {{agreements}} and decisions concerning trade and our social well-being are increasingly calling upon mutual recognition of measurements and tests between nations.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to demonstrate that the weight of non-Pb radiation shielding materials can be minimized by structuring the material as a bilayer composed of different metal-powder-embedded elastomer layers. Methods: Measurements and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations were performed to study the attenuation properties of several non-Pb metal bilayers over the x-ray energy range 302 ̆ 013150 keV. Metals for the layers were chosen on the basis of low cost, nontoxicity, and complementary photoelectric absorption characteristics. The EGSnrc user code cavity. cpp was used to calculate the resultant x-ray fluence spectra after attenuation by these metal layers. Air kerma attenuation was measured using commercially manufactured metal/elastomer test layers. These layers were irradiated using the primary standard calibration beams at the Institute for <b>National</b> <b>Measurement</b> <b>Standards</b> in Ottawa, Canada utilizing the six x-ray beam qualities recommended in the German Standard DIN 6857. Both the measurements and the calculations were designed to approximate surface irradiation as well as penetrating radiation at 10 mm depth in soft tissue. The MC modeling point and the position of the measurement detector for surface irradiation were both directly against the downstream face of the attenuating material, as recommended in DIN 6857. Results: The low-Z upstream/high-Z downstream ordering of the metal bilayers provided substantially more attenuation than the reverse order. Optimal percentages of each metal in each bilayer were determined for each x-ray radiation beam quality. Conclusions: Depending on the x-ray quality, appropriate choices of two complementary metalembedded elastomer layers can decrease the weight of radiation shielding garments by up to 25...|$|R

This {{study was designed to}} isolate compounds from American ginseng and to determine those responsible for the Nrf 2 -mediated resolution of inflamed macrophage-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Materials and methods: A standardized crude extract of American ginseng was supplied by the National Research Council of Canada, Institute for <b>National</b> <b>Measurement</b> <b>Standards.</b> A bioassay-based fractionization of American ginseng was performed to identify the putative substances which could activate Nrf 2 -mediated suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages and macrophage-mediated pro-hypertrophic growth in cardiomyocytes. Results: A hexane fraction of an anti-inflammatory crude extract of American ginseng was found to be most effective in suppressing the inflammatory responses in macrophages. Preparative, reverse-phase HPLC and a comparative analysis by analytical scale LC 2 ̆ 013 UV/MS revealed the hexane fraction contains predominantly C 17 polyacetylenes and linolenic acid. Panaxynol, one of the major polyacetylenes, was found to be a potent Nrf 2 activator. Panaxynol posttranscriptionally activated Nrf 2 by inhibiting Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap) 1 -mediated degradation without affecting the binding of Keap 1 and Nrf 2. Moreover, panaxynol suppressed a selected set of cytokine expression via the activation of Nrf 2 while minimally regulating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- 3 ̆baB) -mediated cytokine expression in macrophages. It also dramatically inhibited the inflamed macrophage-mediated cardiomyocyte death and hypertrophy by activating Nrf 2 in macrophages. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that American ginseng-derived panaxynol is a specific Nrf 2 activator and panaxynol-activated Nrf 2 signaling is at least partly responsible for American ginseng-induced health benefit in the heart.

40|$|A new selenized yeast {{reference}} material (SELM- 1) {{produced by the}} Institute for <b>National</b> <b>Measurement</b> <b>Standards,</b> <b>National</b> Research Council of Canada (INMS, NRC) certified for total selenium (2, 059164 mg kg 2 ̆ 2121), methionine (Met, 5, 7581277 mg kg 2 ̆ 2121) and selenomethionine (SeMet, 3, 4311157 mg kg 2 ̆ 2121) content is described. The 1 value represents an expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2. SeMet and Met amount contents were established following a methanesulfonic acid digestion of the yeast using GC-MS and LC-MS quantitation. Isotope dilution (ID) calibration was used for both compounds, using 13 C-labelled SeMet and Met. Total Se was determined after complete microwave acid digestion based on ID ICP-MS using a 82 Se spike or ICP-OES spectrometry using external calibration. An international intercomparison exercise was piloted by NRC to assess the state-of-the-art of measurement of selenomethione in SELM- 1. Determination of total Se and methionine was also attempted. Seven laboratories submitted results (2 National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and 5 university/government laboratories). For SeMet, ten independent mean values were generated. Various acid digestion and enzymatic procedures followed by LC ICP-MS, LC AFS or GC-MS quantitation were used. Four values were based on species-specific ID calibration, one on non-species-specific ID with the remainder using standard addition (SA) or external calibration (EC). For total selenium, laboratories employed various acid digestion procedures followed by ICP-MS, AFS or GC-MS quantitation. Four laboratories employed ID calibration, the remaining used SA or EC. A total of seven independent results were submitted. Results for methionine were reported by only three laboratories, all of which used various acid digestion protocols combined with determination by GC-MS and LC UV. The majority of participants submitted values within the certified range for SeMet and total Se, whereas the intercomparison was judged unsuccessful for Met because only two external laboratories provided values, {{both of which were}} outside the certified range.
