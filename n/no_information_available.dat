5|$|The false {{catshark}} is an infrequent bycatch of longlines {{and bottom}} trawls. It has minimal economic value, though its meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized. In Okinawa, its oil is traditionally used {{to seal the}} hulls of wooden fishing boats. Like other deepwater sharks, this species {{is thought to be}} highly susceptible to overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>available</b> on its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>available</b> on Rapolionis' {{activities}} from 1532 to 1542. Possibly {{he was a}} tutor to the nobility or taught at a higher school established by Abraomas Kulvietis in Vilnius. Grand Duke Sigismund I the Old {{did not support the}} Reformation and in May 1542 issued an edict on heresy aimed at Kulvietis and other Protestants who could now be tried by the bishop. Many Protestant activists left the Grand Duchy and settled in the Lutheran Duchy of Prussia.|$|E
25|$|CCDC130 {{is located}} on the short arm of {{chromosome}} 19 in humans. The exact locus is 19p13.2. The entire gene spans from 13858753-13874106 on the + strand of chromosome 19. CCDC130 is bordered upstream by CACNA1A on the - strand, glatobu, smagly, and socho on the + strand, and downstream by MGC3207, C19orf53, ZSWIM4 on the + strand and joypaw, smeygly, floytobu, smawgly, and wycho on the - strand. Glatobu, smagly, socho, joypaw, smeygly, floytobu, smawgly, and wycho have only been verified by cDNA sequences in GenBank and have <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>available</b> about their function. There are also several small genes found within the CCDC130 sequence, with snugly, glytobu, stygly, and glartobu occurring on the + strand and chacho, zoycho, spogly, glotobu, glutobu, and sneygly occurring on the - strand. All of these small genes have extremely low levels of expression (under 3% of the expression of the average gene), with stygly having the highest expression at 2.8% of the average.|$|E

2500|$|Different testimonies {{were given}} {{about the number}} and timing of phone calls to the Falmouth {{coastguard}} station {{on the evening of}} 31 July, giving rise to a view that searches could have begun earlier. The court strongly recommended that in future, all messages received by coastguard stations relating to vessels should be recorded and logged. [...] It was, however, satisfied that all searches had been [...] thoroughly carried out. [...] It did not feel that the supposed delay in beginning the searches was significant, as there was <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>available</b> that would have justified action before 9.00 pm, by which time the disaster had in all probability already happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. They {{were soon}} {{discouraged}} and {{lost interest in}} the matter when I {{took hold of the}} case. But I don't intend to get discouraged. I hate to be 'stumped,' as you know, and it seems to me, after careful consideration, that success may follow the discovery of the cab-driver. I've not been neglecting other trails, I assure you. I've obtained a pretty fair record of the history of nurse Orme. She has the habit of drudging in sick rooms until she accumulates enough capital to lead a gay life for a month or so, after which she resumes nursing in order to replenish her purse. She's a good nurse and a wild spendthrift, but aside from the peculiarity mentioned there's nothing in her career of especial interest. The woman is pretty well known both in New York and Chicago, for she squanders in the first city and saves in the other, but of her early history there is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>available.</b> In her wildest moods she has never done anything to warrant her arrest, yet the police have kept a suspicious eye on her for years." ...|$|E
