25|$|When Marge {{escapes from}} the {{courtroom}} {{and goes to the}} library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding <b>nothing</b> <b>bad</b> about her and a newspaper tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she was going to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she has too much to do to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is dressed for the job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep.|$|E

From this platform I call on President Assad to instruct the Syrian army not to harm Israeli soldiers and then <b>nothing</b> <b>bad</b> will happen to [...] We desire no clashes with the Syrian army, if we reach the line 40km from our northern border the work will have been done, all fighting will end. I am directing my words to the ears of the President of Syria. He knows how to keep an agreement. He signed a cease-fire with us and kept it. He did not allow the terrorists to act. If he behaves in this manner now in Lebanon, no Syrian soldier will be harmed by our soldiers".|$|E

2500|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} the [...] "True Self" [...] begins to develop in infancy, in the {{relationship}} between the baby and its primary caregiver (Winnicott typically refers to this person as [...] "the mother"). One of the ways the mother helps the baby develop an authentic self is by responding in a welcoming and reassuring way to the baby's spontaneous feelings, expressions, and initiatives. In this way the baby develops a confidence that <b>nothing</b> <b>bad</b> happens when she expresses what she feels, so her feelings don't seem dangerous or problematic to her, and she doesn't have to put undue attention into controlling or avoiding them. She also gains a sense that she is real, that she exists and her feelings and actions have meaning.|$|E

We wanted them to see the crosses and know how we felt about things." [...] Ossama Bahloul of the ICM told worshippers, [...] "This day is a day of forgiveness. We want to say that we have <b>nothing</b> <b>bad</b> in our heart against anyone." [...] The New York Times praised the forbearance of the ICM's members in an editorial published on August 19, noting that [...] "ith patience and dignity, the Islamic Americans of Murfreesboro learned the hard way the endless American lesson that constitutional rights don't come guaranteed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the Liepāja executions were {{witnessed}} by persons {{other than the}} participants. Klee, Dressen, and Riess, {{in their study of}} the Holocaust perpetrators, concluded that the public executions were [...] "in many ways a festival", that German soldiers traveled long distances to get the best places to witness the mass shootings, and that these public executions continued {{over a long period of}} time and became a form of [...] "execution tourism. Nobody was forced to murder Jews, and there were people who refused to do so. <b>Nothing</b> <b>bad</b> happened to them and in particular no one who refused was ever sent to a concentration camp. At most, those who refused orders to kill were abused as [...] "cowards" [...] by their commanders. This pattern was followed in Liepāja. For example, a boatman who worked under the harbormaster, Navy personnel and at least one hundred Wehrmacht soldiers were present at an execution, apparently pursuant to orders.|$|E

2500|$|The Star Sapphires {{appear in}} [...] Debuting in the episode [...] "In Love and War", Queen Aga'po is their leader. This version starts {{out as a}} villain group, as their {{conception}} of love involves trapping men in crystalline stasis chambers, putting them in a permanent euphoric state to ensure <b>nothing</b> <b>bad</b> will happen to them. They rely on their charms to convince men to be trapped willingly, or, if those men already have true loves, attempt to recruit said true loves. Carol Ferris is briefly recruited {{in an attempt to}} seduce Hal Jordan, but the ring's effect causes her to turn crazy and attack Hal. He is finally able to bring her back to her senses through a kiss, and she decides to reject the Star Sapphire ring, stating that the Zamarons' methods are not love, but selfishness. One of the Star Sapphire's novices is struck by her speech, and helps Hal and the others to escape, planning to teach her comrades the true meaning of love. In the episode [...] "Homecoming", it is shown that they have stopped being fanatical. They help Hal and Razer by transporting them to Earth and Oa, respectively. In the episode [...] "Love is a Battlefield", the Star Sapphires are attacked by Aya and the Manhunters for the spreading the message of love. As a result, they call back Carol to explain love to Aya. To help prove her case she had to fight Atrocitus. At the end of the episode, she decides to keep the ring this time just in case.|$|E
2500|$|Unbreakable {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 56, based on 8 reviews. Bill Lamb from About.com gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, praising [...] "the incomparably lush harmonies and instantly pleasing melodies" [...] and labeling the songs [...] "radio friendly." [...] Lamb also {{commented that the}} band [...] "have settled into a comfortable place as an adult vocal group" [...] and named the album [...] "a pure pop pleasure." [...] Tammy LaGorce from Amazon.com judged that the album [...] "boasts Super Glue-strength harmonies and an overall tightness of sound" [...] and that [...] "the music is more thoughtful and mature than ever." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly judged that [...] "They come close to recreating the sheer euphoria of their biggest pre-2YK smashes {{on many of the}} up-tempo dance-pop numbers that follow." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, writing that [...] "the basic sound of the album is good, {{but the problem is that}} few of the songs stick. Here, the Backstreet Boys don't have any songs that will lift them out of the adult contemporary world -- but the audience who has turned from teens to adults with them will likely enjoy its easy sound, as there is <b>nothing</b> <b>bad</b> here. There's just nothing great, either." [...] Gemma Padley of BBC Music felt that the album [...] "is a valiant effort at reinvention and an at times gutsier record." [...] Matt O'Leary from Virgin Media opined that [...] "While there is nothing to match their crowning glory – karaoke classic I Want It That Way – this is a largely inoffensive collection of pop hits. It's bound to be huge." [...] Lauren Murphy from Entertainment.ie called Unbreakable [...] "far from the perfect pop album - in fact, it's rather boring for the most part - but it does confirm that Backstreet Boys aren't quite ready for the scrap heap just yet." [...] Christina Hoard from Rolling Stone gave the album 2 out of 5 stars, summarizing that [...] "Unbreakable makes small nods to adult pop, peppering the processed music with tasteful piano and light guitar riffs and keeping bright, danceable grooves to a minimum. But the material stinks worse than ever." ...|$|E
