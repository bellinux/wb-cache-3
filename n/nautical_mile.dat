5|$|UB-10 began August 1915 by {{capturing}} {{and burning}} Alert—another British fishing smack—off Lowestoft on the 1st. The same day, Fulgens, a 2,512-ton collier, was torpedoed one <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> (1.8km) from Palling; {{the crew of}} the ship—UB-10s largest victim to-date—were all saved.|$|E
5|$|UB-12 sank her largest ship, Silksworth Hall of , on 10 April. The British-registered {{ship was}} en route from Hull to Philadelphia in ballast when Kiel torpedoed her without warning {{a little more than}} one <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> (two kilometers) from the Corton Lightvessel. Other ships picked up 31 {{survivors}} from Silksworth Hall, but 3 men were lost. Later in the month, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the newest commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.|$|E

5|$|With maximum {{sustained}} {{winds of}} 215mph (345km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872mbar (hPa; 25.75inHg), Hurricane Patricia is the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever observed, {{just shy of}} Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar (hPa; 25.69inHg). It is also the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere. It exceeded the previous sustained wind record of 190mph (305km/h) set by Hurricane Allen in 1980 and the pressure record of 882mbar (hPa; 26.05inHg) set by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, both in the Atlantic basin. In the Eastern Pacific basin, north of the equator and east of the International Dateline, the previous basin record-holder was Hurricane Linda in 1997 with winds of 185mph (295km/h) and a pressure of 902mbar (hPa; 26.64inHg). Reconnaissance also found a pressure gradient of 24mbar (hPa; 0.71inHg) per <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> early on October23, among the steepest gradients ever observed in a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 3February, Terra Nova arrived {{unexpectedly}} in the Bay of Whales. She had sailed from New Zealand on 29November 1910 and had arrived in McMurdo Sound early in January. After landing Scott and his main party there, Terra Nova had taken a party of six men, led by Victor Campbell, eastward to King Edward VII Land. This group intended to explore this then-unknown territory, but had been prevented by sea ice from approaching the shore. The ship was sailing westward along the Barrier edge in search of a possible landing place when it encountered Fram. Scott had previously speculated that Amundsen might make his base in the Weddell Sea area, {{on the opposite side of}} the continent; this proof that the Norwegians would be starting the race for the pole with a 60 <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> advantage was an alarming prospect for the British. The two groups behaved civilly towards each other; Campbell and his officers Harry Pennell and George Murray Levick breakfasted aboard Fram, and reciprocated with lunch on the Terra Nova. Amundsen was relieved to learn that Terra Nova had no wireless radio, since that might have imperilled his strategy to be first with the news of a polar victory. He was worried, however, by a remark of Campbell's that implied that Scott's motorised sledges were working well. Nevertheless, he offered the British party a site alongside Framheim as a base for the exploration of King Edward VII Land. Campbell turned the offer down, and sailed for McMurdo Sound to inform Scott of Amundsen's whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|Historically a <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> {{was defined}} as the length of one minute of arc along a {{meridian}} of a spherical earth. An ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> with latitude. This was resolved by defining the <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> to be exactly 1,852 metres.|$|E

25|$|Distance {{may also}} be {{measured}} {{as a function of}} time. The radar mile is the amount of time it takes for a radar pulse to travel one <b>nautical</b> <b>mile,</b> reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> is defined as 1,852m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36μs in duration.|$|E
25|$|Air and sea {{transportation}} commonly use the <b>nautical</b> <b>mile.</b> This {{is about}} one minute of arc of latitude along any meridian arc and it is precisely defined as 1852metres (about 1.151 statute miles). It is not an SI unit (although it is accepted {{for use in the}} SI by the BIPM). The prime unit of speed or velocity for maritime and air navigation remains the knot (<b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> per hour).|$|E

25|$|Upon {{ratification}} of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a country has ten years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200 <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> zone. Due to this, Norway (which ratified the convention in 1996), Russia (ratified in 1997), Canada (ratified in 2003) and Denmark (ratified in 2004) launched projects to establish claims that certain sectors of the Arctic seabed should belong to their territories.|$|E

25|$|One of the Finnish Navy's annual traditions was a naval {{visit to}} the Finnish coastal towns along the Gulf of Bothnia, the trip {{doubling}} as a training exercise for conscript sailors. In 1925, the gunships Klas Horn and Hämeenmaa, {{as well as the}} torpedo boats S1 and S2, embarked on one such journey. The plan was to visit all the coastal cities up to Tornio and the group began the journey from Uusikaupunki to Vaasa on October 3, 1925. They traveled in line formation with one kabellängd (1/10 <b>nautical</b> <b>mile)</b> internal distance and at a speed of 12 knots. S2 was positioned furthest back in the formation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} known as Arnold 36 and was, in fact, the first watch that Arnold called a chronometer, {{a term that}} subsequently came into general use and still means any highly accurate watch. The Royal Observatory, Greenwich tested Arnold 36 for thirteen months, from 1 February 1779 to 6 July 1780. The testers placed it in several positions during the trial, and even wore it and carried it around. The watch exceeded all expectations, as it demonstrated great accuracy. The timekeeping error was 2 minutes 32.2 seconds, but the error in the last nine months amounted to just one minute. The greatest error in any 24 hours was only four seconds, or one <b>nautical</b> <b>mile</b> of longitude at the equator.|$|E

50|$|The crisis {{began on}} the {{afternoon}} of May 12, 1975, as the American container ship , owned by Sea-Land Service Inc., passed nearby Poulo Wai island en route to Sattahip, Thailand, in waters claimed as 12 <b>nautical</b> <b>miles</b> of territorial waters by Cambodia. The U.S. did not recognize 12 <b>nautical</b> <b>miles</b> territorial waters claims at that time, recognizing only 3 <b>nautical</b> <b>miles,</b> and characterised the location as international sea lanes on the high seas. U.S. military reports state that the seizure took place 6 <b>nautical</b> <b>miles</b> off the island, but crew members brought evidence in a later legal action that Mayaguez had sailed about two <b>nautical</b> <b>miles</b> off Poulo Wai and was not flying a flag.|$|R
