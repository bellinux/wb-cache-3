In our scheme we reconstruct the intensity from E and F so that it is consistent with the closure relation, relation, χ = (3 + 4 f ^ 2) /(5 + 2 √(4 - 3 f ^ 2)). Here the symbols, χ, f = |F|/(cE), and c, denote the Eddington factor, the reduced flux, and the speed of light, respectively. We evaluate the numerical flux across the cell surface from the kinetically reconstructed intensity. It is an explicit function of E and F in the neighboring cells across the surface considered. We include absorption and reemission within a <b>numerical</b> <b>cell</b> in the evaluation of the numerical flux.

40|$|SUMMARY To {{determine}} whether the increased thickness seen in media of mesenteric resistance vessels of Wistar-Kyoto rats made hypertensive by a Goldblatt procedure (one-kidney, one clip model) was due to hypertrophy or hyperplasia of smooth musde cells, the cellular dimensions of these vessels were estimated using a new, unbiased stereoJogkal method (the disector). Furthermore, to investigate whether the changes seen could be secondary to the increased blood pressure, morphometric measurements were also made in renal arcuate arteries, which, due to the constricting silver clip, probably had not {{been exposed to the}} increased pressure load. Vessels were mounted on a myograph, and their media thickness, lumen diameter, and maximum active wall tension response were measured. In the mesenteric vessels media thickness had increased by 58 %, whereas no changes were seen In the renal vessels. Vessels were then fixed, and serial sections were made in the mesenteric vessels. The disector was used to calculate the <b>numerical</b> <b>cell</b> density in each vessel.

By means of the model we are able to explain several pattern observed in particulate organic and inorganic carbon production rates for different strains and under different acclimation conditions. Particulate organic and inorganic carbon production rates for instance decrease at very low external CO 2 concentrations.

The energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS) model can be used at different scales to describe local and global heterogeneities as well as steady-state fluid dynamics of gas-solid fluidization. However, the same cluster diameter correlation based on energy dissipation was used in all cases, which may give a smaller cluster diameter than single particle diameter at low solids fluxes. In this paper, a description of the solids mass transfer between the dilute and dense phases in heterogeneous gas-solid flow is proposed to replace the correlation of cluster diameter to avoid some problems associated with the empirical calculation of the cluster diameter. This cluster description can facilitate the prediction of the drag coefficient at the scale of <b>numerical</b> <b>cells</b> in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) at extremely low solids fluxes and the radial heterogeneity in large-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers with downward particle velocities near the wall.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a study of voids in {{amorphous}} glassy polymers that exhibit elastic-viscoplasticity with rate dependent yield, intrinsic softening and progressive strain hardening at large strains. The study is motivated by the plastic deformation in voided polymer-rubber blends caused by cavitation of the rubber particles, and thus attempts {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the toughening mechanisms in blends. Axisymmetric cell analyses are presented to study the plastic deformation around initially spherical voids and their resulting growth in terms of size and shape up to large overall strains. This void growth is demonstrated to inherit particular properties from the typical features of plasticity in glassy polymers, viz. small strain softening and large strain hardening. The role of strain localization into shear bands and their subsequent propagation in controlling void growth is highlighted. Furthermore, an approximate constitutive model is presented for the description of the macroscopic overall behaviour of porous glassy polymers. This model includes a modification of existing porous plasticity models to account for elasticity effects on the initiation of overall plasticity, which are important in polymers because of their relatively high yield strain.

40|$|The present {{doctoral}} thesis studies and develops methodologies for turbulent combustion with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Three main objectives for present {{doctoral thesis}} were. First, development of LES methodology in curvilinear coordinates. LES formulation in curvilinear coordinates {{can be achieved}} in two ways, (1) conventional approach, where filtering is performed prior to the transformation, and (2) alternate approach, where filtering is performed after the transformation. In present work the conventional approach was preferred than the alternate approach. Furthermore, filtering in physical space introduces a commutation error between filtering and differentiation due to non uniform meshes. The commutation filter, which can commute upto any order of accuracy were discussed in generalized coordinates. The LES module in generalized coordinate was implemented in the in-house RANS code. The methodology was validated by performing the LES of pipe, 3 D lid driven cavity, Backward facing step, axisymmetric dump combustor with and without swirl. Furthermore, the influence of numerical scheme, discretization, subgrid model, grid resolution were explored for LES. The second objective of the present doctoral research was development of the Eddy Dissipation Concept for turbulent combustion (EDC) for LES. EDC assumes that combustion {{take place in the}} fine structure and they are located in the isolated regions. In RANS, the fine structure regions are estimated based on the full cascading in the each <b>numerical</b> <b>cell,</b> however this was not applicable for the LES, where either partial cascading or no cascading take place in the each <b>numerical</b> <b>cell.</b> In present work fine structure regions were formulated considering the partial cascading. Furthermore, in LES the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation are not computed explicitly, therefore the fine structure length and velocity scales, based on the eddy viscosity were proposed. The LES-EDC was validated by performing the LES of many diffusion flames i. e. Sandia Flame D, Flame H 3, Flame DLR and Flame ETH. The last objective was to extend the applicability of the EDC for predicting the pollutant such as NOx with low computational effort. Estimation of minor species such as NOx requires modelling of detailed chemical kinetics with eddy dissipation concept model, which is a computationally expensive procedure specially in large industrial burners with LES. A method was presented, where EDC with fast chemistry approach was used for major species mass fractions. A mixture fraction was formulated from the major species mass fractions and a transport equation for the NOx was solved, where source term was estimated as a function of mixture fraction from flamelet tables.

Carrier availability (i. e., liquid-suspended sand grains) proved necessary for bacterial aggregate formation from individual cells during reactor start-up. Electron microscopic examination revealed that incipient colonization of sand grains by bacteria from the bulk liquid occurred in surface irregularities, conceivably reflecting local quiescence. Subsequent confluent biofilm formation on sand grains proved to be unstable, however. Substrate depletion in the bulk liquid is assumed to weaken deeper parts of the biofilm due to cellular lysis, after which production of gas bubbles and liquid shearing forces cause sloughing. The resulting fragments, although sand free, were nevertheless {{large enough to be}} retained in the reactor and gradually grew larger through bacterial growth and by clumping together with other fragments.

A simulation approach is used where the underlying transmissivity map is assumed a member of a random field and realizations of transmissivity maps are generated using stochastic simulation. For each simulation run, several models with different structures and complexities, based on zonation parameterization, are calibrated and the model transmissivities are estimated using measurements of head data. Then, using the calibrated models, the heads and the flow terms are evaluated in the <b>numerical</b> <b>cells</b> of the aquifer. The corresponding prediction the heads and flow terms are calculated and the optimal models having the lowest prediction errors are determined. The method is applied study of a two-dimensional aquifer with steady groundwater flow with pumpage. For small correlation lengths of transmissivity variability, the numerical results indicate that a simple singlezone model yields the best predictions and outperforms complex models with more parameters. For larger correlation lengths however, models of medium complexity have best prediction characteristics and should be preferred. It is further shown quantitatively that as the quality of measurements decreases the number of parameters and the complexity of the optimal model decreases. The reduced flexibility of a model with fewer parameters protects it from being adversely affected from the errors contained in the measurements. © 2005 International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research...|$|R

For models of smooth faults between elastically deformable continua, it is critical that the friction laws involve a characteristic distance for slip weakening or evolution of surface state. That results in a finite nucleation size, or coherent slip patch size, h*. Models of smooth faults, using <b>numerical</b> <b>cell</b> size properly small compared to h*, show periodic response or complex and apparently chaotic histories of large events but have not been found to show small event complexity like the self-similar (power law) Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size statistics. This conclusion is supported in the present paper by fully inertial elastodynamic modeling of earthquake sequences. In contrast, some models of locally heterogeneous faults with quasi-independent fault segments, represented approximately by simulations with cell size larger than h* so that the model becomes "inherently discrete," do show small event complexity of the Gutenberg-Richter type. Models based on classical friction laws without a weakening length scale or for which the numerical procedure imposes an abrupt strength drop at the onset of slip have h* = 0 and hence always fall into the inherently discrete class. We suggest that the small-event complexity that some such models show will not survive regularization of the constitutive description, by inclusion of an appropriate length scale leading to a finite h*, and a corresponding reduction of numerical grid size...|$|E

A very simple numerical integration scheme was chosen to reduce computing time. Robust boundary condition procedures were incorporated to simulate various flow conditions (e. g., valves, open ends, and choked inflow) as well as to accommodate flow reversals that may arise during large flow-field oscillations. The accompanying figure shows a sample simulation result. A combustor with an open inlet, a choked outlet, and a large constriction approximately two thirds of the way down the length is shown. The middle plot shows normalized, time-averaged distributions of the relevant flow quantities, and the bottom plot illustrates the acoustic mode shape of the resulting thermoacoustic oscillation. For this simulation, the limit cycle peak-to-peak pressure fluctuations were 13 percent of the mean. The simulation used 100 <b>numerical</b> <b>cells.</b> The total normalized simulation time was 50 units (approximately 15 oscillations), which took 26 sec on a Sun Ultra 2...|$|R

40|$|NASA-Lewis has {{committed}} to a long range goal of creating a <b>numerical</b> test <b>cell</b> for aeropropulsion research and development. Efforts are underway to develop a first generation Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS). The NPSS will provide a unique capability to numerically simulate advanced propulsion systems from nose to tail. Two essential ingredients to the NPSS are: (1) experimentally validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes; and (2) high performing computing systems (hardware and software) that will permit those codes to be used efficiently. To this end, NASA-Lewis is using high speed, interactive computing {{as a means for}} achieving Integrated CFD and Experiments (ICE). The development is described of a prototype ICE system for multistage compressor flow physics research...|$|R
