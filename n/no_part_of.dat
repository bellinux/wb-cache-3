5|$|As a {{circular}} highway, M-185 has no specific termini; the generally accepted {{starting point is}} at the mile0 marker {{placed in front of}} the Mackinac Island State Park Visitor Center. The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage; these signs are erected by the MISPC, as MDOT does not install the standard state highway reassurance markers along this roadway. M-185 is one of only three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands; the others are M-134 on Drummond Island and M-154 on Harsens Island. <b>No</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> M-185 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.
