Relative magnitudes of <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> and associated processes were examined {{for one year}} in a stream that flowed through a clearcut and an old-growth forest in the Cascade Mountains. Diel patterns of nutrients in four streams of different size indicated greater demand for inorganic nitrogen than phosphorus and suggested that uptake by aquatic primary producers was responsible for diel fluctuations of nutrient concentrations. Atomic ratios of N/P supported the conclusion that primary producers were most probably nitrogen limited. In an experiment of light and nitrate addition to a stream in an old-growth forest, primary producer processes were enhanced by addition of light (11000 lux) and by addition of both light and nitrate. There was no effect of nitrate addition on accumulation of algae, gross <b>primary</b> <b>production,</b> <b>net</b> community <b>primary</b> <b>production,</b> community respiration, P/R ratios, or community structure of diatoms at low ambient light levels (1100 lux). Addition of light resulted in greater colonization of algae, gross <b>primary</b> <b>production,</b> <b>net</b> community <b>primary</b> <b>production,</b> community respiration, P/R ratios and altered community structure of diatoms. The watershed was clearcut one year later and the experiment was essentially repeated with artificial shading instead of artificial lighting. Responses of colonization and <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> to light and nitrate in the clearcut {{were similar to those}} observed in the previous experiment in the old-growth forest. Interactions between primary producers and grazers in lotic systems were examined in laboratory streams. Different densities of snails were established in laboratory channels; <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> in these channels was compared to production in a channel without grazers. Heavy and intermediate grazing resulted in decreases in standing crop of chlorophyll a, biomass/chlorophyll ratios, biomass of periphyton, gross <b>primary</b> <b>production,</b> and <b>net</b> community <b>primary</b> <b>production.</b> Low grazing densities did not significantly alter the above factors. Gross <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> increased with increasing standing crop of chlorophyll a but assimilation number was much greater at low standing crops; therefore, there was a partial compensatory mechanism for adjustment to grazing pressure. Total <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> was approximately equal at both high and intermediate densities of grazers and was greater at low densities of grazers and no grazing. Taxonomic structure of periphyton was altered by heavy and intermediate grazing but not changed at low grazing pressures. Snail growth increased with increasing biomass of periphyton. Responses of aquatic primary producers to canopy removal were examined in a clearcut and old-growth forest section of a stream in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Standing crop of chlorophyll a, biomass of periphyton, community respiration, assimilation number, and respiration per unit weight of periphyton were all significantly greater in the clearcut than in the old-growth forested section. Gross <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> was approximately 2. 5 times greater in the open section than in the shaded section.

Carrying capacity is an ecological concept that expresses the relationship between a population and the natural environment on which it depends for ongoing sustenance. Carrying capacity assumes limits on the number of individuals that can be supported at a given level of consumption without degrading the environment and, therefore, reducing future carrying capacity. That is, carrying capacity addresses long-term sustainability. Worldviews differ in the importance accorded to the carrying capacity concept.

Viewed on a yearly scale, phytoplankton respiration exceeded gross production in three model compartments where turbidity and basin morphology were most limiting. Due to the high turbidity of the area and the relatively large mixing depth, <b>net</b> pelagic <b>primary</b> <b>production</b> in the model was relatively low: the global estuarine average was 41 g C m~ 2 year" 1. It fluctuated from a negative production of- 7 4 g C m~ 2 year" 1 in the turbidity zone to a maximum net production of 60 g C m" 2 year' 1 near the sea. Salinity stress mortality was the main factor causing freshwater algal stocks to decline, while marine and brackish phytoplankton biomass was mainly controlled by grazing...|$|R
