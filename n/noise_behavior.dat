40|$|We {{predict the}} {{existence}} of an anomalous crossover between thermal and shot noise in macroscopic diffusive conductors. We first show that, besides thermal noise, these systems may also exhibit shot noise due to fluctuations {{of the total number of}} carriers in the system. Then we show that at increasing currents the crossover between the two <b>noise</b> <b>behaviors</b> is anomalous, in the sense that the low frequency current spectral density displays a region with a superlinear dependence on the current up to a cubic law. The anomaly is due to the non-trivial coupling in the presence of the long range Coulomb interaction among the three time scales relevant to the phenomenon, namely, diffusion, transit and dielectric relaxation time.

40|$|A noise {{study on}} a set of ZnS 0. 58 Se 0. 42 UV photodiodes with 1 mum thick Al bonding pads {{selected}} from a 2 '' wafer was carried out. Based on their 1 /f <b>noise</b> <b>behaviors,</b> they were divided into three groups. The noise spectral density, impulse response time, bandwidth, responsivity, dark current at reverse bias up to 12 V and zero bias resistance were determined for three typical detectors, i. e. one from each of the three groups. The uneven performance of these detectors is mostly likely due to the different damage level induced in the wire-bonding process. With thicker Al bonding pads of 1. 5 mum, a detectivity as high as 7. 1 x 10 (14) cmHz(1 / 2) W- 1 has been achieved. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Contrary to the expected noise increase with the resistance, the noise for SLG decreases near the Dirac point, possibly due {{to the effects of}} the spatial charge inhomogeneity.

The key contribution of velocity estimation here is to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>behaviors</b> of encoder-based measurement. In particular, the estimated signal can be useful for many applications such as haptic devices, industrial applications as well as robotics. The proposed method is simple to implement. Therefore, encoders or tachometers can be replaced with current sensors which are cheaper, and more compact. This solution was investigated with experimental results. The results indicated that, estimation velocity could reduce noise significantly compared to encoder-based measurement. And, with the same experimental parameters and hardware, the proposed velocity estimated signal {{is exactly the same}} as the result of encoder-based measurement.

40|$|Inverse {{reinforcement}} learning (1 RL) aims {{to recover the}} reward function underlying a Markov Decision Process from behaviors of experts in support of decision-making. Most recent work on IRL assumes {{the same level of}} trustworthiness of all expert behaviors, and frames IRL as a process of seeking reward function that makes those behaviors appear (near) -optimal. However, it is common in reality that noisy expert behaviors disobeying the optimal policy exist, which may degrade the IRL performance significantly. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a robust IRL framework that can accurately estimate the reward function in the presence of <b>behavior</b> <b>noise.</b> In particular, we focus on a special type of <b>behavior</b> <b>noise</b> referred to as sparse noise due to its wide popularity in real-world behavior data. To model such noise, we introduce a novel latent variable characterizing the reliability of each expert action and use Laplace distribution as its prior. We then devise an EM algorithm with a novel variational inference procedure in the E-step, which can automatically identify and remove <b>behavior</b> <b>noise</b> in reward learning. Experiments on both synthetic data and real vehicle routing data with noticeable <b>behavior</b> <b>noise</b> show significant improvement of our method over previous approaches in learning accuracy, and also show its power in de-noising behavior data...|$|R

The same KP method overestimates thermal noise by 2 – 3 orders of magnitude in similar devices as demonstrated in Roy et al. (2007). This apparent discrepancy between thermal and flicker <b>noise</b> <b>behavior</b> lies in origin of these noises, which leads to opposite trend of local noise power spectral density vs doping.

40|$|The {{interest}} in "Physically Unclonable Function"-devices has increased rapidly {{over the last}} few years, as they have several interesting properties for system security related applications like, for example, the management of cryptographic keys. Unfortunately, the output provided by these devices is noisy and needs to be corrected for these applications. Related error correcting mechanisms are typically constructed on the basis of an equal error probability for each output bit. This assumption does not hold for Physically Unclonable Functions, where varying error probabilities can be observed. This results in a generalized binomial distribution for the number of errors in the output. The intention {{of this paper is to}} discuss a novel Bayesian statistical model for the noise of an especially wide-spread class of Physically Unclonable Functions, which properly handles the varying output stability and also reflects the different <b>noise</b> <b>behaviors</b> observed in a collection of such devices.

However, it also makes MPSoC more susceptible to various reliability threats, such as high temperature and power/ground (P/G) noise. As the scale and complexity of MPSoC continuously increase, monitoring and mitigating reliability threats at run time could offer better performance, scalability, and flexibility for MPSoC designs. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach, on-chip sensor network (SENoC), to collaboratively detect, report, and alleviate run-time threats in MPSoC. SENoC not only detects reliability threats and shares related information among PUs, but also plans and coordinates the reactions of related PUs in MPSoC. SENoC is used and explained in our case study to alleviate the impacts of simultaneous switching noise in MPSoC’s P/G network during power gating.
