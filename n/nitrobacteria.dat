25|$|Carboxysomes are {{bacterial}} microcompartments {{found in}} many autotrophic bacteria such as Cyanobacteria, Knallgasbacteria, Nitroso- and <b>Nitrobacteria.</b> They are proteinaceous structures resembling phage heads in their morphology and contain the enzymes of carbon dioxide fixation in these organisms (especially ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, RuBisCO, and carbonic anhydrase). It is thought that the high local concentration of the enzymes along with the fast conversion of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide by carbonic anhydrase allows faster and more efficient carbon dioxide fixation than possible inside the cytoplasm. Similar structures are known to harbor the coenzyme B12-containing glycerol dehydratase, the key enzyme of glycerol fermentation to 1,3-propanediol, in some Enterobacteriaceae (e. g. Salmonella).|$|E
40|$|Analyses of pond {{water and}} mud samples show that nitrifying {{bacteria}} (including ammonifying bacteria, nitrite bacteria, <b>nitrobacteria</b> and denitrifying bacteria) are in general closely correlated with various physico-chemical factors, ammonifying bacteria are mainly correlated with dissolved oxygen; denitrifying bacteria are inversely correlated with phosphorus; nitrite bacteria are closely correlated with nitrites, <b>nitrobacteria</b> are inversely correlated with ammoniac nitrogen. The nitrifying bacteria are more closely correlated with heterotrophic bacteria. <b>Nitrobacteria</b> are inversely correlated with anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria. The correlation is quite weak between all the nitrite bacteria {{which indicates that}} the nitrite bacteria have a controlling and regulating function in water quality {{and there is no}} interdependence as each plays a role of its own. The paper also discusses how the superficial soil (pond mud down to 3. 5 cm deep) and different layers of the mud affect the biomass of bacteria.

Two nitrifying bacteria were isolated from shrimp-pond sediment at Pasuruan, East Java, Indonesia. The study aimed to characterize and evaluate nitrite oxidoreductase ability of the bacteria. Comparative (phylogenetic) analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences revealed that both isolated bacteria were moderately related (77 - 90 %) to uncultured clones of <b>Nitrobacteria</b> and Nitrospira. The nitrite oxidoreductase activity of both bacteria was comparable. However, per mg of protein, the enzymatic activity of <b>Nitrobacteria</b> was twice than Nitrospira.

Therefore, our objective was to {{study the effects of}} heavy metal pollution on microbial populations (bacteria, actinomyces, fungi, ammonifying bacteria, <b>nitrobacteria</b> and cellulolytic bacteria) and microbial activities (microbial biomass C (MBC), basal respiration and metabolic quotient (qCO 2)) on soils of Lawu Cu-Zn-Pb mine in central Tibet, China. Five sampling sites included the mine center (Site 1), grassland near the mine center (Site 2), traffic road of the mine (Site 3), abandoned mine tailing (Site 4) and about 2 km from the mine center (Site 5, taken as the control). A composite soil sample was collected using a soil sampler with 5 cm diameter and 10 cm depth at eight random positions in each sampling site. Results indicated that compared to the control, soils in Sites 1 - 4 were polluted by heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd), resulting in decrease in culturable number of bacteria, actinomyces, ammonifying bacteria, <b>nitrobacteria</b> and cellulolytic bacteria, and MBC contents, but increase in basal respiration and qCO 2.

The activated sludge samples were taken from aeration tank of the sewage treatment plant when the outside temperature was below 0 ˚C (water temperature below 12 ˚C). Five kinds of <b>nitrobacteria</b> strains with cold-resistance and higher activity of ammonia degradation were isolated from aeration tanks.

30|$|As the {{reaction}} continues, {{the total amount}} of total organic matter, particulate organic matter, and dissolved organic matter somewhat decreases. The reason is that they are converted into organic matter with a low MW when as a carbon source of the system in {{the reaction}} and are consumed to be biochemically reacted with the original soluble organic matter. In the A 2 /O process, the nitrification stage takes autotrophic <b>nitrobacteria</b> as the dominant species. The autotrophic <b>nitrobacteria</b> utilize ammonia in wastewater as energy and CO 2 as a sole carbon source to convert ammonia into NO 2 − and NO 3 −, and obtain energy for their growth needs simultaneously, thus enabling CO 2 to synthesize cellular organic matter. With no organic matter as the carbon source, there are no constraints from the low organic matter concentration in the course of nitrification. C/N mainly effects denitrification. Denitrification bacteria use oxygen of nitrate as electron acceptors in an anaerobic environment and organic matter in wastewater as the carbon source and the electron donor to supply energy and stabilize oxidation. When wastewater lacks organic matter, microorganisms consume their own protoplasm for endogenous denitrification, which reduces cellular matter and generates NH 3. Thus, {{it can be seen that}} the carbon source is of great importance in denitrification. If the C/N ratio is too low, then denitrification lacks a carbon source, which leads to incomplete denitrification and a failure to remove nitrogen.|$|E
30|$|Substrate {{concentration}} {{is an important}} parameter in the nitrification process, which can control the rate of ammonium/nitrite oxidation because of its inhibitory effects (Gerardi 2002). The prevailing strategies for incomplete nitrification and depressing the activity of NOB have been mentioned previously. Among them, the accumulation of free FA and FNA has strong and complicated effects on the inhibition of NOB activity (Qiao et al. 2010). The concentrations of both FA and FNA according to Eqs.  3 and 4 are influenced by operational pH, substrate concentration, and temperature (Chen et al. 2010). The threshold inhibition of FA and FNA reported by Anthonisen et al. (1976) is that AOB was inhibited from 10  mg FA/L to 150  mg FA/L, while the inhibition of NOB began at a concentration of 0.1 – 1  mg FA/L. The FAN inhibition of FNA takes place with <b>nitrobacteria</b> at FNA concentrations between 0.22 and 2.8  mg L− 1 (Anthonisen et al. 1976; Yang et al. 2010), and researchers reported the inhibition of AOB at FNA concentrations higher than 0.2  mg L− 1 (Mosquera-Corral et al. 2005; Qiao et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{biological membrane}} sewage treatment device {{has been designed}} based on the mechanism of microorganism nitrogen and phosphorus removal {{and the influence of}} temperature and dissolved oxygen on nitrogen and phosphorus removal of integrated bioreactor with adoption of this sewage treatment device. The research results shows that the optimal temperature range of microorganism nitrogen and phosphorus removal is 20 - 30 °C, and the effluent COD removal rate within this range maintains at over 90 %; NH 4 ^+-N removal rate is between 95 % and 97 %. TN removal rate is approximately 81 %. In practical production, the internal temperature environment of the sewage reactor should be maintained at above 15 °C, to decrease the inhibition of low-temperature environment on growth and reaction speed of <b>nitrobacteria.</b> In various concentrations of DO in the reactor, there is little change in the effluent COD concentration and effluent COD concentration is influenced by temperature. With the increasing of DO concentration, both effluent TN and TP concentrations present changing features of initially decreasing then increasing. The analysis of the influence of comprehensive dissolved oxygen on microorganism nitrogen and phosphorus removal reveals that when the concentration of DO maintains within the range of 1. 0 - 1. 5 mg/L, the sewage purification system can attain a higher nitrogen and phosphorus removal effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} water depth, {{coverage}} rate and harvest regime on nutrient removal from wastewater and high-protein biomass production were assessed in a duckweed-based (Lemna aequinoctialis) pilot-scale {{wastewater treatment system}} (10 basins x 12 m(2)) that is located near Dianchi Lake in China. The results indicated that a water depth of 50 cm, a coverage rate of 150 % and a harvest regime of 4 days were preferable conditions, under which excellent records of high-protein duckweed (dry matter production of 6. 65 g/m(2) /d with crude protein content of 36. 16 % and phosphorus content of 1. 46 %) were obtained at a temperature of 12 - 21 degrees C. At the same time, the system achieved a removal efficiency of 66. 16, 23. 1, 48. 3 and 76. 52 % for NH 4 +-N, TN, TP and turbidity, respectively, with the considerable removal rate of 0. 465 g/m(2) /d for TN and 0. 134 g/m(2) /d for TP at a hydraulic retention time of 6 days. In additionally, {{it was found that}} a lower duckweed density could lead to higher dissolved oxygen in the water and then a higher removal percentage of NH 4 +-N by <b>nitrobacteria.</b> This study obtains the preferable operation conditions for wastewater treatment and high-protein biomass production in a duckweed-based pilot-scale system, supplying an important reference for further large-scale applications of duckweed...|$|E
30|$|Influent with COD/TN {{smaller than}} 4 is {{typically}} a low C/N ratio of wastewater (Fang et al. 2005). As the influent {{is very low}} in the C/N ratio, the nitrification time is prolonged. In addition, denitrification lacks organic matter as electron donors. In this case, the denitrification rate is lowered and the degradation of nitrogen containing compounds is affected. Through the A 2 /O treatment system, the removal rates of NH 3 –N, TN, and TP are at 79, 72, and 61 %, respectively, and they all fall short of the primary grade-A emission standard. Moderate pH and DO are also required for efficient operation of the A 2 /O process. In the A 2 /O process, pH and DO mostly influence nitrification and denitrification. <b>Nitrobacteria</b> {{are very sensitive to}} pH changes, and the optimum range is believed to be from 7.5 to 8.5. When the pH value is lower than 7, the nitrification rate drops remarkably, and the nitrification will stop when the pH value is lower than 6 or higher than 9.5. Oxygen is an electron accepter in the process of nitrification, while the DO level in a reactor definitely has an effect on nitrification. In general, the DO concentration of mixed liquid should be maintained at 2 – 3  mg/L. During denitrification, the most moderate pH value ranges between 6.5 and 7.5; otherwise, the growth speed of denitrification bacteria and activity of denitrification enzyme will be affected. DO plays a great inhibition role in the process of denitrification. It is generally recognized that denitrification can only normally proceed when DO in the system is kept lower than 0.5  mg/L.|$|E
40|$|The eastern Tibetan Plateau {{has become}} {{increasingly}} warmer and drier since the 1990 s. Such warming and drying has {{a great impact on}} ecosystem processes on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. To determine their combined effects on CO 2 and N 2 O emission rates, we conducted a field manipulative experiment in an alpine meadow of the eastern Tibetan Plateau during the growing season of 2009. The experiment showed that warming manipulation increased soil temperature by 1 A degrees C, and drying manipulation decreased soil water content by 6. 8 %. We found that by counteracting the effect of low temperature in the area, experimental warming significantly increased soil microbial biomass, the number of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, ammonifying bacteria, <b>nitrobacteria</b> and denitrifying bacteria, and facilitated the emission rates of CO 2 and N 2 O by 33. 4 and 31. 5 %, respectively. However, decreased precipitation further aggravated soil water stress and inhibited the numbers of these organisms, and reduced the emission rates of CO 2 and N 2 O by 47. 4 and 37. 9 %, respectively. So decreased soil water content tended to offset the positive effect of warming. Compared to the positive effects of warming, decreased soil water content was shown in our study to have even greater impact on the eastern Tibetan Plateau during the growing season. Therefore, inhibition of CO 2 and N 2 O emission rates (32. 3 and 29. 3 %, respectively) by warming and drying will intensify if the combined effects of these climatic trends persist in the region.

40|$|Le manganèse est un élément minéral fréquemment rencontré dans différents types d'eau, surtout souterraines. Dans le cas des eaux de surface, le manganèse peut se trouver lors de pollutions accidentelles où lorsque la rivière reçoit des eaux d'un barrage réservoir en fin de vidange. Des essais de {{traitement}} d'une pollution par du manganèse par filtration lente ont été effectués sur un pilote. Les essais ont porté sur différentes concentrations de manganèse pendant des périodes de courte durée. La filtration lente semble très efficace pour l'élimination de ce composé, mais il faut noter que la nitrification biologique est altérée par la présence de fortes concentrations de manganèse. Manganese is {{a mineral}} element {{which is often}} found in differing types of water. The manganese content is rather consistent, especially in underground waters. In surface waters, manganese can only be found {{as a result of}} an occidental pollution or in rivers supplied with water from a dam whose tank has been sewed. This metal is not dangerous for humans but it can create problems in drinking water as it becomes progressively oxidized and thus precipitates in the water supply. This oxidation can produce direct effects like spots on linen or sanitary appliances, but also indirect effects, like important bacterial developments, as well as bacteria protection against biocides used as bactericidal or bacteriostatic agents. This study aims at : 1) Underlining the possible effects of manganese in case of an accidental pollution. 2) Underlining how much time the system takes to react to an increased manganese content, given that ferric salts which permanently incluse manganese (500 to 600 ppm in the 40 % commercial solution) are used in the coagulation phase. Amongst several methods to eliminate the manganese, the biological oxidation seems to be the most appropriate to this occasional pollution problem. Indeed, it filters are continually contaminated by manganese, the bacteria is likely to oxidize the divalent manganese, resulting in an immediate ceasing of the pollution, without human intervention. This is what the operation aims at. The existing data regarding the biological elimination of manganese in underground waters shows it to be consistent. There is no such data on manganese elimination by slow sand filtration, in surface waters, in case of a short accidental pollution. As far as slow sand filtration is concerned, the available results only represent waters with consistent manganese contents. This study has been carried out with a 50 m 3 /h pilote system, which was located in Paris surroundings. It was supplied with water from the Marne river and combined physicochemical and biological treatments. The physicochemical phase consisted of a coagulation-flocculation-decantation reaction in a pulsator, with ferric chloride including 500 to 600 ppm divalent manganese. Then, it was quickly filtered through sand, at a flow rate of 5 m/h. The water was subsequently poured into a storage tank in which it remained for around two hours. Then, it was filtered through slow sand filters, which biologically treated it. The filters contained 1 m high of sand and the filtration rate was 1 m/h, which allowed the development of a biological membrane on their surfaces. Simulated manganese pollution tests have been realised as follows :- water with two different manganese contents have been tested (0, 5 and 1 mg/l),- ammonium Ions have been simultaneously added to show a possible inhibition of nitrification. Each test lasted around two weeks and time was spent as follows :- polluting agents were continuously added during 3 days (which is the maximum duration of an accidental pollution). These two tests gave the following results : 1 st test (0, 5 manganese/l)  :- 35 % of the manganese was eliminated during the coagulation-decantation-quick filtration phase. - 100 % of the manganese was held bock by the slow sand filtration. - An important amount of nitrites appeared in water at the end of the treatment, which suggested an inhibition of the nitrification, or a competition between manganese and ammoniacal oxidation. - After the manganese pollution was stopped, no release of manganese and no inhibition of the nitrification were noticed. 2 nd test (1 mg manganese/l)  :- 25 % of the manganese was eliminated during the coagulation-decantation-quick filtration phase. - 97 % of the manganese was eliminated by slow sand filtration. - In this case, the ammonium and nitrites were eliminated by the biological filtration, which suggested a readaptation of the bacterial flora to this kind of pollution. The result showed chat the biological chain adapts itself very quickly to a rapid increase in water manganese content (no more than 2 hours). Indeed, the biological membrane, which was already contaminated by a permanent accumulation of manganese, reacted very quickly. The first test shows that nitrites appear and confirms the results that other searchers had already obtained before, in there is competition between <b>nitrobacteria</b> and the bacteria which oxidize manganese. A less efficient elimination of organic matter also shows competition during the biodegradation phase. In the second series of tests, a modification of the bacterial flora, due to the first manganese simulated pollution tests, is noticed. These encouraging results allowed us to propose an original system for water treatment, based on a physicochemical treatment and biological slow treatments and, afterwards, a refining phase with combined ozone and granular actiated carbon. In addition to its well-known properties, ozone allows to avoid the possible appearance of nitrites in water...|$|E
