5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover <b>narration,</b> sometimes used as a structuring device, {{came to be seen}} as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person <b>narration</b> (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person <b>narration</b> is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E

5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, the BBC began to release {{existing}} audio of serials with missing episodes, with linking <b>narration</b> provided by former series actors such as Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Colin Baker, Peter Purves, and Frazer Hines. By December 2005, the soundtracks {{for all of the}} missing episodes had been released, albeit with copyright-uncleared music replacements where necessary (e.g., a Beatles song in Evil of the Daleks), slightly rejigged sequences for reasons of clarity, and with overdubbed <b>narration.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to examine and compare <b>narrations</b> by five witnesses, who has written about atrocities against Christians from 1915 to 1919 in what is today {{south-eastern}} Turkey, but {{what was then the}} Ottoman Empire. I have focused on how the roles of perpetrators, victims, spectators and protectors are featured in the witness <b>narrations.</b> Four questions were posed in the study: Who are portrayed as perpetrators, victims, bystanders and protectors in the various witness <b>narrations?</b> How are these roles expressed in the witness <b>narrations?</b> What differences can be found among the five selected witness <b>narrations</b> from Mardin and Urfa, 1915 - 1919 ? What are the explanations of the differences in the witness <b>narrations?</b> The method I have used has been an analysis in which I compare how the different <b>narrations</b> capture the events of 1915 - 1919. I have used three factors to look at the explanations why there may be differences in the witness <b>narrations.</b> The three factors are nationality, position, and religious affiliation. In the comparison and the results of the witness <b>narrations,</b> I have found that the three factors affect the way the authors write about the events and that these factors help to explain the differences in the witness <b>narrations.</b> These factors {{are a part of the}} authors’ respective worldviews. Also, local differences, power constellations, and political factors meant that witness <b>narrations</b> differed...|$|R

Due to these <b>narrations,</b> the belief among the Ismaili Shi’a that the Twelver Shi’a replaced Isma'il ibn Jafar with Musa al-Kadhim through the excuse of bada’, has been a point of criticism by the Ismaili’s against the Twelver’s. However these <b>narrations</b> are rejected by Twelvers based on <b>narrations</b> from Muhammad, as well as <b>narrations</b> from the respective fathers of those Imāms, in which they were directly named as the successors to the Imāmate.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the role {{organizational}} <b>narrations</b> can play {{in the field of}} knowledge management and develop a model on qualifying and evaluating <b>narrations.</b> As a necessary prerequisite we first clarify the epistemological nature of narrative knowledge opposed to discursive knowledge by referring to a distinction drawn by the French philosopher Lyotard. Narrative knowledge is characterized as a kind of verbal life-world knowledge that is non-reflexive in character by contrast to discursive knowledge which is based on sound reasons and therefore reflexive in nature. Building on this clarification we develop a three-step-model designed to qualify <b>narrations</b> and to develop narrative knowledge from <b>narrations.</b> The model suggests to examine the transferability of <b>narrations</b> within and across contexts (first and second step), and its validity and applicability in broader contexts (third step). Finally, the practical importance of developing <b>narrations</b> will be illustrated by examples from Shell International Exploration and Production...|$|R

5|$|Mary Alice Young is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the ABC television series Desperate Housewives.

40|$|Abstract. Protocol <b>narrations</b> are an {{informal}} means to describe, in an idealistic manner, {{the functioning of}} cryptographic protocols as a single intended sequence of cryptographic message exchanges among the protocol’s participants. Protocol <b>narrations</b> have also been informally “turned into ” a number of formal protocol descriptions, e. g., using the spi-calculus. In this paper, we propose a direct formal operational semantics for protocol <b>narrations</b> that fixes a particular and, as we argue, wellmotivated interpretation on how the involved protocol participants are supposed to execute. Based on this semantics, we explain and formally justify a natural and precise translation of <b>narrations</b> into spi-calculus. ...|$|R

5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać <b>narration</b> and a heroic <b>narration.</b> The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent <b>narration</b> in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E
