25|$|Tyre {{selections}} are announced over a {{month before}} each event, with rules stating Pirelli must announce compounds nine weeks before a European round and 15 weeks before a long-haul event. Drivers ordinarily select 10 of the 13 sets available for a race weekend, though Pirelli's new tyres means the Italian company will force each driver {{to stick to the}} same allocations for the first five races as it learns about the <b>new</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E
500|$|Michelin, Dunlop and Continental {{supplied}} tyres for the race. In the Grand Prix's {{one major}} technical innovation, Michelin introduced the jante amovible: a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, {{which could be}} quickly swapped onto {{the car in the}} event of a puncture. Unlike in the Gordon Bennett races, only the driver and his riding mechanic were allowed to work on the car during the race, hence carrying the detachable rims could save time and confer a large advantage. The conventional method of changing a tyre, which involved slicing off the old tyre with a knife, and forcing the <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> onto the rim, generally took around fifteen minutes; replacing Michelin's rims took less than four. The FIATs each used a full set, while the Renaults and two of the Clément-Bayards used them on the rear wheels of their cars. As carrying each rim added [...] to the weight of the car over conventional wheels and tyres, some teams—such as Itala and Panhard—could not carry them without exceeding the weight limit.|$|E
6000|$|In youth {{she was all}} glory,--a <b>new</b> <b>Tyre,</b> - [...] Her very byword {{sprung from}} victory, [...] The 'Planter of the Lion,' which through fire [...] And blood she bore o'er subject earth and sea; [...] Though making many slaves, herself still free [...] And Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite: [...] Witness Troy's rival, Candia! Vouch it, ye [...] Immortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight! For ye are names no time nor tyranny can blight.|$|E
50|$|The {{teams will}} also be testing the company's <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> for 2014 in the Friday Free Practice sessions.|$|R
5000|$|Tyres {{were limited}} to 20 slick tyres per weekend, whereof 8 of these 20 were allowed to be <b>new</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first 40 laps {{went without}} {{incident}} until Villeneuve suffered a puncture {{and had to}} pit which dropped him back down to fifth, and a few laps later Peterson also pitted for <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> leaving the charging Reutemann second ahead of Jacques Laffite's Ligier. Peterson on the <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> was much quicker {{and was able to}} pass them both in the closing stages, and Laffite made an attempt to pass Reutemann on the last lap but they collided and Laffite was out. Andretti cruised to an untroubled victory, with Peterson making it a Lotus 1-2, and Reutemann completing the podium.|$|R
60|$|Another {{great work}} which {{was set for}} him to do, was to give the first great {{overthrow}} to the Phoenicians, and fulfil the prophecies of Isaiah and Ezekiel, by destroying Tyre. The siege lasted thirteen years, and the besiegers suffered {{as much as the}} besieged, till, as Ezekiel had foretold, every head was bald, every shoulder peeled with the burdens that were carried; but at last it was taken in the year 573, and so utterly destroyed, that not a trace was left of it. It had been said by Isaiah, that after seventy years Tyre should take her harp and sing again, and return for a time to her former splendour and corruption; and thus it happened, for a <b>new</b> <b>Tyre</b> arose upon a little island at some little distance from the shore.|$|E
50|$|Eight tyre {{carriers}} are used, two at each {{corner of the}} car, one assigned the task of removing the old tyre from the car, and one to install the <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> on it.|$|E
50|$|The four tyre changers, one at {{each corner}} of the car, have the sole {{responsibility}} of using a pneumatic wrench to remove the car's single locking lug nut from each tyre, then reinstall it on the <b>new</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over {{the next}} laps, Rosberg {{steadily}} closed on Hamilton in front {{without being able}} to catch his teammate. Lap 18 saw Romain Grosjean gain another position at Ricciardo's expense, moving into fourth. Just two laps later, a DRS aided move on Pérez handed him third place. On lap 21, Daniel Ricciardo's Red Bull came to a sudden stop at the exit of the 'Bus Stop' chicane, leading to a Virtual Safety Car period, during which many drivers made pit stops for <b>new</b> <b>tyres,</b> among them Grosjean, Massa and Verstappen. By lap 29, Kvyat had made a pit stop for <b>new</b> soft <b>tyres,</b> being able to go fast {{until the end of the}} race, while Vettel decided to try and finish the race without pitting for <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> a second time. Kvyat's <b>newer</b> <b>tyres</b> allowed him to overtake Bottas, Räikkönen, Massa and Pérez to eventually finish fourth. Sainz, Jr. eventually retired from the race on lap 34. Vettel's strategy however did not work out. By lap 42, less than two laps from the finish, his right rear tyre exploded while on the Kemmel straight, handing Grosjean the final podium position. Vettel ended his race in the pit lane, but was classified down in twelfth place. Unchallenged by his teammate in second, Lewis Hamilton finished the race to take his 39th Grand Prix victory.|$|R
5000|$|Tyres: A {{controlled}} Dunlop D14 non tread [...] "slick" [...] and R92 W08 treaded {{wet weather}} tyre. The contact patch {{is very small}} and therefore {{there is very little}} grip. Only six <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> are given out to teams per round to spice up racing.|$|R
50|$|The Ferraris {{were also}} {{struggling}} on Michelins, and Villeneuve pitted for <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> on lap 50, before stopping with fuel vaporization problems five laps from the end. Scheckter, meanwhile, was lapped by Regazzoni on lap 56, before Jarier and Watson passed {{him in the}} closing laps.|$|R
50|$|The 'new age' {{dry weather}} tyre which is {{currently}} used was chosen for its relatively hard compound, promoting durability and removing the need to replace them as often. In 2010 a <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> was introduced {{which was designed to}} improve performance.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the fatal}} crash of Danish driver Allan Simonsen at the 2013 race {{at the exit}} of Tertre Rouge into D338, Tertre Rouge was re-profiled again. The radius will be moved in {{approximately}} 200m for safety reasons with <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> barriers at the exit.|$|E
50|$|Having {{lost control}} of Bob Jane T-Marts, Jane {{attempted}} to create a <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> business using his name. It was blocked by son Rodney in court which also ruled Jane pay legal costs. In May 2015 his Diggers Rest farm was seized by the state sherriff in order to settle the outstanding costs.|$|E
50|$|Maxxis {{produced}} tyres {{have been}} used in the class since its advent. The class organisers restricts the use to a single 'wet' and 'dry' tyre for the class, with the idea of creating a level performance level and removing the costs of requiring <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> for each race weekend.|$|R
50|$|Lewis Hamilton {{led from}} the start, ahead of Fernando Alonso, Felipe Massa and a slow-starting Kimi Räikkönen. Mark Webber was forced to pit for <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> {{at the end of}} the first lap. Paul di Resta and Adrian Sutil lightly collided, with no damage {{suffered}} on either cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} side sun visor {{was signed by}} one of the famous race drivers who drove the car at the Sandton celebration. Renault SA also replaced the clutches and driveshafts a week after the showdown at Renault Sandton, and also fitted brand <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> before selling the cars.|$|R
50|$|After Force India {{failed to}} get their new car, the Force India VJM08 ready in time for {{pre-season}} testing {{at the beginning of}} , the VJM07 was used at the second test in Barcelona, although in the 2015 livery. This allowed the team to gain data on the <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> compounds and degradation.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Zenises {{announced}} its Z Tyre Flat Rate program in Germany, with its partner Alzura. A monthly subscription of EUR 4.99 covers all <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> related costs, and allows customers to fit or upgrade tyres when needed. The service is currently available in Germany through Alzura X and its 600 partner stores nationwide.|$|E
50|$|Two new control Dunlop tyres were introduced, {{marking the}} first change in tyre {{construction}} since 2003. Whereas in previous seasons, the two compounds were designated hard and soft, in 2017 these are named soft and super soft respectively. All teams attended a test session on 21 February 2017 at Sydney Motorsport Park {{to evaluate the}} <b>new</b> <b>tyre.</b>|$|E
50|$|Michael Waltrip had the inglorious honour {{of being}} the first to call into the pits {{at the end of the}} first lap for <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> after a tap from behind had sent him into a half spin from which he quickly recovered. The tap also saw damage to the rear of Waltrip's Monte Carlo.|$|R
5000|$|... {{marked a}} new {{beginning}} for the team, with two new drivers, a new engine supplier in Yamaha and <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> supplied by Bridgestone. The year also marked the first full season for Tom Walkinshaw's outfit TWR in running the team, as the Scotsman had bought it from one of its founders, Jackie Oliver during [...]|$|R
5000|$|Mansell {{managed to}} keep Prost within arms length, but with a less {{powerful}} engine on the tight Jerez circuit, could not get past, or close enough, to the Frenchman who was driving close to a perfect race (Mansell described it as [...] "following the master"). On lap 47 Mansell pitted but a sticking wheel nut delayed him and enabled Prost to pull ahead. Meanwhile, Nannini was going fast on his <b>new</b> <b>tyres,</b> passing both Patrese and Senna in one lap. Mansell's slow stop allowed Prost to pit on lap 50 without losing his lead (though he accidentally selected second gear and was slow getting away from his pit), and a lap later Senna also pitted for <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> and {{dropped out of the}} points. He passed Gugelmin and Berger before finally overtaking Patrese on lap 65, who drove the entire race on one set of tyres.|$|R
50|$|Due to its size, Ford {{was unable}} to design the Galaxy using a full Kinetic Design format. However, Ford states that the Mk III Galaxy has 'elements' of Kinetic Design, such as its {{trapezoidal}} grille, large wheelarches and angular headlights. The vehicle has no spare wheel; instead an aerosol foam sealant is provided to seal punctures until a <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> can be purchased.|$|E
50|$|The car {{was driven}} by S. C. H. Davis for the attempt at the one-hour light car record. The car lapped {{consistently}} at the Brooklands circuit at 103-104 mph but the front offside tyre came off and after having a <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> fitted, the same wheel shed its tyre several more times at speeds higher than 100 mi/h km/h, until the record attempt was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Inspired by 'Make In Maharashtra' initiative, CEAT Tyres {{announced}} {{its plans to}} invest Rs. 400 crore in a <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> plant in Butibori, Nagpur. Devendra Fadnavis, Chief Minister of Maharashtra, laid the cornerstone for the plant that will be set up in three phases. In the first phase (2014- 2016), Rs. 400 crore will be invested. In the nagpur plant the production has been started.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But your Mr. Leggatt {{he had to}} {{make and}} mend tyres all our watch below. It trarnspired she had been running on the rim o' two or three wheels, which, very properly, he hadn't {{reported}} till the close of the action. And that's the reason of your four <b>new</b> <b>tyres.</b> Mr. Morshed was of opinion you'd earned 'em. Do you dissent?' ...|$|R
50|$|Mansell, Piquet and Prost {{were engaged}} in a {{gripping}} battle for the lead, separated by just two seconds. On lap 19, Piquet spun and Prost passed him for second. Meanwhile, Senna was holding onto a creditable fourth place. On lap 30, Piquet pitted for <b>new</b> <b>tyres,</b> followed two laps later by Senna. Meanwhile, Thierry Boutsen (Benetton B187) retired with electrical failure. Both Mansell and Prost came in for <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> on lap 36, handing the lead to Piquet. Mansell completed his stop and closed rapidly on Piquet, breaking fastest lap records. On lap 46, at the Le Beausset corner, Piquet made an error and Mansell passed him on the inside to take a lead he would not lose. On lap 65 Piquet made a second stop which went wrong when the engine stalled, delaying him by an additional eight seconds. After exiting the pits, he caught and passed Prost (who was dealing with an electrical problem) on lap 67.|$|R
50|$|In 318 B.C., {{during the}} {{sequence}} of the invasion and sack of Tyre, by Alexander the Great, the Phoenicians founded the Myrtilis or <b>New</b> <b>Tyre.</b> The region became an important trading center frequented by Phoenicians and Carthaginians, thanks to the abundance of river and land routes connecting it to the southern portion of the peninsula. Before {{the invasion of the}} Iberian Peninsula, it held commercial importance among these civilizations.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 Pirelli {{developed}} a new extra large high performance tyre with a 205 section and a new tread pattern that was designated CN72 HS (HS standing for High Speed). This <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> again took the world of sportscars by storm and kept the Cinturato as the tyre of choice for sports cars such as Ferrari 330 GT 2+2, Iso Grifo, Lamborghini Muira and Maserati Ghibli. Once again Aston Martin also offered them as a radial alternative for their DBS.|$|E
50|$|The Young Driver Tests were {{followed}} by another testing session - also held at Yas Marina - for the teams to test the tyres developed by <b>new</b> <b>tyre</b> supplier Pirelli. Ferrari's Felipe Massa was the fastest during the tests, with many drivers declaring their satisfaction with the new tyres, particularly given Pirelli's short development window. Sebastian Vettel experienced an explosive puncture on the final day, though an investigation by Pirelli attributed the incident to debris on the circuit rather than a critical error with the build of the tyre.|$|E
5000|$|Regency Mark II saloon: £2,324 / £2,778 {{with the}} <b>new</b> Tubeless <b>Tyres</b> fitted as {{standard}} equipment ...|$|R
50|$|Pérez {{touched the}} {{barriers}} near the Nouvelle Chicane {{after trying to}} overtake Räikkönen on lap 69, Räikkönen had to pit for <b>new</b> <b>tyres</b> following a puncture caused by the collision. Fernando Alonso, teammate Jenson Button and Räikkönen himself later complained about Pérez's aggressive driving during the race, even though he didn't receive any penalties. Pérez later retired after running down the exit road near Rascasse.|$|R
5000|$|The train {{continued}} to grow by lap 38 as Grosjean in 10th joined Massa, Räikkönen, Kobayshi, and Vettel {{in the battle for}} 5th. Jenson Button asked his engineer [...] "what time is Rosberg doing?", to which his engineer replied [...] "Rosberg is seven tenths slower than us". However, this was before Rosberg pitted for <b>new</b> <b>tyres,</b> and now Rosberg was six tenths a lap up on Button.|$|R
