40|$|D. Phil. Clean water (i. e. {{water that}} is free of toxic {{chemicals}} and pathogens) is essential to human health and in South Africa the demand is fast exceeding the supply. The prevalence of toxic contaminants in water remains a huge challenge for water supplying companies and municipalities. However, the presently used water treatment technologies either fail to remove these contaminants to acceptable levels or they transform them into more toxic substances (e. g., DBPs). <b>Nanocatalysts,</b> especially TiO 2 (titania) have a proven potential to treat ‘difficult-to-remove’ contaminants and hence are expected {{to play an important}} role in solving many serious environmental and pollution challenges. In this study TiO 2 <b>nanocatalysts</b> were used for the degradation of Rhodamine B dye both under UV and visible light irradiation. Two phases of titania, i. e. anatase and rutile phases, were compared for the degradation of Rhodamine B under UV light irradiation. The anatase titania was found to be more photocatalytically active for the degradation of Rhodamine B than the rutile phase. It completely degraded 100 mg ℓ– 1 (100 mℓ) of Rhodamine B within 270 min and was two times more photocatalytically active than the rutile phase (Kapp of 0. 017 min– 1 compared to 0. 0089 min– 1). To extend the band edge of the titania <b>nanocatalysts</b> towards visible-light, TiO 2 was doped with metal ions (Ag, Co, Ni and Pd). These metal-ion-doped titania <b>nanocatalysts</b> were photocatalytically active under visible-light illumination. The Pd-doped titania had the highest photodegradation efficiencies, followed by Ag-doped and Co-doped, while Ni-doped had the lowest. The optimum metal-ion loading percentage was found to be at 0. 4 %, with the exception of Co-doped titania as it had the highest efficiencies at 1 % loadings. The free and metal-ion-doped titania <b>nanocatalysts</b> were embedded on carbon-covered alumina (CCA) supports. The CCA-supported TiO 2 <b>nanocatalysts</b> were more photocatalytically active under visible light illumination than they were under UV-light irradiation. The CCA-supported metal-ion-doped titania <b>nanocatalysts</b> were more photocatalytically active under visible light than their unsupported counterparts. The CCA-supported Pd-TiO 2 <b>nanocatalysts</b> were the most active while CCA-supported Ni-TiO 2 catalysts were the least active. The improved photocatalytic activities observed were as a result of increased surface areas of the CCA-supported <b>nanocatalysts.</b> Also, supporting the <b>nanocatalysts</b> did not destroy the anatase phase of the titania while doping with metal ions and supporting on CCAs resulted in decreased band gap energies, hence the visible-light photocatalytic activities. Finally, the metal-ion-doped titania <b>nanocatalysts</b> were supported on glass slides using the layer-by-layer thin film self-assembly technique. This was to overcome the aggregation and post treatment problems associated with the use of TiO 2 in suspension form. PAH and PSS were the polyelectrolytes used. These metal-ion-doped titania thin films were highly porous and strongly adhered by the polyelectrolytes onto the glass slides. The thin films were photocatalytically active for the degradation of Rhodamine B under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation efficiencies observed were similar for all four metal-ions (i. e. Ag, Co, Ni and Pd) with average degradation of 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % for 5 catalysts (5 glass slides) of 1, 3, 5 and 10 bi-layers, respectively, after 330 min.

The extent of removal declined at higher concentrations of <b>nanocatalyst.</b> This is explained by the accumulation of TiO 2 particles and the {{decrease in the number}} of superficial active sites of the <b>nanocatalyst</b> and increased turbidity and light dispersion at high concentrations (Thakur et al. 2010). A study conducted by Dehghani et al. (2014 a) in Iran demonstrated that increased concentrations of Fe 3 +–TiO 2 <b>nanocatalyst</b> resulted in the increased efficiency of penicillin-G removal. This was due to the enumeration of absorbed photons in the number of active sites of the <b>nanocatalyst</b> that resulted in an increased number of hydroxyl radicals (Dehghani et al. 2014 b); these results support the results of the current research. The results obtained by Evgenidou et al. (2007) in their 2007 study in Greece for removing prometrin photocatalytically from an aquatic environment indicated that the application of TiO 2 was very effective and dramatically increased the reaction rate; this result was attributed to the increased production of hydroxyl radicals. The results obtained by Mantzavinos et al. demonstrated that complete amoxicillin degradation and 93 % mineralization were achieved after 25 and 90  min of reaction, respectively, at 10  mg/L amoxicillin and 250  mg/L titanium dioxide using UV-A/TiO 2 photocatalysis. The current study showed that 91.43 – 99.14 % amoxicillin removal was obtained at an initial antibiotic concentration of 10 and 90  mg/L of catalyst at 90 – 120  min contact time using Fe+ 3 –TiO 2 /UV-C. The results obtained by Reyes et al., in Mexico in 2016 for the removal of As(III) under visible radiation and Fe-doped TiO 2 and its potential application on the treatment of As-contaminated groundwater indicated that favorable outcomes could be achieved in the photocatalytic oxidation reaction of As(III) by using a small doping amount of Fe (1.0  wt%) in TiO 2 powder (Garza-Arévalo et al. 2016). Therefore, titanium dioxide doped with trivalent iron can increase the efficiency of amoxicillin removal and save on catalyst consumption (Dimitrakopoulou et al. 2012). Trace amounts of iron enrichment had positive effects on increasing Fe 3 +–TiO 2 photocatalytic activity.|$|E

The fabricated carbonnanostructures were investigated by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM), itconsists of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) together with significant numberof helical carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) and straight carbon nanofibers (SCNFs). Thecontributions {{of the three major}} components were highly dependent on the morphologyof <b>nanocatalysts,</b> supportive gas ammonia, substrates and on the growth temperatures. Pd <b>nanocatalysts</b> shows structural sensitivity, the nanostructures synthesized on Pdnanoplates at 550 °C have almost the same amount of MWCNTs and carbon nanofibers(CNFs). At 650 °C the fabricated nanostructures on Pd nanoplates consist of more than 95 % MWCNTs. The yield and average diameter of all the three components increaseswith rising growth temperature (550 - 700 °C) and the growth seized completely at 750 °C. Ammonia supports the growth of MWCNTs.

40|$|This thesis {{work was}} carried out at Materials Science Institute of Seville, ICMS (Spain). CSIC-Univ. Seville, at the group of nanotechnology, under the {{supervision}} of the Prof. Maria Asunción Fernández. The aim of this thesis was to synthesize and characterize supported thin films of metallic <b>nanocatalysts</b> (Pt-Cu) supported on silicon carbide. The <b>nanocatalysts</b> have been produced by a physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique, precisely the magnetron sputtering. One of several possible techniques to check and modify the reactivity of <b>nanocatalysts</b> is the dealloying. The selective leaching in an acid environment was used on <b>nanocatalysts</b> in this thesis. The supported metal alloys produced have been chosen to test on the reaction of Catalytic Hydrogen Combustion (CHC). The work was therefore divided into two parts. In the first the synthesis of the supported metal alloy has been developed, through the use of magnetron sputtering; the second step was the use of the technique of dealloying in acidic environment; the third step was the characterization of the of produced coatings. Through spectroscopic techniques XRD, SEM and EDX. In the second part a process for the CHC reaction on supported <b>nanocatalysts</b> coatings has been developed; after testing the samples, the reported results were used to calculate the activation energy of the reaction CHC and the T 50...|$|R
