40|$|Nepal harbors unique {{mammalian}} fauna, but it {{is poorly}} studied at higher elevation. Mammalian fauna were recorded in Manaslu Conservation Area, Dudhkunda and Dudhkoshi valley of Solukhumbu district and Kanchenjunga Conservation Area of Nepal during March 2011 to April 2013 along the trail and the study plots from 700 m to 4400 m a. s. l. Semi-structured interviews were made with local people to understand their behavior and habitats. Altogether, 29 mammalian fauna were recorded. Five species were recorded new for the areas. Overall, Carnivore species (nine) were encountered more, followed by species of the order Cetartiodactyla (seven). The highest number of mammalian fauna (18) was identified from Manaslu Conservation Area whereas the least (11) from Dudhkunda and Dudhkoshi valley. Human wildlife conflict was frequent with Himalayan Goral (Naemorhedus goral), Barking Deer (Muntiacus vaginalis), Himalayan Tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta), <b>Nepal</b> <b>Grey</b> <b>Langur</b> (Semnopithecus schistaceus) and Himalayan Black Bear (Ursus thibetanus) for crop depredation in these areas. Although mammalian research started a long time ago, scenario of comprehensive research is not satisfactory in the Central Himalaya, Nepal...|$|E
40|$|The {{golden langur}} (Trachypithecus geei) is an {{endangered}} endemic species of primate in Bhutan. Conservation {{of this species}} is addressed here through phylogeographic and habitat management tools. I hypothesize that rivers and mountains in Bhutan isolated a population of capped langurs (Trachypithecus pileatus) and that this population later speciated into the morphologically distinct golden langur. Trachypithecus, the genus to which both capped and golden langurs belong, spread north from a paleo-refuge in south China and Semnopithecus (<b>grey</b> <b>langurs)</b> spread east and northward from a refuge in south India. My results show that these two genera both arrived in Bhutan but could not mix since the Sunkosh River and Pelela range form a biogeographic barrier. Likewise, a population of capped langurs isolated from parental populations by rivers speciated into the distinct golden langur. I conducted field surveys covering {{the entire range of}} langurs in Bhutan, confirming the distribution and isolating barriers among the three <b>langurs.</b> <b>Grey</b> <b>langurs</b> and golden langurs are isolated from each other by the Sunkosh River and Black Mountain range in west Bhutan. In the east, the Manas river system (Manas-Mangde-Chamkhar) served as a barrier between golden and capped langurs. However, this barrier has been broken in the last 30 years due to the construction of bridges over the Chamkhar river. A hybrid zone was found and the implications are discussed. A cyt b phylogeny showed the <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> of Bhutan grouping into a distinct clade with other congenerics of Semnopithecus. The south-Indian clade of <b>grey</b> <b>langurs</b> is more ancient, with the Bhutan and <b>Nepal</b> <b>grey</b> <b>langurs</b> having diverged later. The golden and capped langur from Bhutan grouped with Trachypithecus from South East Asia. Finally, I explore conservation of golden langur habitat in Bhutan and estimate available habitat at 3, 089 km 2 and an estimated population of about 6, 000 individuals. I also find that the most viable strategy for conservation of langur habitat is to give ownership of the forests to local people, with monitoring by the Department of Forestry...|$|R

25|$|Tigers are carnivores. They prefer hunting large {{ungulates}} such as chital, sambar, gaur, and to {{a lesser}} extent also barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, serow and takin. Among the medium-sized prey species they frequently kill wild boar, and occasionally hog deer, muntjac and <b>grey</b> <b>langur.</b> Small prey species such as porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in their diet. Because of the encroachment of humans into their habitat, they also prey on domestic livestock.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{six months}} ending in August 2009, the park earned revenue of Rs. 18.2 millions. From 1994 to 2001 some 423,000 people visited the park, 20% of them foreigners. For the 1998-2001 period average annual revenue was 280,000. Postage stamps bearing the images of four wild animals of Udawalawe were issued on 31 October 2007 in the series [...] "National Parks of Sri Lanka", {{featuring}} water buffalo, Sri Lankan elephant, ruddy mongoose and tufted <b>grey</b> <b>langur.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fauna: The {{forest cover}} in the park helps provide the ideal habitat for many wild animals. Chital (or spotted deer), rhesus macaque and bonnet macaque {{are some of the}} wild mammals that can easily be spotted roaming inside the park. Other large mammals found in the park are: black-naped or Indian hare, muntjac (barking deer), porcupine, Asian palm civet, chevrotain (mouse deer), Hanuman or <b>grey</b> <b>langur,</b> Indian flying-fox, sambar deer and leopard. One can also spot striped hyena or four-horned antelope.|$|R
2500|$|Resisting {{males and}} {{fighting}} back are important tactics some species use to counter male coercion. Many females try to vigorously shake off males to dislodge them and flee; this {{is seen in}} females sepsid flies [...] and diving beetles. Sepsids also try to bend their abdomen {{in such a way}} that males cannot copulate forcefully. Females are especially likely to fight back when they are protecting their offspring. This is seen in mountain gorillas, red howlers, and <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> females, where males are often infanticidal.|$|R
50|$|The tiger, one-horned rhino, golden langur, clouded leopard, {{hispid hare}} and the sloth bear {{live in the}} lush {{tropical}} lowland and hardwood forests in the south. In the temperate zone, <b>grey</b> <b>langur,</b> tiger, common leopard, goral and serow are found in mixed conifer, broadleaf and pine forests. Fruit bearing trees and bamboo provide habitat for the Himalayan black bear, red panda, squirrel, sambar, wild pig and barking deer. The alpine habitats of the great Himalayan range in the north are home to the snow leopard, blue sheep, marmot, Tibetan wolf, antelope and Himalayan musk deer.|$|R
50|$|The Sri Lanka primate project still continues, {{now more}} than four decades later. It is {{recognized}} as being the most intensive long-term study of a wild population of primates, anywhere, ever. Dittusâ€™ team tracks (among dozens of other variables) the life histories of some 4,500 macaques from birth to death, maintains matrilineal and patrilineal genealogies, documents migration between troupes and monitors the social rank and relations of each individual through time. His team has been engaged in similar long-term studies on the <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> (Semnopithecus priam thersites) and the northern purple-faced leaf monkey (Semnopithecus vetulus philbricki) at the same site.|$|R
5000|$|Indian wolf is the {{keystone}} species of Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary. Other carnivores here include: Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, striped hyena, wild dog (Dhole), Bengal fox, Muggar crocodile, golden jackal, and bears. The tiger and the leopards are conspicuous by their absence though infrequent evidences are met with. Recently a tigress {{was found dead}} due to old age. Other fauna often seen is smooth Indian otter, sloth bear and Indian grey mongoose. Herbivores living here include: Four-horned antelope (Chousingha), nilgai (blue bull), chinkara (Indian gazelle), sambar deer, blackbuck antelope, barking deer, <b>grey</b> <b>langur,</b> rhesus macaque, chital (spotted deer) and wild boar.|$|R
5000|$|Mesopithecus ("middle monkey") is an extinct genus of Old World monkey {{that lived}} in Europe and western Asia 7 to 5 million years ago. It was once thought {{that it might be}} an {{ancestor}} of the <b>grey</b> <b>langur,</b> but a more recent study suggests that they are more closely related to the snub-nosed monkeys and doucs. [...] Mesopithecus resembled a modern macaque, with a body length of about 40 cm. It was adapted to both walking and climbing, possessing a slender body with long, muscular limbs and flexible fingers. Its teeth suggest that it primarily ate soft leaves and fruit.|$|R

The endangered wild water buffalo occurs in southern Bhutan, although in small numbers.|$|R
5|$|Other than feral {{dogs and}} {{domestic}} cattle, {{the most frequently}} encountered non-human mammal is the hanuman, a long tailed <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> prevalent in the Gangetic plain. Some wild boars and wolves may still be spotted in the small forests of Chinpai, Bandarsol and Charicha. Leopards and bears {{are not to be}} seen any more in the wild. Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water fowls, doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.|$|R

50|$|The rusty-spotted cat, {{fishing cat}} and Sri Lankan leopard {{are members of}} the family Felidae present in Udawalawe. The Sri Lankan sloth bear is seldom seen because of its rarity. Sri Lankan sambar deer, Sri Lankan axis deer, Indian muntjac, Sri Lankan spotted chevrotain, wild boar and water buffalo are among other mammal species. Golden jackal, Asian palm civet, toque macaque, tufted <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> and Indian hare also inhabit the park. A study {{conducted}} in 1989 found that considerable numbers of golden palm civets inhabit the forests of Udawalawe. Five species of mice also have been recorded from the park. The endemic Ceylon spiny mouse, known from Yala National Park, was recorded in Udawalawe in 1989. Indian bush rat and three species of mongoose are also recorded in the national park.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} species of rare, {{endangered}} and protected species. The main species are hangul, musk deer, serow, brown bear, Leopard, rhesus macaque, <b>grey</b> <b>langur,</b> Himalayan mouse hare, etc. Wild bears still roam much of the area, and local villagers are on constant alert for their presence. Due to the constant threat of illegal border crossings, the Indian army is always patrolling the area and is on constant high alert. As the local population cannot carry firearms, this has saved the bears from being hunted to extinction. With the abundance of fresh trout in the rivers and local farm animals, they have plenty to eat. Monkeys also populate the area. The area houses a good population of pheasants and upland birds apart from other species, both resident and migratory. The common birds are griffon vulture, monal, snow cock, koklas, blue rock pigeon, Kashmir roller, European hoopoe, jungle crow etc.|$|R
5|$|Although wolves {{primarily}} feed {{on medium}} to large sized ungulates, {{they are not}} fussy eaters. Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots, hares, badgers, foxes, weasels, ground squirrels, mice, hamsters, voles and other rodents, as well as insectivores. They frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs. When such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards, snakes, frogs, rarely toads and large insects as available. In times of scarcity, wolves readily eat carrion, visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter houses. Cannibalism is not uncommon in wolves: during harsh winters, packs often attack weak or injured wolves, and may eat the bodies of dead pack members. Wolf packs in Astrakhan hunt Caspian seals on the Caspian Sea coastline and some wolf packs in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon. Humans are rarely, but occasionally preyed upon. Other primates occasionally taken by wolves include <b>grey</b> <b>langurs</b> in <b>Nepal</b> and hamadryas baboons in Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{varieties}} of birds {{are found in}} Madhu Road including Alexandrine parakeet, ashy-crowned sparrow-lark, ashy prinia, ashy woodswallow, Asian koel, Asian palm swift, baya weaver, black drongo, black-hooded oriole, black-rumped flameback, black-winged kite, blue-faced malkoha, brahminy kite, brown-headed barbet, changeable hawk-eagle, common emerald dove, common iora, common myna, common tailorbird, common woodshrike, coppersmith barbet, crested honey buzzard, crimson-fronted barbet, greater coucal, greater racket-tailed drongo, green bee-eater, green imperial pigeon, grey-breasted prinia, house crow, house sparrow, Indian paradise flycatcher, Indian peafowl, Indian robin, Indian roller, Jerdon's bush lark, Jerdon's leafbird, jungle crow, jungle prinia, large cuckooshrike, Malabar pied hornbill, orange-breasted green pigeon, oriental magpie-robin, paddyfield pipit, plain prinia, Sri Lanka green pigeon, purple sunbird, red-rumped swallow, red-vented bulbul, red-wattled lapwing, rock dove, rose-ringed parakeet, scaly-breasted munia, shikra, small minivet, spotted dove, Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lankan junglefowl, tawny-bellied babbler, white-bellied sea eagle, white-browed bulbul, white-browed fantail, white-rumped munia, white-rumped shama, yellow-billed babbler, yellow-eyed babbler and Zitting cisticola.

50|$|The Himalayas, {{created during}} the {{collision}} of the Indian and Asiatic continental plates, form the northern boundary of the Indian subcontinent. Valmik Thapar begins in the cold, dry desert of Ladakh, the northernmost region of India. A sequence of aerial mountain shots and typical fauna including snow leopard, Himalayan ibex and lammergeier is shown, followed by scenes of Buddhist monasteries and winter festivals. The Buddhist's respect for all nature stems from the ancient animist belief system in which animals were thought of as living embodiments of the spirit world. Wildlife is often plentiful around villages, where chukar, robin accentor and red-billed chough are commonly seen. Temperatures plunge to -30 Celsius in winter. Bharal can survive at great height by digging for roots or even climbing trees. Across the border in Pakistan, markhor are not so hardy, and must descend to lower elevations. In spring, melting snows reveal winter's casualties. Himalayan griffon vultures strip a carcass in 20 minutes, then lammergeiers carry away the bones. Further west in the meadows of Deosai, rarities such as Himalayan brown bears, kiang and black-necked cranes are filmed. Bar-headed geese cross the mountains to breed here, and marmots play fight in the meadows. Thapar then travels to {{the south side of}} the mountains where lush forests of oak, birch, spruce and rhododendron thrive on the monsoon rains. Animals in this region include Himalayan tahr, yellow-throated marten and <b>grey</b> <b>langurs,</b> shown feeding on Indian horse chestnut shoots. The golden langur, discovered in the 1950s, survives in the wild only in Bhutan and western Assam. In the north east of India, the animals of the Arunachal Pradesh are very different. Here, species from China and East Asia have colonised the forests. They include spectacular pheasants such as Himalayan monal, Temminck's tragopan and Blyth's tragopan. Mammals include red panda, Malayan giant squirrel and Hoolock gibbon, India's only ape. Valmik Thapar ends the programme at Namo Buddha in Nepal where legend has it Lord Buddha gave his life to a starving tigress and her cubs, and in doing so instilled a protective attitude to all creatures in his followers.|$|R
50|$|The {{density of}} wild {{animals in the}} valley is not high, but all the animals found are rare or endangered. A total 13 species of mammals are {{recorded}} for the park by CP Kala and its vicinity although only he sighted 9 species directly: northern plains <b>grey</b> <b>langur</b> Semnopithecus entellus, flying squirrel Petaurista petaurista, Himalayan black bear Ursus thibetanus (VU), red fox Vulpes vulpes, Himalayan weasel Mustela sibirica, and Himalayan yellow-throated marten Martes flavigula, Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster, Indian chevrotain Moschiola indica, Himalayan thar Hemitragus jemlahicus (VU) and serow Capricornis sumatraensis (VU). The tahr is common, the serow, goral, musk deer and bharal, blue sheep are rare. The common leopard Panthera pardus is reported from lower parts of the valley closer to the villages. Local people have also reported evidence of brown bear Ursus arctos and bharal or blue sheep Pseudois nayaur. A recent faunal survey in October 2004 has established the presence of snow leopard Panthera uncia (EN) in the national park. The area is within the West Himalayan Endemic Bird Area {{but there have been}} no surveys specific to the Valley. 114 species were seen in 1993 in Nanda Devi Park. Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Himalayan vulture Gyps himalayensis, yellow billed and red billed choughs Pyrrhocorax graculus and P. pyrrhocorax, koklass pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, the nationally listed Himalayan monal pheasant Lophophorus impejanus, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellow-nape woodpeckers Picus squamatus and P. flavinucha, great and bluethroated barbets Megalaima virens and M. asiatica, snow pigeon Columba leuconota and spotted dove Stigmatopelia chinensis. The area is relatively poor in reptiles: most often seen are the high altitude lizard Agama tuberculata, Himalayan ground skink Leiolopisma himalayana and Himalayan pit viper Gloydius himalayanus. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly Papilio demoleus demoleus, common yellow swallowtail Papilio machaon, common Mormon Papilio polytes romulus, spangle Papilio protenor protenor and common blue apollo Parnassius hardwickei.|$|R
