40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide a basis for {{understanding}} among Tech Prep and School-to-Work change agents, and educational leaders, of the role that Discipline-Based Art Education (DBAE) can perform as a part of the core curriculum, within the framework of these reform movements. The literature indicated that the federally supported Tech Prep and School-to-Work reform movements were not acquainted with DBAE reform initiative which were supported by the Getty Education Institute <b>for</b> the <b>Arts</b> through the work of Regional Institutes. Therefore, they had no ideas about the possible worth of art as an education core component. Also, DBAE was not acquainted with Tech Prep and School-to-Work and therefore had established no common terminology to communicate the power of what they do in a manner which was relevant to that audience. The DBAE Regional Institutes provided individuals to assist in the development and validation of the study tools, and to participate in the pilot study. The Regional Institutes also identified the 10 Discipline-Based Art Education experts who composed the national Delphi panel for the study. The findings were reported according to research questions. They show the national Delphi panels' perceptions of which SCANS skills can be developed by Content Standards and Performance <b>Standards</b> from the <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> [Visual] <b>Arts</b> Education. The study concluded that: 1) there is a relationship between the Content and Performance Standards taken from the <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> [Visual] <b>Arts</b> Education and the SCANS skills; 2) SCANS Basic skills, Thinking skills, Resources skills, Information skills and Systems skills could be developed through the achievement of the Performance <b>Standards</b> of the <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> [Visual] <b>Arts</b> Education; and 3) the relationship between the SCANS Workplace Know-How skills and the <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> [Visual] <b>Art</b> Education was validated by a national Delphi panel.

40|$|Standards {{themselves}} cannot {{capture the}} imaginations of teachers or students. Translated into curriculum that actively engages teachers and students, standards can ensure that instruction {{leads to the}} achievement of significant skills and knowledge, and that perfor-mances and products demonstrate those competencies. Aesthetic literacy-the acquisition of skills, knowledge, and habits of mind that empower {{students to participate in}} and discriminate amongA artistic experiences and, by extension, in the experiences art reflects-is a concept based on both the <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>Education</b> and the National Standards for English Language Arts. Aesthetic literacy depends on &dquo;reading&dquo; in its fullest sense-experiencing, interpreting, and responding to print, images, and sound; as well as &dquo;writing&dquo; that extends communication to include not only verbal, but also musical, kinesthetic, and visual languages.

40|$|George Frederick Root (1820 - 1895) {{was widely}} {{known for his}} {{pedagogical}} approach {{to the teaching of}} music. He authored or composed more than seventy works of considerable length for use in classrooms, colleges, normal institutes, churches, and the concert hall. 	George Root was a student and friend of Lowell Mason, and in 1839, became one of Mason's teaching assistants in the public schools of Boston. From 1845 - 1855, he taught at academies and colleges in the New York City area. In 1853, Root organized and directed the first three-month music normal institute in New York City. 	Root was greatly influenced by Pestalozzi (1746 - 1827) whose principles became the foundation for Root's pedagogy. Root believed that music instruction should be available to all. His music and methods of teaching were published in numerous instructional manuals and were dispersed to thousands of teachers who attended his normal institutes during an approximate forty-year period. 	The purpose of this dissertation is three-fold: (1) to compare the integrated pedagogical approach of Root's two instructional manuals for private instruction, The Musical Curriculum (1864) and The New Musical Curriculum (1872), with other manuals of the period; (2) to compare Root's pedagogy in his manuals for private instruction with that found in his manuals for group instruction; and (3) to compare Root's integrated pedagogical approach with that found in current theory and musicianship texts. 	Root's two editions of The Musical Curriculum (1864 and 1872) are unique works of the period which integrate the study of theory, harmony, and sight-singing with piano and vocal training. His teaching method is comprehensive and progressive. Expressive and artistic performance is encouraged. The student is expected to think perceptively, engage in self-assessment, and develop creativity. These principles are also promoted in today's <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> the Fine <b>Arts</b> (2000). 	A survey of current texts reveals that pedagogical approaches promoted in today's music classroom differ from those presented in Root's instructional manuals. The Musical Curriculum (1864) and The New Musical Curriculum (1872) could serve as models for new integrative curricula, programs, and texts in twenty-first century music classrooms...|$|R

40|$|Helping {{students}} to understand and appreciate music of the worlds cultures is an important long-term goal in music education, a position supported in documents dating from the Tanglewood Declaration (Choate, 1968) to the <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>Education</b> (Consortium of National Arts Education Associations, 1994). Currently the position is endorsed in the Housewright Declaration (Madsen, 2000), a summation of agreements made during the Housewright Symposium on the Future of Music Education. Although music teachers believe in the value and benefit of world music instruction, they often are uncertain {{as to how to}} provide that instruction effectively (Moore, 1993; Norman, 1994; Young, 1996). This uncertainty remains an ongoing concern. What constitutes effective world music instruction? One component involves providing music experiences that are likely to increase students preferences for the music style studied, as this is a desired long-term outcome for music instruction. Reimer (1965) indicated that teaching methods, among other considerations, should be examined to determine how and to what extent the teaching-learning process affects learners in terms of achievement and levels of music preference. LeBlanc (1982) theorized that music preference decisions are based upon th...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge, {{as central}} to {{sustaining}} society and culture, is becoming increasingly dependent on the visual. While other signs and symbol systems such as text and numbers have dominated, and other arts forms such as music and dance are able to express and reveal the pulse of human existence, it {{is the emergence of}} new visual technologies and new multimodal forms of the visual that see us expressing and communicating, as never before, {{in a wide variety of}} visual forms and materials- including multi-media, web, video, photography and film- along with expressions and communications through design objects and the more traditional forms of art and crafts. Many of these forms of visual expression and presentation are penetrating deeply into everyday work and life. As the nature of the (visual) world is transforming and enlarging, so is the way we develop knowledge and act in the world. This creates new opportunities and a demand for skills that enable people to function within the mediated, graphic and performative environments (Druckery, 1996; <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>Education,</b> 1997).

40|$|Project (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Education, 2008 Although aural {{learning}} and improvisation of music have been fundamental components of music learning theories {{for at least}} two hundred years, published resources for beginning instrumentalists usually take a notation-first approach. An analysis of popular beginning band method books published {{in the last six years}} further reveals an emphasis on the teaching of techniques necessary to play music in the Western classical tradition, an emphasis which might influence instrumental teachers' values and teaching approaches. An alternative approach in beginning instrumental music instruction emphasizes improvisation and the development of music listening and speaking vocabularies prior to the development of music literacy. Jazz offers an ideal medium for this exploration, as improvisation is integral to this art form, and it is a genre outside of the Western Classical tradition. 	The call to incorporate improvisation and jazz into the beginning instrumental curriculum will necessitate the revision of current curricula, the adoption of new learning goals, and the development of additional teaching strategies. This project aims to help fill this void and to make improvisation and jazz available to all instrumentalists through the creation of a jazz-based beginning band improvisation curriculum unit for grades 5 through 8. The unit that is the content of Chapter Four of the project meets the <b>National</b> <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>Education</b> improvisation content standard and can be taught within the typical time constraints of beginning instrumental instruction in a school setting...|$|E
