2500|$|In the 1940s, Jordan {{released}} {{dozens of}} hit songs, including the swinging [...] "Saturday Night Fish Fry" [...] (one {{of the earliest}} and most powerful contenders {{for the title of}} first rock and roll record), [...] "Blue Light Boogie", the comic classic [...] "Ain't <b>Nobody</b> <b>Here</b> but Us Chickens", [...] "Buzz Me," [...] "Ain't That Just Like a Woman (They'll Do It Every Time)", and the multimillion seller [...] "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie".|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, Mercury Records signed Jordan and {{released}} two LPs {{and a handful}} of singles. Jordan's first LP for Mercury, Somebody Up There Digs Me (1956), showcased updated rock-and-roll versions of previous hits such as [...] "Ain't <b>Nobody</b> <b>Here</b> but Us Chickens", [...] "Caldonia", [...] "Choo Choo Ch'Boogie", [...] "Salt Pork, West Virginia", and [...] "Beware!" [...] Its follow-up, Man, We're Wailin (1957), featured a more laid-back, [...] "late-night" [...] sound. Mercury intended this to be a comeback for Jordan, but it was not commercially successful, and the label let him go in 1958. He recorded sporadically in the 1960s for Warwick (1960), Black Lion (1962), Tangerine (1962–1965), and Pzazz (1968) and in the early 1970s for Black and Blue (1973), Blues Spectrum (1973), and JSP (1974).|$|E

2500|$|Roy Beck, whose 1.5-million-member {{organization}} NumbersUSA {{played a}} major role in defeating the Senate immigration bill, calls Huckabee [...] "an absolute disaster as governor of Arkansas... Every time there was any enforcement in his state, he took the side of the illegal aliens." [...] Huckabee responded by saying if voters are looking for the toughest guy on immigration, he's not their man. [...] Nevertheless, like many in the Republican party, Huckabee's position has evolved, particularly after the bruising immigration reform fight in the summer of 2007. [...] On December 6, 2007, he released a nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. [...] These were modeled on a ten-point plan proposed in 2005 by Mark Krikorian. [...] On January 16, 2008, Huckabee became the first presidential candidate to sign Americans for Better Immigration's No-Amnesty pledge. [...] In response, Roy Beck's organization raised his rating on illegal immigration to EXCELLENT. [...] Huckabee continues to speak for the dignity of legal immigrants. [...] In the January 10 Republican debate he said that all immigrants [...] "ought to live with their heads up.. We ought to have the assumption that everybody here is legal, that <b>nobody</b> <b>here</b> is illegal." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 July at 11:49a.m. Prince Lichnowsky {{sent the}} fourth British offer of mediation, {{this time from}} King George V as well as Grey. Lichnowsky wrote that the King desired that [...] "British-German joint participation, with the {{assistance}} of France and Italy, may be successful in mastering in the interest of peace the present extremely serious situation." [...] At 4:25p.m. on 28 July, Lichnowsky reported to Berlin that [...] "since appearance of Austrian demands <b>nobody</b> <b>here</b> believes in possibility of localizing conflict." [...] The Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, and the Private Secretary to Grey, Sir William Tyrrell, saw Grey's conference offer as [...] "the only possibility of avoiding a general war" [...] and hoped [...] "to get full satisfaction for Austria, as Serbia would be more apt to give in to the pressure of the Powers and to submit to their united will than to the threats of Austria". Tyrrell relayed Grey's view that if Serbia were invaded, [...] "world war would be inevitable". Lichnowsky in his dispatch to Berlin offered [...] "an urgent warning against believing any further in the possibility of localization [...] ". When Sir Edward Goschen, the British Ambassador in Berlin, presented Grey’s conference proposal to Jagow, the Germans totally rejected the offer. In a letter to Grey, Bethmann Hollweg stated that Germany [...] "could not summon Austria before a European court of justice in her case with Serbia". Austrian troops began to concentrate in Bosnia as a preparatory step towards invading Serbia. Falkenhayn told the German government, [...] "It has now been decided to fight the matter through, regardless of the cost," [...] and advised Bethmann Hollweg to order a German attack on Russia and France at once. Moltke supported Falkenhayn by submitting the assessment that 1914 was a [...] "singularly favourable situation" [...] for Germany to go to war as both Russia and France were not prepared whereas Germany was. Once the Russian Great Military Programme would be completed by 1917, Moltke stated that Germany {{would never be able to}} entertain the prospect of a victorious war again and so should destroy both France and Russia while it was still possible. Moltke ended his assessment that [...] "We shall never hit it again so well as we do now." [...] Jagow backed up Moltke by sending a message to Vienna telling the Austrians they must attack Serbia at once because otherwise the British peace plan might be accepted.|$|E
