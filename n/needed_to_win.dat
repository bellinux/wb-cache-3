5|$|In the semi-finals, Juve's captain Antonio Conte met Edgar Davids' pass to give Juventus an away goal. United {{equalised}} in injury-time through Giggs, who converted a Beckham cross: a Teddy Sheringham goal a {{few minutes}} earlier had been disallowed.

5|$|Liverpool's first match {{after the}} final was against Arsenal, a match the club <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> {{to stay in touch}} with the top four. Two goals from Robin van Persie, after Liverpool had scored in the first half meant that Liverpool lost 2–1 and were 10 points behind the team in 4th place, which would ensure {{qualification}} for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Liverpool's league form continued to falter {{after the final}}; they won four of their last thirteen matches and ended the season in eighth place. Despite their poor league form, Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup against Chelsea. But they were unable to win a second trophy and lost 2–1. Cardiff played West Ham United in their first match after the final, which they lost 2–0. Despite the loss, they only <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> one more in their remaining thirteen matches to finish in 6th place and qualify for the Championship playoffs. They faced third placed West Ham United, in the playoffs, which were contested over two-legs, with one at each team's home ground. Cardiff were unable to secure a second Wembley final, as West Ham United won 5–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|On 10 September 1985, the Welsh and Scottish {{national}} teams played {{each other}} during the qualifying stages of the 1986 FIFA World Cup at Ninian Park, the home of Cardiff City.

5|$|The {{points from}} the {{forfeiture}} provided Detroit with the margin it <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> first place overall and be guaranteed home-ice advantage throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 1–0, and Michael Thomas's goal with seconds left of the match ensured the team won the league title. Liverpool, days before the league encounter with Arsenal, defeated Everton to win the 1989 FA Cup Final which meant they obtained the other Charity Shield place.|$|E
5|$|Both {{games against}} Barcelona ended in draws. Despite Giggs, Scholes and Beckham putting the team into a 3–2 lead at Old Trafford, the {{visitors}} were awarded a late penalty after Butt was sent off for handling the ball. Luis Enrique converted {{the ball into}} the net to leave both teams with a point on Matchday One. In the return game on 25 November at the Camp Nou, a fixture that Barça <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> to avoid elimination, Dwight Yorke's goals put United ahead 3–2, but Barça star Rivaldo equalized and nearly scored again but his effort hit the crossbar.|$|E

Despite this, Liverpool had won the Football League Cup for the first time earlier in the season, defeating West Ham United 2–1 in a replay after the final finished 1–1.

She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda {{was the only one who}} went through a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Test {{was played}} at Headingley, {{starting}} on 22 July, and Australia made two changes. Harvey replaced the injured Sid Barnes, while Ron Saggers replaced Don Tallon, {{who had a}} finger injury, as wicket-keeper. Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test to open; instead, Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. As Australia were leading 20 after three Tests, England <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the last two Tests to square the series. England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch.|$|E

5|$|The club {{continued}} to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions {{on two occasions}} and reaching {{the final of the}} 1974 League Cup. One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals. The final trophy of the club's most successful period was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{loosely based}} on {{professional}} wrestling games, but more closely resembles a beat-'em up. The game can be played in two modes: a tournament style single-player game or a grudge match where two players can interact. The matches take place in ten different detailed 3D locations from Springfield, such as the Simpsons' house, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, the Kwik-E-Mart, and Moe's Tavern. Letters float around in the wrestling ring, and if a wrestler collects enough of them, they can taunt and temporarily become invincible. A round ends when one wrestler pins their opponent for a three count. Two rounds are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a match.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

5|$|At the DFL {{endorsement}} convention, Schiff came {{in third}} place behind Mark Andrew and Hodges {{during the first two}} rounds of voting but was denied a place on the third round ballot after failing to meet a minimum vote threshold during round two. When Schiff backed Hodges with the intention, according to the Star Tribune, of preventing Andrew from receiving the 60% of votes <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the endorsement, he lost the support of the Minneapolis Firefighters Union. The convention concluded with no winner and, because no one was endorsed, Schiff stated that he would remain in the race. His campaign manager, Mark Warren, left Schiff's campaign shortly after the convention and a few days later, he declared an end to his bid for mayor and announced that he would campaign actively for Hodges.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were now}} 02 down and <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> three Tests {{in a row}} to retain the Ashes. The {{pressure}} on McCabe increased when last-minute injuries meant {{that he had to}} open the bowling. McCabe made 63 and 22 and took a wicket as Australia won their first match in the series. He then top-scored with 88 in Australia's first innings of 288 and made 55 in the second as Australia won by 148 runs in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to level the series. In the deciding Test at the MCG, McCabe scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in Ashes Tests in Australia. This laid the platform for the innings victory that retained the Ashes. McCabe aggregated 491 runs in five Tests at 54.55, with a century and five fifties in a consistent display.|$|E
5|$|By May 29, {{four days}} before the opening of the convention, trainloads upon trainloads of delegates, lobbyists, reporters, and {{campaign}} followers had arrived at the Union and Dearborn railway stations in Chicago. Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies. Pre-convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources. One, from the Albany Evening Journal, predicted Blaine with 277 votes, Grant with 317, Sherman with 106, and 49 for the other candidates. All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> Many in Chicago knew that a victor, most probably Grant, would only be determined if the unit rule, which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state's delegation, was to be in effect. If that was not the case, then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other.|$|E
