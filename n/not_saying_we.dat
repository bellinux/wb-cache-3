500|$|During {{the first}} half of its first season, Fringe staff and critics noted that the series was still trying to define itself and its characters. The writers worked on {{balancing}} serialized storytelling with standalone plots and had to contend with continuous rewrites and expensive last-minute reshoots. For them, [...] "Safe" [...] marked {{a turning point in the}} series. They turned David Robert Jones into a recurring character and began to give Olivia more of a personal life. Actor Lance Reddick, who portrays Agent Broyles, later explained in an interview how important the episode was to the evolution of the series, [...] "We found who we were in episode 10, the episode where Olivia got kidnapped... We were trying to hedge our bets and trying to be too many kinds of shows at once. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> got rid of the procedural element because each episode still is on a case – a case in terms of the quote-unquote police work — but it's not formulaic, not like the early episodes. What keeps the show most watchable is the fact that it is character-based." ...|$|E

According to Collins, some in the jury felt sympathy for Libby and believed he was only the [...] "fall guy".

2500|$|In 1962 or 1963, Elvis {{managed to}} talk the understandably {{reluctant}} Beaulieus into allowing their teenage daughter {{to live with his}} father, Vernon, and stepmother, Dee Presley, at a home Elvis purchased on Hermitage Drive in Memphis located at the back of Graceland. However, that arrangement lasted only a matter of weeks, Priscilla slipping back and forth between Vernon’s house and Graceland. In her 1985 autobiography, Elvis and Me, written with author Sandra Harmon, Priscilla describes Presley as a very passionate man who was not overtly sexual towards her. According to her account, the singer told her that they had to wait until they were married before having intercourse. He said, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> can't do other things.

2500|$|Bono {{described}} the song's theme as such: [...] "It {{is a song}} about coming together, but it's not the old hippie idea of 'Let's all live together.' It is, in fact, the opposite. It's saying, We are one, but we're not the same. It's <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> even want to get along, but {{that we have to}} get along together in this world if it is to survive. It's a reminder that we have no choice". The Edge described it on one level as a [...] "bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff". On another level, he suggested that the line [...] "we get to carry each other" [...] introduces [...] "grace" [...] to the song and that the wording [...] "get to" [...] (instead of [...] "got to") is essential, as it suggests that it is a privilege to help one another, not an obligation. The band have been told by many fans that they played the song at their weddings, prompting Bono to respond, [...] "Are you mad? It's about splitting up!" [...] There was some speculation that the song described a conversation between a father and his HIV-positive gay son, based on the connection of the song to David Wojnarowicz, a gay artist who died of AIDS.|$|E

"That is {{all true}} enough," [...] Captain Martin agreed; [...] "but our English men have fought {{well on the}} plains of France before now, and I don't believe we should fight worse today. We beat the French when they were ten to one against us over and over, and what our fathers did we can do. What you say about the navy is true also. They have a big fleet, {{and we have no}} vessels worth {{speaking}} about, but we are as good sailors as the Spaniards any day, and as good fighters; and though I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> could stop their fleet if it came sailing up the Thames, I believe when they landed we should show them that we were as good men as they. They might bring seventy thousand soldiers, but there would be seven hundred thousand Englishmen to meet; and if we had but sticks and stones to fight with, they would not find that they would have an easy victory." ...|$|E

I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> can always do this but just as an example of what we can sometimes do. Three weeks ago, we were rung up at 2.30 on a Friday afternoon by one of our clients, Dyson... They rang up and they said look, we've got a huge issue, and that {{is that a lot of}} our products are being completely ripped off in China, to the point where they're not just completely duplicating the product... (The) Chinese government won't take it seriously, it's half past two on a Friday afternoon. On Saturday, the Chinese Prime Minister is coming in for a UK visit - can you please get the UK to raise it?...And I'm pleased to say that on the Saturday, David Cameron raised it with the Chinese Prime Minister and showed him the photos of the products. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>we</b> can do that all the time but that is an illustration of what, if you have the right message - David Cameron, yes he was doing it for Dyson, yes he was doing it because we asked him to do it, he was doing this also because he thought this was also in the UK wider national interest. This was something where there would be a UK proper interest. But in terms of very fast turnaround and getting things done right at the top of government, if you've got the right message, yes, we can do it.|$|E
