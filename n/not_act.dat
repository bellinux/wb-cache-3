Gani did <b>not</b> <b>act</b> in any further films, but instead returned to the nationalist movement. During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–49) he became known as a smuggler, and after independence became a government minister. In November 2007 Gani was made a National Hero of Indonesia. Djoewariah continued to act until the 1950s, when she migrated to theatre after receiving a series of increasingly minor roles.|$|E

However, Rajinikanth could <b>not</b> <b>act</b> in the film due to {{schedule}} conflicts with Padayappa (1999). Hence the role went to Arjun Sarja. Post Anniyan (2005), Shankar decided to take a break before preparing for his next project.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 Walter Long of Gillingham, Dorset {{objected to}} the giant's nudity and {{conducted}} a campaign to either convert it to a simple nude, or to cover its supposed obscenity with a leaf.

The Home Office considered the protest to be in humour, though the chief constable responded to say the office could <b>not</b> <b>act</b> against a protected scheduled monument.|$|E

Soon after al-Mansur Ali's ascendancy rumors of another conspiracy to which an-Nasir Yusuf had an alleged connection emerged. The accused conspirator, al-Mansur Ali's vizier, Sharaf ad-Din al-Fa'izi, was strangled by Egyptian authorities. The Bahri Mamluks in Syria led by Baibars pressured an-Nasir Yusuf to intervene by invading Egypt, but he would <b>not</b> <b>act,</b> fearing the Bahri dynasty would usurp his throne if they gained Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In natural populations, {{genetic drift}} and natural {{selection}} do <b>not</b> <b>act</b> in isolation; both forces are always at play, together with mutation and migration. Neutral evolution {{is the product}} of both mutation and drift, not of drift alone. Similarly, even when selection overwhelms genetic drift, it can only act on variation that mutation provides.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1972, Holt's {{government}} was voted {{out as the}} Labor Party took the majority in Canberra.

Although Whitlam had supported the idea in the past, he now opposed it as prime minister and did <b>not</b> <b>act</b> on Madgwick's request.|$|E

5|$|Richardson {{made his}} {{television}} debut in January 1939, reprising his 1936 stage {{role of the}} chief engineer in Bees on the Boatdeck. His last stage part in the 1930s was Robert Johnson, an Everyman figure, in Priestley's Johnson Over Jordan directed by Basil Dean. It was an experimental piece, using music (by Benjamin Britten) and dance as well as dialogue, and was another production in which Richardson was widely praised but which did not prosper at the box-office. After it closed, in May 1939, he did <b>not</b> <b>act</b> on stage {{for more than five}} years.|$|E
5|$|Temnothorax unifasciatus, a myrmicinid ant, {{has been}} shown not to have {{collective}} worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in egg laying are created by dominance hierarchies. Individuals do <b>not</b> <b>act</b> in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.|$|E

As of 2007, the oldest known American goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old.|$|E

5|$|The court {{eventually}} {{declared that}} they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ.

5|$|The fall of Skra {{prompted}} Bulgarian {{prime minister}} Vasil Radoslavov to resign on 21 June 1918. Aleksandar Malinov who assumed office immediately afterwards pursued secret negotiations with Britain, offering Bulgaria's {{exit from the}} war with the condition that Bulgaria fully retains eastern Macedonia. However, British prime minister David Lloyd George rejected the proposal, assuring the Greek ambassador in London Ioannis Gennadius, that Britain would <b>not</b> <b>act</b> against Greek interests.|$|E
