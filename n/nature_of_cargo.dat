40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract For expression of genes in mammalian cells, various vectors {{have been developed}} using promoters including CMV, EF- 1 a, and CAG promoters and have been widely used. However, such expression vectors sometimes fail to attain sufficient expression levels depending on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> genes and/or on host cell types. In the present study, we aimed to develop a potent promoter system that enables high expression levels of cargo genes ubiquitously in many different cell types. We found that insertion of an additional promoter downstream of a cargo gene greatly enhanced the expression levels. Among the constructs we tested, C-TSC cassette (C: CMV-RU 50 located upstream; TSC: another promoter unit composed of triple tandem promoters, hTERT, SV 40, and CMV, located downstream of the cDNA plus a polyadenylation signal) had the most potent capability, showing far higher effi-ciency than that of potent conventional vector systems.

40|$|The endosomal network {{comprises}} {{a series}} of compartments which co- ordinate sorting and trafficking of internalised cargo. The early endosome sorts internalised cargo by two distinct trafficking pathways, depending the ultimate fate of the cargo. Cargo is either recycled back to the plasma membrane or degraded by lysosomes. Given {{the ability of the}} light microscope (LM) to observe living cells, much of our understanding of the dynamic <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> sorting in the endosomal network has come from observations from the LM. However, in order to fully appreciate the localisation of cargo in the context of its membranous environment requires the resolving power of the electron microscope (EM). The examination of the same area of a biological specimen by both LM and EM can provide more information than the application of either technique alone. In particular correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) combined with high pressure freezing (HPF) allows observation of a live cellular event to be correlated with a high-resolution snapshot of said event, preserved in a near native state. The current system for performing CLEM with HPF as the method of fixation limits the capabilities of live cell imaging. In this thesis I describe modifications to the system that have increased the achievable resolution and sensitivity of fluorescent live cell imaging and also improved the method of cellular relocation. To observe endocytic sorting using CLEM required two novel functionalised ligand probes to represent the differentially sorted cargos epidermal growth factor receptor and transferrin receptor. The validity of these ligand- fluorophore-gold conjugates, with respect to detection by both fluorescence and electron microscopy and their ability to represent the native ligands has been shown here. With the validity of the probes established, the new system was then employed to illustrate how CL EM combined with electron tomography can provide new insights into the sorting events occurring in early endocytic compartments. As a result of this investigation however, it was found that disruption of cells during HPF is a major issue with this system of CLEM that still needs to be resolved. As an additional investigation into endocytic sorting, I have studied the potential role of sorting nexin 15 (SNXI 5) in receptor trafficking. This research has contributed to the characterisation of the SNXI 5, whilst also providing mechanistic details of SNX 15 s role in regulation of receptor degradation. SNX 15 associates with clathrin during clathrin-mediated endocytosis and remains bound to the fully formed vesicles. The characteristic phosphoinositide-binding domain possessed by all SNX proteins means that SNX 15 is also present on early endosomes. The association of SNX 15 with early endocytic compartments potentially facilitates their directional movement via microtubules away from the periphery of the cell allowing compartment maturation and lysosomal fusion to occur.

40|$|Stimuli {{responsive}} polymer assemblies {{have been}} long investigated for drug application {{due to their}} flexibility for surface functionalization to achieve desired interfacial property and capability of acting as a host for payloads encapsulation. These interfacial and host-guest properties are very critical {{and need to be}} customized really depending on <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargos</b> and specific delivery application. More importantly, these properties are always desired to be adaptable in different environments. For instance, adjustable interfacial property can facilitate the carrier to overcome a variety of different barriers before it reach the target while changeable host-guest property allows to selectively releasing the payload in targets. This dissertation mainly focuses on investigating the correlation between these microscopic properties of polymer assembly and the custom-designed polymer structures. Guided by understanding from this structure-property investigation, we aim on manipulating the polymer assembly using rationally designed stimuli-responsiveness as a handle to achieve desirable interfacial and host-guest properties that are potentially useful for specific drug delivery application. We believe the fundamental findings from this dissertation have potential to profoundly impact a broad spectrum of drug delivery fields including multistage delivery (chapter 3), combinational delivery (chapter 4), hydrophobic drug delivery (chapter 2), and biomacromolecule delivery (chapter 5) ...|$|R

Nevertheless, there are also differences: contrary to container services that generally include transshipment in intermediate ports, RoRo services are generally direct services.

To do so, we have built an econometrically based model designed to operate like the ACIM. Two main drivers account for virtually all of the demand: the growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and changes in the fare yield (which is a proxy of the price charged or fare). These differences arise from a combination <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> air <b>cargo</b> demand and the peculiarities <b>of</b> the air <b>cargo</b> market. The net effect of these two factors are that sales <b>of</b> new <b>cargo</b> aircraft are much less sensitive to either increases in GDP or changes in the costs of labor, capital, fuel, materials, and energy associated with the production <b>of</b> new <b>cargo</b> aircraft than the sales of new passenger aircraft.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cyclic heptapeptide cyclo(FΦRRRRQ) (cFΦR 4, where Φ is L- 2 -naphthylalanine) was {{recently}} {{found to be}} efficiently internalized by mammalian cells. In this study, its mechanism of internalization was investigated by perturbing various endocytic events through the introduction of pharmacologic agents and genetic mutations. The results show that cFΦR 4 binds directly to membrane phospholipids, is internalized into human cancer cells through endocytosis, and escapes from early endosomes into the cytoplasm. Its cargo capacity was examined {{with a wide variety}} of molecules, including small-molecule dyes, linear and cyclic peptides of various charged states, and proteins. Depending on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cargos,</b> they may be delivered by endocyclic (insertion <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> into the cFΦR 4 ring), exocyclic (attachment <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> to the Gln side chain), or bicyclic approaches (fusion of cFΦR 4 and cyclic cargo rings). The overall delivery efficiency (i. e., delivery <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> into the cytoplasm and nucleus) of cFΦR 4 was 4 − 12 -fold higher than those of nonaarginine, HIV Tat-derived peptide, or penetratin. The higher delivery efficiency, coupled with superior serum stability, minimal toxicity, and synthetic accessibility, renders cFΦR 4 a useful transporter for intracellular cargo delivery and a suitable system for investigating the mechanism of endosomal escape. The plasma membrane presents a major challenge in drugdiscovery, especially for biologics such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids. One potential strategy for subverting the membrane barrier and delivering the biologics into cells is to attach them to “cell-penetrating peptides...|$|R
