50|$|Born in Stuttgart, Berthold Leibinger {{graduated}} with Abitur(General Certificate of Education) at the Ulrich-von-Hutten Gymnasium in Korntal in 1950. He started an apprenticeship as a mechanic at Trumpf and then studied {{mechanical engineering at}} the Technische Hochschule Stuttgart. After graduating with a Diplom he became a development engineer in 1958 at Cincinnati Milling Machines (today: Milacron) in Cincinnati (USA). In 1961 he returned to Germany and to Trumpf as head of engineering division. In 1968 he developed the first contour <b>nibbling</b> <b>machine</b> tool with numerical control. The owner of the company, Christian Trumpf, having no children, named Leibinger as his successor. Leibinger successively took over shares of the company and served as President from 1978 to 2005. On 18 November 2005, he retired from management and became Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Trumpf Group until the end of 2012.|$|E
50|$|In the 2000s, McVey {{learns that}} an Italian native named Enrico Zanetti {{claims to have}} beaten his score in September 1984, shortly after reading about McVey in the Italian video game magazine, Video Giochi. News footage from an Italian TV station {{demonstrates}} Zanetti breaking the score and the subsequent celebrity he received. While McVey acknowledges that Zanetti may have legitimately beaten him, Day claims that, because no one from Twin Galaxies witnessed the event, Zanetti's score is invalid. Zanetti himself is unfazed, content just {{to know that he}} achieved the score. Nonetheless, McVey decides to beat Zanetti's score and purchases a <b>Nibbler</b> <b>machine</b> of his own.|$|R
50|$|Binary {{arithmetic}} {{and logical}} operations are performed as register-to-register and as memory-to-register/register-to-memory {{as a standard}} feature. If the Commercial Instruction Set option was installed, packed decimal arithmetic could be performed as memory-to-memory with some memory-to-register operations. The Scientific Instruction Set feature, if installed, provided access to four floating point registers that could be programmed for either 32-bit or 64-bit floating point operations. The Models 85 and 195 could also operate on 128-bit extended-precision floating point numbers stored in pairs of floating point registers, and software provided emulation in other models. The System/360 used an 8-bit byte, 32-bit word, 64-bit double-word, and 4-bit <b>nibble.</b> <b>Machine</b> instructions had operators with operands, which could contain register numbers or memory addresses. This complex combination of instruction options resulted {{in a variety of}} instruction lengths and formats.|$|R
5000|$|Nibbler {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first video game to feature a nine-digit scoring system that allowed players to score one billion points. The first to achieve this feat was a seventeen-year-old named Tim McVey, who scored 1,000,042,270 points on January 17, 1984 while playing {{continuously}} for 44 hours over two days at Walter Day's Twin Galaxies arcade in Ottumwa, Iowa. A local news crew arrived to film him on location as he closed in on the record. McVey stated in a 2016 interview that he quit playing on his own accord due to exhaustion after setting the mark. For his achievement, McVey, an Ottumwa native, had the day of January 28, 1984 declared in his honor. [...] He additionally received his own <b>Nibbler</b> <b>machine</b> as a prize, which he later gave to a rival arcade in exchange for two hundred game tokens.|$|R
