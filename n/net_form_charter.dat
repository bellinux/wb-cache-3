40|$|Online {{publication}} September 2016 Pyrenophora teres f. teres (Ptt) causes <b>net</b> <b>form</b> <b>net</b> blotch {{disease of}} barley, partially by producing necrosis-inducing proteins. The protein {{profiles of the}} culture filtrates of 28 virulent isolates were compared {{by a combination of}} 2 DE and 1 D-PAGE with 105 spots and 51 bands chosen for analysis by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 259 individual proteins were identified with 63 of these proteins being common to the selected virulent isolates. Ptt secretes a broad spectrum of proteins including cell wall degrading enzymes; virulence factors and effectors; proteins associated with fungal pathogenesis and development; and proteins related to oxidation–reduction processes. Potential virulence factors and effectors identified included proteins with glucosidase activity, ricin B and concanavalin A-like lectins, glucanases, spherulin, cutinase, pectin lyase, leucine-rich repeat protein, and ceratoplatanin. Small proteins with unknown function but cysteine-rich, common to effectors, were also identified. Differences in the secretion profile of the Ptt isolates have also provided important insight into the different mechanisms contributing to virulence and the development of <b>net</b> <b>form</b> <b>net</b> blotch symptoms.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed spot form of blotch differential set of 16 barley lines was tested for reaction response to 60 Pyrenophora teres f. maculata isolates from geographically disperse barley crops of Australia. Twelve barley lines (Arimont, Barque, Chebec, CI 5286, CI 5791, CI 9214, CII 6150, Dairokkaku, Esperance Orge 289, Galleon, Keel, Skiff, Torrens and TR 250) provided differential response between the isolates. The susceptible controls Gairdner and Kombar provided indication of isolate virulence or avirulence. Abundant pathogenic diversity was revealed with 33 designated pathotypes, {{some of which}} related to geographic region. AFLP analysis also revealed abundant diversity {{with each of the}} isolates representing a unique genotype and one isolate that contained both AFLP bands unique to P. teres f. maculata and P. teres f. teres, the cause of spot <b>form</b> and <b>net</b> <b>form</b> of <b>net</b> blotch respectively, suggesting that sexual recombination between the <b>net</b> <b>form</b> and spot form isolates may have occurred naturally in the field. ...|$|R

50|$|While it was {{originally}} proposed that <b>NETs</b> would be <b>formed</b> in tissues at a site of bacterial/yeast infection, NETs have {{also been shown to}} form within blood vessels during sepsis (specifically in the lung capillaries and liver sinusoids). Intra-vascular NET formation is tightly controlled and is regulated by platelets, which sense severe infection via platelet TLR4 and then bind to and activate neutrophils to <b>form</b> <b>NETs.</b> Platelet-induced NET formation occurs very rapidly (in minutes) and may or may not result in death of the neutrophils. <b>NETs</b> <b>formed</b> in blood vessels can catch circulating bacteria as they pass through the vessels. Trapping of bacteria under flow has been imaged directly in flow chambers in vitro and intravital microscopy demonstrated that bacterial trapping occurs in the liver sinusoids and lung capillaries (sites where platelets bind neutrophils).|$|R
