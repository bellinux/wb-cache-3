5|$|Body {{tissue samples}} from Eurasian sparrowhawks are still {{analysed}} {{as part of}} the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme conducted by the UK government's Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Although the average liver concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Eurasian sparrowhawks were lower in birds that died in 2005 compared to those that died in 2004, there was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> or consistent decline in residues between 2000–2005.|$|E
5|$|The new CSG International grew quickly. The {{convergence}} of phone, internet, on-demand movies, {{and other services}} created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG. Professional services and international clients, which were previously <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> portion of revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|With the {{progress}} of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced. The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> factor in the overall decline among Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.|$|E

5|$|Balzac wrote Louis Lambert {{during the}} summer of 1832 while he was staying with friends at the Château de Saché, and {{published}} three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> example of the realist style for which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author's own childhood. Specific details and events from the author's life – including punishment from teachers and social ostracism – suggest a fictionalized autobiography.|$|E
5|$|During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci {{noted that}} during the camera survey of the {{equipment}} in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate {{as much as possible}} during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, but it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> concern.|$|E

Some years earlier, Harding had had his front porch remodeled to {{resemble}} McKinley's, which his neighbors felt signified presidential ambitions. The candidate remained at home in Marion and gave addresses to visiting delegations. In the meantime, Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation, giving hundreds of speeches. Coolidge spoke in the Northeast, {{later on in the}} South, and was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> factor in the election.|$|E

Nests are also raided by crows, Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies. Predation {{accounted for more than}} 60% of nest failures in a 2012 survey in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Quantum Break was {{developed}} by Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Studios. In 2010, the company released Alan Wake, another title published by Microsoft. The game received high critical praise but was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> commercial success for either company. Remedy intended to develop a sequel to Alan Wake {{after the release of}} the first game, and hoped to include live action elements into the game. The concept was pitched to Microsoft, who showed no interest in publishing another Alan Wake game and wanted to diversify their games lineup.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{commercial}} success but received widespread critical praise {{and has since}} become a cult classic. It was lauded for its immersive dialogue, for the dark and relatively obscure Planescape setting, and for the protagonist's unique persona, which shirked many characteristics of traditional role-playing games. It was considered by video game journalists {{to be the best}} role-playing game of 1999, and continues to receive attention long after its release, with a source port version of Torment released on April 11, 2017 by Beamdog.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} misconception, the Church {{was not in}} a {{struggle}} for its existence during its first centuries, before its adoption by the Roman Empire as its national religion.
