50|$|While the {{underlying}} protocols and technologies are different, both MPLS and ATM provide a connection-oriented service for transporting data across computer networks. In both technologies, connections are signaled between endpoints, connection state is maintained at each node in the path, and encapsulation techniques {{are used to}} carry data across the connection. Excluding differences in the signaling protocols (RSVP/LDP for MPLS and PNNI:Private <b>Network-to-Network</b> <b>Interface</b> for ATM) there still remain {{significant differences in the}} behavior of the technologies.|$|R
50|$|The two {{different}} flavors of data path {{give rise to}} two slightly different versions of this protocol. One (SPBM) is intended where complete isolation of many separate instances of client LANs and their associated device MAC addresses is desired, and it therefore uses a full encapsulation (MAC-in-MAC a.k.a. IEEE 802.1ah). The other (SPBV) is intended where such isolation of client device MAC addresses is not necessary, and it reuses only the existing VLAN tag a.k.a. IEEE 802.1Q on participating <b>network-to-network</b> <b>interface</b> (NNI) links.|$|R
5000|$|ATM {{switches}} have link-level forwarding tables {{much like}} those used in frame relay. Rather than a DLCI, however, interfaces have forwarding tables that specify the outgoing interface, virtual path identifier, and virtual circuit identifier. These tables may be configured statically, or they can be distributed by the private <b>network-to-network</b> <b>interface</b> (PNNI) protocol. When PNNI is in use, the ATM switches {{at the edges of}} the ATM [...] "cloud" [...] will map one of the standard ATM end-to-end identifiers, such as an NSAP, to the next-hop VPI/VCI.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a novel end-to-end seamless framework to support end-to-end Quality of Service and Traffic Engineering. The network model {{is based on}} the MPLS/DiffServ paradigm and addresses the definition of a network architecture according to both users and network providers requirements. A first solution relies on the centralized MPLS/DiffServ based Multi-protocol Access Inter-Domain (MAID) architecture. This architecture allows a seamless QoS-IP service setup through proper Users-Network Interfaces and inter-domain communication through <b>Network-to-Network</b> <b>Interfaces.</b> A fully distributed solution is also presented to address critical scalability issues and to improve network resilience. The overall architecture has been validated by means of functional tests carried out on operational testbeds based on Linux PC platforms. ...|$|R

50|$|To {{maintain}} network performance, networks {{may apply}} traffic policing to virtual circuits to limit {{them to their}} traffic contracts at the entry points to the network, i.e. the user-network <b>interfaces</b> (UNIs) and <b>network-to-network</b> <b>interfaces</b> (NNIs): Usage/Network Parameter Control (UPC and NPC). The reference model given by the ITU-T and ATM Forum for UPC and NPC is the generic cell rate algorithm (GCRA), which is {{a version of the}} leaky bucket algorithm. CBR traffic will normally be policed to a PCR and CDVt alone, whereas VBR traffic will normally be policed using a dual leaky bucket controller to a PCR and CDVt and an SCR and Maximum Burst Size (MBS). The MBS will normally be the packet (SAR-SDU) size for the VBR VC in cells.|$|R
40|$|ATM PNNI (Private <b>Network-to-Network</b> <b>Interface)</b> is a {{hierarchical}} and dynamic link-state routing protocol, designed to scale {{to the largest}} possible ATM networks, encompassing thousands of nodes. The paper investigates the route computation load imposed by the PNNI routing scheme, and shows that this load is unevenly distributed among the network nodes. More specifically, the routing computation load associated with the set up of a single VC grows exponentially with the hierarchy level. As a result, some of the network nodes [...] mainly those that function as border nodes of high levels [...] may be overloaded with route computation, while other nodes are rarely involved in this process. The paper also proposes a possible scheme for spreading the route computation burden more evenly. According to this scheme, heavily loaded nodes transfer route computation tasks to lightly loaded nodes. 0...|$|R

Shortest Path Bridging virtual {{local area network}} {{identifier}} (VLAN ID) or Shortest Path Bridging VID or (SPBV) provides capability that is backwards compatible with spanning tree technologies.

SPB (the generic term for both) combines an Ethernet data path (either IEEE 802.1Q in the case of SPBV, or Provider Backbone Bridges (PBBs) IEEE 802.1ah in the case of SPBM) with an IS-IS link state control protocol running between Shortest Path bridges (<b>network-to-network</b> <b>interface</b> (NNI) links).

40|$|Abstract and Executive Summary <b>Network-to-Network</b> <b>Interface</b> (NNI) defines how two {{networks}} interconnect {{and exchange}} information. QoS over NNI interconnect {{is important for}} optimal network utilizations and for delivering high quality services economically. Traditionally, carriers have {{addressed the issue of}} QoS by over-provisioning of their networks. That could possibly be managed for networks carrying VoIP traffic only. However, with the increasing volume of TDM traffic being migrated to IP based networks, and with the increasing uptake of IP based multimedia services; it will not be possible to dimension networks to meet all peak bursty traffic requirements effectively. Hence, QoS over NNI is an important topic of study in major Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and an issue that must be addressed prior to widescale NGN deployment. Issues related to QoS over NNI are being debated actively in various industry SDOs/fora. This paper provides an overview of the current ongoing work in the industry regarding QOS over the NNI and discusses the similarities and differences between the different organisations...|$|R
