The other six are <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan,</b> Tom Seaver, Mike Scott, Dwight Gooden, Hideo Nomo and David Cone. The New York Mets, at the time of Humber's perfect game, had never had a no-hitter thrown by a player in the 50-year history of the {{franchise}} (Johan Santana has since accomplished this feat).|$|E
5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} major league pitcher to pitch four no-hitters and the eighth pitcher to pitch a perfect game in {{baseball}} history. Despite his comparatively short career, Koufax's 2,396 career strikeouts ranked 7th in history as of his retirement, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers. Koufax, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, and <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan</b> are the only four pitchers elected to the Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched.|$|E

5000|$|Following a 5-1 defeat by Liverpool on 28 December, Kinnear re-affirmed {{his belief}} that the Newcastle squad lacked {{strength}} in depth - with the manager having fielded a makeshift side due to injuries and suspensions resulting from the 2-1 Boxing Day defeat by Wigan Athletic - and stated {{that he was looking}} to improve the side with transfers in the January window.In January, Kinnear secured the signings of Peter Løvenkrands, Kevin <b>Nolan</b> and <b>Ryan</b> Taylor. The latter had been signed in a part exchanged deal with Charles N'Zogbia. N'Zogbia had frequently stated in the press, via his agent, that he wished to leave. The final straw came after Kinnear mispronounced N'Zogbia's name during an interview in which he called him [...] "insomnia". N'Zogbia stated that he no longer wished to play for Newcastle as long as Kinnear was the manager. Shay Given was also sold to Manchester City for £7m.|$|R
5|$|On July 12 and September 28, 1951, Reynolds threw no-hitters. He was {{the first}} American League pitcher to throw two no-hitters in a season and only the second player {{to do so in}} {{baseball}} history, after Johnny Vander Meer threw consecutive no-hitters in 1938. This is still the MLB record for most no-hitters in a single season, a record that Reynolds and Vander Meer share with Virgil Trucks (1952), <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan</b> (1973), Roy Halladay (2010), and Max Scherzer (2015).|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 1965, Koufax {{became the}} sixth pitcher {{of the modern}} era, and eighth overall, to throw a perfect game, the first by a {{left-hander}} since 1880. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, setting a Major League record (subsequently broken by <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan).</b> Koufax struck out 14 batters, {{at the time the}} most recorded in a perfect game (now tied by Matt Cain). The game also featured a quality performance by the opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley of the Cubs. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning.|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnati Reds won the West {{division}} {{the previous}} {{season with the}} Astros finishing 1.5 games back in second, and the Dodgers 11.5 back in third. However, the Reds went on to lose the 1979 NLCS in three games to the Pittsburgh Pirates, ending their season. The Astros acquired Joe Morgan and <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan</b> via free agency during the offseason and the Dodgers signed Dave Goltz. Dave Kindred of the Washington Post, George Vecsey of The New York Times, and Astros' relief pitcher Joe Sambito all credited Morgan's leadership with the Astros' success in 1980.|$|E
40|$|Two {{similarly}} managed {{trials were}} conducted to investigate serial ultrasound measures of body composition (longissimus muscle area (ULMA), 12 th - rib fat thickness (UFAT), and percentage of intramuscular fat (UIMF)) early {{in the lives of}} feeder calves as they compared to carcass traits. Group 1 cattle were Charolais-sired by Brahman-British crossbred dams whereas Group 2 cattle were purebred Beefmaster. Both groups were fed at the same commercial feedlot (Graham Land and Cattle Co.) in Gonzales, Texas. In both data sets classifications were developed for ribeye area of Lower (less than 70. 95 cm 2, Middle (between 70. 95 cm 2 and 90. 3 cm 2) and Upper (over 90. 3 cm 2) based on a range that fit within the ribeye specifications of such branded beef programs as Certified Angus Beef and <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan?s</b> Tender Aged Beef. Differences among ribeye area and quality grade (Choice vs. Select) categories were evaluated for ultrasound and carcass traits. As reported previously, correlations between ultrasound measures and carcass traits became larger at times closer to harvest. In both sets of cattle, there were no differences in fat thickness or intramuscular fat at the ultrasound scan sessions or in these carcass traits due to ribeye area category. The same trend for quality grade classification was not seen across both groups of cattle however. In Group 1, there were no differences in early measures of body composition between carcass quality grade classes except for ultrasound fat thickness at weaning. However, in Group 2 cattle there were differences in ultrasound fat at times 1 and 2, IMF at time 1, and ribeye area at time 2 between cattle that graded choice verses those that graded select. Correlations between ultrasound measures of REA (r of. 26 to. 50) and ultrasound REA and carcass REA (r of. 16 to. 81) appeared to be lower in Group 1 vs. Group 2 (r of. 55, and. 64 to 81 respectively). Results from this project imply that changes in ribeye area will not automatically result in changes of marbling and vice versa. Furthermore, these results also show that ultrasound is useful to help predict beef carcass traits, but that early measures of body composition used alone do not explain {{a large portion of the}} variation in the carcass measures and specific methods should be developed by different biological cattle types...|$|R

40|$|Comparison {{of three}} auto-adjusting {{positive}} pressure devices {{in patients with}} sleep apnoea G. M. <b>Nolan,</b> S. <b>Ryan,</b> T. M. O’Connor and W. T. McNicholas ABSTRACT: Auto-adjustable continuous positive airway pressure (APAP) devices are an emerging treatment alternative to fixed-pressure continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. They have been engineered to automatically adjust the pressure to the optimal level on a continuous basis. However, not all APAP technologies use the same algorithm. Three different APAP devices (Autoset Spirit, Breas PV 10 i and RemStar Auto) were compared in a randomised crossover trial in patients already established on fixed-pressure CPAP therapy. The outcome measures were compliance, {{quality of life and}} side-effects. Twenty-seven middle-aged patients (25 male) previously diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (median (interquartile range) apnoea/hypopnoea index 48 (29 – 76)), established on CPAP therapy for. 3 yrs, were randomised to each APAP device for 4 weeks. Mean pressure and patient compliance were significantly lower on the Breas PV 10 i than on the other APAP devices. The devices were similar in terms of quality of life, daytime sleepiness and upper airway side-effects, but patients evaluated them significantly differently in terms of device features, sleep quality and pressure comfort, with the Breas PV 10 i being the least popular. Auto-adjustable positive airway pressure devices differ in pressure delivery and patient compliance in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients...|$|R
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have accomplished this feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan,</b> Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E
5|$|First {{base was}} the highest paid {{position}} in 2010; regular starters at that position earned an average salary of $9,504,165 in compared to an overall average of $3,014,572. Pitcher <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan</b> was {{the first player to}} earn an annual salary above $1 million, signing a $4.5 million, 4-year contract with the Houston Astros in 1979. Kirby Puckett and Rickey Henderson signed the first contracts which paid an average of $3 million a year in November 1989, while 2010 was the first season where the MLB average salary rose above that same mark. Five of the twenty highest paid players in 2013 were members of the Yankees. Their team payroll for 2013 was $228,835,490, roughly $12 million above the second-largest Los Angeles Dodgers. The Yankees have drawn criticism for their payroll, with some claiming it undermines the parity of MLB.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} {{complain}} {{of pain in}} his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan</b> broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The longest {{interval}} between Yankees no-hitters {{was between the}} game pitched by Larsen on October 8, 1956 and Dave Righetti's no hitter on July 4, 1983, encompassing 26 years, 8 months, and 26 days. The shortest gap between such games fell between Allie Reynolds' two no-hitters in 1951, a gap of just 2 months and 16 days from July 12 till September 28. Reynolds is the only Yankees pitcher to throw multiple no-hitters in his career, and one of only six pitchers in Major League history to throw multiple no-hitters in a season along with Max Scherzer in 2015, Roy Halladay in 2010, <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan</b> in 1973, Virgil Trucks in 1952, and Johnny Vander Meer in 1938. The Red Sox and the Cleveland Indians have been no-hit by the Yankees {{more than any other}} franchise, each doing so three times. Notably, Reynolds' two no-hit victims in 1951 were the Red Sox and the Indians.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball {{recognizes the}} player or players in each league {{with the most}} strikeouts each season. Jim Devlin led the National League in its inaugural season of 1876; he threw 122 strikeouts for the Louisville Grays. The American League's first winner was Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who {{captured}} the American League Triple Crown in 1901 by striking out 158 batters, along with leading the league in wins and earned run average. Walter Johnson led the American League in strikeouts 12 times during his Hall of Fame career, most among all players. He is followed by <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan,</b> who captured 11 titles between both leagues (9 American League and 2 National League). Randy Johnson won nine strikeout titles, including five with his home state Arizona Diamondbacks. Three players have won seven strikeout championships: Dazzy Vance, who leads the National League; Bob Feller; and Lefty Grove. Grover Cleveland Alexander and Rube Waddell led their league six times, and five-time winners include Steve Carlton, Roger Clemens, Sam McDowell, Christy Mathewson, Amos Rusie, and Tom Seaver.|$|E
5|$|Only three pitchers, Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Early Wynn, {{joined the}} 300win club between 1924 and 1982, {{which may be}} {{explained}} by a number of factors: the abolition of the spitball, World WarII military service, such as Bob Feller's, and the growing importance of the home run in the game. As the home run became commonplace, the physical and mental demands on pitchers dramatically increased, which led to the use of a four-man starting rotation. Between 1982 and 1990, the 300win club gained six members: Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Steve Carlton, <b>Nolan</b> <b>Ryan,</b> Don Sutton and Tom Seaver. These pitchers benefited from the increased use of specialized relief pitchers, an expanded strike zone, and new stadiums, including Shea Stadium, Dodger Stadium and the Astrodome, that were pitcher's parks, which suppressed offensive production. Also, the increasing sophistication of training methods and sports medicine, such as Tommy John surgery, allowed players to maintain a high competitive level for a longer time. Randy Johnson, for example, won more games in his 40s than he did in his 20s.|$|E
