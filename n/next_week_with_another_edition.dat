5000|$|... 10/8/2011 - After last week's loss, USF {{had another}} {{difficult}} opponent in Walsh. Formerly a MSFA conference meeting, {{the game was}} a non-league contest this year due to the transition of Walsh from the NAIA to NCAA-II football. The game was won in the 2nd overtime period when USF scored and converted the extra point kick after a missed extra point effort by Walsh. The game was highlighted by USF redshirt freshman Antoin Campbell, who set a new Cougar record by scoring 5 touchdowns in the game. For the week's effort, the Cougars moved up one spot in the national rankings to 6th. The tough opponents continue <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> conference game, Homecoming Week against Marian, the nation's #2 ranked team.|$|R
5000|$|Iowa {{opened the}} 2000 season with five {{straight}} losses, adding to a losing streak that totaled 13 games when the Hawkeyes lost to Indiana on September 30, 2000. However, the streak {{came to an}} end a week later, when the Hawks defeated Michigan State, 21-16, giving Ferentz his first ever Big Ten win as head coach at Iowa. [...] Following a three-game losing streak, the Hawkeyes traveled to State College, Pennsylvania, for a game against Penn State. The Hawks won the game, 26-23, and followed it up the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> win, this time over Northwestern. The 27-17 victory gave Iowa a two-game winning streak, something that had not occurred for the Hawkeyes since the 1997 season. [...] Iowa finished the season with a 27-24 loss on November 18, 2000, against Minnesota.|$|R
5000|$|Matt Kenseth led {{the field}} to the green flag at 2:16 p.m. Erik Jones made contact with Kasey Kahne exiting Turn 2 on the first lap, leading to a left-front tire cut and {{slamming}} the wall on the seventh lap in Turn 3, bringing out the first caution of the race. Jones, after being released from the infield care center, said he and Kahne, were [...] "three-wide right on the start and then the 5 ran us up into the fence. I {{was trying not to}} wreck everybody and then a couple laps later the GameStop Prey Toyota Camry cut a left-front tire. It’s just really a heartbreaking day. It’s not what we wanted, but we’ll just have to come back <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> fast race car and try to run up front again.” He went on to finish last.|$|R

50|$|November 11 and November 19, 2006 - After the Week 4 loss to NE in the 2006 - 07 NFL season, the Bengals' offense {{appeared}} to be out-of-sync and inconsistent. Chad Johnson was relegated to having games of less than 4 catches. There were key injuries to the offensive line. The defenses' propensity for getting turnovers were getting less than one every game. The Bengals faced off against the San Diego Chargers in Week 9 followed by the New Orleans Saints in Week 10 and {{appeared to}} have regained the previous year's character. Although the San Diego game ended with the Bengals losing 49 - 41, the seemingly dormant Cincinnati offense came to life that day. Carson Palmer threw a career-high 440 yards and Chad Johnson had a career-high and Bengal record 260 yard day. They followed up the <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> explosive game where Chad caught another 190 yards breaking the record for most yards in two consecutive games for 450 yards total, as Cincinnati won over the Saints 31 - 16.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 42 laps to go. The seventh caution of {{the race}} flew with 41 laps {{to go for a}} multi-car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, Johnson made contact with the rear-end of Austin Dillon and sent him sliding into the wall. Dillon overcorrected and hit the outside wall with the right-front of his car. His car turned down the track, was clipped by Ricky Stenhouse Jr., slid down and tapped the inside wall. With a number of cars trying to avoid the spinning No. 3 car, an accordion-effect led to more cars being caught up in the melee. A total of 13 cars sustained damage in the wreck. Dillon said afterwards that being on older tires, he [...] "was trying to get all I could there. It’s part of trying to win a race. We put ourselves in a position to be out front, thinking that two laps wouldn’t mean much, but it did. That’s part of it. The good Lord kept me safe tonight and gave me a good race car. You have to be gracious in defeat. We’ll come back <b>next</b> <b>week</b> <b>with</b> <b>another</b> fast car and hopefully we can do the same thing we did today, and that’s run up front." ...|$|R
