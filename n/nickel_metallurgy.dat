40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effects of environmental pollution with heavy metals from ferro-nickel smelter on Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase (ALAD) activity, and to analyze the blood lead level of feral pigeon (Columba livia) in ferro-nickel smelter courtyard in Drenas City, Republic of Kosovo. For this purpose, twenty specimens of feral pigeon (20 birds, males and females), were collected in Drenas city which were living in ferro-nickel smelter courtyard, and 20 specimens in Lubizhdë village as control group (non-contaminated area). ALAD activity in Drenas group was significantly inhibited (P 0. 050) and positive in Lubizhdë group (r= 0. 452; P> 0. 050), but not in {{significant difference between the}} input groups. Feral pigeons can play an important role as bioindicators, which can used to monitor the environmental pollution with heavy metals that may originate from <b>Nickel</b> <b>metallurgy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nickel {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the environment. High consumption of nickel containing products inevitably leads to environmental pollution by nickel and its derivatives at all stages of production, utilization, and disposal. Human exposure to nickel occurs primarily via inhalation and ingestion and is particularly high among <b>nickel</b> <b>metallurgy</b> workers. In addition, implantation of nickel-containing endoprostheses and iatrogenic administration of nickel-contaminated medica-tions leads to significant parenteral exposures. Exposure to nickel compounds can produce a variety of adverse effects on human health. Nickel allergy {{in the form of}} contact dermatitis is the most common reaction. A frontal headache, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, and irritability are the most common signs of acute poisoning with nickel compounds. The respiratory tract, kidneys and liver suffer the most significant changes like nickel pneumoconiosis, chronic rhinitis and sinonasal tumors and transitory nephropathy. Although the accumulation of nickel in the body through chronic exposure can lead to lung fibrosis, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, the most serious concerns relate to nickel’s carcinogenic activity. Nickel compounds are carcinogenic to humans and metallic nickel is possibly carcinogenic to humans...|$|E

The behaviour of alloy N – 18 is modelled by classical constitutive equations involving plasticity and creep. The experimental data used include stress relaxation and creep tests. An updated version of the first model is proposed and compared to the experimental data set. A new model is also presented with equations based on physical concepts.

40|$|Demand for nickel is {{constantly}} growing {{due to the}} versatility of its application, at the first place for stainless steel production. Ore reserves and possibility of nickel production of today’s Serbia and in neighboring countries were thoroughly investigated, and presented work {{is part of a}} wider project of sublimation of scientific and professional experience in the field of <b>nickel</b> extractive <b>metallurgy</b> on domestic raw materials. Presented research explores the possibility of high pressure sulfuric acid leaching of Serbian lateritic ores from localities Rudjinci, Ba and Lipovac. All three investigated ore deposits behaved differently both during preparation and during hydrometallurgical treatment. As optimal method for ore preparation proved to be crushing-milling-sieving route, but without possibility of concentrate production. Only for Rudjinci ore deposit achieved leaching efficiency reached satisfactory level of 95 %. Within presented paper flow-sheet is proposed for processing high-magnesium laterite ores, with iron and magnesium oxide Both could be recirculated and used again in technological process; MgO for iron precipitation and SO 2 for production of leaching agent, sulfuric acid. Final decision on the sustainability of the process will be made according to techno-economic and environmental evaluation. Estimated overall impact of the project implementation on the environment is negative...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{lifetime}} to initiate an engineering crack in a component is usually predicted from Coffin-Manson curves using smooth specimens for low-cycle fatigue. However this procedure {{has to be}} examined carefully when cracks initiate from defects, such as inclusions or pores that are inherited from the manufacturing process. A special methodology has been developed for defects occurring in turbine discs made from powder <b>metallurgy</b> <b>nickel</b> base superalloys [1 - 3]. A probabilistic life prediction model was so built combining measurements {{of the distribution of}} defect size and a simple fracture mechanics approach to assess small crack growth, as done by Murakami [4] for high cycle fatigue. A key issue is to know whether defects should be considered as cracks of equivalent area. The investigation carried out in [1] has shown that this approximation was effective in describing fatigue life under small scale yielding...|$|R
40|$|This lecture {{will focus}} on new {{techniques}} for the testing of very small objects belonging to various areas, for example carbon and tungsten sulfide nanotubes in the composites area, <b>Nickel</b> micropillars in <b>metallurgy,</b> and hair cilia and dentin pillars in biology. Some of our recent experimental and theoretical results regarding materials mechanics at the nanoscale will be reviewed. The main theme includes carbon and tungsten sulfide nanotubes, and nanotube-based composite materials. Such developments still present, however, enormous practical challenges, in particular: (1) when attempting to probe the properties of individual nanotubes, for which most –but not all-studies consist of computer simulations, and (2) when attempting to optimize the mechanical properties of nanocomposites, especially biological nanocomposites. The principle and potential use of nanotubes as sensors in composite structures is also briefly outlined. We report here our most recent laboratory results regarding polymer-nanotube composite mechanics, including interfacial adhesion and toughness issues, as well a...|$|R
40|$|The {{durability}} of powder <b>metallurgy</b> <b>nickel</b> base superalloys employed as compressor and turbine disks is often limited by {{low cycle fatigue}} (LCF) crack initiation and crack growth from highly stressed surface locations (corners, holes, etc.). Crack growth induced by dwells at high stresses during aerospace engine operation can be particularly severe. Supersolvus solution heat treatments {{can be used to}} produce coarse grain sizes approaching ASTM 6 for improved resistance to dwell fatigue crack growth. However, the coarse grain sizes reduce yield strength, which can lower LCF initiation life. These high temperature heat treatments also can encourage pores to form. In the advanced General Electric disk superalloy KM 4, such pores can initiate fatigue cracks that limit LCF initiation life. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) during the supersolvus solution heat treatment has been shown to improve LCF initiation life in KM 4, as the HIP pressure minimizes formation of the pores. Reduction of boron levels in KM 4 has also been shown to increase LCF initiation life after a conventional supersolvus heat treatment, again possibly due to effects on the formation tendencies of these pores. However, the effects of reduced boron levels on microstructure, pore characteristics, and LCF failure modes in KM 4 still need to be fully quantified. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of boron level on the microstructure, porosity, LCF behavior, and failure modes of supersolvus heat treated KM 4...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech (<b>Metallurgy)</b> <b>Nickel</b> in South Africa is scarce. Other {{than as a}} {{by-product}} from platinum mining, its only source is the Uitkomst Complex, a satelite of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, located between Machadodorp and Barberton and mined by Nkomati Nickel. Pentlandite occurs as the main nickel-bearing mineral, disseminated within a sulfide matrix of pyrrhotite, pyrite and chalcopyrite. Accessories are of chromite and platinum in solid solution with the sulfides. The sulfides are hosted in mainly ultramafic rocks. The presence of talc is of particular nuisance. Head grade is in the decline, from earlier 0. 7 to more recently 0. 3 % or even lower. Standard froth flotation yields a concentrate of 7 – 9 % nickel at a recovery of up to 70 %. A higher nickel recovery from such low – grade feed stock would be desirable. To achieve these two methods were investigated and reported in the following:  Non-oxidative leaching {{as an alternative to}} flotation, using strong hydrochloric and sulfuric acid and also aqueous ammonia solutions at various liquid-to-solid ratios. Only the degree of nickel dissolution over time at room temperature was studied and no attempt was made to recover the dissolved metal from solution.  Froth flotation after pre-treatment with microwaves at various power levels and over various periods of time of irradiation. It was surmised that a certain amount of inter-granular cracking could thus be achieved that would improve the flotation behavior in respect of grade and recovery. An extensive literature study, in particular, of the nature of microwaves, their interaction with matter and possible metallurgical benefits derived as a consequence of such interaction, forms part of the investigation and is reported in detail. A lot of theoretical and experimental work has been done in this respect, although the obtained results were not conclusive...|$|R
40|$|Hot forming {{processes}} such as forging, {{die casting}} and glass forming require tooling that is subjected to high temperatures during the manufacturing of components. Current tooling is adversely affected by prolonged exposure at high temperatures. Initial studies were conducted to determine {{the root cause of}} tool failures in a number of applications. Results show that tool failures vary and depend on the operating environment under which they are used. Major root cause failures include (1) thermal softening, (2) fatigue and (3) tool erosion, all of which are affected by process boundary conditions such as lubrication, cooling, process speed, etc. While thermal management is a key to addressing tooling failures, it was clear that new tooling materials with superior high temperature strength could provide improved manufacturing efficiencies. These efficiencies are based on the use of functionally graded materials (FGM), a new subset of hybrid tools with customizable properties that can be fabricated using advanced powder metallurgy manufacturing technologies. Modeling studies of the various hot forming processes helped identify the effect of key variables such as stress, temperature and cooling rate and aid in the selection of tooling materials for specific applications. To address the problem of high temperature strength, several advanced powder <b>metallurgy</b> <b>nickel</b> and cobalt based alloys were selected for evaluation. These materials were manufactured into tooling using two relatively new consolidation processes. One process involved laser powder deposition (LPD) and the second involved a solid state dynamic powder consolidation (SSDPC) process. These processes made possible functionally graded materials (FGM) that resulted in shaped tooling that was monolithic, bi-metallic or substrate coated. Manufacturing of tooling with these processes was determined to be robust and consistent for a variety of materials. Prototype and production testing of FGM tooling showed the benefits of the nickel and cobalt based powder metallurgy alloys in a number of applications evaluated. Improvements in tool life ranged from three (3) to twenty (20) or more times than currently used tooling. Improvements were most dramatic where tool softening and deformation were the major cause of tool failures in hot/warm forging applications. Significant improvement was also noted in erosion of aluminum die casting tooling. Cost and energy savings can be realized as a result of increased tooling life, increased productivity and a reduction in scrap because of improved dimensional controls. Although LPD and SSDPC tooling usually have higher acquisition costs, net tooling costs per component produced drops dramatically with superior tool performance. Less energy is used to manufacture the tooling because fewer tools are required and less recycling of used tools are needed for the hot forming process. Energy is saved during the component manufacturing cycle because more parts can be produced in shorter periods of time. Energy is also saved by minimizing heating furnace idling time because of less downtime for tooling changes...|$|R
