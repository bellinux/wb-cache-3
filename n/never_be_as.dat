25|$|When Assad took power, Syria was isolated; {{planning}} {{an attack on}} Israel, he sought allies and war material. Ten weeks after gaining power, Assad visited the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership was wary of supplying the Syrian government, viewing Assad's rise to power with reserve and believing him to lean further West than Jadid did. While he soon understood that the Soviet relationship with the Arabs would <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> deep as the United States' relationship with Israel, he needed its weapons. Unlike his predecessors (who tried to win Soviet support with socialist policies), Assad {{was willing to give}} the Soviets a stable presence in the Middle East through Syria, access to Syrian naval bases (giving them a role in the peace process) and help in curtailing American influence in the region. The Soviets responded by sending arms to Syria. The new relationship bore fruit, and between February 1971 and October 1973 Assad met several times with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.|$|E

500|$|Singer and Sigel {{credited}} Road to Perdition as {{a visual}} influence. Though Sigel shot the first X-Men in anamorphic format, he opted to shoot X2 in Super 35. Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses, even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally. Sigel noted, [...] "If you think about it, every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it. They'll <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> good as the spherical lenses that they emulate." [...] Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL, {{as well as an}} Aaton 35mm. Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films, while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments.|$|E

It produced a film, Waters of Destiny, characterized by author Michael Grunwald as propaganda, that likened nature to a villainous, shrieking force of rage and declared the C's mission was to tame nature and make the Everglades useful. Everglades National Park management and Marjory Stoneman Douglas initially supported the C, as it promised to maintain the Everglades and manage the water responsibly. However, an early report by the project reflected local attitudes about the Everglades as a priority to people in nearby developed areas: [...] "The aesthetic appeal of the Park can <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> strong as the demands of home and livelihood.

500|$|Writers such as Robert A. W.

Moorcock wrote an essay entitled [...] "Starship Stormtroopers" [...] in which he attacked Heinlein and other writers over similar [...] "Utopian fiction". Lowndes accused Heinlein of using straw man arguments, [...] "countering ingenuous half-truths with brilliant half-truths". Lowndes further argued that the Terran Federation could <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> idealistic as Heinlein portrays it to be because he never properly addressed [...] "whether or not [...] have at least as full a measure of civil redress against official injustice as we have today". Farmer also agreed, arguing that a [...] "world ruled by veterans would be as mismanaged, graft-ridden, and insane as one ruled by men who had never gotten near the odor of blood and guts".|$|E
500|$|In January 1937, First Division club Everton paid Burnley £6,500 {{to secure}} Lawton's services, and also gave his {{grandfather}} {{a job as}} deputy groundsman at Goodison Park; the fee was a record for a player under 21. The move to Everton made him a teammate of Dixie Dean, his boyhood idol, who {{he was expected to}} gradually replace as first choice centre-forward. He later recalled that on his way to Goodison Park on his first day as an Everton player he was told by a tram conductor that [...] "You're that young Lawton, aren't you? You'll <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> good as Dixie." [...] Dean was finally rested on 13 February, which allowed Lawton to make his first team debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux; the match ended in a 6–2 defeat, though Lawton scored a penalty. He {{spent the rest of the}} season at inside-left, with Dean at centre-forward, and ended the 1936–37 campaign with four goals in 11 games. He started the 1937–38 season in the Reserves, but was installed as first choice centre-forward in September after Dean was dropped for punching club secretary Theo Kelly. On 2 October, Lawton scored the winning penalty in a 2–1 victory over Merseyside derby rivals Liverpool at Anfield. He ended the campaign with 28 goals in 39 appearances to become the division's top-scorer.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club called the episode {{one of the}} [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] of the series and cited it {{as an example of}} the series' subtle shift [...] "from a collection of monster tales to something more akin to an attempt to explain the dark underbelly of America’s obsession with pulp narratives." [...] He ultimately concluded that [...] "Field Trip" [...] showed [...] "how the series would <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> good as its best seasons again, but could still be remarkably effective." [...] In a subsequent review, VanDerWerff awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "one of my favorite episodes of The X-Files sixth season" [...] due to its analysis of what Mulder and Scully each desire from the world, and the fact that the episode argues that the [...] "mysteries can only be solved if both of these people are working to solve them." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two positively compared the episode to the episode [...] "Bad Blood", noting that the episode [...] " [...] a retread of those 'Bad Blood' themes". Furthermore, however, Shearman and Pearson noted that, [...] " [...] not merely poking fun at the conventions of the long running sci-fi show, but inviting its audience to question the truths around us we take for granted".|$|E

500|$|The First Cello Concerto, in A minor (1872) is {{a serious}} {{although}} animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section. It {{is among the most}} popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players. The Second, in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections. It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saëns-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> popular as the First because it was too difficult. There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second, in C major. The First, in A, was also completed in 1858. It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting {{less than a quarter of}} an hour. The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime. The Third, in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate, is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity. It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso, in A minor, Op. 28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863. It changes from a wistful opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, [...] "After a multi-stopped cadenza... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{likened the}} episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded [...] "vaguely and less {{successfully}} on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "the new Seinfeld wannabe, {{but it will}} <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny {{as it used to}} be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated about a guy who dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed.|$|E

2500|$|On April 1, 2014, Universal Music {{announced}} the disbandment of Island Def Jam Music, {{one of four}} operational umbrella groups within Universal Music.

Barry Weiss who previously moved from Sony Music to head up Island Def Jam Music back in 2012 when Motown Records was incorporated into Island Def Jam has stepped down from Universal Music. Additionally, as part of the changes to the labels, Motown Records will be transferred to Los Angeles to become part of the Capitol Music Group—previous Vice President Ethiopia Habtemariam was promoted to Label President for Motown Records.

2500|$|With the {{increasingly}} precise {{data provided by}} WMAP, {{there have been a}} number of claims that the CMB exhibits anomalies, such as very large scale anisotropies, anomalous alignments, and non-Gaussian distributions. The most longstanding of these is the low-l multipole controversy. Even in the COBE map, it was observed that the quadrupole (l = 2, spherical harmonic) has a low amplitude compared to the predictions of the Big Bang. In particular, the quadrupole and octupole (l = 3) modes appear to have an unexplained alignment with each other and with both the ecliptic plane and equinoxes, A number of groups have suggested that this could be the signature of new physics at the greatest observable scales; other groups suspect systematic errors in the data. Ultimately, due to the foregrounds and the cosmic variance problem, the greatest modes will <b>never</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> well measured as the small angular scale modes. The analyses were performed on two maps that have had the foregrounds removed as far as possible: the [...] "internal linear combination" [...] map of the WMAP collaboration and a similar map prepared by Max Tegmark and others. Later analyses have pointed out that these are the modes most susceptible to foreground contamination from synchrotron, dust, and Bremsstrahlung emission, and from experimental uncertainty in the monopole and dipole. A full Bayesian analysis of the WMAP power spectrum demonstrates that the quadrupole prediction of Lambda-CDM cosmology is consistent with the data at the 10% level and that the observed octupole is not remarkable. Carefully accounting for the procedure used to remove the foregrounds from the full sky map further reduces the significance of the alignment by ~5%.|$|E
