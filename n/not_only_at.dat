According to Hareide, the actions were in line with the parliamentary stance on the issue.|$|E

25|$|Between 1810 and 1828, the Zulu kingdom under Shaka Zulu laid {{waste to}} {{large parts of}} present-day South Africa and Zimbabwe.

(Controversial) estimates for the death toll range from 1 million to 2million.|$|E

25|$|Although local {{extinction}} {{of one or}} more competitors has been less documented than niche separation or competitive exclusion, it does occur. In an experiment involving zooplankton in artificial rock pools, local extinction rates were significantly higher in areas of interspecific competition.

25|$|At room {{temperature}} and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium {{when the air}} over the water has a humidity of about 3%. This percentage increases as the temperature goes up. At 100°C and atmospheric pressure, equilibrium is not reached until the air is 100% water.

25|$|After the {{frontier}} closure, {{there was a}} vacuum in the labour pool which had resulted from {{the removal of the}} Spanish workforce, which constituted about one third of the entire workforce. About 4,666 men who previously commuted daily across the border from Spain were now cut off. The governments of the blockade period undertook ambitious regeneration programs aimed <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> meeting the demand for improved housing and services, but also at maintaining high employment levels.|$|E
25|$|His first project, {{undertaken}} at McCook Field, in Dayton, Ohio, was for {{the creation}} of a heavily armored attack plane for supporting ground forces. Although the designs that resulted were not practical and did not meet Mitchell's specifications for aircraft that could land troops behind enemy lines, the project led Mitchell to closely supervise aircraft development, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> McCook but in Europe as well. On October 30, 1919, the McCook Field engineers tested the first reversible-pitch propeller.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{assumes that}} disorganized regeneration {{occurs at the}} site of the lesion. On the contrary, recent research by Choi and Raisman has provided a more thorough understanding of synkinesis through aberrant axonal regeneration. Their study has shown that regenerating axons become disorganized throughout the length of the nerve and <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> the site of the lesion. Previously, many developed treatment strategies (that inevitably failed) were invented based on the original hypothesis by only focusing on the lesion site for improving the organization of regeneration. The new modification to the hypothesis could allow for better success in developing treatments.|$|E

25|$|Masinissa also {{cultivated}} a grand {{vision of}} uniting all the Berbero-Libyan peoples from {{the frontiers of}} Egypt to the Atlantic. His expansionist actions were directed mainly against the surviving city-state of Carthage. Eventually Masinissa's aggressive actions achieved several major acquisitions of lands previously held by Carthage, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> the borders of Numidia and Carthage, but extending also well south of Punic territory, and including Mediterranean seaports in Tripolitania {{to the east of}} Carthage. Indeed, his last war against Carthage {{turned out to be a}} prelude to the Third Punic War (149–146). Here, Rome intervened and eventually besieged and destroyed Carthage.|$|E
25|$|Uniting the Church of Byzantium {{with that}} of Rome was a simple matter, since all the {{bargaining}} chips were {{in the hands of}} the Roman Catholic West. John VIII, as the de facto head of the Byzantine Church ordered the Byzantine Church to accept Papal primacy and declared that the Filioque dispute arose from semantic confusion. Few on Byzantium's side were impressed with the Union between 1438 and 1439 held in Ferrara and Florence, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> the terms at which the Byzantine Church had to stoop to, but also at the non-existent aid to Byzantium. One can safely say that the most notable effect of the Union was the increased resentment between Byzantium's populace and the Imperial government.|$|E
