5|$|Although {{unusual in}} the West, school {{corporal}} punishment is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> more conservative areas of the state, with 28,569 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of school corporal punishment in Texas is surpassed only by Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies {{appear from}} late June to November, but usually from August to October; overwintered {{specimens}} {{can be found}} in freezing days up to early February. The fungus prefers the downs and the uplands, but is also <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> lowlands.|$|E
5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> {{many parts of the world}} during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E

5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and {{preventing them from}} being absorbed. Notable examples are oxalic acid, tannins and phytic acid, which are high in plant-based diets. Calcium and iron deficiencies are <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E
5|$|Warfare was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> the Yavapai world, {{and they}} made {{changing}} alliances for security. Wi:pukba (Wipukepa) and Guwevkabaya (Kwevkepaya) bands formed alliances with Western Apache bands, to attack and defend against raids by the Pima and Maricopa bands from the south. Because of the greater strength of the Pima/Maricopa, Yavapai/Apache raids generally conducted small-scale quick raids, followed by a retreat to avoid counter-attack. The Yavapai defended their lands against Pima incursions, when the Pima would invade to harvest saguaro fruits.|$|E
5|$|Buckland had not {{provided}} a specific name, as was <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> {{the early nineteenth}} century, when the genus was still seen as the more essential concept. In 1826, Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete binomial, Megalosaurus conybeari, which however was not much used by later authors and is now considered a nomen oblitum. A year later, in 1827, Gideon Mantell included Megalosaurus in his geological survey of southeastern England, and assigned the species its current valid binomial name, Megalosaurus bucklandii. Until recently, the form Megalosaurus bucklandi was often used, a variant first published in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer – and sometimes erroneously ascribed to von Ritgen – but the more original M. bucklandii has priority.|$|E

5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a highly intelligent but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|Although wolves {{primarily}} feed {{on medium}} to large sized ungulates, {{they are not}} fussy eaters. Smaller sized animals that may supplement the diet of wolves include marmots, hares, badgers, foxes, weasels, ground squirrels, mice, hamsters, voles and other rodents, as well as insectivores. They frequently eat waterfowl and their eggs. When such foods are insufficient, they prey on lizards, snakes, frogs, rarely toads and large insects as available. In times of scarcity, wolves readily eat carrion, visiting cattle burial grounds and slaughter houses. Cannibalism is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> wolves: during harsh winters, packs often attack weak or injured wolves, and may eat the bodies of dead pack members. Wolf packs in Astrakhan hunt Caspian seals on the Caspian Sea coastline and some wolf packs in Alaska and Western Canada have been observed to feed on salmon. Humans are rarely, but occasionally preyed upon. Other primates occasionally taken by wolves include grey langurs in Nepal and hamadryas baboons in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
50|$|D. Michael Quinn {{responded to}} these charges by {{pointing}} out that methods by Roberts used in creating History of the Church—while flawed by today's standards—were <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> practices <b>in</b> the nineteenth century, even by reputable historians.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon,</b> {{particularly}} <b>in</b> America, for haggadot to {{be produced}} by corporate entities, serving as texts for the celebration of Passover, but also as marketing tools and ways of showing that certain foods are kosher.|$|R

5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus are <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits {{still in their}} earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the ear canal), Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E
5|$|The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the tepid {{feelings}} {{the public}} had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. Victoria wore black mourning {{for the rest of}} her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning, and linen and towels changed daily. Such practices were <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal family should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{another former}} student, Frances Loring, noted that Taft used his students' talents to further his own career, a <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> situation. <b>In</b> general, history has given Taft credit {{for helping to}} advance {{the status of women}} as sculptors.|$|R

A permanent structure was constructed on the site in 1973.|$|R
5|$|While <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> {{predominantly}} Catholic cultures, Christian metal {{is rooted}} in evangelical Protestantism, beginning {{as a means of}} evangelism among the non-Christian metal scene. Over the years the focus changed because of the increased secularization of Christianity in the West during the 1990s. Moberg (2008) notes that the current scene seems to have very little interest in evangelism, especially in Northern Europe. Instead, it is argued that the current Christian metal music scene ultimately provides its core members with important resources for the shaping of an alternative and complementary form of religious expression and practice and an alternative Christian identity. Thus, Moberg states that Christian metal serves four main purposes: an alternative form of religious expression and identity; as a legitimate form of religious expression; as an effective means of evangelism and fighting and standing up for the Christian faith; as a positive alternative to non-Christian metal.|$|E
5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours {{to the effect}} that a secret baptism had been {{administered}} to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like this were <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>in</b> 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment to parental authority to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E

50|$|Below decks, {{there are}} crew spaces for fifteen in the forecastle, {{and the main}} fish hold was amidships.

50|$|Secondary {{blindness}} is <b>not</b> <b>uncommon,</b> particularly <b>in</b> long lived {{groups such}} as the Agnostida and Trinucleioidea. In Proetida and Phacopina from western Europe and particularly Tropidocoryphinae from France (where there is good stratigraphic control), there are well studied trends showing progressive eye reduction between closely related species that eventually leads to blindness.|$|R
