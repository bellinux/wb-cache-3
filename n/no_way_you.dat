In 1988, {{he became}} the 1,884th personality to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6541 Hollywood Blvd. In 2001 he was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. The following year he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, although {{he was also a}} naturalized US citizen. With his American status, he maintained his Canadian heritage: [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> can be a Canadian and think you can lose it... Canadians are a goodly group.

500|$|The Boston Herald noted {{superficial}} {{similarities between}} System Shock and Doom, but called System Shock [...] "much more elaborate". The reviewer noted its high system requirements and complex controls; of the latter, he said, [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> can play System Shock without first studying the manual {{for at least}} 20 minutes". The paper believed that the game would [...] "set a new standard for computer games with its combination of action and puzzle-solving". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said that the game [...] "is like a well-prepared hamburger—familiar stuff, but good to the last byte". The reviewer noted the game's [...] "somewhat clumsy control", but said, [...] "That, however, is all I can find to complain about. Graphics and sound are outstanding, and the game is well-paced and riveting".|$|E

In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the extended remix {{of the song}} at number four on their list of ten best Beyoncé's songs. The same year, the writers of Complex magazine put [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] at number 9 on their list of 25 best Beyoncé's songs.

500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I just felt like you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> can outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song {{in the studio with}} Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E

She was awarded a Worst Actress Razzie Award in 2005 for this role. She appeared at the ceremony to accept the award in person (making her the third person, and second actor, ever to do so) {{with a sense of}} humor, considering it an experience of the [...] "rock bottom" [...] in order to be [...] "at the top". Holding the Academy Award in one hand and the Razzie in the other she said, [...] "I never in my life thought that I would be here, winning a Razzie. It's not like I ever aspired to be here, but thank you. When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> could be a good winner."

500|$|Biko never {{addressed}} {{questions of}} gender and sexism in his politics. The sexism was evident in many ways, according to Mamphela Ramphele, a BCM activist and doctor at the Zanempilo Clinic, including that women tended to be given responsibility for the cleaning and catering at functions. [...] "There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> could think of Steve making {{a cup of tea}} or whatever for himself", another activist said. Feminism was viewed as irrelevant [...] "bra-burning". Surrounded by women who cared about him, Biko developed a reputation as a womaniser, something that Woods described as [...] "well earned". He displayed no racial prejudice, sleeping with both black and white women. At NUSAS, he and his friends competed to see who could have sex with the most female delegates. Responding to this behaviour, the NUSAS general secretary Sheila Lapinsky accused Biko of sexism, to which he responded: [...] "Don't worry about my sexism. What about your white racist friends in NUSAS?" [...] Sobukwe also admonished Biko for his womanising, believing that it set a bad example to other activists.|$|E
500|$|Edward James Olmos portrays Gaff. Olmos {{used his}} diverse ethnic background, and {{personal}} research, {{to help create}} the fictional [...] "Cityspeak" [...] language his character uses in the film. His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, [...] "Horse dick ! <b>No</b> <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> are the Blade ... Blade Runner." [...] M. Emmet Walsh plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions, and shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease; Joe Pantoliano was considered for the role. James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrays the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{the music for}} the album, the band decided that the artwork needed to reflect the themes on the record, likening the change of image to a political campaign. Armstrong recalled, [...] "We wanted to be firing on all cylinders. [...] Everything from the aesthetic to the music to the look. [...] Just everything." [...] Green Day drew inspiration from Chinese communist propaganda art the band saw in art galleries on Melrose Avenue and recruited artist Chris Bilheimer, who had designed the art for the previous records Nimrod and International Superhits! to create the cover. The band aimed for the cover to be [...] "at once uniform and powerful". The album's artwork—"a Posada-stark print of a heart-shaped hand grenade gripped in a blood-soaked fist"—is representative of its political content. After listening to the new music on his computer, Bilheimer took note of the lyric [...] "And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade" [...] from [...] "She's a Rebel". Influenced by artist Saul Bass's poster for the 1955 drama film The Man with the Golden Arm, Bilheimer created an upstretched arm holding a red heart-shaped grenade. Although he felt that red is the [...] "most overused color in graphic design", {{he felt that the}} [...] "immediate" [...] qualities of the color deemed it appropriate for use on the cover. He explained, [...] "I'm sure there's psychological theories of it being the same color of blood and therefore has the powers of life and death... And as a designer I always feel it's kind of a cop-out, so I never used it before. But there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> couldn't use it on this cover." ...|$|E

[...] PlayStation Lifestyle writer Mike Hartnett declared Hot Pursuit better than Gran Turismo 5, and concluded with [...] "Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit is just downright more fun than anything rolling out of Polyphony Digital’s garage.

2500|$|Cyberdreams {{brought in}} writer David Sears to {{collaborate}} with Harlan Ellison. Sears, formerly a writer and assistant editor for Compute! magazine, had never before worked on a video game. Though a long-time fan of Ellison and his work, Sears was initially nervous and somewhat skeptical at his assignment: [...] "...they said, 'No, it's I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, and I was like, 'What?'...At the time, in the game-development community, people said, 'Oh I love Ellison's stories, but there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> could turn that into a game.' I thought, 'Wow, what have I gotten into?'" [...] One of the biggest initial challenges was taking a short story whose characters have very limited background story and character development, and fleshing it out into a full-length interactive narrative. A breakthrough came about when Sears asked Ellison the question, [...] "Why were these people saved? Why did AM decide to save them?" [...] This brought about the decision to split the game into five separate narratives, each following a particular character and exploring why they had been selected to be tortured. Sears spent several weeks at Ellison's house, where they worked to flesh out the characters and their backgrounds.|$|E
2500|$|Strength {{played an}} {{important}} part in Hoad's game, as he often drove for winners rather than rallying and waiting for the right opportunity. Although he assaulted his opponents, he also had the skill to win the French Championships on the slower clay court. Hoad played right-handed and had a powerful serve and groundstrokes but his game lacked consistency. At times Hoad had difficulty maintaining concentration. According to Kramer, [...] "Hoad had the loosest game of any good kid I ever saw. There was absolutely no pattern to his game.... He was the only player I ever saw who could stand six or seven feet behind the baseline and snap the ball back hard, crosscourt. He'd try for winners off everything, off great serves, off tricky short balls, off low volleys. He hit hard overspin drives, and there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> could ever get him to temporise on important points." [...] Kramer compares Hoad to another great player, Ellsworth Vines. [...] "Both were very strong guys. Both succeeded at a very young age.... Also, both were very lazy guys. Vines lost interest in tennis (for golf) before he was thirty, and Hoad never appeared to be very interested. Despite their great natural ability, neither put up the outstanding records that they were capable of. Unfortunately, the latter was largely true because both had physical problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Buffy was conceived by Joss Whedon {{as a way}} of subverting the cliché of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror film". Whedon stated [...] "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" [...] was the first incarnation of Buffy in his head, [...] "the idea of a seemingly insignificant female who in fact turns out to be extraordinary." [...] When asked how he came up with the name of [...] "Buffy," [...] Whedon states [...] "It was the name that I could think of that I could take the least seriously. There is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> could hear the name Buffy and think, [...] "This is an important person. To juxtapose that with Vampire Slayer, just felt like that kind of thinga B movie. But a B movie that had something more going on. That was my dream." [...] Whedon claims the title was criticized for being too silly, and the television network begged him to change it. He refused, insisting [...] "You don't understand. It has to be this. This is what it is." [...] Jason Middleton feels that Buffy avoids the [...] "final girl" [...] character trope seen in horror films, where the androgynous and celibate heroine gets to outlive her friends and exact revenge on their killer; in Middleton's words, [...] "she... gets to have sex with boys and still kill the monster".|$|E
