Anderson responded to the claim of black metal influence by stating that he does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> people compare his music to black metal; he hypothesized that it is simply the raw production of the music, or the double 'i' in the band name.|$|E

25|$|The {{triple jump}} (contemporarily hop, step and jump) {{resulted}} in a minor controversy surrounding the third Olympic spot behind Bowman and Romero; 1928 Olympic silver medalist Levi Casey placed third at the Trials, but the AOC instead selected Sol Furth, who placed fourth. Why this substitution happened was left unexplained by AOC officials, though they said the reasons were known to Casey; Casey, for his part, stated he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> he had {{been left out of}} the team.|$|E
25|$|On 3 October 1968, {{at the age}} of 15, Dupas, still {{attending}} school in Waverley High in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visited his next-door neighbour, requesting to borrow a knife for the purpose of peeling vegetables. Dupas was apprehended after he stabbed the woman in the face, neck, and hand as she attempted to fight off his attack. He later told police he could not help himself and did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> he began to attack the woman.

25|$|In , Martin {{had another}} major {{incident}} with Jackson and it {{eventually led to}} him losing his position. On July 17 against the Kansas City Royals, Jackson came to the plate {{in the bottom of}} the tenth inning with Thurman Munson on base and Martin put the bunt sign on. After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off and Jackson was given the sign to swing away. Jackson bunted again, and then on the third pitch he bunted again and popped out. A furious Martin demanded Jackson be suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but after conversing with upper management Martin agreed on a five-game suspension. Then, when Jackson returned, he told reporters that he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> Martin had suspended him.|$|E

25|$|The {{giant panda}} has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The {{rest of the}} animal's coat is white. Although {{scientists}} do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat. The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45kg (243.5lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292. Another study had a 117.5kg (259lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, DeMarco {{is trying}} to cope with {{adjusting}} to civilian life. Although Dredd is uninterested in her romantically, he retains an interest in her welfare, and he helps her to find a job as a licensed private detective. Her first assignment appears to be a missing person case, but it actually transpires that her client is working for the Frendz Mob, and is using her to locate a man who they wish to kill. DeMarco manages to find their intended victim and save his life, and she calls Dredd to interrogate him. The man reports that he works in a warehouse in which the Judges' new Lawgiver handguns are kept before being shipped to the Justice Department to replace the old models. He has been bribed to allow the Frendz Mob to exchange the microchips in the weapons with new ones, but does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why.</b>|$|E

500|$|MalcolmX {{was equally}} {{critical}} {{of the civil rights}} movement.

500|$|Murray's {{trial on}} charges {{stemming}} from the bus incident and her experience with the Waller case inspired a career in civil rights law.

500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen and we do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why.</b> We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to}} the First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story begins}} with Memer narrating her {{earliest}} memory: of entering a secret {{room filled with}} books, to which the door may only be opened by making shapes on the wall. Memer believes {{she is the only}} who knows how to get in, until she finds the Waylord there when she is nine years old. He offers to teach her to read, after swearing her to secrecy. Memer proves to be a quick learner. Four days after her seventeenth birthday, Memer makes the acquaintance of Orrec and Gry, the protagonists of Gifts. Orrec, famous as a poet and storyteller, has been invited to Ansul to perform: Memer invites him and Gry to stay at Galvamand. They tell the Waylord that though the Alds invited them to Ansul, they came to find Galvamand, for the ancient library rumored to have once existed there. Orrec questions Memer {{about the history of the}} city: she tells him that Galvamand used to be known as the Oracle house, and realizes she does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why.</b>|$|E
500|$|Scientists do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> {{the fungus}} mysteriously lives only in Texas and Japan, {{locations}} of {{approximately the same}} latitude, but separated by [...] Fred Jay Seaver commented [...] "this is only another illustration of the unusual and unpredictable distribution of many species of the fungi. It would be difficult indeed to account for it, and we merely accept the facts as they are." [...] In 2004, a research study compared the DNA sequences of both populations and used a combination of molecular phylogenetics and molecular clock calculations to estimate the extent of genetic divergence. It concluded that the two populations have been separated for at least nineteen million years, ruling {{out the possibility of}} human introduction of the species from one location to the other. Although there are no consistent differences in morphology between the two populations, there are several differences in their life histories. The preferred host of Texan populations is typically roots and stumps of Ulmus crassifolia, while the Japanese populations tend to grow on the fallen trunks of Symplocos myrtacea and Quercus gilva. Texan species grow in areas subjected to periodic flooding, unlike their Japanese counterparts. Finally, only Japanese specimens can be grown in culture—the spores of Texan material have not been successfully germinated on artificial media.|$|E
