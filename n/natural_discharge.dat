25|$|Groundwater is {{the water}} present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces {{and in the}} {{fractures}} of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally; <b>natural</b> <b>discharge</b> often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article evaluates {{hydrological}} {{transformations in}} Jaguaribe River Basin over this century after {{the construction of}} its twelve largest reservoirs. The results showed that, even with large reservoirs, the degree of control of Jaguaribe Basin is relatively low, and around 35 % of the <b>natural</b> <b>discharges</b> keeps on flowing to the ocean. The main reason for that low efficiency of reservoirs comes from the high variability of rivers inflows. In order to ana-lyze the behavior of this same system for a different scenario, Jaguaribe River and its tributar-ies were simulated as they were less variable on their annual discharges. The results obtained were completely different, with the reservoir system regulating up to 85 % of the mean <b>natural</b> <b>discharges</b> and less than 1 % flowing to the ocean. 1.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The High Plains aquifer of Tertiary age Ogallala {{formation}} and of Quaternary age sediments, supports large irrigation withdrawals in westem Kansas and seven other mid-continent states. <b>Natural</b> <b>discharges</b> from this aquifer {{in south central}} Kansas feed base flows of streams. Irrigation pumping up-gradient from this discharge area depletes or eliminates base flows in the streams. The Division of Water Resources, Kansas Depadment of Agriculhlre appropriates water according to the prior appropriation doctrine. Livestock owners hold senior water rights on the streams and irrigators hold water rights in the aquifer. Additional applications for irrigation permits are pending. A hydrologic analysis of the stream and aquifer interaction in the area will defme threshold pumping water levels up-gradient from affected streams that will serve as regulatory criterion for conjunctive use of this water supply. Limits may be imposed on the permits issued. Irrigation wells {{may be required to}} cease pumping or decrease pumping rates when pumping levels reach the threshold until stream flow recovers.

40|$|Background & Aim: Bacterial vaginosis is {{characterized}} by an imbalance in vaginal <b>natural</b> <b>discharges</b> due to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria {{as well as a}} concomitant {{decrease in the number of}} lactobacilli and increase in vaginal PH to more than 4. 5. Bacterial vaginosis increases the risk of pelvic inflamatory disease, postoperative infection following hysterectomy, cervix abnormal cytology and preterm birth. Microbial resistance and a growing tendency to move toward "natural therapies" have led to increase interests in non-antibiotic treatments for bacterial vaginosis. This study aimed to compare the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus suppository and Metronidazol vaginal tablet on treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Methods & Materials: In a double-blind, paralled randomized clinical trial, 40 out of 300 participants were included in the study from an out-patient private gynaecology clinic in Tabriz, Iran. The participants were randomly allocated to two treatment groups of Lactobacilli suppository and Metronidazol vaginal tablet. Results: The cure rate for the Metronidazol group and the Lactobacilli supository group were 100 and 75 per cents, respectively. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, Metronidazol was more effective in treatment of bacterial vaginosis than the Lactobacilli suppository.

40|$|Turkey is {{an energy}} {{importing}} nation {{with more than}} half of our energy requirements met by imported fuels. Air pollution is becoming a significant environmental concern in the country. In this regard, geothermal energy and other renewable energy sources are becoming attractive solution for clean and sustainable energy future for Turkey. Turkey is the seventh richest country in the world in geothermal energy potential. The main uses of geothermal energy are space heating and domestic hot water supply, greenhouse heating, industrial processes, heat pumps and electricity generation. The district heating system applications started with large-scale, city-based geothermal district heating systems in Turkey, whereas the geothermal district heating centre and distribution networks have been designed according to the geothermal district heating system (GDHS) parameters. This constitutes an important advantage of GDHS investments in the country in terms of the technical and economical aspects. In Turkey, approximately 61, 000 residences are currently heated by geothermal fluids. A total of 665 MWt is utilized for space heating of residential, public and private property, and 565, 000 m 2 of greenhouses. The proven geothermal heat capacity, according to data from existing geothermal wells and <b>natural</b> <b>discharges,</b> is 3132 MWt.
