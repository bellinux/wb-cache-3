40|$|Brooding with hens is the {{simplest}} and easiest way to raise a few chickens and is the method which issued almost exclusively on the average farm. Artificial brooders are necessary where winter or very early chickens are raised, where only Leghorns or other <b>nonsetting</b> breeds of poultry are kept, or where large numbers of chickens are raised commercially. Successful natural rearing of chickens requires convenient facilities, regular attention, and often tries one's patience, while artificial methods require a larger investment, close attention, and more care, but are more commonly used where large numbers of chickens are raised.

40|$|The present case {{demonstrates}} the possible detrimental effect of an overextension of a calcium hydroxide intracanal dressing into the periradicular and soft tissue after iatrogenic buccal root perforation of a maxillary central incisor. At first this perforation was not {{recognized by the}} dentist, {{which resulted in the}} introduction of a large amount of <b>nonsetting</b> calcium hydroxide paste under the gingival tissues through a dehiscence on the buccal side of the root. This report describes the consequences and management of the necrosis of the buccal gingiva and mucosa, and the subsequent treatment and follow-up of the root perforation...|$|E
40|$|High {{harmonic}} {{fast wave}} heating and current drive (CD) {{are being developed}} on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) [M. Ono et al., Nucl. Fusion 41, 1435 (2001) ] for supporting startup and sustainment of the ST plasma. Considerable enhancement of the core heating efficiency (η) from 44 % to 65 % has been obtained for CD phasing of the antenna (strap-to-strap φ = - 90 o, kφ = - 8 m- 1) by increasing the magnetic field from 4. 5 kG to 5. 5 kG. This increase in efficiency is strongly correlated to moving {{the location of the}} onset density for perpendicular fast wave propagation (<b>nonset</b> ∝ ΒΦ× k|| 2 /w) away from the antenna face and wall, and hence reducing the propagating surface wave fields. RF waves propagating close to the wall at lower BΦ and k|| can enhance power losses from both the parametric decay instability (PDI) and wave dissipation in sheaths and structures around the machine. The improved efficiency found here is attributed to a reduction in the latter, as PDI losses are little changed at the higher magnetic field. Under these conditions of higher coupling efficiency, initial measurements of localized CD effects have been made and compared with advanced RF code simulation...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the high}} {{harmonic}} fast wave (HHFW) research on NSTX is to maximize the coupling of RF power {{to the core of}} the plasma by minimizing the coupling of RF power to edge loss processes. HHFW core plasma heating efficiency in helium and deuterium L-mode discharges is found to improve markedly on NSTX when the density 2 cm in front of the antenna is reduced below that for the onset of perpendicular wave propagation (<b>nonset</b> ∝ B*k|| 2 /ω). In NSTX, the observed RF power losses in the plasma edge are driven {{in the vicinity of the}} antenna as opposed to resulting from multi-pass edge damping. PDI surface losses through ion-electron collisions are estimated to be significant. Recent spectroscopic measurements suggest that additional PDI losses could be caused by the loss of energetic edge ions on direct loss orbits and perhaps result in the observed clamping of the edge rotation. Initial deuterium H-mode heating studies reveal that core heating is degraded at lower kφ (- 8 m- 1 relative to 13 m- 1) as for the Lmode case at elevated edge density. Fast visible camera images clearly indicate that a major edge loss process is occurring from the plasma scrape off layer (SOL) in the vicinity of the antenna and along the magnetic field lines to the lower outer divertor plate. Large type I ELMs, which are observed at both kφ values, appear after antenna arcs caused by precursor blobs, low level ELMs, or dust. For large ELMs without arcs, the source reflection coefficients rise on a 0. 1 ms time scale, which indicates that the time derivative of the reflection coefficient can be used to discriminate between arcs and ELMs...|$|R
