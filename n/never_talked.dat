5|$|Among the organisations that Playford {{belonged to}} was the local {{branch of the}} Liberal Federation, yet until the months {{preceding}} his eventual election, he <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> of holding political office. The Liberal Federation was considering a merger with the Country Party to avoid Labor retaining office during the Great Depression. Archie Cameron, an old wartime friend of Playford's and a federal Coalition MP, influenced Playford {{to run for office}} when he heard of the merger. In 1932 the Liberal and Country League (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of Murray at the 1933 election.|$|E
5|$|He {{made the}} Tigers team in spring {{training}} 1945 before finishing high school and without having played in the minor leagues, but {{sat on the bench}} before making his major league debut in June 1945, just a few weeks after his 18th birthday. He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each time he went in.|$|E

5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They {{asked her if}} she had ever had cross words with Cristina. She said she had <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of the}} leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E

25|$|Shang resumed {{civilian}} life {{working as a}} herbalist in Victoria during the interwar years. He married Anna Louise Kassene on 28 April 1923 in Hamilton, Victoria. The couple then moved to Queensland, where Shang worked as a clerk, taxi driver, and bookmaker, mostly in the Cairns area. He {{and his wife had}} a son and two daughters. According to Shang's sister, Alma Fang Yuen, he <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> about the war. Through the early 1930s, Shang was frequently in hospital. From the mid-1930s, he continued to suffer from poor health. In 1934, he was granted a 100% war service pension.

25|$|Martínez Salinas, on {{the other}} hand, stated that {{he was forced to}} confess because he was a {{neighbor}} at Santa Elena and driver of the Hernández family. He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he had ever met Constanzo, he stated that he had seen him in person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when {{he was looking for a}} car piece for his vehicle. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that he had never heard Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she had talked about her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or talked to him about it.|$|E

Shortly after having failed her art teacher's diploma exam, in August 1962, she found she was {{pregnant}} with Lennon's child. She later explained that she and Lennon had never used contraception, had <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> about it, and didn't think about it at the time. When she told Lennon he said, [...] "There's only one thing for it Cyn, we'll have to get married".|$|E

500|$|Peter Braunstein, {{the former}} Women's Wear Daily (WWD) media reporter, later convicted of sexually assaulting a coworker, {{allegedly}} planned to kill Wintour because of perceived slights. After receiving only one {{ticket to the}} 2002 Vogue Fashion Awards, which he perceived as a snub, he became so angry that WWD fired him. At his 2007 trial, prosecutors introduced as evidence a journal he kept on his computer in which he stated his intention to kill her.

500|$|Proponents of the Bricker Amendment {{said this}} {{language}} made it essential {{to add to}} the Constitution explicit limitations on the treaty-making power. Raymond Moley wrote in 1953 that Holland meant [...] "the protection of an international duck takes precedence over the constitutional protections of American citizens". In response, legal scholars such as Professor Edward Samuel Corwin of Princeton University said the language of the Constitution regarding treaties—"under the authority of the United States"—was misunderstood by Holmes, and was written to protect the 1783 peace treaty with Britain; this became [...] "in part the source of Senator Bricker's agitation". Professor Zechariah Chafee of Harvard Law School wrote, [...] "the Framers <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> about having treaties on the same level as the Constitution. What they did want was to make sure a state could no longer flout any lawful action taken by the nation". Chafee claimed that the word [...] "Supreme", as used in ArticleVI, simply meant [...] "supreme over the states".|$|E
500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They <b>never</b> <b>talked</b> to me. They never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E
