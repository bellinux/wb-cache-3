However, the demands of wartime and the rapid decline in effort following the cessation of hostilities often resulted in the failure to fully document the experiments or in the loss of documentation as personnel returned to civilian pursuits. When documented, the results were often highly classified. Even when eventually declassified, the data were often not approved for public release until years later. 2 Even after declassification and approval for public release, the records are sometimes difficult to find. Through a fortuitous discovery, a set of handwritten notes by ''ORF July 1945 '' entitled ''Dragon - Research with a Pulsed Fission Reactor'' was found by William L. Myers in an old storage safe at Pajarito Site of the Los Alamos National Laboratory 3. Of course, ORF was identified as Otto R. Frisch. The document was attached to a page in a nondescript spiral bound notebook labeled '' 494 Book'' that bore the signatures of Louis Slotin and P. Morrison.

30|$|Blocking {{mutations}} on {{the donor}} plasmid increased {{the percentage of}} EBFP positive cells from 0.013 to 0.055  % when gRNA 1 - 1 and gRNA 2 - 1 were co-delivered, with 0.27  % EBFP cells appearing in the EGFP <b>negative</b> population (Additional <b>file</b> 4 : Figure   4 B, Additional file 8 : Table  3). Conversion from EGFP to EBFP positive cells were also detected using other paired guide/Cas 9 combinations (Additional file 8 : Table  3). Paired delivery of TALEN pairs A and D with the EBFP-BM donor plasmid resulted in a conversion rate of 0.02  % EBFP, or 0.334  % EBFP positive cells in the EGFP <b>negative</b> population (Additional <b>file</b> 4 : Figure   4 B, Additional file 3 : Table  3). In comparison to the simultaneous delivery of 2 ssODNs with blocking mutations, a plasmid with blocking mutations proved a superior donor. The proportion of EBFP positive cells in the EGFP negative population was approximately doubled when plasmid template was utilised instead of the 2 ssODNs (0.167 vs 0.088  %; Fig.  4 c). The result was similar when TALEN pairs A and D were co-transfected with the EBFP-BM donor plasmid (0.168  %). By contrast, no EBFP positive cells were detected when ssODN 1 -BM and ssODN 2 -BM were {{used in conjunction with}} the paired TALENs (Fig.  4 c). Sequence analysis of PCR products from EBFP positive cells generated from EBFP-BM mediated HDR by either paired gRNA/Cas 9 or two TALEN pairs, showed that simultaneous site conversion events could be induced using either approach (Additional file 5 : Figure   5 B and C). When supplied with the EBFP-BM plasmid, TALEN pairs were less efficient at inducing genomic deletions than gRNAs, as revealed by PCR (Fig.  5 b) but were more efficient at stimulating concurrent HDR as determined by RFLP (Fig.  5 c). As Cas 9 co-transfected with a ssODN template was more efficient at stimulating HDR at a single target site than simultaneously at adjacent sites (Fig.  4 c), we investigated the possibility of carrying out the EGFB to EBFP conversion in a stepwise manner. First we mutated Y 145 F (437 A > T) using the ssODN 2 -BM in conjunction with either gRNA 2 - 1, gRNA 2 - 2, or both, and subsequently used the same cells to mutate the Y 66 H (199 T > C) using ssODN 1 -BM and gRNA 1 - 1. Using this approach we generated up to 1.15  % EBFP positive cells as a proportion of the whole population, translating as 4.05  % EBFP positive cells as a proportion of the EGFP <b>negative</b> population (Additional <b>file</b> 4 : Figure   4 C).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{potential}} of novel mechanisms towards the reduction of issuers’ ex ante uncertainty {{in the process of}} going public: i) the recruitment of directors with exceptional academic backgrounds and ii) obtaining credit ratings. Given the information scarcity in the private domain, IPO firms can use these strategies to provide investors with solid, readily identifiable benchmarks to assess their standing. Notwithstanding whether these informational cues are associated with positive or negative prospects, they cause a significant portion of uncertainty in valuation to subside. Ultimately, this should act to constrain the phenomenon of IPO underpricing causing firms to claim a larger portion of the surplus value created on the issue day. First, we examine whether CEO educational and professional attainments are associated with short-run IPOs performance. We find that returns are negatively associated with Ivy-League education, the existence of at least one University degree and the total number of qualifications. After controlling for endogeneity and self-selection bias, the results show that at the graduate level of education the Master of Arts, the MBA, the Juris and Medical Doctor titles exhibit negative relation with the money left on the table. The same is true for any professional qualification. It is also reported that only {{in the case of the}} PhD title the Nobel Elite group of Universities outperforms the rest of the sample. Second, we examine the effect of multiple credit ratings on IPO performance. The evidence comes from the U. S. and shows that the acquisition of credit ratings constitutes a valid investment decision for the issuing firm as it leaves less money on the table. Both individual as well as any combination of ratings from the three largest agencies associates with lower underpricing. This effect exacerbates with higher grade levels which are also found to decrease initial returns. Additionally, rated IPOs systematically experience <b>negative</b> <b>filing</b> price revisions. The results offer new insight to the facilitation of the going public process. Finally, we contribute to the large literature associating IPOs with earnings management. In this respect, we explore a special niche, i. e. politically connected firms. A priori, these issuers can be expected to refrain from discretionary accruals manipulation to avoid causing discontent to their contacts. Alternatively, the case may be that the powerful acquaintances fuel managers with overconfidence which permeates the financial statements. Assembling a hand-collected database on firms’ political donations, we come up with strong support for the latter conjecture. In particular lobbying activity and candidate campaign financing are both shown to be among the important determinants of aggressiveness in reporting. Our findings tie in with a growing body of literature showing businesses actively involved in politics to be prone to abuses and professional misconduct...|$|R

Therefore, the gene network identified in module 6 may be associated with crosstalk of N and K signaling as an adaptive response to nutrient starvation.

40|$|Objectives Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with ulcer disease who were not using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been overestimated. The decreasing prevalence of H. pylori could lead to a relative {{increase in the number of}} patients with this idiopathic peptic ulcer disease (IPUD). This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of IPUD and any possible trends. Design and methods The reports of all upper gastrointestinal endoscopies performed in a Dutch regional hospital over the period 1991 to 1998 were reviewed. If a gastric and/or duodenal ulcer had been diagnosed, data concerning possible H. pylori infection (culture, histology, rapid in-house urease test) were retrieved. If H. pylori tests were <b>negative,</b> hospital <b>files</b> were examined for possible use of NSAIDs or other rare causes of ulcer disease. When these were not found, stored biopsy specimens were tested for H. heilmanii by using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Results Ulcer disease was diagnosed in 405 patients who had undergone endoscopy (1159 with gastric ulcer, 235 with duodenal ulcer, and 11 with both gastric and duodenal ulcer). H. pylori infection was found in 349 of these patients (86. 2 %). Thirty-three of the 56 H. pylori negative patients used NSAIDs and three patients had Crohn's disease, leaving 20 patients with IPUD (4. 9 %, 12 gastric ulcer and eight duodenal ulcer). Time trends over the study period showed a decrease of H. pylori associated peptic ulcer disease (P < 0. 002) and an increase of NSAID associated peptic ulcer disease (P < 0. 0005). The prevalence of IPUD remained stable (P = 0. 978). Conclusions The prevalence of patients with H. pylori negative ulcer disease significantly decreased in our study population due to an increase in the number of patients with NSAID associated peptic ulcer disease. IPUD was rare and its prevalence did not increase over a period of 8 years. (C) 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins...|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the northeastern {{part of the}} Futagawa fault has another {{significant}} negative slip even for {{the case of the}} two faults (Fig.  6 d), which well coincides with a relatively large misfit area in the InSAR data (Fig.  5 c, d). These things suggest that something is wrong in the setting of the inversion. However, {{we have not been able}} to find the solution of this problem. For example, linearly distributed surface ruptures were found in the northwestern part of Aso caldera (Geospatial Information Authority of Japan 2016; Lin et al. 2016). So, we put another fault there, but we still obtained significant <b>negative</b> slips (Additional <b>file</b> 1 : Figure S 2). The result suggests that the surface ruptures found in the northwestern part of Aso caldera are what we call nontectonic faults and they are unlikely to have a deeper root. We also tried various cases by putting another fault in this area and calculated the slip distribution, but it was difficult to drastically reduce the negative slip as in the southwestern part. More complicated fault geometry, curved and/or more than one fault, may be needed. Otherwise, because the negative slip area coincides with the caldera rim of Aso volcano, something peculiar might happen, due to mass wasting, loose sediment, and/or large contrast of the elastic constants.|$|R
30|$|The most {{striking}} result {{in this study}} was the lack of correlation between tumour thymidine concentrations and [18 F]FLT uptake across 14 different tumour models and 4 centres (Fig.  6 and Additional file 1 : Figure S 2 and Figure S 3). One cannot exclude that differences between the three PET scanners and reconstruction algorithms used have introduced variability into the dataset. However, by employing regular quality control measures and by using tumour-to-tissue ratios rather than SUV as the primary parameter describing uptake variability due to technical differences is expected to be minimised. Previous work has shown a negative correlation between [18 F]FLT uptake and tumour thymidine concentrations in smaller cohorts from single centres [5, 6]. The current work however implies that if there is competition between thymidine in the tumour and [18 F]FLT, tumour thymidine concentration alone is not sufficient to predict [18 F]FLT uptake. In a subset where tumour thymidine and [18 F]FLT uptake were available for individual mice from a single centre, there was no <b>negative</b> correlation (Additional <b>file</b> 1 : Figure S 9). This was also observed in the models studied by McKinley et al. [7], highlighting the complexity of factors affecting [18 F]FLT uptake. Variable effects of metabolism, clearance, cell membrane transporters, thymidine kinase 1 (TK 1) activity, dephosphorylation and inflammatory infiltration on [18 F]FLT uptake all probably play a part to different degrees [16].|$|R
40|$|An {{information}} retrieval system (as distinguished from a document retrieval system) is described for handling statute-oriented legal literature. The Normalized Sentence-Index Matrix (N-SIM) system suggested differs from more traditional retrieval systems for legal literature in three respects: (1) the categories used for classification are normalized versions of sentences from statutes, regulations, treaties, constitutions, case opinions, legal treatises, law review articles, {{and other documents}} in legal literature, (2) the classification system is hierarchial and open-ended to evolve with the literature through time, and (3) {{the organization of the}} file facilitates some analysis of the literature by computer. A sentence is expressed in implicative normal form (INF) when three specified conditions are fulfilled. Statutory norms are converted into INF before being stored in the N-SIM <b>file.</b> <b>Negative</b> implicative normal form (NINF) is also defined, and all assertions in legal literature about aspects of the statutory norms are converted into either INF or NINF for storage in the N-SIM file. The N-SIM file is designed {{so that it can be}} used manually as a loose-leaf service or in a system of automatic data processing by machine. It is hypothesized that statutes expressed in this normalized form will be understood by various audiences of readers both more quickly and more accurately than statutes expressed in their current form. A method for empirically testing this hypothesis is suggested...|$|R
