Although the inferior olive lies in the medulla oblongata and receives input from the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebral cortex, its output goes entirely to the cerebellum. A climbing fiber gives off collaterals to the deep cerebellar nuclei before entering the cerebellar cortex, where it splits into about 10 terminal branches, each of which gives input to a single Purkinje cell. In striking contrast to the 100,000-plus inputs from parallel fibers, each Purkinje cell receives input from exactly one climbing fiber; but this single fiber [...] "climbs" [...] the dendrites of the Purkinje cell, winding around them and making a total of up to 300 synapses as it goes.

We implement this network by using a variant of extended normalized RBF (Cheung and Xu 2001) with its hidden units learned by the rival penalization controlled competitive learning (RPCCL) algorithm (Cheung 2002).

40|$|The {{intertropical}} {{convergence zone}} (ITCZ) migrates north–south on seasonal and longer time scales. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the zonal-mean ITCZ displacement off the equator is negatively correlated with the energy flux across the equator; when the ITCZ lies in the Northern Hemisphere, energy flows southward across the equator, and vice versa. The hemisphere that exports energy across the equator is the hemisphere with more <b>net</b> energy <b>input,</b> and it is usually the warmer hemisphere. But states with a double ITCZ straddling the equator also occur, for example, seasonally over the eastern Pacific and frequently in climate models. Here it is shown how the ITCZ position is connected to the energy balance near the equator in a broad range of circumstances, including states with single and double ITCZs. Taylor expansion of the variation of the meridional energy flux around the equator leads to the conclusion that for large positive <b>net</b> energy <b>input</b> into the equatorial atmosphere, the ITCZ position depends linearly on the cross-equatorial energy flux. For small positive equatorial <b>net</b> energy <b>input,</b> the dependence of the ITCZ position on the cross-equatorial energy flux weakens to the third root. When the equatorial <b>net</b> energy <b>input</b> or its curvature become negative, a bifurcation to double-ITCZ states occurs.

This latter observation makes it possible to relate the ITCZ position to the energy balance, specifically the atmospheric <b>net</b> energy <b>input</b> near the equator and the cross-equatorial energy flux. Here the validity of the resulting relations between the ITCZ position and energetic quantities is examined with reanalysis data for the years 1979 – 2014. In the reanalysis data, the EFE and ITCZ position indeed covary on time scales of seasons and longer. Consistent with theory, the ITCZ position is proportional to the cross-equatorial atmospheric energy flux and inversely proportional to atmospheric <b>net</b> energy <b>input</b> at the equator. Variations of the cross-equatorial energy flux dominate seasonal variations of the ITCZ position.
