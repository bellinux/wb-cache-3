5|$|Not all {{software}} {{states are}} vulnerable to rowhammer attacks. An attacker thus <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> right target states in order to utilize rowhammer errors. In practice, {{one of the main}} challenges is in identifying target states. Such typically have been done by domain experts. The mainstream fault tolerance community responded to rowhammer attacks with a systematic methodology which can be used to identify, validate, and evaluate rowhammer attack target states and their exploitability. That work is based on the well-established fault injection-based experimental methodology, and generalized attack target states and found a few practical target states that were previously unknown.|$|E

He fails in his enterprise but pretends publicly to have succeeded, causing the ruin of a husband (if the gageure had claimed to have succeeded with another man's wife) or, in this case, the despair of a brother.

USGamer further considers [...] "stamina decay" [...] as another feature related to resource management. The player's character constantly <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> food to survive or will die from hunger, which prevents the player from exploiting health regeneration by simply either passing turns {{for a long period of}} time or fighting very weak monsters at low level dungeons.

Swift also provided vocals for Boys Like Girls' [...] "Two Is Better Than One".

While filming Valentine's Day in October 2009—Swift's film debut—she began a romantic relationship with co-star Taylor Lautner, but they broke up later that year. The romantic comedy, released the following year, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role in which Los Angeles Times found [...] "serious comedic potential".

500|$|Chris Redfield {{debuted in}} the {{original}} Resident Evil {{as one of the}} playable protagonists, along with Jill Valentine, partnered with the rookie officer Rebecca Chambers. He is introduced as a former U.S. military pilot hailing from New York City, {{and a member of the}} Raccoon City Police Special Tactics And Rescue Service's (STARS) Alpha team, sent to investigate the disappearance of Bravo team after their helicopter goes missing in a nearby forest. Chris, accompanied by Jill, Albert Wesker, and Barry Burton, soon find themselves trapped in a nearby mansion, filled with horrific monsters and deadly traps. Chris' scenario is more challenging than Jill's, as he has a smaller carrying capacity and lacks certain items. Unlike Jill, he is not equipped with a lock-pick and <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> keys. He can take a lot more physical damage from enemies than she can. In the end, Chris and his comrades learn how the incident began, and witness the death of Albert Wesker, who was betraying them all along. They also face and kill a prototype Tyrant released by Wesker. Following the so-called [...] "Mansion Incident", Chris leaves Raccoon City, embarking on a personal mission against the Umbrella Corporation, after learning of how Umbrella instigated the viral outbreak in the mansion.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said the}} series <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{a way to}} {{distinguish}} Leslie from Steve Carell's Michael Scott from The Office, {{but he said the}} pilot episode was funny, particularly the Aziz Ansari character. Sepinwall also said The Office did not find its footing until the second season, so comparisons simply based on the pilot were not fair. (Ironically, most critics now agree that Parks and Recreation set a significantly higher standard after the second season.) Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said the supporting cast needed stronger writing and reinforcements, but that Poehler was excellent in a lead role unique for women because it is based on weakness and wrongheadedness, but still a positive and strong part. Stanley said, [...] "The pilot episode isn’t perfect, but Ms. Poehler very nearly is." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday said Poehler has [...] "plenty of appeal here" [...] so he felt the show might have potential, but felt the pilot was for the most part a [...] "near knockoff" [...] of The Office. Likewise, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times said [...] "so far it's a pale Xerox of the paper company", although she said [...] "there are lots of funny little moments that could add up to a great series." [...] Robert Bianco said the episode was not funny, {{and the way in which}} the scripts and supporting cast ridicule and ignore the Leslie character leaves a [...] "sour whiff of gratuitous cruelty." [...] He also called the pilot unoriginal and described it as [...] "a style in search of a show," [...] despite Poehler's likability. Similarly, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said, [...] "Watching Poehler's pathetic character have her dreams stomped on by apathetic bureaucrats is off-putting, more so than Michael Scott's obliviousness," [...] although Owen said the Ansari character was amusing.|$|E

As a [...] "present", de Killer stages an assassination attempt on Franziska, rendering her unable to act as prosecutor. At the last second, Edgeworth arrives and steps in to replace her. With Phoenix resorting to increasingly desperate acts to prolong the trial, Edgeworth offers to help him save Maya, explaining {{that he has been}} leading a task force to capture de Killer. Using a tape that Engarde, in truth a thoroughly guilty psychopath, had recorded as blackmail, Phoenix reveals his betrayal to de Killer. Fearing that Shelly will target him, Engarde pleads guilty and is convicted of murder. As a reward for Phoenix's help, de Killer releases Maya, who subsequently reunites with Pearl and all of their friends. Edgeworth explains that his absence was spent soul-searching for [...] "the answer" [...] as to {{what it means to be}} a prosecutor, and he and Phoenix reconcile, while Franziska pledges to renounce her profession in disgrace. Edgeworth confronts her at the airport, where Franziska breaks down in tears and admits that she is jealous of Edgeworth and wanted to destroy him, but now feels that she cannot with such huge losses on her record. Recognizing that she <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the same answers he did, she returns to her native Germany with a picture of Phoenix in her possession. There is also an alternate ending, where Engarde is declared innocent, and his manager is convicted instead based on Franziska's evidence. Phoenix, convinced that he can no longer continue as an attorney, closes his firm and retires in disgrace.|$|E
