Arcidiacono hit a 3-pointer with 10.1 {{seconds left in}} a November 29 matchup against Kansas despite <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> shot until that point. The Wildcats held on to upset the second-ranked Jayhawks 63-59. Arcidiacono had his first double-double with 20 points and 11 assists in a 94–85 overtime win over Marquette on January 25, 2014.

5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E

25|$|Air Stord was one {{of several}} {{airlines}} in 1998 to announce that they could operate out of a possible civilian airport situated at Rygge Air Station. The Oslo flights moved to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen on 8 October 1998. By then the airline was operating three Do 328s. The airline was under sustained financial distress and was <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> profit on its routes. Air Stord filed for bankruptcy on 19 February 1999 and the following day all services were terminated. The company had at the time 70 employees.|$|E
25|$|Statements {{of future}} {{intention}} are not generally actionable representations, so {{that someone who}} fails {{to carry out a}} stated intention is <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> misrepresentation. However, a misrepresentation of one's present intention is actionable. As Bowen LJ said in Edgington v Fitzmaurice, 'the state of a man's mind is just as much a fact as the state of his digestion.' So where Mr Edgington had bought shares after he heard the company was seeking capital to expand, but in reality it was to pay off debts, he was entitled to rescind his purchase.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Development Act 1966 {{changed the}} name of Development Districts (parts of the country {{with higher levels of}} {{unemployment}} than the national average and which governments sought to encourage greater investment in) to Development Areas and increased the percentage of the workforce covered by development schemes from 15% to 20%, which mainly affected rural areas in Scotland and Wales. Tax allowances were replaced by grants in order to extend coverage to include firms which were <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> profit, and in 1967 a Regional Employment Premium was introduced. Whereas the existing schemes tended to favour capital-intensive projects, this aimed {{for the first time at}} increasing employment in depressed areas. Set at £1.50 a man per week and guaranteed for seven years, the Regional Employment Premium subsidised all manufacturing industry (though not services) in Development Areas.|$|E

25|$|The Law of April 6, 1830 of Mexico {{had been}} passed to stop the tide of Anglo {{immigration}} into the country, hoping to safeguard against the annexation of Texas by the United States. The state government of Coahuila y Tejas sent Carbajal and Jose Francisco Madero to conduct land grant surveys in East Texas in January 1831, for settlers who had been residing outside the authority of any other empresario grants prior to 1828. A confrontation about the granting of the titles arose between Madero and Mexican Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn, who was the military governor over Galveston Bay. After correspondence disputing Madero's authority to make the surveys, and Madero's faux pas of <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> courtesy call to discuss the issue, Bradburn issued a directive on February 13, instructing Madero to meet with him. When Madero ignored that order, Bradburn immediately arrested both Madero and Carbajal. The two remained incarcerated for ten days. They were released, pending Bradburn's receiving further direction from Mexico City. Madero and Carbajal resumed their surveying, filing sixty completed land titles. On April 12, the government in Saltillo sent Madero orders to stop surveying in Bradburn's territory, but the work had already been completed by that date.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of Activision's 2010 {{fourth quarter}} {{financial}} report in February 2011, Activision disbanded its Guitar Hero business unit {{and announced that}} it would cease development of the planned 2011 Guitar Hero game. Activision cited [...] "continued declines in the music genre" [...] to explain its decision. The closure also affected the DJ Hero series, as Activision stated that there were no plans to publish a music game during 2011. Activision's vice president Dan Winters later clarified that the company was [...] "just putting Guitar Hero on hiatus" [...] and that they were [...] "just <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> new game for next year, that's all".|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the first two {{landings}} allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as Commander, with two rookies. Apollo 13 launched Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise in April 1970, headed for the Fra Mauro formation. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the Service Module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a [...] "life boat" [...] to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, {{which turned out to be}} a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> tank component according to updated design specifications. Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.|$|E

[...] There is a clockwork mechanism in his base which propels him along the table, and his head lifts off to show a cup, and he would have been used in drinking games.

500|$|Pressman did {{not receive}} any money from Conans box office takings, but he sold the film rights for the Conan {{franchise}} to De Laurentiis for $4.5million and 10percent of the gross of any sequel to Conan the Barbarian. [...] The sale more than paid off his company's debts incurred from producing Old Boyfriends, saving him from financial ruin; Pressman said this deal [...] "made [...] more money by selling out, by <b>not</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> movie, than [...] ever have made by making one." [...] He also arranged for Mattel to obtain the rights to produce a range of toys for the film. [...] Although the toy company abandoned the license after its executives decided Conan was [...] "too violent" [...] for children, Pressman convinced them to let him produce a film based on their new Masters of the Universe toy line. [...] The eponymous film cost $20million to produce and grossed $17million at the United States box office in 1987.|$|E
