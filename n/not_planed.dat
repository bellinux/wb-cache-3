50|$|The Upper Iowa and {{its tributaries}} {{are part of the}} Driftless Area of Iowa, a region that was {{ice-free}} during the last ice age. Unlike areas to the south and west, the area was <b>not</b> <b>planed</b> down by glaciation or covered in glacial drift, with the result that there are steep, high-walled canyons that little resembles what one normally sees in Iowa rivers in the western and southern regions of the state. The lack of any serious development makes this the only river in Iowa eligible for designation as a National Wild and Scenic River. It has not yet attained this status, partly because much of the land and the riverbottom itself are privately owned.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{the past}} decades the {{newspaper}} industry went through many changes {{but it has}} never had a problem of this kind. With the freedom the Internet brings us today and the wide range of information channels, the newspaper is for the first time seriously challenged. When the newspapers began to establish themselves on the internet they thought it was only to copy the content of the newspaper on to their webpage and the advertisers would come along. This move was <b>not</b> <b>planed</b> and had no vision. When the advertisers discovered Internets wide range of advertisement platforms they started to look for other places they could put their ads.   This thesis is about the local newspapers ability to address the problem that the internet has created. I based my study on the following issues: Why has internet caused this problem for the newspapers? What are the prerequisites for local newspapers when they face challenges from the internet? How have the advertisers acted after the emergence of this challenge? To answer these questions I did qualitative interviews with different personalities within the newspaper industry, two local newspaper executives and two professors in media economics.   In conclusion the result shows that there are different opinions regarding these questions and different views of how to solve them. The Newspaper industry is heading towards a new era where the electronic newspaper is going to play a much bigger role. The executives need to come up with new business models where the consumer’s needs are in the center...|$|E

Under these conditions mariculture {{also makes a}} part od sea master plan because demands for mariculture are focused on clean environmental conditions to obtain economic benefits. Increased pressure to the coastal area is global trend and if <b>not</b> <b>planed</b> and organized can provoke conflicts and can affect further development. Under these condition, marine aquaculture is frequent subject of many discussion focused on the environmental impact. Conflict of different interest in coastal area with no argumentation is putting marine aquaculture in worst position related with tourism and industry. Hard argumentations is laying in noneadequate frame of work in some facilities and to take advantake competitors are preasenting marine aquaculture in worst picture. Marine aquaculture product has to be health product, which can be completely damaged because of non-responsible approach of other activity. Mariculture also can suffer from self-pollution as for example tourism and must be well planed and managed. Fecal pollution from towns, pollution from bad controlled tourists activity, industry, influence of intensive and non controlled agriculture in coast line, are also potential danger for quality of all sea products and also cultured products from marine aquaculture. High quality of marine products {{can be obtained by}} zoning of coastal area, and in concept of these zoning it is necessary to define the zones for marine aquaculture. Procedure of zoning has to be divided in three steps: deetrmination of present status of area, definition of shore land for making mariculture related shore infrastructure and definitions of areas suitable for mariculture with limits of production. These can make positive situations with avoiding conflicts in exploitation of common resources in future. Zone for marine aquaculture has to be controlled, with an adequate program of monitoring, and implementation of corrective measures has to be applied. Living resources quality in zones for marine aquaculture must be control and protected from pollutant of others activities, by controlling of polluted water in zone, controlling of emission in land in zone (pesticides and fertilizers), and sanitary control of sea...|$|E

Defining {{of medical and}} psychological assistance volume to women with physiological pregnancy O. Bozhuk National Medical University named after O. O. Bohomolets Department of General and Medical Psychology and Pedagogy Summary. Mother and prenate are in close symbiotic relationship, which manifests itself in the interaction at physiological and psychological levels of organisms’ functioning. Reflexive accepting yourself as a pregnant woman depends also on the the motives of conception, planed / <b>not</b> <b>planed</b> parenthood, social situation and level of psychological and social support. The aim of the research is to determine the volume and structure of medical and psychological assistance. The research was conducted in maternity hospital prenatal consultation centre of Chernihiv City Council and Municipal nonprofit company "Consultation and Diagnostic Center" of Golosiivsky district in Kyiv in 2010 - 2014. The research involved 185 pregnant women whose age ranged from 17 to 36 years old (group 1 μ = 25, 5 ± 0, 27, group 2 -μ = 24, 8 ± 0, 27). Women of group 1 show some fear of future childbirth, which applies to both the woman herself and the unborn child. The course of psychological education was developed for women of group 1, which included not only the educational part regarding the physiology of pregnancy and childbirth, postpartum, etc. but also the part aimed at reducing anxiety and overcoming identified fears. For the women of group 2 psychological influence is required in all researched spheres (personal, psycho-social, psycho-emotional and reproductive) if the fear of future birth is present and vivid. According to conducted research for women of group 2 there were found the next targets of psycho-therapeutic influence which have been taken into account when developing the course of psycho- correction: to normalize psycho-emotional state of the pregnant woman, to reduce anxiety level; to work with identified fears; to normalize emotional relation in the dyad "prenate - mother" and creating the triad "father-mother-prenate"; to normalize family relations and to construct optimal types of family systems; to harmonize personal traits of the pregnant woman. Based on the results of the study proved the need for medical and psychological support to women with physiological pregnancy.
