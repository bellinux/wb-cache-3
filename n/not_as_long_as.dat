5|$|In the skull, {{the front}} part (rostrum) is large, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> in A.budini. The skull is more robust {{than in the}} very similar Akodon boliviensis, but less so than in A.simulator. The hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrower}} than in A.caenosus and not as squared as in A.polopi. Members of the Akodon varius group, with which Akodon oenos was formerly associated, tend to have much broader interorbital regions. The braincase is somewhat inflated and bears well-developed temporal and lambdoid crests relative {{to the situation in}} A.caenosus; Akodon polopi has even better developed crests.|$|E

Anterior femora black, black stripe above and on inner side of patella and tibia I., rest of legs pale yellowish, without any spots. Mandibles and mouth parts red-brown; sternum black. Abdomen black, clothed above and on sides with iridescent scales and long hairs; venter black, hairy, and with two indistinct rows of pale spots. Structure in general similar to Z. bettini, but the mandibles {{are not quite}} so large; and the sternum is much broader, not narrowed in front, so that the anterior coxae, which are <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> in Z. bettini, are more widely separated. The region of the epigynum is red-brown, and is semicircular in outline; showing four pale spots, two in front close together, and one in each posterior corner. Franconia, N. H. (Mrs. Annie T.

500|$|Davis' given {{names are}} Isaac and Benjamin (after his mother's two grandfathers). [...] Although Davis does not {{practice}} Judaism and is non-religious, he stated: [...] "I am {{really proud of}} my Jewish heritage" [...] and describes himself as [...] "culturally Jewish." [...] He reflected: [...] "It's funny about Judaism; It doesn’t matter if you're ultra-religious or <b>not,</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> you know that it's in you or you're a part of it, everyone accepts you." [...] He often uses the Jewish greeting [...] "shalom". [...] Davis states: [...] "I'm glad Jewish kids get to see they can {{grow up to be}} professional baseball players."

500|$|Other critics, such as GameZone's Michael Lafferty, {{were less}} {{reserved}} in their {{praise of the}} narrative—The Electric Playground {{referred to it as}} [...] "a textbook example to other console developers on how to write videogame prose"—but agreed that its complex and involved backstory could alienate some players. The Adrenaline Vault's Mike Laidlaw stated that [...] "the folks at Crystal Dynamics obviously have no kindness in their heart for game reviewers trying desperately to describe the plot". Journalists also commonly cited Soul Reaver 2s poor lifespan and replayability as an issue; the reviewer for Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine opined that [...] "the problem is that there just isn't much gameplay there" [...] and Fielder warned that play [...] "burns bright, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> you'd like".|$|E
500|$|Transandinomys bolivaris is a {{medium-sized}} rice rat with very long superciliary vibrissae (more than [...] long and extending {{well beyond the}} ears when laid back against the head). According to Fiona Reid's Mammals of Southeastern Mexico & Central America, it is distinguishable from any similarly sized rice rats by the length of these whiskers; T.talamancae also has long superciliary vibrissae, but <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> in T.bolivaris. In both species, the mystacial vibrissae (above the mouth) are also long and extend beyond the ears when laid back, but they are again much longer in T.bolivaris. The vibrissae are mostly dark, but translucent at the tips. Handleyomys alfaroi, a rice rat with which young T.bolivaris are often confused, is much smaller. In T.bolivaris, the cheeks may be light gray, , or reddish. The ears are dark brown to black and are sparsely haired.|$|E

500|$|Competing at {{his first}} Olympic Games, Julius Mutekanga {{qualified}} for the London Games via qualification standards because his fastest time of one minute, 46.30 seconds, recorded at the 2011 Ninove Memorial Geert Rasschaert, met the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for his event, the 800 metres. In an interview with New York Press before the Games he said he promised to ensure {{that he would make}} the best of his participation: [...] "When you’re running, you’re looking at improving your personal best time, so it doesn’t matter whether you win or <b>not.</b> <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> you’re running faster and faster, that’s the ultimate goal." [...] Mutekanga took part in the first round's seventh heat on 6 August, finishing fifth out of eight athletes, with a time of one minute and 48.41 seconds. He ranked ahead of Moise Joseph from Haiti (one minute and 48.46 seconds) and Equatorial Guinea's Benjamín Enzema (one minute and 57.47 seconds) in a heat led by Duane Solomon of the United States (one minute and 46.05 seconds). Overall Mutekanga finished 35th out of 52 athletes, and was 2.06 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his heat who advanced to the semi-final and, therefore, {{that was the end of}} his competition.|$|E

2500|$|The Restoration is {{an unusual}} {{historical}} period, as its literature is bounded by a specific political event: {{the restoration of the}} Stuart monarchy. It is unusual in another way, as well, for it is a time when the influence of that king's presence and personality permeated literary society to such an extent that, almost uniquely, literature reflects the court. The adversaries of the restoration, the Puritans and democrats and republicans, similarly respond to the peculiarities of the king and the king's personality. Therefore, a top-down view of the literary history of the Restoration has more validity than that of most literary epochs. [...] "The Restoration" [...] as a critical concept covers the duration of the effect of Charles and Charles's manner. This effect extended beyond his death, in some instances, and <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> his life, in others.|$|E

2500|$|The Duchess often squabbled {{with her}} {{mother-in-law}} on how {{she should be}} addressed at court. As the Tsar’s only daughter, Maria Alexandrovna had precedence over all the Grand Duchesses in Russia. She therefore deeply resented having to give precedence in England to the Princess of Wales. From her birth, Maria Alexandrovna was an Imperial Highness {{as the daughter of}} an Emperor. However, once she married her husband she was only entitled to the style of Royal Highness. Tsar Alexander II alleged that his daughter should continue to be styled as an Imperial Highness, not royal, [...] "as in all civilized countries". Queen Victoria replied that she did not care whether imperial was used or <b>not,</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> royal came first. [...] There was also the added problem that Maria was both Duchess of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess of Russia, and which title should be written first. In retaliation for the quarrel over precedence, the Duchess of Edinburgh took great pleasure in showing off her magnificent jewellery. The English princesses were clearly jealous of her diamonds, as was Queen Victoria. Meriel Buchanan, daughter of the last British ambassador to Imperial Russia, described Maria’s first Drawing Room: [...] "The Queen compared the Duchess’s tiara with those of her own daughters, shrugging her shoulders like a bird whose plumage has been ruffled, her mouth drawn down at the corners, in an expression which those who knew her had learned to dread." ...|$|E
