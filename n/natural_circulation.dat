25|$|The water {{enters the}} boiler through a {{section in the}} {{convection}} pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers {{at the bottom of}} the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by <b>natural</b> <b>circulation</b> (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils.|$|E

25|$|After almost 80minutes of slow {{temperature}} rise, {{the primary}} loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to cavitate as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, {{and it was}} believed that <b>natural</b> <b>circulation</b> would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. About 130minutes after the first malfunction, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the Zircaloy nuclear fuel rod cladding, yielding zirconium dioxide, hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and {{depressurized}} after a failed insulator in the plant's switchyard caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low voltage conditions on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} reactor coolant pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two reactor coolant pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the main generator) and <b>natural</b> <b>circulation</b> had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, secondary side of the plant to aid in the cooling process while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's turbine generator, preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's switchyard.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Natural {{convection}} {{provides a}} means for circulating fluids {{without the use of}} pumps. This type of system is of great interest {{for a wide variety of}} applications, including solar heaters, process industry, and nuclear reactors. Natural convection will play a vital role in the area of passive safety and reliability, particularly for the development of Generation IV nuclear energy systems. This study mainly focuses on the linear stability analysis of asymmetrically heated/cooled natural convection loops with large temperature variations across the heated core. The study targets the Argonne Lead Loop Facility (ALLF), a concept for an experiment loop to support the development of the Secure Transportable Autonomous Reactor-Liquid Metal (STAR-LM) at Argonne National Laboratory, using lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) as the primary reactor coolant. A one-dimensional linear stability analysis is performed and the Nyquist criterion is employed to find the linear stability boundary of both forward and backward circulations. It was found that the <b>natural</b> <b>circulations</b> could be linearly unstable in a high Reynolds number region. Increasing loop friction makes a forward circulation more stable, but destabilizes the corresponding backward circulation under the same heating/cooling conditions. The preliminary results suggest that as the Peclet number decreases, the forward circulation is prone to become unstable while the backward circulation is prone to remain stable...|$|R

40|$|A {{concept for}} a {{greenhouse}} dehumidifier has been designed. Important constraints {{for the design}} are low-energy consumption and homogeneous greenhouse climate. From a survey of dehumidifying methods, condensation to a cooled surface was selected as most promising. Low-energy demand is achieved by <b>natural</b> air <b>circulation</b> through the system and by recovering sensible heat. A homogeneous climate can be realized by decentralized local dehumidification in the greenhouse. Applying a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to simulate fluid flow and heat exchange enabled great improvements in the design. A vertical geometry was chosen first in a double-chimney approach to exploit the vertical distance between inlet and cold surface and that between cold and hot surface for <b>natural</b> convection air <b>circulation.</b> However, CFD calculations indicated stagnating flow in this vertically oriented system.
