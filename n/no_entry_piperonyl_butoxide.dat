40|$|What is <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide?</b> $ <b>Piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> is a {{synergist}} {{used in a}} {{wide variety}} of insecticides (1). Synergists are chemicals that lack pesticidal effects of their own but enhance the pesticidal properties of active ingredients (2). <b>Piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> is used in insecticides containing active ingredients such as pyrethrins, pyrethroids, rotenone, and carbamates (1, 3). See the Pesticide Label box above. $ Researchers developed <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> in 1947 using naturally-occurring safrole as a key raw material (1, 3). $ <b>Piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> is a colorless to pale yellow liquid. It is practically insoluble in water and is stable to hydrolysis and ultraviolet irradiation. Researchers consider <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> to be noncorrosive (4). How does <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> work? $ <b>Piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> inhibits detoxification of pesticides by insects (3, 5). Without <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide,</b> an insect’s metabolic enzymes, specifically a class of enzymes known as Cytochrome P 450, can detoxify an active ingredient before an insecticidal effect can occur. The addition of <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> to a pesticide reduces the dose of the active ingredient required to generate the desired effect (2). $ Researchers propose that <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> inhibits detoxification by binding a <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> metabolite to Cytochrome P 450 enzymes, thus preventing the enzymes from detoxifying pesticides (5). $ <b>Piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide’s</b> effect on Cytochrome P 450 enzymes is biphasic; it both inhibits and induces enzymatic activity. The inhibition of Cytochrome P 450 enzymes occurs rapidly, followed by a slow induction process.

Pretreatment of goats with the inhibitor caused a greater than three-fold increase in the relative bioavailability of fenbendazole and fenbendazole sulphoxide. A pharmacokinetic dose titration study {{was carried out in}} sheep with fenbendazole (5 mg kg(- 1)) and <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> administered orally at 0, 15, 31, 63, 125 and 250 mg kg(- 1). The AUC of fenbendazole and the sulphoxide were significantly increased when fenbendazole was co-admimstered with <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> at dose rates equal to or higher than 31 mg kg(- 1). Peak plasma concentrations (C-max) and mean residence time (MRT) were also significantly increased. The efficacy of the combination was assessed in sheep against two species of benzimidazole-resistant abomasal nematodes; Ostertagia circumcincta and Haemonchus contortus. The percentage reduction in the total number of O. circumcincta worms was 7. 9 % (fenbendazole) and 97. 8 % (fenbendazole-piperonyl butoxide).

BackgroundIron plays a role in free radical-mediated tissue injury, including cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. However, the source of iron (catalyzing free radical reactions) is not known. We examined the role of cytochrome P- 450 {{as a source}} of catalytic iron in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro. MethodsCisplatin-induced acute renal failure was produced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (10 mg/kg body wt). <b>Piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide,</b> a cytochrome P- 450 inhibitor, was administered intraperitoneally (400 mg/kg body wt twice at 48 -hr intervals) prior to cisplatin injection. The effects of cisplatin in the absence or presence of <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> on the belomycin-detectable iron, cytochrome P- 450 content in the kidney, and renal functional and histological changes were evaluated. In an in vitro study, the effect of cytochrome P- 450 inhibitors, cimetidine or <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide,</b> on cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and catalytic iron release from LLC-PK 1 cells was examined. ResultsIn cisplatin-treated rats, there was a marked decrease in the cytochrome P- 450 content specifically in the kidney, accompanied by increased bleomycin-detectable iron content in the kidney. <b>Piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> prevented cisplatin-induced loss of cytochrome P- 450 as well as the increase of bleomycin-detectable iron in the kidney, along with both functional and histological protection.

The 3 HCP 55940 and 3 HSR 141716 A binding data suggest that study compounds modify radioligand binding allosterically.

The current study suggests that the level of metabolic resistance depends on the structure of the molecule and that structurally different compounds may still be effective because detoxifying enzymes are unable to bind to these uncommon structures. Treated surface contact bioassays were performed on susceptible Aedes aegypti, East African knockdown resistance (kdr) Anopheles gambiae (strain RSP-H) and metabolically resistant Anopheles funestus (strain FUMOZ-R) with different pyrethroids, such as cypermethrin, ß-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, permethrin and transfluthrin (alone and in combination with the synergist <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide).</b> The nonfluorinated form of transfluthrin was also assessed as a single agent and in combination with <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide.</b> Although the dosages for pyrethroids containing a phenoxybenzyl moiety have exhibited differences in terms of effectiveness among the three tested mosquito species, the structurally different transfluthrin with a polyfluorobenzyl moiety remained active in mosquitoes with upregulated P 450 levels. In trials with transfluthrin mixed with <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide,</b> the added synergist exhibited no efficacy-enhancing effect. The {{results of this study suggest}} that transfluthrin has the potential to control P 450 -mediated metabolically resistant mosquitoes because the structural formula of transfluthrin differs from that of the tested pyrethroids, which are used in vector control. The P 450 -detoxifying enzymes of the Anopheles funestus FUMOZ-R mosquitoes seem to bind preferably at the phenoxybenzyl moiety and appear to be unable to degrade transfluthrin with its tetrafluorobenzyl moiety. Inhibition of the class of monooxygenases by <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> revealed no increase of efficacy of the pure transfluthrin compound, which also indicates that the P 450 enzymes potentially do not impact the efficacy of transfluthrin...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{importance}} of sandflies in the transmission of cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Al-Gassim Region, Saudi Arabia, this study was carried out. The main objective was to describe the prevalence and distribution of sandflies and their susceptibility to insecticides used in three different areas in the region. Castor oil coated paper traps and insect collecting aspirators were employed in sampling three different environments in three selected sites in Al-Gassim, for two seasons. Two pyrethroid-based insecticides, Scidco Fog (0. 54 % permethrin + 0. 15 % S-Bioallethrin + 0. 75 % <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide)</b> and Aralin (2 % tetramethrin + 11 % cypermethrin + 18 % <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide)</b> were used for sandfly control, for two active seasons. The results of the study indicated that only one species of sandflies, Phlebotomus papatasi, predominates in the region and that 38. 7 and 36. 5 % of all the insects collected were in farms and primitive houses, respectively. The performance of Scidco Fog was superior over Aralin, their effect was 91. 9 and 81. 1 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Oxibendazole (OBZ) was {{administered}} to eight horses at an oral dose of 10 mg kg(- 1) bodyweight each. Parent OBZ could only be detected in plasma at the 0. 5 and 1. 0 hours post administration sampling times and the mean maximum plasma concentration was 0. 008 mug ml(- 1). Parent OBZ was detected in faeces between 12 and 72 hours after administration and the highest dry faecal concentration was detected at 24 hours. An unidentified metabolite was detected in plasma between 0. 5 and 72 hours. The unidentified metabolite in the plasma of treated horses corresponded to the second eluted metabolite in the in vitro study. Metabolism Of OBZ to its metabolite in vitro was significantly inhibited by co-incubation with the cytochrome P 450 inhibitor <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide.</b> These results indicated that first-pass metabolism decreases OBZ bioavailability in horses. The in vitro metabolism of OBZ was significantly inhibited by <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> and this could be utilised to extend the exposure of nematodes to the parent molecule.

40|$|The role of esterases and monooxygenase in the detoxication vii {{processes}} of field populations of pea aphids was studied {{in relation to}} seasonal changes, developmental stage, and treatment with DEF and <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide.</b> LCSO values for 12 hour exposure periods in glass vials ra nged from 0. 04 - 2. 3 micrograms / vial and 820 - 4871 J. Jg/vial for paraoxon and carbaryl, respectively. Topical bioassays showed the adults to be more tolerant to paraoxon (LDSO of 1. 4 - 12. 3 ng/aphid) toxicity than nymphs (LDSO of 0. 13 - 4. 7 ng/aphid). Treatment with DEF® (S,S. S-tributylphosphorotrithioate) enhanced paraoxon toxicity against the pea aphid whereas <b>piperonyl</b> <b>butoxide</b> {{had little effect on}} the enhancement of either paraoxon or carbaryl toxicity. The higher synergistic effect of DEF indicates a greater dependency upon esterases in detoxifying paraoxon. The high LC 5 O values of carbaryl toxicity may indicate that part of the pea aphid tolerance to carbaryl is attributable to a mechanism other than detoxication. The percent dependency values were 29 - 98...|$|R
