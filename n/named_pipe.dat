On 13 July 2010, he was made an honorary fellow of Cardiff University, and on 28 January 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate at the University of Sussex, for his work campaigning for people suffering from mental health problems, bipolar disorder and HIV. He is a Patron of the Norwich Playhouse theatre and a Vice-President of The NoÃ«l Coward Society. Fry {{was the last person}} to be <b>named</b> <b>Pipe</b> Smoker of the Year before the award was discontinued. In 2017, Fry became the latest patron of the Norwich Film Festival, and said he was [...] "Very proud now to be a patron of a festival that encourages people from Norfolk, Norwich and beyond to be enchanted, beguiled and entranced by all kinds of film that might not otherwise reach them." ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>named</b> <b>pipe</b> {{can be used}} to {{transfer}} information from one application to another without the use of an intermediate temporary file. For example, you can pipe the output of gzip into a <b>named</b> <b>pipe</b> like so: mkfifo -m 0666 /tmp/namedPipe gzip -d < file.gz > /tmp/namedPipeThen load the uncompressed data into a MySQL table like so: LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/namedPipe' INTO TABLE tableName;Without this <b>named</b> <b>pipe</b> one would need to write out the entire uncompressed version of file.gz before loading it into MySQL. Writing the temporary file is both time consuming and results in more I/O and less free space on the hard drive.|$|E
5000|$|In computing, a <b>named</b> <b>pipe</b> (also {{known as}} a FIFO for its behavior) is an {{extension}} to the traditional pipe concept on Unix and Unix-like systems, {{and is one of}} the methods of inter-process communication (IPC). The concept is also found in OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, although the semantics differ substantially. A traditional pipe is [...] "unnamed" [...] and lasts only as long as the process. A <b>named</b> <b>pipe,</b> however, can last as long as the system is up, beyond the life of the process. It can be deleted if no longer used. Usually a <b>named</b> <b>pipe</b> appears as a file, and generally processes attach to it for IPC.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} where a handler saved {{the day was}} in ISC's {{diskless}} workstation support, where a bug in the implementation meant that using <b>named</b> <b>pipes</b> on the workstation could induce undesirable resource locking on the fileserver. A handler was created on the workstation to field accesses to the afflicted <b>named</b> <b>pipes</b> until the appropriate kernel fixes could be developed. This handler required approximately 5 kilobytes of code to implement, an indication that a non-trivial handler {{did not need to}} be large.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{the band}} {{changed its name}} to The Scottish & Irish Imports Pipe Band due to a {{sponsorship}} change, and was upgraded to Grade One. In 1990 Mike Green was <b>named</b> <b>Pipe</b> Major, and after competing under the Denny & Dunipace name during the 1990 season, the band was renamed to the City of Washington Pipe Band to avoid confusion with a new Pipe Band of the same name.

25|$|Each Net-Lib {{supported}} {{network protocol}} has a separate driver (not {{to be confused}} with a device driver), and has support for a session layer in its protocol stack. There are two general types of Net-Lib: the primary and the secondary. The primary Net-Lib consists of a Super Socket Net-Lib and the Shared Memory Net-Lib, while there are numerous secondary Net-Libs, including TCP/IP and <b>named</b> <b>pipes</b> network libraries (<b>named</b> <b>pipes</b> are a method of communicating with other processes via a system-persistent pipeline that is given an identity). The Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB) communicates via primary Net-Libs.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are very}} rarely seen by users, {{but there are}} notable exceptions. The VMware Workstation PC {{hardware}} virtualization tool, for instance, can expose emulated serial ports to the host system as <b>named</b> <b>pipes,</b> and the WinDbg kernel mode debugger from Microsoft supports <b>named</b> <b>pipes</b> as a transport for debugging sessions (in fact, VMware and WinDbg can be coupled together - since WinDbg normally requires a serial connection to the target computer - letting driver developers do their development and testing on a single computer). Both programs require the user to enter names in the [...] form.|$|R
