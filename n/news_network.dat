5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime <b>News</b> <b>Network</b> {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E

John Rose of the Fandom Post considered {{the team of}} Allen and fellow Exorcist Yu Kanda the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. In a later review, Rose enjoyed the plotline in which Allen was unable to distinguish innocents from Akumas. Allen's rematch with enemy Noah Tyki Mikk was praised by Casey Brienza of Anime <b>News</b> <b>Network.</b> Brienza also liked his new abilities, the Innocence Crown Clown and Allen's sword, comparing it to a sword in Final Fantasy VII wielded by protagonist Cloud Strife. Reviewing the same fight, Otaku USAs Joseph Luster praised Allen's development during the series and enjoyed his battle with Tyki. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin liked Allen's situation in volume 21, and wanted {{to see more of}} the same instead of the focus on Kanda's fight against the Akuma of Alma Karma. During Allen's imprisonment for saving Alma, Anne Lauenroth of Anime <b>News</b> <b>Network</b> found the growing camaraderie between Allen and Tyki interesting; it led to Allen's decision to leave the Order after putting his comrades in danger, and his goodbye to Lenalee was mournful.|$|E

5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those {{belonging to the}} Big Three television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All three networks erroneously reported that Brady had died.
