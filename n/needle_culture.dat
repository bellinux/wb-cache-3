40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Transthoracic needle {{aspiration}} (TNA) with an ultrathin needle is a {{safe and}} highly specific procedure for obtaining a diagnosis in bacterial pneumonias, but its sensitivity is at best 70 %. A study was performed to assess whether Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b antigen detection by latex agglutination from the TNA sample enhanced the diagnostic yield. METHODS [...] Blood cultures, TNA with an ultrathin <b>needle</b> (<b>culture,</b> Gram stain, and latex agglutination), serological tests, and pneumococcal antigen detection in the urine by counterimmunoelectrophoresis were performed in samples from 18 of 23 consecutive patients with severe community acquired pneumonia. RESULTS [...] The causative organism was identified in 16 cases (88 %) : S pneumoniae (10 cases), S pneumoniae plus H influenzae (two cases), Legionella pneumophila (three cases), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (one case). The investigation of antigens by latex agglutination in the pulmonary aspirate increased the diagnostic yield of TNA from 50 % to 78 % and provided a rapid diagnosis (in less than two hours) with therapeutic implications in seven cases. Its effectiveness was not modified by prior antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS [...] A latex agglutination test on the pulmonary aspirate enhances the diagnostic yield of TNA in severe community acquired pneumonia...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are a {{major source}} of infections {{associated}} with indwelling medical devices. Many antiseptic agents are used in hygienic handwash to prevent nosocomial infections by Staphylococci. Our aim was to determine the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance to quaternary ammonium compound of 46 S. aureus strains and 71 CoNS. Methods S. aureus (n = 46) isolated from auricular infection and CoNS (n = 71), 22 of the strains isolated from dialysis fluids and 49 of the strains isolated from <b>needles</b> <b>cultures</b> were investigated. Erythromycin resistance genes (erm A, erm B, erm C, msr A and mef) were analysed by multiplex PCR and disinfectant-resistant genes (qac A, qac B, and qac C) were studied by PCR-RFLP. Results The frequency of erythromycin resistance genes in S. aureus was: erm A+ 7. 7 %, erm B+ 13. 7 %, erm C+ 6 % and msr A+ 10. 2 %. In addition, the number of positive isolates in CoNS was respectively erm A+ (9. 4 %), erm B+ (11. 1 %), erm C+ (27. 4 %), and msr A+ (41 %). The MIC analyses revealed that 88 isolates (74 %) were resistant to quaternary ammonium compound-based disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BC). 56 % of the BC-resistant staphylococcus isolates have {{at least one of the}} three resistant disinfectants genes (qac A, qac B and qac C). Nine strains (7. 7 %) among the CoNS species and two S. aureus strains (2 %) harboured the three- qac genes. In addition, the qac C were detected in 41 strains. Conclusions Multi-resistant strains towards macrolide and disinfectant were recorded. The investigation of antibiotics and antiseptic-resistant CoNS may provide crucial information on the control of nosocomial infections. </p...|$|R
40|$|Though India has {{the state}} of art medical {{facilities}} on par with global standards for a comparatively cheaper cost with best knowledge, the bio-waste management protocols of many hospitals are far below the international standards. An {{effort was made to}} understand the bio-waste management procedures of big hospitals by making a critical analysis of bio waste generated. Biomedical waste includes syringes, live vaccines, laboratory samples, body parts, bodily fluids and waste, sharp <b>needles,</b> <b>cultures</b> and lancets. Based on the parameters of number of beds occupied and number of operations performed on any single day of the observation period of 30 days and comparing with the International Standards mentioned by World Health Organization, an analysis was made to understand whether the hospitals are following the quality parameters implemented by them. After 30 days of evaluation of biomedical waste management protocol at B. L Kapur hospital, New Delhi, it is found that the amount of hazardous bio-medical waste generated/bed/day exceeds the limit as per the international standards. For this study, the labeling component of the protocol for waste management for various departments was documented, to understand the protocol adopted. Through analysis it is concluded that to avoid hazardous effects, all major hospitals should seriously train their staff about the perilous effects of bio-waste and segregating and labeling them properly for disposal by launching a waste management protocol. It is also suggested that by recording the amount of general waste as well as bio-waste generated and conducting periodical surveillance of health care waste management practices, the hospitals can help the hospitals in protecting the environment. As it is an area of much concern, further studies can also be made to understand the impact of such negligible way of handling bio-medical wastes and the impact of such acts on the community...|$|R

40|$|Summary: In two {{children}} ages 8 months and 4 years, tuberculous synovitis {{of the knee}} was suggested by pathologic examination of synovial tissue obtained through <b>needle</b> biopsy. <b>Culture</b> of the biopsy material was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one case. In this child, the tuberculin test was negative, {{in the absence of}} anergy, at the time the child was first evaluated, and the primary lung lesion was not identified by the radiologist. Tuberculous synovitis has not previously been recognized as part of primary tuberculosis during the early weeks when the tuberculin skin test may be negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive modality for demonstrating joint fluid, synovial hypertrophy, and associated osteomyelitis, if present. With the increasing frequency of cases of tuberculosis in the population, greater awareness of the risk of tuberculous arthritis in childhood is important in order to recognize this unusual presentation. If negative early on, the tuberculin skin test should be repeated after 6 weeks of arthritis. A needle biopsy of the synovium is helpful and appropriate in all children with monoarticular arthritis who have a positive tuberculin skin test...|$|R

40|$|Case report. OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this work}} is to {{describe}} a case of infected vertebroplasty due to uncommon bacteria solved surgically with 2 years of follow-up and to discuss 6 other cases found in literature. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Vertebroplasty is a well-known and useful technique {{for the treatment of}} painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Complications, such as cord or root compression or pulmonary embolisms, are infrequent and are mainly related with the frequent escape of cement throughout the vertebral veins. Infection is even more rare, but when it occurs is difficult to manage and can be a life-threatening complication. METHODS: A 63 -year-old-man had a spondylitis of L 2 after vertebroplasty. The patient was initially managed with antibiotics without clinical improvement. Surgical treatment by anterior debridement and anterior and posterior stabilization was done. The bacteria isolated from the intraoperative cultures were Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Burkholderia cepacia. After surgery, the patient was treated with antibiotics for 3 month. RESULTS: After 2 years of follow-up, the patient was free of pain, without signs of infection, and a correct fusion was achieved. CONCLUSION: When facing an infected vertebroplasty, initial conservative treatment with <b>needle</b> biopsy <b>culture</b> and antibiotic administration are a rational option to start. If this treatment fails, surgical debridement is then indicated in order to remove the infected tissue and the acrylic cement and to stabilize the spine. Although this can be an effective treatment, it could be a difficult and hazardous surgical procedure...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{long-term}} analysis {{of a group of}} patients with infected arthroplasties of the hip or the knee. We identified 28 patients with an infected arthroplasty (22 hips, 6 knees) documented by bacterial culture or on direct examination. At the time of diagnosis and on follow-up (a mean of 46 months after treatment) we evaluated the clinical picture, the radiological appearances of the articulation and the biological parameters. 19 / 28 patients showed a typical clinical picture, whereas in 9 others the picture was more doubtful. The treatments were 14 two-stage replacements of the arthroplasties, 7 simple resections, 5 conservative treatments and 2 one-stage replacements. On follow-up, 25 patients were considered as cured of their infection and 3 as failures. From a functional viewpoint, 9 patients showed no limitation, whereas 19 were limited in the daily activity. Half of the patients had no pain. Radiology showed that 20 / 26 evaluated patients had no signs of recurrence. Paraclinical examinations are important in the diagnosis of persistent low grade infections, particularly the demonstration of bacteria by pre-surgical sampling (fine <b>needle</b> aspiration, <b>culture</b> from draining sinuses). In spite of the cure of infection, the functional and painful sequellae are often considerable. As a result of our experience, we recommend a two-stage surgical procedure. Only when the general condition of the patient is poor, or when the infection is not under control, would we envisage an alternative procedure (arthrodesis, girdelstone, conservative) ...|$|R
30|$|An easy to perform, minimal {{invasive}} {{diagnostic technique}} for {{the identification of}} the causative pathogen of cellulitis and erysipelas, such as <b>needle</b> aspiration <b>cultures,</b> would be very helpful, particularly in view of the increasing incidence of skin and soft tissue infections and considering the spread of resistant bacteria such as community-associated methicillin resistant S. aureus. However, information on how to perform needle aspiration and on its clinical utility is rather scarce and conflicting. As some authors favour the margin of the lesion as best localisation to perform needle aspiration (Sachs 1990; Epperly 1986), we began study with this technique. However, the results were disappointing, as none of the 25 aspirates showed a positive result. The subsequent change to the site of maximal inflammation yielded somewhat better results. However, sensitivity did not exceed 15  % even for those patients who did not have prior antibiotic treatment. The rate of positive <b>needle</b> aspirate <b>cultures</b> in our study is congruent to some earlier studies (Newell and Norden 1988; Patel Wylie et al. 2011; Epperly 1986; Goldgeier 1983; Howe et al. 1987), while others reported positive results in up to 36.4  % (Sigurdsson and Gudmundsson 1989) and even 81  % (Lee et al. 1985). In this study by Lee et al., only 21 patients with cellulitis were studied and in those without antibiotic treatment, 9 / 11 (81  %) had positive results. The authors immediately suspended the aspirate in 0.2  ml saline and inoculated the suspension directly in the microbiological laboratory. We also tried to perform the microbiological cultures as soon as possible after aspiration, however, the delay may have been larger, as the aspirates were transported to the microbiological laboratory with the other routine microbiological specimens and processed only during standard working times (8  am– 5  pm, and 8  am– 12  am during holidays) Another difference was the technique used for aspiration. We performed a technique of aspiration used in most studies injecting 0.5  ml sterile saline before aspiration (Newell and Norden 1988; Sachs 1990; Lebre et al. 1996; Epperly 1986). Lee et al. (1985) did not inject a small amount of saline but used an empty syringe moving forward and backward the needle in different directions, comparable to puncture for cytological evaluation. However, the high sensitivity found by Lee et al. may be related to differences in the study populations. A substantial number of Lee’s patients needed surgical intervention during the hospitalisation. Therefore this study population may not have represented the usual patients with cellulitis or erysipelas. In our study the aspiration was performed by different attending physicians of the emergency department. Even if these physicians were trained in the technique, the number of aspirations performed by each physician was relatively low. Better result may be obtained if only a few, well trained persons perform the aspirations. We did not find a difference in sensitivity between erysipelas and cellulitis. As cellulitis involves subcutaneous tissue, intradermal aspiration {{may not be the best}} method. However, as the technique is rather demanding and clinical differentiation between cellulitis and erysipelas sometimes difficult, we do not think differentiated aspiration technique would have enhanced sensitivity.|$|R

The relation between increasing lag phase and increasing dosages of radiation is represented by a logarithmic straight line.

40|$|AbstractRoutine cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) medical care includes invasive procedures {{that may be}} difficult for young children and adolescents to tolerate because of anxiety, concern with health status, or unfamiliarity with the performed tasks. A growing body of pediatric psychology literature suggests that behavior therapy can effectively increase patient cooperation with stressful medical procedures such as tracheostomy care and <b>needle</b> sticks. Throat <b>cultures</b> are obtained at least quarterly in the outpatient setting or more frequently if a CF patient develops respiratory symptoms. Obtaining a throat culture from an anxious and uncooperative child poses a significant challenge for physicians, since the child may demonstrate emotional distress and avoidant behavior that disrupts efficient specimen collection during a routine clinic visit. The use of behavioral interventions, such as relaxation exercises, diaphragmatic breathing, differential reinforcement, gradual exposure, and systematic desensitization, is beneficial in addressing this commonly encountered problem in CF care. This case series describes the implementation of a behavioral therapy protocol utilizing two interventions, gradual exposure and systematic desensitization, in two young CF patients for the treatment of behavioral distress with routine throat cultures. The behavioral interventions were simple and transferred easily from mock procedures to actual specimen collection. Moreover, these cases highlight the important roles of the pediatric psychology staff on a comprehensive multidisciplinary CF care team to improve patient cooperation with routine clinic procedures and the medical treatment regimen overall...|$|R

Few conifer cDNA libraries have been sequenced. Because of {{the high level of}} sequence conservation between Pinus and Picea we have investigated the use of arrays from one genus for studies of gene expression in the other. The partial cDNAs from 384 identifiable genes expressed in differentiating xylem of Pinus taeda were printed on nylon membranes in randomized replicates. These were hybridized with labelled cDNA from <b>needles</b> or embryogenic <b>cultures</b> of Pinus taeda, P. sylvestris and Picea abies, and with labelled cDNA from leaves of Nicotiana tabacum. The Spearman correlation of gene expression for pairs of conifer species was high for needles (r 2 = 0. 78 − 0. 86), and somewhat lower for embryogenic cultures (r 2 = 0. 68 − 0. 83). The correlation of gene expression for tobacco leaves and needles of each of the three conifer species was lower but sufficiently high (r 2 = 0. 52 − 0. 63) to suggest that many partial gene sequences are conserved in angiosperms and gymnosperms. Heterologous probing was further used to identify tissue-specific gene expression over species boundaries. To evaluate the significance of differences in gene expression, conventional parametric tests were compared with permutation tests after four methods of normalization. Permutation tests after Z-normalization provide the highest degree of discrimination but may enhance the probability of type I errors. It is concluded that arrays of cDNA from loblolly pine are useful for studies of gene expression in other pines or spruces...|$|R

Latex agglutination and PCR had sensitivities of 52. 2 and 91. 3 %, specificities of 88. 7 and 83. 3 %, positive predictive values of 62. 3 and 65. 6 %, and negative predictive values of 83. 3 and 96. 5 %, respectively, when culture techniques were used as the “gold standard. ” When we considered expanded criteria for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia as a standard for our calculations, latex agglutination and PCR had sensitivities of 53. 6 and 89. 7 %, specificities of 93. 0 and 90. 0 %, positive predictive values of 78. 9 and 81. 3 %, and negative predictive values of 80. 3 and 94. 7 %, respectively. The additional diagnosis provided by the PCR assay compared to latex agglutination was 12. 2 % (95 % confidence interval of the difference from 0. 4 to 20. 1 %). PCR was more sensitive than TNA culture, particularly in patients who had received prior antibiotic therapy (83. 3 versus 33. 3 %). Although PCR is a very sensitive and specific technique, it has not proved to be cost-effective in clinical practice.

After 4 - 6 wk growth and 4 d fusion in media containing normal physiologic concentrations of insulin (22 pM) and glucose (5. 5 mM), both basal (5. 21 +/- 0. 79 vs 9. 01 +/- 1. 25 %, P < 0. 05) and acute insulin-stimulated (9. 35 +/- 1. 81 vs 16. 31 +/- 2. 39, P < 0. 05) GS fractional velocity were reduced in NIDDM compared to ND cells. Determination of GS kinetic constants from muscle cells of NIDDM revealed an increased basal and insulin-stimulated Km(0. 1) for UDP-glucose, a decreased insulin-stimulated Vmax(0. 1) and an increased insulin-stimulated activation constant (A(0. 5)) for glucose- 6 -phosphate. GS protein expression, determined by Western blotting, was decreased in NIDDM compared to ND cells (1. 57 +/- 0. 29 vs 3. 30 +/- 0. 41 arbitrary U/mg protein, P < 0. 05). GS mRNA abundance also tended to be lower, but not significantly so (0. 168 +/- 0. 017 vs 0. 243 +/- 0. 035 arbitrary U, P = 0. 08), in myotubes of NIDDM subjects. These results indicate that skeletal muscle cells of NIDDM subjects grown and fused in normal culture conditions retain defects of basal and insulin-stimulated GS activity that involve altered kinetic behavior and possibly reduced GS protein expression. We conclude that impaired regulation of skeletal muscle GS in NIDDM patients is not completely reversible in normal culture conditions and involves mechanisms that may be genetic in origin...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that diversion {{of the first}} milliliter of venipuncture blood—the initial specimen diversion technique (ISDT) —would eliminate incompletely sterilized fragments of skin from the culture specimen and significantly reduce our blood culture contamination rate (R). We studied our hypothesis prospectively beginning with our control culture (C) definition: one venipuncture with two sequentially obtained specimens, 10 ml each, the first specimen (M 1) for aerobic and the second (M 2) for anaerobic media. The test ISDT culture (D) was identical, with the exception that each was preceded by diverting a 1 -ml sample (DS) from the same venipuncture. During {{the first of two}} sequential 9 -month periods, we captured D versus C data (n = 3, 733), where DMXR and CMXR are R for D and C specimens. Our hypothesis predicted DS would divert soiled skin fragments from DM 1, and therefore, CM 1 R would be significantly greater than DM 1 R. This was confirmed by CM 1 R (30 / 1, 061 [2. 8 %]) less DM 1 R (37 / 2, 672 [1. 4 %]; P = 0. 005), which equals 1. 4 %. For the second 9 -month follow-up period, data were compiled for all cultures (n = 4, 143), where ADMXR is R for all (A) diversion specimens, enabling comparison to test ISDT. Our hypothesis predicted no significant differences for test ISDT versus all ISDT. This was confirmed by DM 1 R (37 / 2, 672 [1. 4 %]) versus ADM 1 R (42 / 4, 143 [1. 0 %]; P = 0. 17) and DM 2 R (21 / 2, 672 [0. 80 %]) versus ADM 2 R (39 / 4, 143 [0. 94 %]; P = 0. 50). We conclude that our hypothesis is valid: venipuncture <b>needles</b> soil blood <b>culture</b> specimens with unsterilized skin fragments and increase R, and ISDT significantly reduces R from venipuncture-obtained blood culture specimens...|$|R
40|$|The {{often cited}} and criticized {{statistic}} stating {{one in four}} college women will be a victim of some form of assault while in college (Koss, 1985) has regained traction {{over the last several}} years due, in part, to renewed efforts by the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights to redefine Title IX and place many high profile schools under investigation. While laws such as Title IX, The Campus SaVE Act, The Violence Against Women Act and Office of Civil rights guidance documents have sought to force colleges and universities to address the issue, they fall short of addressing the root causes of gender-based violence. This additional piece could help us make the cultural shift away from acceptance of the inevitability of gender-based violence. Sexual immaturity and adherence to outdated and unhealthy gender roles related to sex could be factors that contribute to gender-based violence. Most high school students in the United States are not required to receive sex education. Thus, first time students enter college with a variable range of knowledge and experiences regarding sex. Add to this traditional, and sometimes restrictive, gender roles and media portrayals, and it becomes difficult to address something as serious and uncomfortable as sexual assault and gender-based violence in a meaningful and substantive way. Traditional prevention efforts and bystander training may help increase student awareness and reporting. However, gaining an understanding of student attitudes when they enter college may help schools provide a more nuanced approach to prevention training and education. These combined efforts can ultimately begin to move the <b>needle</b> toward a <b>culture</b> change. This dissertation in practice exists in two parts. Part one introduces the issue of gender-based violence on college campuses and examines the current discourse surrounding this complicated issue. In part two, this information will be used to develop a pedagogical survey for use in first year seminar courses that will result in a class text and drive discussion about sexual education and sexual gender roles...|$|R
