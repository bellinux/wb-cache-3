25|$|In 1944, Anderson {{went to the}} Los Alamos National Laboratory, {{where he}} participated in using the Omega reactor to {{determine}} the critical mass of uranium-235. In preparation for the first nuclear device test on July 16, 1945, which was codenamed Trinity, Anderson, with his radiochemist colleagues, developed a method of determining the <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> by collecting fission products at the detonation site. This technique was later perfected for <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> determinations through the analysis of airborne fission products.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{it was thought}} an attack causing almost {{complete}} loss of life could be achieved {{with the use of}} less than 15 percent of the total <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> available to the Soviets.|$|E
25|$|Out of 25 one-point safety tests {{conducted}} in 1957 and 1958, seven had zero or slight <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> (success), three had high yields of 300 t to 500 t (severe failure), {{and the rest}} had unacceptable yields between those extremes.|$|E
50|$|Various {{models and}} pit options gave <b>nuclear</b> <b>yields</b> of 8, 26, 80, 154, and 160 kilotons for Mark 6 models.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear weapons safety {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study {{the possibility of a}} nuclear weapon detonation during an accident. On July 26, 1957, a safety experiment, Pascal-A, was detonated in an unstemmed hole at NTS, becoming the first underground shaft nuclear test. The knowledge gained here would provide data to prevent <b>nuclear</b> <b>yields</b> in case of accidental detonations-for example, in a plane crash.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} simple analytical formulae {{constructed to}} approximate the temporal {{behavior of the}} temperature, density, and radius of various presupernova shells immediately after {{the arrival of the}} supernova shock wave. The formulae are derived from detailed hydrodynamical simulation of the supernova envelope expulsion. When used within traditional nuclear kinetic codes, the formulae are expected to be a useful tool for adjusting the resulting <b>nuclear</b> <b>yields</b> to current supernova models...|$|R
25|$|Neither {{of these}} effects is likely with {{implosion}} weapons {{since there is}} normally insufficient fissile material to form a critical mass without the correct detonation of the lenses. However, the earliest implosion weapons had pits so close to criticality that accidental detonation with some <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> was a concern.|$|E
25|$|With an {{estimated}} Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6, the eruption was equivalent to about 13,000 times the <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> of the Little Boy bomb (13 to 16 kt) that devastated Hiroshima, Japan, during World War II, {{and four times}} the yield of Tsar Bomba (50 Mt), the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.|$|E
25|$|The 'unimproved' British Polaris A3T carried three 200 kt warheads {{designated}} ET.317 in U.S. Mk-2 RVs, {{composed of}} a primary known as Jennie and a thermonuclear secondary known as Reggie. The integrated upgraded Polaris system was known as A3TK and carried two warheads in upgraded British-designed RVs. These warheads used the new Harriet primary with Reggie re-used from the ET.317 warhead, and their <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> increased to 225 kt. This system was in service from 1982 to 1996, when it was replaced by Trident D5.|$|E

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{of the expected}} gamma-ray signatures of galactic supernovae of all types are performed in order to estimate {{the significance of the}} lack of a gamma-ray signal due to supernovae occurring during the last millenium. Using recent estimates of <b>nuclear</b> <b>yields,</b> we determine galactic supernova rates consistent with the historic supernova record and the gamma-ray limits. Another objective of these calculations of galactic supernova histories is their application to surveys of diffuse galactic gamma-ray line emission...|$|R

2500|$|The {{first test}} {{explosion}} at Yucca Flat came after five prior atmospheric tests at nearby Area 5 {{as part of}} Operation Ranger. On October 22, 1951, the [...] "Able" [...] test of Operation Buster was detonated {{at the top of}} a tower in Area 7, resulting in a <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> less than an equivalent kilogram of TNT; the shot was a fizzle. It was the world's first failure of a nuclear device. Over the next two weeks, four successful tests were conducted via airdrop, with bomber aircraft releasing nuclear weapons over Area 7.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} British {{thermonuclear}} weapons, the tritium gas {{used in the}} bomb core was purchased from the United States {{as part of the}} 1958 USâ€“UK Mutual Defence Agreement; that permitted the US to obtain UK weapons-grade plutonium, in exchange for enriched uranium, tritium, and other specialised material uneconomical to produce in the UK in the very small quantities required. [...] An industrial plant codenamed Candle located adjacent to the Chapelcross nuclear power station, near the town of Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, was built to recover tritium from time-expired service weapons returned for routine maintenance, or servicing. [...] It was then recycled after re-lifing. [...] All boosted fission weapons use tritium, which decays with time, reducing the designed fission yield by approx 4.4% per year. [...] Reduction in the fission yield of a primary will reduce the thermonuclear <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> by a similar proportion, or even lead to the thermonuclear fusion stage failing to ignite. [...] To maintain optimum yield, all versions of WE.177 required routine maintenance at intervals of three years or slightly more. [...] Normal servicing was carried out by specialist teams of RAF Armourers.|$|E
2500|$|One {{particularly}} dangerous warhead was Livermore's W47, {{designed for}} the Polaris submarine missile. The last test before the 1958 moratorium was a one-point test of the W47 primary, which had an unacceptably high <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> of [...] of TNT equivalent (Hardtack II Titania). With the test moratorium in force, {{there was no way}} to refine the design and make it inherently one-point safe. Los Alamos had a suitable primary that was one-point safe, but rather than share with Los Alamos the credit for designing the first SLBM warhead, Livermore chose to use mechanical safing on its own inherently unsafe primary. The result was a safety scheme consisting of a boron-coated wire inserted into the hollow pit at manufacture. The warhead was armed by withdrawing the wire onto a spool driven by an electric motor. Once withdrawn, the wire could not be re-inserted. [...] The wire had a tendency to become brittle during storage, and break or get stuck during arming, preventing complete removal and rendering the warhead a dud. It was estimated that 50-75% of warheads would fail. This required a complete rebuild of the W47 primaries. The oil used for lubricating the wire also promoted corrosion of the pit.|$|E

50|$|According to South Korean and Japanese estimates, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>yield</b> was {{equivalent}} to about 10 kilotons of TNT (10 kt), generating about a 5.3 magnitude seismic shock. This {{would make the}} explosion the largest North Korean nuclear test.|$|E

50|$|All current {{thermonuclear}} weapons use a {{fission bomb}} {{as a first}} stage to create the high temperatures and pressures necessary to start a fusion reaction between deuterium and tritium in a second stage. For many years, nuclear weapon designers have researched whether {{it is possible to}} create high enough temperatures and pressures inside a confined space to ignite a fusion reaction, without using fission. Pure fusion weapons offer the possibility of generating very small <b>nuclear</b> <b>yields</b> and the advantage of reduced collateral damage stemming from fallout because these weapons would not create the highly radioactive byproducts associated with fission-type weapons. These weapons would be lethal not only because of their explosive force, which could be large compared to bombs based on chemical explosives, but also because of the neutrons they generate.|$|R
40|$|An {{essential}} {{aspect of}} studying the nuclei important for cosmochemistry is their production in stars. Over the grant period, we have {{further developed the}} Clemson/American University of Beirut stellar evolution code. Through use of a biconjugate-gradient matrix solver, we now routinely solve l 0 (exp 6) x l 0 (exp 6) sparse matrices on our desktop computers. This has allowed us to couple nucleosynthesis and convection fully in the 1 -D star, which, in turn, provides better estimates of <b>nuclear</b> <b>yields</b> when the mixing and nuclear burning timescales are comparable. We also have incorporated radiation transport into our 1 -D supernova explosion code. We used the stellar evolution and explosion codes to compute iron abundances in a 25 Solar mass star and compared the results to data from RIMS...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} transparency {{measures that}} could be taken to build international confidence that "subcritical experiments " conducted underground by the U.

Our calculations sug-gest that on-site measurement of the integrated radiation output from these experi-ments should be adequate to verify that <b>nuclear</b> <b>yields</b> greater than grams of TNT equivalent had not occurred, even allowing {{for the possibility of}} substantial shielding. However, our calculations also indicate that a pure fission experiment that remained strictly subcritical for its entire duration should have a yield no greater than 0. 1 micro-gram TNT equivalent, even given irradiation by an external deuterium-tritium neu-tron source. Experiments involving chemical-implosion-induced deuterium-tritium fusion could have yields above this limit, and may require fission product measure-ments in addition to prompt radiation measurements to rule out a supercritical test...|$|R
