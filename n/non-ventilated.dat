40|$|Backside {{ventilation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common passive cooling methods of PV modules in the built environment, but might be under constraint when integrating PV in the building envelope. To investigate the short and long term effect of backside ventilation on Building Integrated PV (BIPV) performance and lifespan, a comparative BIPV field test is conducted in a real life lab located in the Netherlands. The field test includes 24 modules in 4 segments with different levels of backside ventilation. PV energy output, module backside temperature, relative humidity in the air gap, and air velocity in the air gap have been monitored for three years in the period January 2013 –December 2015. At the end of the monitoring period Electric Luminescence (EL) images were made and Standard Testing Condition (STC) power was determined. The ventilated segments show a similar behaviour (6 % difference) in PV energy output, but the <b>non-ventilated</b> segment shows a strong decrease of 86 % in output after three years. A maximum temperature of 72 °C is reached in the ventilated segments and a maximum temperature of 83 °C in the <b>non-ventilated</b> segment. Relative humidity (RH) levels reach a maximum of 100 % in all segments. Air velocity in the <b>non-ventilated</b> segment is 13 – 39 % of the air velocity in the ventilated segments. STC power determination and EL imaging show lower peak power and more defects in the <b>non-ventilated</b> modules, and modules placed at vertical higher positions in the <b>non-ventilated</b> segment have a lower power output of 50 – 60 %. The results indicate that, considering the first generation Metal Wrap Through (MWT) modules investigated, the <b>non-ventilated</b> BIPV modules exposed to the highest temperatures show the lowest power output, lowest STC power and show the most damaged cells in the EL imaging. Even though PV module manufacturing shows continuous technological advances, the methodology and results of this work has added value for the prediction of BIPV operating aspects and lifespan when designing and realizing a BIPV installation. Moreover, the BIPV field test presented in this study has been a very illustrative BIPV demonstration project for manufacturers, installers and designers...|$|E

The segments have different amounts of ventilation, ranging between forced and <b>non-ventilated,</b> and have been monitored for 3 years. In the <b>non-ventilated</b> segment, higher operating temperatures, higher daily temperature amplitudes and decrease in output have been measured, which increased over the monitoring period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{has been}} {{associated}} with increased mortality in the general population, whereas a paradoxical relationship between higher body mass index and lower mortality has been referred to as the obesity paradox in critically ill patients. However, it remains unknown whether a particular subgroup is most affected. The aim of the present study is to elucidate whether obesity is associated with lower mortality in the ICU population by comparing subjects with and without mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A total of 334, 238 subjects from a nationwide database who were discharged between July 2010 and March 2012 and who were admitted to general ICUs during their hospitalization were included in this study. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of all subjects evaluated, 23. 3 % were started on mechanical ventilation within the first 2 d after ICU admission. Compared with the <b>non-ventilated</b> group, the ventilated group was more likely to have sepsis, pneumonia, or coma. The ventilated group underwent more procedures within the first 2 d after ICU admission compared with the <b>non-ventilated</b> group. A restricted cubic spline function showed lower mortality in subjects with a higher body mass index among the ventilated group, whereas mortality was increased with increasing body mass index in the <b>non-ventilated</b> group. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a high body mass index is associated with low mortality in the mechanically ventilated group, whereas the <b>non-ventilated</b> group showed a re-verse J-shaped association.

40|$|Introduction Increasing {{evidence}} links advanced glycation end products (AGE) including N(epsilon) -(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) to {{the development}} of heart failure. Accumulation of AGE leads to myocardial inflammation, which is considered as one of the possible mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesized that mechanical ventilation (MV) augmented sepsis-induced myocardial CML deposition and inflammation. Methods Sepsis was induced using a modified cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) technique in 36 male adult Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were randomized to four hours of MV with low tidal volume (LTV: 6 ml/kg, PEEP 5 cmH(2) O, n = 10) or high tidal volume (HTV: 15 ml/kg, PEEP 3 cmH(2) O, n = 10) 24 hours after the induction of sepsis. Eight rats served as septic, <b>non-ventilated</b> controls and eight as non-septic, <b>non-ventilated</b> controls. After 28 hours all rats were killed. The number of extravascular polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes was measured as the number of positive cells/mm(2). The number of CML positive endothelial cells were semi-quantified based upon an intensity score. The CML intensity score was correlated with the number of inflammatory cells to study the association between CML depositions and inflammation. Results Gas exchange was comparable between the ventilated groups. Sepsis induced a significant increase in CML deposition in both ventricles that was significantly augmented by MV compared with <b>non-ventilated</b> septic controls (left ventricle 1. 1 +/- 1. 0 vs 0. 7 +/- 0. 1, P = 0. 030; right ventricle 2. 5 +/- 0. 5 vs 0. 6 +/- 0. 1, P = 0. 037), irrespective of ventilatory strategy. In the right ventricle there was a non-significant tendency towards increased CML deposition in the HTV group compared with septic, <b>non-ventilated</b> controls (1. 0 +/- 0. 1 vs 0. 7 +/- 0. 09, P = 0. 07). Sepsis induced {{a significant increase in the}} number of macrophages and PMNs compared with <b>non-ventilated</b> septic controls that was augmented by MV, irrespective of ventilatory strategy. CML deposition was significantly correlated with the number of macrophages and PMNs in the heart. Conclusions Sepsis induces CML deposition in the heart with a predominant right ventricular inflammation that is significantly augmented by MV, irrespective of the ventilatory strategy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pneumonia {{is one of}} {{the leading}} hospital-acquired infections {{worldwide}} and has an important impact. Although preventive measures for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are well known, less is known about appropriate measures for prevention of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Aim The purpose of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the current standards for preventing HAP in <b>non-ventilated</b> adult patients. Methods A search of the literature up to May 2015 was conducted using Medline for guidelines published by national professional societies or professional medical associations. In addition, a comprehensive search for the following preventive measures was performed: hand hygiene, oral care, bed position, mobilization, diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia, aspiration prevention, viral infections and stress bleeding prophylaxis. Findings Regarding international guidelines, several measures were recommended for VAP, whilst no specific recommendations for HAP prevention in <b>non-ventilated</b> patients are available. There is reasonable evidence available that oral care is associated with a reduction in HAP. Early mobilization interventions, swift diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia, and multimodal programmes for the prevention of nosocomial influenza cross-infection, have a positive impact on HAP reduction. The impact of bed position and stress bleeding prophylaxis remains uncertain. Systematic antibiotic prophylaxis for HAP prevention should be avoided. Conclusion Scant literature and little guidance is available for the prevention of HAP among <b>non-ventilated</b> adult patients. In addition, the criteria used for the diagnosis of HAP and the populations targeted in the studies selected are heterogeneous. Oral care was the most studied measure and was commonly associated with a decrease in HAP rate, although a broad range of interventions are proposed. No robust evidence is available for other measures.

We changed IA environment of lecture rooms while the lecture was given by using fan-ventilation or not, and with room doors open or closed: we monitored the CO 2 level at 5 -min intervals during 2 or 3 consecutive 90 -min lectures using an infrared ray absorption type CO 2 monitor. Based on the observed levels for 90 min, we calculated the ventilation rate (times of operating the ventilation fan), and estimated CO 2 level change in ventilated and <b>non-ventilated</b> rooms for a 90 -min lecture with the ventilation rate. In <b>non-ventilated</b> rooms, the observed and estimated CO 2 level exceeded the maximum of 1, 500 ppm speci-fied by the Japanese Government. The excess was irrespective of the ratio of air volume/ person in <b>non-ventilated</b> rooms with doors closed. During the 1 -h lunch break with doors open, over 5, 000 ppm levels dropped below the standard.
