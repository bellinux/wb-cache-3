Indeed, there are different theories around competitiveness, different approaches by policy makers and various targets are projected, both at micro and macro levels. Going thoroughly within policies and literature, it can be admitted that competitiveness is still vague, ambiguous, but wrapped up in ingenuity. There are still many open questions related to the definition of competitiveness, competitiveness factors, the applicability and the practical approaches to foster competitiveness. Is competitiveness just an entrepreneurial skill to sell or could be a premise of development?

Since the country's first democratic elections in 1994 there has been debate about the failure of <b>national</b> <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks</b> to increase employment substantially and reduce unemployment. Attention is being focused on municipal government's role in tackling persistent high levels of unemployment beyond the economic growth-oriented local economic development strategies favoured by most of the larger city administrations. This paper explores recent responses to employment related challenges by the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality in Durban. It suggests that despite their firm commitment to increasing employment, municipal authorities see their role as secondary to national programmes. It is observed, however, that growing attention is being paid to employment creation outside traditional LED programmes. local economic development, employment, unemployment, municipalities, urban development, eThekwini,...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. This Policy Brief follows-up on the DIA-CORE Policy Brief on “Assessing {{costs and}} {{benefits}} of deploying renewables”, dated 26 September 2014, which highlighted the complexities in making a comprehensive and appropriate assessment of {{costs and benefits}} resulting from an increased use of renewable energy sources (RES). It distinguished the different types of effects into system-related effects, distributional effects and macro-economic effects, and looked at the related data requirements, which need to be comprehensive and standardised. This DIA-CORE Policy Brief uses the tools proposed in the previous Policy Brief to estimate the effects on Member States of reaching the EU-wide RES target of 27 % of the EU’s energy consumption by 2030. This allows to draw some conclusions on the differentiated impacts across Member States, and the potential implications for an effort sharing approach. It also assesses whether a higher ambition level could be beneficial.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} {{insights}} {{in the cost}} developments of offshore wind energy in Europe. This is done by analysing 46 operational offshore wind farms commissioned after 2000. An increase of the Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) is found that {{is linked to the}} distance to shore and depth of more recent wind farms and commodity prices. Analysis results indicate that these two factors are only responsible for about half of the observed CAPEX increase, suggesting other factors such as turbine market with limited competition also led to an increasing CAPEX. Using CAPEX, Annual Energy Production, Financings costs and Operational Expenditures, the development of average Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) is shown to increase from 120. €/MWh in 2000 towards 190. €/MWh in 2014, which {{is a direct result of}} the CAPEX increase. The results indicate very different LCoE values among European countries, from currently about 100 Euro/MWh in Denmark and Sweden to 150 - 220 Euro/MWh in all other countries investigated suggesting an effect of <b>national</b> <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks</b> on the LCoE of offshore wind energy...|$|E
30|$|Existing <b>national</b> <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks</b> on {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} impacts and, specifically, to coastal flooding, differ between the study sites. The national adaptation strategies of Denmark and Germany seem to be similar: In both countries, for example, coastal risk management is considered a key issue addressed in the National Adaptation Strategies (Biesbroek et al. 2010). A large part of the German North Sea coast is protected by dikes; flood control and coastal protection are the responsibility of the state (Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conversation and Nuclear Safety Germany 2009). In Denmark, landowners are responsible for protecting their properties from flooding (The Danish Government 2008). In Argentina, {{there is a lack of}} institutional organization responsible for the coastal management. An exception to this is the province of Buenos Aires, where the “Unidad de Coordinación de Manejo Costero Integrado” (Coordination Unit of Integrated Coastal Management) was created in 2008. However, there is no specific reference to flood management or adaptation strategies. Along the Argentinean coast there are a few examples of coastal protection structures and practices, such as seawalls, breakwaters, artificial beach nourishment and dune maintenance.|$|E

40|$|National {{domestic}} energy-efficiency {{policies are}} unlikely to be implemented in a geographically uniform manner. This paper demonstrates the importance of socioeconomic, contextual, and local policy conditions in shaping the spatially heterogeneous response to a national policy. Through an assessment of the geographical and temporal variation in domestic energy-efficiency assessments provided under the United Kingdom’s Green Deal, the factors underpinning the spatial diffusion of this policy are identified. Spatial regression models show that the presence of young families, university educated residents, detached homes, and large households positively affects the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments whereas property market activity, personal incomes, the presence of self-employed residents, and the efficiency levels of the existing housing stock has a dampening effect. National incentives for policy implementation that are distributed through selected local authorities also work to promote the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments. Overall, the analysis clearly shows the importance of local factors in determining how national policies are implemented on the ground. This has important implications for policymakers in designing and administering <b>national</b> <b>policy</b> <b>frameworks,</b> in trading-off targeted implementation with fairness and uniformity, and in evaluating the local effectiveness of national policies...|$|E

National planning using prioritization tools {{can result in}} efficient, effective and equitable allocation of limited resources to benefit the most vulnerable farmers and systems.

Access to adaptation finance remains critical to achieving local and global goals for adaptation. Both economic incentives and value chain initiatives can ensure that financial investments achieve adaptation at scale. Effective research and knowledge systems connect farmers, policy-makers, businesses and researchers to accelerate sharing of emerging knowledge, and help adapt to dynamic current climates and to future scenarios for climate and development. Modernizing extension services, capacity building and technology transfer approaches are importan to capture the attention and participation of a wider group of rural people, including youth. Indigenous knowledge strengthens adaptation measures by working closely with knowledgeholders at both local and national levels. Gender equality and social inclusion can be strengthened if adaptation measures are well designed. Adaptation measures in agricultural systems also offer opportunity to achieve multiple cobenefits, for environmental health and mitigation...|$|E
