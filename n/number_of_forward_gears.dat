5000|$|In 1990, the Turbo Hydra-Matic 700R4 {{was renamed}} the 4L60. Under the new designation, the [...] "4" [...] {{stands for the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> <b>gears,</b> the [...] "L" [...] for {{longitudinal}} applications (rear-wheel-drive), and the [...] "60" [...] is the strength rating (less than the 4L80). [...] "60" [...] is the relative torque value. For example, 80 is stronger than 60, which is stronger than 40, etc. A 4L80-E can handle more torque than a 4L60-E. The [...] "E" [...] denotes electronically controlled shifting. The 4L60 however is hydraulically shifted based on governor pressure and throttle valve (TV) cable position. 1992 was {{the last year of}} widespread usage of the 700R4 (4L60).The 1993 Camaro, Corvette and Typhoon were equipped with the last production 700R4. The last design change of the 700R4 was an added checkball to the valve body.|$|E

50|$|An {{automatic}} transmission, {{also called}} auto, self-shifting transmission, n-speed automatic (where n is its <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratios), or AT, {{is a type}} of motor vehicle transmission that can automatically change gear ratios as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Like other transmission systems on vehicles, it allows an internal combustion engine, best suited to run at a relatively high rotational speed, to provide a range of speed and torque outputs necessary for vehicular travel. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratios is often expressed for manual transmissions as well (e.g., 6-speed manual).|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} 5-speed {{manual transmission}} {{is often the}} standard equipment in a base-model car, while more expensive manual vehicles are usually equipped with a 6-speed transmission instead; other options include automatic transmissions such as a traditional automatic (hydraulic planetary) transmission (often a manumatic), a semi-automatic transmission, or a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratios is often expressed for automatic transmissions as well (e.g., 9-speed automatic).|$|R
50|$|A manual transmission, {{also known}} as a manual gearbox, stick shift, n-speed manual (where n is its <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> ratios), standard, MT, or in colloquial U.S. English, a stick (for {{vehicles}} with hand-lever shifters), is a type of transmission used in motor vehicle applications. It uses a driver-operated clutch engaged and disengaged by a foot pedal (automobile) or hand lever (motorcycle), for regulating torque transfer from the engine to the transmission; and a gear selector operated by hand (automobile) or by foot (motorcycle).|$|R
40|$|The {{foundation}} {{of this research}} work was laid by {{the vision of a}} tractor simulator where the users can generate their customized tractor model with the help of just a user-interface. The aim of this paper was to modify the attributes of the tractor simulation model. For the same reason, a modeling configurator was developed for the tractor model in python programming language with a user-friendly interface designed over Microsoft excel. This research work reports the effort in the development of modeling configurator for parameterizing a tractor model. The modeling configurator has been designed {{in such a way that}} the users can select their choices just from a drop down menu in the user-interface. The attributes that can be parameterized are maximum torque of the engine, maximum braking torque for the engine, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> and reverse <b>gears.</b> For tyre modeling, special attention was paid as the modeling configurator allowed users to select only from the standard tyres available, whose width and diameter are predefined. The mass and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tyres can also be modified. At last, additional equipment that can be used in farming was also modeled as an assembly file. For additional equipment, only trailer has been covered within the scope of this research work whose mass is predefined. The modeling configurator was validated by selecting different options in the user-interface and then running the simulation file and noting down the differences. Some differences can be visualized like the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tyres and attached trailer, while other differences can be seen with the help of plots like maximum torque of the engine, gear index, and tyre profiles. For the masses of the tyres, user can only feel the difference while running the simulator in real-time. At the end of the research, scope for future work is also suggested based on the limitations of this research work...|$|R

40|$|In a wired network, {{a packet}} can be {{transmitted}} to a specified destination only, no broadcasting required. But in ad hoc wireless network a packet transmitted by a node can reach all neighbors due to broadcasting. This broadcasting introduces unnecessary retransmissions of same message. Therefore, the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transmissions (<b>forward</b> nodes) is generally used as the cost criterion for broadcasting. The problem of finding the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> nodes is NP-complete. In this paper, {{the goal is to}} reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> nodes which will reduce redundant transmission as a result. Thus some of approximation approaches are analyzed, especially dominant pruning and total dominant pruning which use 2 -hop neighborhood information and a new approach: Probability based algorithm is proposed with a view to minimizing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> nodes. Simulation results of applying this algorithm shows performance improvements with compared to dominant pruning and total dominant pruning algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} problem of {{reducing}} data overhead of mesh-based multicast ad hoc routing protocols by reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> nodes.

In addition, we demonstrate the problem to be NP-complete by a transformation to the Steiner tree problem. We propose a distributed heuristic algorithm based on the epidemic propagation <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> nodes. Our simulation results show that the proposed heuristic, when implemented into ODMRP, is able to offer similar performance results and a lower average latency while improving the forwarding efficiency in around a 40 - 50 % with respect to the original ODMRP.

By contrast, most reverse gears are spur gears, meaning that they have straight teeth, in order to allow for the sliding engagement of the idler, which is difficult with helical gears. The teeth of spur gears clatter together when the gears spin, generating a characteristic whine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using {{directional}} antennas {{to conserve}} bandwidth and energy consumption in ad hoc networks is becoming popular in recent years. However, applications of directional antennas for broadcasting have been limited. We propose a novel broadcast protocol called directional self-pruning (DSP) for ad hoc networks using directional antennas. DSP is a non-trivial generalization {{of an existing}} localized deterministic broadcast protocol using omnidirectional antennas. Compared with its omnidirectional predecessor, DSP uses about the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> nodes to relay the broadcast packet, while the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> directions that each forward node uses in transmission is significantly reduced. With the lower broadcast redundancy, DSP is more bandwidth- and energy-efficient. DSP is based on 2 -hop neighborhood information and does not rely on location or angle-of-arrival (AoA) information. DSP is a pure localized protocol. We prove that the expected <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> nodes in DSP is within a constant factor of the minimal value in an optimal solution.

40|$|Many inverse {{problems}} {{in science and}} engineering involve multi-experiment data and thus require a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> simulations. Dimensionality reduction techniques aim at reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>forward</b> solves by (randomly) subsampling the data. In the special case of non-linear least-squares estimation, we can interpret this compression of the data as a (low-rank) approximation of the noise covariance matrix. We shoe that this leads to different design criteria for the subsampling process. Furthermore, the resulting low-rank structure can be exploited when designing matrix-free methods for estimating (properties of) the posterior covariance matrix. Finally, we discuss the possibility of estimating the noise covariance matrix itself...|$|R

That is, the input torus of the fluid coupling ran at a lower speed than the engine, due to the reduction <b>of</b> the <b>forward</b> <b>gear</b> assembly. This produced an exceptionally smooth startup because of the relatively large amount of slippage initially produced in the fluid coupling. This slippage quickly diminished as engine RPM increased.|$|R
