As such, all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions.|$|E

Morpholinos do not activate toll-like receptors or innate immune responses such as interferon induction or the NF-κB-mediated inflammation response. Morpholinos are <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> modify DNA methylation.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, {{the animal is}} <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> eat fish.

5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot was <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> be an earthquake zone. On October 10 {{of the following}} year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, {{but at least one}} earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press. In 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the Society. Those articles were often sensationalist and served {{to put the}} Society in a bad light. The views and practices of the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas might be better tolerated.|$|E
