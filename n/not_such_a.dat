5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all, implying the Leafs were <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.|$|E

5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing there is <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> mirror {{in creating a}} European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to {{the selection of the}} Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
5|$|No multituberculates {{are known}} to have had hypsodont teeth, none has more than two molariform (molar-like) teeth in a single toothrow, and most have large, blade-like teeth. However, the form of the remains of TNM02067's third cheektooth {{suggests}} it was <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> blade-like tooth and that at least the last three cheekteeth were likely molariform. In these respects, TNM02067 does resemble gondwanatheres in the family Sudamericidae, and Krause and colleagues tentatively identified it as representing that family, primarily {{on the basis of its}} hypsodont teeth. Krause and colleagues compared the dentary in detail to that of Sudamerica, the only other gondwanathere for which a substantial fragment of the jaw was known. Sudamerica has only four, not five, cheekteeth (all of which are molariform), a higher, narrower incisor with a root that extends further through the dentary, and a shorter diastema; in all these respects, TNM02067 is more primitive. In addition, the mental foramen of the TNM02067 is located lower and the cheekteeth vary more in size.|$|E

25|$|This {{suggests}} that about 3% of all promotions are underpromotions. The frequency of truly significant underpromotions is, however, less than this. Note that the promoted piece {{does not have}} to be a piece that has previously been captured. A player may promote to any piece they wish, regardless of whether or <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> piece has been captured. In theory, a player could have nine queens, ten knights, ten bishops or ten rooks, though these are highly improbable scenarios. Some chess sets come with an extra queen of each color to use for promoted pawns. If an extra queen is unavailable, it is often represented by an upside-down rook instead.|$|E

25|$|Between January 1992 and November 1994, 11 tigers were captured, {{fitted with}} radio-collars and {{monitored}} {{for more than}} 15 months in the eastern slopes of the Sikhote-Alin mountain range.

Although they prey on both Siberian roe deer and sika deer, overlap of these ungulates with tigers was low. Distribution of moose was poorly associated with tiger distribution. The distribution of preferred habitat of key prey species was an accurate predictor of tiger distribution.|$|E
25|$|In modern cricket, the {{two lines}} usually aimed for by fast bowlers is the {{so-called}} corridor of uncertainty, the area just outside the batsman's off stump, or actually on the stumps. It is difficult for the batsman to tell whether or <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> ball is likely to strike their wicket, and thus to know whether to attack, defend or leave the ball. This technique was historically known as off theory (contrast leg theory), but it is now so routine that it is rarely given a name at all, or forgotten about completely. Of course, variation in line is also important and deliveries aimed at the leg stump can also serve a purpose.|$|E

The Israeli elected governing cabinet was not informed, and though Foreign Affairs Minister Moshe Sharett was privy to prior deliberations on whether or <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> punitive raid ought to be conducted, he expressed strong disapproval of the proposal, and was deeply shocked when informed of the outcome.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court of Canada {{ruled that}} the Government has the {{authority}} to amend the definition of marriage, but did not rule on whether or <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> change is required by the equality provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court stated that such a ruling is not necessary because the Federal Government had accepted the rulings of provincial courts to the effect that the change was required. The Court also ruled that given freedom of religion in the Charter of Rights, and wording of provincial human rights codes, it was highly unlikely that religious institutions could be compelled to perform same-sex marriages, though because solemnization of marriage is a matter for provincial governments, the proposed bill could not actually guarantee such protections.|$|E
25|$|Acetaldehyde is a colorless, {{volatile}} substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, {{it can cause}} an off-taste in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300°C or 570°F), high pressures, extruder speeds (excessive shear flow raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute {{to the production of}} acetaldehyde. When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.|$|E
