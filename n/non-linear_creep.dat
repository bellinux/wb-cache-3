The vehicle is modelled by a 27 -degrees-of-freedom (27 -DOF) car system, with lateral displacement, vertical displacement, roll angle, and yaw angle of the each wheelset and the bogie frames, {{as well as the}} lateral dis-placement, roll angle and yaw angle of the car body all taken into consideration. To analyse the respective effects of major system parameters on the vehicle dynamics, the 27 -DOF system is reduced to a 14 -DOF system by excluding designated subsets of the system parameters. The effects of suspension parameters of a vehicle on the critical hunting speeds were evaluated by the 14 - and 27 -DOF systems. Results obtained in this study, show that the critical hunting speeds derived using the 14 -DOF system are generally higher than those evaluated using the 27 -DOF system. Additionally, the critical hunting speeds evaluated using the heuristic <b>non-linear</b> <b>creep</b> model are lower than those derived using the linear creep model. The effects on derailment quotients of vehicle speeds are evaluated using both linear and <b>non-linear</b> <b>creep</b> models with various suspension parameters.

40|$|Springer-Verlag London Limited 2009 The {{adaptive}} {{identification of}} the <b>non-linear</b> hysteresis and <b>creep</b> effects in a piezoelectric actuator is proposed in this paper. Model uncertainties related to the hysteresis and creep effects, most prominently in the high frequency zone (to 100 Hz), large operating amplitude and/long operating time, can make a piezoelectric actuator-driven micro-positioning system unstable in the closed loop. Furthermore, these uncertainties may lead to inaccurate open-loop control and frequently cause harmonic distortion when a piezoelectric actuator is driven with a sinusoidal input voltage signal. In order to solve the above issues, {{it is important to}} determine an accurate non-linear dynamic model of a piezoelectric actuator. An unscented Kalman filter-based adaptive identification algorithm is presented, which accurately determines the non-linear dynamics of a piezoelectric stack type actuator such that the <b>non-linear</b> hysteresis and <b>creep</b> effects can be accurately predicted.

40|$|International audienceInorganic {{glasses are}} {{viscoelastic}} materials since they exhibit, below {{as well as}} above their glass transition temperature, a viscoelas-tic deformation under stress, which can be decomposed into a sum of an elastic part, an inelastic (or viscous) part and a delayed elastic part. The delayed elastic part {{is responsible for the}} <b>non-linear</b> primary <b>creep</b> stage observed during creep tests. During a stress relaxation test, the strain, imposed, is initially fully elastic, but is transformed, as the stress relaxes, into an inelastic and a delayed elastic strains. For linear viscoelastic materials, if the stress relaxation function can be fitted by a stretched exponential function, the evolution of each part of the strain can be predicted using the Boltzmann superposition principle. We develop here the equations of these evolutions, and we illustrate their accuracy by comparing them with experimental evolutions measured on GeSe 9 glass fibers. We illustrate also, by simple equations, the relationship between any kind of relaxation function based on additive contribution of different relaxation processes and the delayed elastic contribution to stress relaxation: the delayed elasticity is directly correlated to the dispersion of relaxations times of the processes involved during relaxation...|$|R

It is shown that the coupling between the processes can be {{expressed in terms of}} a parameter L, which has the dimensions of length and which is a function of material properties, temperature and applied stress; L decreases with increasing temperature and stress and has, e. g., values in the range of 0. 25 to 25 pm for various pure metals when stressed to 10 m 3 x shear modulus at 0. 5 T,. The contribution of dislocation creep to the cavity growth rate is shown to be negligible when L is comparable to or larger than the cavity spacing, but significant interactions occur. leading to growth rates very much in excess of those predicted on the basis of boundary diffusion alone, when L is comparable to or smaller than the cavity size.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns of strain localization in materials with pre-existing heterogeneities are investigated via a series of two-dimensional numerical models. Models include (i) a dynamic feedback process, to simulate rheological weakening {{in response to the}} transition from <b>non-linear</b> flow (dislocation <b>creep)</b> to linear flow (diffusion creep/grain boundary sliding), and (ii) a time dependent strengthening process, counteracting the weakening process. Different load bearing framework geometries with 20 % weak component are used to evaluate the impact of geometry on the strength of the material and its ability to localize strain into an interconnected weak layer (IWL). Our results highlight that during simple shear, if dynamic weakening with or without strengthening feedbacks is present, strain is quickly localized into an IWL, where an increasing proportion of weak material increases the interconnections between the IWLs, thereby increasing the anastomosing character of the shear zones. We establish that not only bulk strain localization patterns but also their temporal patterns are sensitive to the dominance of the weakening or strengthening process. Consequently, shear zones are dynamic in time and space within a single deformation event.

To objectively evaluate the models, creep strain measurements were carried out at three temperatures – 30, 40 and 50 oC – and five tensile stress levels – 10, 16, 20, 25 and 32 MPa for two amorphous polymers (PMMA and PC) and, for two semi-crystalline polymers, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 MPa (PE-UHMW) and 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 MPa (PP). The analytical models developed, based on concepts of non-simulative molecular dynamics, account for a truncated log-normal retardation time distribution, such that a minimum ( 1) and an average (*) retardation time are quantitatively predicted, as functions of temperature and applied stress, for each of the materials studied. The model-predicted shift of the retardation time spectra towards shorter times, when temperature or stress increases, is in agreement with other published results and our own experimental data. In addition, a clear change in the shape (width decrease) of the spectra has been identified and quantified, after increases in the same two operating variables. The fit of the model predictions to the experimentally measured behaviour is of good quality, enabling quantitative estimates of the various physical parameters involved. Thus, for the most refined model developed so far – Model IIB – at each temperature, and for all five tensile stress levels experimentally tested, the number of parameters is seven: b 0, related to the width of the retardation time spectrum, constants  1, 0 and of the minimum and average retardation times, a minimum, β 1, and a average, β*, activation volume, and both asymptotic creep compliances – the instantaneous and the long-term (infinite time) ones.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades {{extensive}} research has been undertaken to characterize the time and rate dependent response of soils and to describe it by means of a constitutive model. However, most of these constitutive equations have been dev. eloped for a single stress point and limited stress paths, and in engineering practice the time, dependent nature of soils is still commonly reduced to a single coefficient of secondary consolidation obtained from a 24 h oedometer test. J This thesis describes the development and implementation, in the Imperial College Finite Element Program (I~FEP), of two elastic visco-plastic models based on the overstress theory to describe the stress-strain-time/rate behaviour of clayey soils. The models differ essentially in the adopted law to describe the variation of the creep ~ deformation with time. The fIrst model - Creep Model 1 - incorporates a linear logarithmic law to describe the variation ofthe creep defon:nation with time, while the second model- Equivalent Time (ET) Model - incorporates a <b>non-linear</b> logarithmic <b>creep</b> law, with a limit to the amount of volumetric creep strain that can occur. The implementation and performance of the models is validated through a series of simple fInite element analyses that mimic common l~boratory stress paths and show that the models are able to reproduce the' phenomena of primary and secondary compression, stress relaxation, primary and secondary creep and persistent rate effects on the stress-strain. response under Ko and triaxial stress conditions. The ET model is then used to investigate the increase in bearing capacity of preloaded footings on soft clay, taking into account both the effects of consolidation and soil hardening due to creep with time. Finally, a series of fInite element analyses are presented that mimic the loading tests performed on two instrumented rigid footings at the Bothkennar test site.

40|$|The {{request to}} obtain refined {{simulations}} {{of a real}} behaviour, in structural analysis, {{is one of the}} most important goals that actually researchers are attempting to reach. Actually, the automated calculation procedures that structural analysts use through Finite Element Modelling (FEM), allow reaching a very high level of refinement if we refer to the prediction of the structural behaviour of a component/machine under a very complex load system. In this field, the capability to be able to reproduce material behaviours {{is one of the most}} intriguing points because the ability to manage the material matrix in FEM software is the necessary starting point to have a satisfying result. Traditionally the possibility to not implement such a complex model has been faced through the use of factors of safety, which are developed and refined on the basis of experience and historical evidence. For systems where efficient design is of the utmost importance (for example the minimum weight design of an aircraft structure) it is possible that the traditional factors of safety may be overly conservative, so that optimal efficiency cannot be achieved. Furthermore, historical factors of safety are unlikely to be appropriate for new design concepts or new complex metal super-alloys. These materials, for instance, have very different behaviours if we consider that depending mainly on the type of load and the temperature. They can present hardening, softening, cyclic stabilization, stress relaxation, creep, etc. The main scope of this work is to provide a procedure for the implementation of an elastovisco-plastic material model that is able to take in account of <b>non-linear</b> interaction of <b>creep</b> and fatigue for structural analysis and life prediction.

40|$|Soft clays are {{associated}} with low shear strength, low permeability and high water content and they are mostly highly compressible. When a geotechnical structure for example road embankment is founded on such soft soil, it exhibits time-dependent deformations due to external loading. The excessive deformation in soft clay deposit may lead to damage of the structure or result in high maintenance cost. Nevertheless, due to increase of population and urbanization it is sometimes difficult to avoid construction of infrastructure on such clay deposit. Therefore, any structure founded on problematic soft clay requires accurate prediction of deformation with time, which includes prediction of time-dependent deformational behaviour of clay, to mitigate post construction damage. Predicting the time-dependent viscous behaviour of soft clay is a geotechnical challenge due to heterogeneity and complex formation of soils. To cope with this challenge, different elastic-viscoplastic (EVP) models are developed in this thesis adopting associated flow rule and non-associated flow rule in general stress space considering time dependent viscous behaviour of soft clay. These models are implemented in fully coupled consolidated non-linear finite element code AFENA involving composite bounding surface as well as Modified Cam Clay (MCC) equivalent single surface. Seven parameters are used in models that involve composite surface while six parameters for the single surface model, which are defined according to soil mechanics principles. Parameters of EVP models can be extracted from conventional oedometer and triaxial tests. Performances of the models in capturing the behaviours of natural clays: (Osaka clay, Shanghai clay) and reconstituted clays: (Kaolin clay, Hong Kong Marine Deposit clay, and Fukakusa clay), under drained and undrained conditions; different initial states (void ratio, mean pressure, over-consolidation ratio) and loading conditions (stress or strain controlled, strain rate) are also presented in this thesis. To account for softening behaviour of natural soft clay, a modification is also introduced for the EVP models developed in this thesis. The time-dependent viscous behaviour of soft clay is incorporated in these models adopting creep co-efficient. Implementation of constant creep in EVP model is common, whereas from long term laboratory tests it is revealed that linear or constant approximation of creep co-efficient may lead to misleading prediction. However, existing <b>non-linear</b> <b>creep</b> functions are either limited to specific EVP models or anchored in the clay {{for which it is}} derived. To avoid the complexity associated with <b>non-linear</b> <b>creep</b> function for EVP models, a general non-linear function is presented which is neither tied to any specific model nor any specific soil group. Moreover, this creep function does not involve any fitting parameters as it is evident in some <b>non-linear</b> <b>creep</b> functions proposed in the literature. To verify the predictability of the EVP models developed in this thesis for long-term performances, an instrumented Nerang Broadbeach Road (NBR) embankments field monitored data are compared with predictions obtained using the EVP models as well as that using the MCC model. The NBR embankments complete subsoil details are presented in this thesis and the model parameters are extracted from laboratory tests like oedometer tests, triaxial tests and field tests such as vane shear tests, cone penetration tests (CPT) and piezocone dissipation tests (CPT-u). The interpreted model parameters obtained from CPT and CPT-u tests are also compared with laboratory obtained data. Another important aspect of this thesis is that a simplified observational approach is proposed based on field monitored data which is capable to capture the time-dependent viscous response. The method is employed to predict the ultimate settlement as well as time-settlement relation for NBR embankment. The proposed observational approach prediction capabilities are compared with Asaoka and Hyperbola methods and coupled consolidated finite element analyses adopting MCC model as well as associated and non-associated flow rule based EVP models...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe creep {{of paper}} is {{accelerated}} by moisture cycling. This effect {{is known as}} mechano-sorptive creep. It is assumed {{that this is an}} effect of transient stresses produced during moisture content changes in combination with <b>non-linear</b> <b>creep</b> behaviour of the fibres. The stresses produced by the moisture content changes are often much larger than the applied mechanical loads. If this is the case, the mechanical loads are only a perturbation to the internal stress state, and it will appear as if the mechano-sorptive creep is linear in stress. It is possible {{to take advantage of this}} feature. In the present report the pure moisture problem is first solved. The mechanical load is then treated as a perturbation of the solution to the moisture problem. Using this strategy, it is possible to linearize a non-linear network model for mechano-sorptive creep and to formulate a continuum model. As a result, the number of variables in the model is reduced. This is a significant improvement as it will be possible to use the linearized model to describe the material in a finite element program and solve problems with complicated geometries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to modelling and simulation of the dynamic behaviour of rail-wheel interface. The proposed dynamic wheel-rail contact model comprises wheel-rail geometry and efficient solutions for normal and tangential contact problems. This two-degree of freedom model {{takes into account the}} lateral displacement of the wheelset and the yaw angle. Single wheel tread rail contact was considered for all simulations and Kalker‟s linear theory and heuristic <b>non-linear</b> <b>creep</b> models were employed. The second order differential equations are reduced to first order and the forward velocity of the wheelset is increased until the wheelset becomes unstable. A comprehensive study of the wheelset lateral stability is performed and is relatively easy to use since no mathematical approach is required to estimate the critical velocity of the dynamic wheel-rail contact model. This novel approach to modelling and simulation of the dynamic behaviour of rail-wheel interface will be useful in the development of intelligent infrastructure diagnostic and condition monitoring systems. The automated detection {{of the state of the}} track will allow informed decision making on asset management actions – especially in maintenance and renewals activities...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{polypropylene}} (PP) based nanocomposites {{were prepared}} by incorporating different kinds and amounts of silica nanoparticles and graphite nanoplatelets (GNP). The role of various percentages of compatibilizer polypropylene grafted with maleic anhydride (PPgMA) into PP nanocomposites was also investigated. In order {{to analyze the}} effect of the manufacturing process on the material’s properties, the samples were produced by (i) melt compounding and compression molding and (ii) extrusion and injection molding. It was found that injection molding provides significantly greater stiffness and strength compared to compression molding for all types of PP nanocomposites. Several characterization techniques were used in order to correlate the microstructure to the physical and mechanical properties of the materials. Both silica and GNP were found to be effective nucleating agents, significantly increasing the crystallization rate during isothermal crystallization and favoring the nucleation of the the β- phase, which manifests superior impact strength and toughness compared to the most common α-form crystals. Graphite nanoplatelets were found more efficient in inducing polymorphism and favoring the formation of a transcrystalline phase on the filler surface. A significant correlation between the tensile modulus, glass transition temperature and the amount of constrained phase, as assessed through tensile and DMA analyses, revealed the presence of a secondary reinforcing mechanisms, which, concurrently to the primary stiffening effect of the high modulus filler, contributes to the enhancement of the bulk properties. A complex constrained phase, responsible for providing a secondary reinforcing mechanism, was modeled as immobilized amorphous and transcrystalline regions located at the filler surface. The <b>non-linear</b> viscoelastic <b>creep</b> of the composites, successfully studied by the application of the time strain superposition principle (TSSP), showed a considerable enhancement of the creep stability in nanocomposites with respect to unfilled PP, especially for higher creep stresses. The study of creep dependance on the temperature showed that the stabilizing effect provided by the nanoparticles was more effective at high temperatures and, considering the time temperature superposition principle (TTSP), at long loading times. The equivalence between the time strain- and time temperature- superposition principle was substantiated by comparing the correspondent superimposed master curves. The nanofilled PP matrices have also been used for the preparation of microcomposites reinforced with short glass fibers (GF). Interfacial shear strength (ISS) was measured by means of the single fiber fragmentation test on various PP/GF microcomposites. Results show that the strength at the fiber/matrix interface can be remarkably increased when using nanocomposite systems, {{especially in the case of}} dimethyldichlorosilane-functionalized silica nanoparticles and GNP platelets, and that the improvement is further increased when the nanoparticles are used in combination with PPgMA. The thermodynamic fiber/matrix work of adhesion, estimated by contact angle measurements, showed a good correlation with the ISS values. Hybrid composites reinforced with short glass fibers and nanofillers were produced and characterized in order to investigate how the morphology and the mechanical properties of the composites were affected by the combined effect of two fillers of rather different size scales (i. e. micro- and nano- scale). The stronger fiber/matrix adhesion combined with the enhancement of the matrix properties resulted in superior tensile properties and impact resistance and improved viscoelastic behavior. As means of comparison, thermosetting hybrid composites based on epoxy resin were also produced by incorporation of GNP and short GF...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is the {{analysis}} of the procedure for material characterization aimed at elasto-visco-plastic models and their implementation in FEM codes. This will be done in order to perform stress analysis of structural components under repeated cyclical loads and high temperatures The overall development involves theoretical, numerical and experimental methodologies. The study of state of the art of material models, available in FEM codes, has allowed the evaluation of the limits of stress analysis on components subjected to repeated cyclical loads and high temperature. The initial study has also highlighted the necessity to implement complex material models. Traditionally this lack has been faced through the use of factors of safety, which are developed and refined {{on the basis of the}} experience and historical backgrounds. For systems where efficient design is of the utmost importance (for example the minimum weight design of an aircraft structure), it is possible that the traditional factors of safety may be overly conservative, so that optimal efficiency cannot be achieved. The implementation of complex material models allows simulating the real material behaviour and taking into account the <b>non-linear</b> interaction between <b>creep</b> and fatigue for structural analysis and life prediction. The results are more dependable and allow reducing the traditional factors of safety, consequently lead to a significant improvement in the designing of structural components. The process of material characterization has been developed through the following phases: designing the necessary experimental data base, choosing the constitutive laws, describing the iterative procedure for determining the coefficients of material model and the procedure of model validation, performed by comparisons between experimental data and simulated ones. It has been described how a poor experimental data base influences the material characterization process and the limits of an automatic procedure. Guidelines have been provided for designing experimental tests able to identify the optimized model parameters. In this way, it will be possible to determine material models with wide range of validity and to allow reducing time and costs of a characterization process. A methodology of structural analysis has been developed through the comparison with procedures of tested validity, in way to allow a correct and safe implementation of elasto-visco-plastic material models. An elasto-visco-plastic analysis on a combustion chamber of aeronautical engine has been performed and component life determined, taking into account the interaction between fatigue and creep...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{building}} materials in the construction industry in the world. Time dependent behaviour of concrete is the major concern for the structural engineers due to its significant effect in the long term serviceability and durability. Reinforced concrete (RC) members are prone to the effect of time dependent deformations that are known as shrinkage and creep, can produce substantial deformations and deflections to the structure. The mechanics of quantifying the serviceability deflection of RC beams is complex due to flexural cracking and the associated partial interaction (PI) behaviour of slip between the reinforcement and adjacent concrete. Add the additional complexity of time dependent concrete shrinkage to this partial-interaction (PI) behaviour and the problem becomes very complex. Current design and analysis techniques to quantify serviceability deflection of reinforced concrete (RC) members are generally built on two major principles which are full interaction (FI) through the use of moment curvature approaches; and a uniform longitudinal shrinkage strain εsh [sh subscript] within the member to simplify the analysis technique. Both of the premises are gross approximations and with regard to the first premise, RC beams are subject to flexural cracking and the associated partial interaction (PI) behaviour of slip between the reinforcement and adjacent concrete. Furthermore with regard to the second premise, numerous tests have shown that εsh [sh subscript] varies along both the depth and width of the beam and which is far from uniform. Hence there are two major sources of error in the quantification of serviceability deflections of RC beams for design and which are due to the PI mechanisms that occur in practice; and that due to the time dependent material properties of creep and shrinkage. This thesis deals with the development of PI numerical mechanics models with non-linear shrinkage strain variations achieved from a moisture diffusion model developed in this study and that is required to simulate the PI behaviour of RC beams in order to considerably reduce the source of error occurred due to the application of numerical mechanics model. Hence this new mechanics model will allow: the development of better design mechanics rules for serviceability deflection; and also assist in the better quantification of <b>non-linear</b> shrinkage and <b>creep</b> by removing or considerably reducing the existing mechanics source of error. Importantly, this research provides mechanics solutions for all the facets that control the serviceability time dependent behaviour of RC beams and it is envisaged that these numerical mechanics solutions can provide researchers with the tools to develop simple design procedures as they simulate the major mechanisms influencing cracking and tension stiffening in reinforced concrete beams. Current shrinkage test methodology is having some limitations that are all surfaces are exposed to the environment and they are small scaled which leads to a uniformity of shrinkage strain and which are not present in real size RC beams. Therefore in this thesis, a new form of experimental setup for shrinkage have been proposed to better quantify the shrinkage variations along both the width and depth of RC members with varying the sizes and surface boundary conditions.
