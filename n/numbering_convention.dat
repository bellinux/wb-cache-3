500|$|The highway was {{designated}} in 1970, replacing Arizona State Route464 and Utah State Route47 {{as well as}} a portion of the old alignment of US 160 in Utah. [...] In 1981, US 191 was routed over the northern section of US163, effectively truncating the northern terminus to Bluff, Utah from Crescent Junction. The state of Utah briefly had plans for a different routing of US163 north of Bluff. These plans were rejected, resulting in discrepancies between the signed route and the official designation by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that were not resolved until 2008. The route number does not follow the <b>numbering</b> <b>convention</b> for U.S. highways, as the number 163 would normally be used for a spur of U.S. Route 63; however, these two highways have never connected.|$|E

Originally this <b>numbering</b> <b>convention</b> ran concurrently with that of the Volkswagen Passat, the first two generations of which were essentially badge engineered clones of the Audi 80. This link was severed in 1988 when the Passat moved to a non-related, transverse-engined, VW-specific platform for its 80-unrelated B3 and B4 versions.
