25|$|Stu Lies - It {{has been}} well {{documented}} throughout the show's history that Stugotz has both a propensity both for stretching the truth and believing his own lies, and starting in 2016 an entire summer show has been spent testing exactly what Stu says is or is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Retired Miami-Dade police officer (and licensed polygraph operator) Joe Harper will hook Stugotz up to a lie-detector, ask him if statements he made actually happened, and then announce the result, often with hilarious results.|$|E
500|$|Supported by the Canningites, Hall was by then {{staying at}} the Gatehouse Prison, {{although}} still not charged with any crime. [...] Hill immediately communicated his concerns to Gascoyne, who sent for the young woman. [...] Accompanied by a contingent of Canningites, her answers were at first noncommittal, but once isolated from Canning's friends she soon admitted to Gascoyne that she had perjured herself. [...] She was committed to the Poultry Compter, where the Canningites continued to support her until they learnt that [...] "particular persons only" [...] were allowed to visit. [...] Hall was again questioned on 7March, by both Gascoyne and Canning's supporters. [...] When asked why she had lied to the court, she said [...] "when I was at Mr Fielding's I at first spoke the truth, but was told it was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> [...] I was terrified and threatened {{to be sent to}} Newgate, and prosecuted as a felon, unless I should speak the truth." [...] She was asked by one of her supporters if she was still lying, but her replies were deemed inconclusive and having confessed to and denied most of the things about which she was questioned, each side began to see her as a liability.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Black {{expanded}} on {{her views}} in a talk to Investors In People. When outlining the common causes of sickness absence, she said: [...] "Very often what the GP will write on a medical certificate...isn't really the truth. When I did the independent review on sickness absence for the government, I talked {{to lots of}} people who were collecting their sicknotes and what they said is: 'I hate my line manager. I'm never going back to that job'. But no GP I've ever known writes anything other than a 'medical' diagnosis; the closest they get is 'stress' or 'anxiety' - often <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> at all". At the same time she drew a sharp distinction between what she called [...] "real" [...] illnesses such as [...] "cancer", [...] "diabetes" [...] and [...] "endogenous depression", and other phenomena such as [...] "stress, anxiety, and mild depression", which she claimed were characterised by [...] "little or no objective disease or impairment" [...] and were [...] "not serious illnesses". They were, she said, usually just a normal human response to something like an unhealthy workplace or a poor line manager and should be handled accordingly.|$|E

2500|$|Arthur is stunned, but {{continues}} {{trying to}} force Merlin to kill Mary Margaret, pushing Merlin to the limit, but the distraction gives Hook time to free himself and come at Arthur. After a brief scuffle, Hook knocks the sword away from Arthur and keeps him from grabbing it. Arthur runs off and releases Zelena, who teleports both of them away. Emma thanks Hook and heals a cut on his neck from Excalibur. He says that now they have the sword, so they just need to light the spark, and then {{they can get the}} darkness out of Emma. Back at Granny’s, Hook recounts the adventure to Henry, who is excited. David and Regina report back that Arthur has retreated far away and Emma is outside with the spark, trying to make it work. Regina comes out and she tells her that Rumplestiltskin's manifestation is playing with her, telling her she can’t light it because she’s not ready to give up the darkness, since she is still lured by it, even though she knows that it’s wrong. Regina grabs the dagger and commands Emma to tell her why she’s afraid to give up the darkness. Emma says that she can’t protect her family if she does. Regina says that’s <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> that it's only [...] "a wall," [...] and uses the dagger to continue probing her, trying to get her to admit the truth. Hook, David, and Mary Margaret come up, and Hook snatches the dagger from Regina, thinking that she's worsening the situation, while Emma storms off with the Dagger and the spark. Regina responds by telling them that she wasn’t being cruel; she was trying to help her find the truth, even it is painful.|$|E
