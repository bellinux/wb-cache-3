5|$|Initially exhibiting {{characteristics}} of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge {{to the south of}} Graham caused strong westerly winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south.

5|$|Several {{days after}} Hurricane Six lost its {{identity}} over Mexico, a new tropical storm formed near {{the southern edge}} of the Gulf of California on September20. Some forecasters stated that the system may have been the remnants of the preceding storm which regenerated. However, the Hurricane Database did not confirm this. The system tracked nearly due north, attaining maximum winds of 50mph (85km/h), <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> coastline of Mexico several times. However, the storm did not make landfall during its existence. On September22, it turned westward before dissipating just off the coast of Baja California Sur.|$|E

The Nova Scotia Government had proposed minor repairs, but it was decided by the N.S. Government that an entirely new bridge would be more cost-effective. The new bridge was designed, unlike its predecessor, without large, overhead steel arches, {{because it would have}} been twice as costly to build. The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907.|$|E

5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are <b>nearing</b> <b>the</b> end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E
