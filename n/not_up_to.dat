5|$|The Rutson Rehabilitation Centre, {{run by the}} North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust {{provides}} specialist {{support for}} stroke victims. It was due to close in spring 2008, as the building which opened in 1877 is <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> modern standards. However, the move has been delayed {{due to lack of}} space at the Friarage.|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{spent most}} of the next year on his farm, and went back to work only when Edward L. Alperson from Grand National Films, a newly established, {{independent}} studio, approached him to make movies for $100,000 a film and 10% of the profits. Cagney made two films for Grand National: Great Guy and Something to Sing About. He received good reviews for both, but overall the production quality was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Warner Bros. standards, and the films did not do well. A third film, Dynamite, was planned, but Grand National ran out of money.|$|E

5|$|Como's final Christmas special {{was filmed}} in January 1994 in Dublin's Point Theatre before an {{audience}} of 4,500 people, including Irish President Mary Robinson and Como's friend, the actress Maureen O'Hara. Perry Como's Irish Christmas was a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) production, made by an Irish independent production company in association with RTÉ. Como, appearing aged and unwell, had the flu during the show which took four hours to record. At the show's conclusion, Como apologized to his Dublin audience for a performance he felt was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his usual standards.|$|E
5|$|Cray had {{intended}} to use gallium arsenide circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only}} way forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E
5|$|During October, City also hosted an inter-league {{game between}} the English and Irish Leagues at Valley Parade. Although the ground was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> high standards, the Football League was keen to {{encourage}} football in Bradford. An estimated 20,000 supporters attended the match which finished with a 2–1 victory for the Football League. The club also made their first signing {{since the start of}} the season, bringing in forward Thomas Drain from Scottish side Maybole.|$|E

5|$|Guitarist Chris Poland {{and drummer}} Gar Samuelson had been {{expelled}} from the band following {{the conclusion of the}} Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler. However, a new guitarist would take longer to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds's firing.|$|E
5|$|Reign in Blood was {{recorded}} and produced in Los Angeles with Rubin. The album was the label boss' first professional experience with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective {{led to a}} drastic makeover of Slayer's sound. Steve Huey of AllMusic believed Rubin drew tighter and faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted sharply with their previous recordings. This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> par production-wise.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the book was terminated by Bernoulli's death in 1705; thus the book is essentially incomplete when compared with Bernoulli's original vision. The quarrel with his younger brother Johann, who was the most competent person who could have fulfilled Jacob's project, prevented Johann {{to get hold of}} the manuscript. Jacob's own children were not mathematicians and were <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the task of editing and publishing the manuscript. Finally Jacob's nephew Niklaus, 7 years after Jacob's death in 1705, managed to publish the manuscript in 1713.|$|E

5|$|The funding {{produced}} by the Battleship Texas Commission was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.|$|E
5|$|The group {{went on a}} {{sell-out}} tour of the UK {{immediately following}} the album's release, but had to cancel the first date at the Green Playhouse, Glasgow due to electrical safety issues. The group realised they were substantially in debt and needed better management, so recruited Tony Smith (no relation to Charisma Records boss Tony Stratton-Smith). The tour was filmed by Charisma for a possible cinema release, but {{was rejected by the}} band who felt it was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> standard. The group returned to the U.S. in December 1973, with three shows at the Roxy in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|To have {{a chance}} of winning a competition, two {{consistently}} good jumps must be made. If an athlete finds themselves in an uncompetitive position after the first round, their challenge in the second round is to make up ground via the attrition of other athletes, their own distance and style points, and wind/gate compensation. For an athlete who had a poor jump in round one, it is possible for them to climb up the order in round two with an excellent jump, and if other competitors fall by the wayside. Conversely, a high-scoring athlete may lose their advantage from round one if their second jump is <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> par.|$|E

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the match}} results were {{encouraging}} {{for such a}} young and inexperienced team, Craig scored only 103runs at 14.71. Despite his contributions as a leader, this was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> standard. He had trouble with his defence, being bowled eight times in 17innings. In the 12 matches {{in the last three}} months of the tour, Craig passed fifty only once in 13 innings. However, the selectors did not have to reverse their youth policy: Craig contracted a bout of hepatitis before the start of the 1958–59 season. He returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two ducks in his only two innings of the season, the second coming against the touring England team. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4–0; as England were widely regarded as the best team at the time, this established him as captain of a resurgent Australia.|$|E
5|$|Brunner {{retired in}} 1869 at the {{relatively}} young age of 46. He remained {{employed by the}} Nelson Provincial Council as a consultant surveyor and was also head of the Nelson Survey Department. His administration skills were <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the latter role {{and many of the}} surveys produced under his supervision were of poor quality. He also continued to seek private work and contributed to a report on the suitability of the Buller region for settlement and this was published in early 1873. On his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff, returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost-cutting measures by the Nelson Provincial Council. This did not meet with the approval of locals.|$|E

5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> date.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Wang Anshi {{had his own}} {{commentaries on}} Confucian {{classics}} made into a standard and required reading for students hoping to pass the state examinations. This and other reforms of Wang's were too much for some officials to bear idly, as there were many administrative disagreements, along with many personal interests at stake. In any case, the rising conservative faction against the reformer Wang Anshi branded him as an inferior-intellect who was <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> par with their principles of governance (likewise, the reformers branded conservatives in the same labeled fashion). The conservatives criticized Wang's reforms {{as a means of}} curbing the influence of landholding families by diminishing their private wealth in favor of self-sufficient communal groups. The conservatives argued that the wealth of the landholding class should not be purposefully diminished by state programs, since the land holding class was the essential socio-economic group that produced China's scholar-officials, managers, merchants, and landlords.|$|E
5|$|In late May 2011, Sukhoi {{delivered}} the first Su-35S to Akhtubinsk to conduct state joint tests with the Defence Ministry {{to prepare the}} aircraft for operational service. Before {{the start of the}} tests, the aircraft's Su-35's avionics and integrated defence systems were reportedly <b>not</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the standard of American aircraft. The first of two stages of the trials commenced in August 2011. By March 2012, the two prototypes and four production aircraft were conducting flights as the air force tested the type's technical characteristics, which were assessed {{by the end of that}} year to have generally complied with requirements. Of the batch of six production aircraft that were handed over in December 2012, five flew to the Gromov Flight Research Institute in Zhukovsky where the aircraft would, in February 2013, start the second stage of the trials. This stage, which was scheduled to last eighteen months, would focus on the Su-35's weapons and manoeuvrability in combat.|$|E
