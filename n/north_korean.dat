5|$|A <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{tank column}} {{equipped}} with ex-Soviet T-34/85 tanks overran {{the task force}} in the first encounter and continued its advance south. After the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> tank column had breached U.S. lines the Task Force opened fire on a force of some 5,000 <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infantry approaching its position, temporarily holding up the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> advance. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops eventually flanked and overwhelmed American positions and {{the remnants of the}} task force retreated in disorder.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{troops had}} been pushed beyond their limits {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems racked the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> Army, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved devastating for the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> units. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did, and UN superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the North Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative. However, the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> force retained high morale and enough supply to allow for a large-scale offensive.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day on}} June 29, the KPAF {{returned}} to attack Suwon, and six sorties of <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> aircraft strafed the airfield during the morning, but each time were driven off by American F-80s, {{and in the course}} of these attacks Lieutenant William T. Norris and Lieutenant Roy W. Marsh each shot down a <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> aircraft. The North Koreans were able to destroy a single C-54 Skymaster parked at the airfield. The sorties culminated in a battle above Suwon in the midst of a conference of US military leaders in the town. Leaders including US Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer and General of the Army Douglas MacArthur personally witnessed the final sortie of the day, in which four <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> aircraft attacked four F-51 Mustang aircraft over the town. The four F-51s succeeded in shooting down all four of the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> aircraft, with Lieutenant Orrin R. Fox scoring two kills and Lieutenants Richard J. Burns, and Harry T. Sandlin scoring one each. Ground forces also downed a <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> aircraft during a subsequent attack. MacArthur subsequently authorized Stratemeyer to launch strikes into North Korea to destroy <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> airfields and establish air superiority for the US forces.|$|E
5|$|Still farther northward in {{the zone}} of the US 38th Infantry the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were also active. At 06:00 on September 3, 300 <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{launched}} an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post. This fight continued until September 5. On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 <b>North</b> <b>Koreans.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} {{in and around the}} fortress, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to fight on the front lines, eventually preventing the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> from the area.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} some <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> working in Sarawak {{in the mine}} industry. This was {{revealed}} after a tragedy that killed one and injuring seven others <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> in 2014.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the initial}} penetration, the 34th Infantry line moved south to Nonsan. The 19th Infantry moved its 2nd Battalion to fill {{some of the}} gaps left by the 34th, {{reinforced}} by Republic of Korea Army troops. The combined forces observed a large build-up of <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops {{on the other side}} of the river. At 03:00 on 16 July, the North Koreans launched a massive barrage of tank, artillery and mortar fire on the 19th Infantry's positions and <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops began to cross the river in boats. The <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces gathered on the west bank and assaulted the positions of 1st Battalion's C and E companies, followed by a second landing against B Company. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces pushed against the entire battalion, threatening to overwhelm it. The regimental commander ordered all support troops and officers to the line and they were able to repulse the assault. However, in the melee, <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces infiltrated their rear elements, attacking the reserve forces and blocking supply lines. Stretched thin, the 19th Infantry was unable to hold the line at the Kum River and simultaneously repel the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|Half of the regiment's {{strength}} {{was ordered to}} retreat from its position before the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> force was encountered, leaving the flank open for the remaining force, 1st Battalion at Pyongtaek. The battalion encountered <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces the morning of July 6, and after a brief fight, was unable to repel them effectively. The battalion then mounted a disorganized retreat to Cheonan several miles away, having failed to significantly delay the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces in their movement south.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an airdrop of supplies. A US plane attempted the drop, but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> hands. The men in the perimeter did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class Joseph R. Ouellette, of H Company, left the perimeter to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} was a two-week battle around Tabu-dong and Waegwan {{in which the}} <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were able to gradually push the 1st Cavalry Division back from its lines. However, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{were not able to}} force the US troops to withdraw completely or push the UN out of Taegu. When the UN counterattacked at Inchon, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> were forced to abandon their attack on Tabu-dong.|$|R
5000|$|<b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> also {{frequently}} visit Singapore for training programs on economic policy, entrepreneurship and law largely through Singapore-based non-governmental organization Choson Exchange’s programs. <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{have a positive}} view of Singapore’s economic development and its political stability. Choson Exchange is a Singapore-based NGO focused on supporting entrepreneurship in North Korea. From 2011 to 2016, the organization brought over 100 <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> to the country. [...] Choson Exchange was founded by a Singaporean, Geoffrey See.|$|R
50|$|In the quarterfinal round, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> {{faced the}} Portugal {{national}} football team. The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> scored three unanswered {{goals in the}} first 24 minutes. Portugal needed a four-goal effort by Eusébio to pull out a 5-3 victory.|$|R
5|$|In the {{mountains}} northeast of Waegwan, the ROK 1st Division continued to suffer <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> attacks throughout mid-August. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> pressure against the ROK division never ceased for long. US planners believed the main <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> attack {{would come from}} the west, and so it massed its forces {{to the west of}} Taegu. It mistakenly believed up to 40,000 <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops were near Taegu. This number was above the actual troop numbers for North Korea, which had only 70,000 men along the entire perimeter.|$|E
5|$|<b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{casualties}} {{could not}} be estimated {{because of lack of}} communications between units during the battle, which limited the value of American signals intelligence. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> armor suffered heavy losses. A total of 15–20 <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> tanks were destroyed by anti-tank weapons and US aircraft, and <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> prisoners estimated that 15 76-mm guns, six 122-mm mortars, and 200 artillerymen were lost. Losses among <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> infantry were heavy, especially in the NK 3rd Division. The NK 3rd division was reported between 60 and 80 percent of its strength {{at the beginning of the}} battle and was reduced to 50 percent by its end, with total casualties ranging from 1,250 to 3,300.|$|E
5|$|<b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. The <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from the north, against the flank. The <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 105th Armored Division. Although the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju against the American right flank, it was slow to move and arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|Some historians contend {{the goals}} of the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> at the Pusan Perimeter were {{unattainable}} from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line. At the same time, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> could not keep up the strength of their attacks. Most of the front saw only probing actions {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|R
5000|$|... 17 January 1968: In an {{incident}} {{known as the}} Blue House Raid, a 31-man detachment from the Korean People's Army secretly crosses the DMZ {{on a mission to}} kill South Korean President Park Chung-hee on 21 January, nearly succeeding. The incursion was discovered after South Korean civilians confronted the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> and informed the authorities. After entering Seoul disguised as South <b>Korean</b> soldiers, the <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> attempt to enter the Blue House (the official residence of the President of South Korea). The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> are confronted by South Korean police and a firefight ensued. The <b>North</b> <b>Koreans</b> fled Seoul and individually attempted to cross the DMZ back to North Korea. Of the original group of 31 <b>North</b> <b>Koreans,</b> 28 were killed, one was captured, and two are unaccounted for. Additionally, 68 South Koreans were killed and 66 were wounded, the majority of whom were soldiers and police officers. Three American soldiers were also killed and three were wounded.|$|R

5|$|<b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops {{continued}} {{attacking the}} 24th Infantry all across its line, probing for weaknesses. On August 25 and 26, C Company beat off several more <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> attacks on Battle Mountain coming along the long ridge extending from Tundok. At {{one point in}} these fights, a flight of US Air Force aircraft caught about 100 <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> soldiers in the open and immediately napalmed, bombed, and strafed them. The <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> force was destroyed with few survivors. Task Force Baker, comprising C Company and a platoon of E Company, 24th Infantry with an ROK police company, defended Battle Mountain at this time. The special command was established because of the isolated Battle Mountain area and the extended regimental battle front. For the next two days, air strikes continued to rack <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> counterattacks and {{to prevent them from}} forming into any serious attack on Battle Mountain.|$|E
5|$|<b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{troops had}} the {{advantage}} of planning the invasion in advance and organizing a pre-set logistics network, but they were not able to keep this logistics network running efficiently. Their largest disadvantage was the successful large-scale UN interdiction effort, as <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> supplies and supply lines were subjected to UN bombing raids. This effort was not successful in stopping the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> supplies, and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for {{the way in which they}} were able to maintain a supply network in the face of a massive bombing campaign. However, the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this, and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads' advantage. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces, though initially successful, were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense, and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own. This meant their supply network limited the combat actions that they could undertake; logistics could not keep up with units on the offensive, and <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements, reducing their ability to fight effectively. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon. This landing, coming behind <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> lines, had the effect of collapsing the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August, Task Force Bradley {{struck out}} from Yongil Airfield to counterattack the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces around P'ohang-dong while Task Force P'ohang {{attacked}} from An'gang-ni area. Both forces immediately met resistance from <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces. By that time, the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces had captured P'ohang-dong. What followed was a complicated series of fights through the large region around P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni as South Korean ground forces, aided by U.S. air forces engaged groups of <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces operation {{all around the}} vicinity.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, {{exhausted}} <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> {{troops were}} caught unaware by the landings at Inchon, far behind their lines. Those forces that remained after 15 days of fighting {{were forced to}} retreat in a total rout or risk being completely cut off. Isolated <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> resistance continued until September 18, but on that date UN troops were mounting a full-scale breakout offensive and pursuing retreating <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> units to the north, ending the fighting around the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Over two weeks, <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> and South Korean ground units {{fought in}} several bloody back-and-forth battles, taking and retaking ground in which neither {{was able to}} gain the upper hand.

5|$|Positioned {{in defense}} of Masan during the Battle of Masan, the US 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division took up {{positions}} along the Nam River, {{one of the many}} tributaries of the Naktong River on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter. The <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> People's Army's 7th Division effected a crossing of the river on August 31, and though the 35th Infantry was able to stem the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> advance, thousands of <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops were able to exploit a hole in the line and surround the regiment. What followed was an intense battle in which the US and <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> units were heavily engaged all along and behind the Kum River line. Eventually, though, the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> force was routed and defeated by the US troops.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Battalion {{had walked}} into a {{prepared}} <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> ambush, suffering a bombardment of mortar and machine gun fire from prepared and hidden <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> positions, and almost its entire command group was eliminated within a minute of the first shot being fired. L Company, at the pass, was heavily engaged with the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces higher on the hill. The company's 1st Platoon sustained a direct assault on its foxholes, with {{two members of the}} company killed by bayonets. L Company was separated {{from the rest of the}} battalion by <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces advancing on its position further up the ridge. K Company attempted to move up to relieve it but was unable to do so. However, the company held in place. Meanwhile, I Company began moving up the hill to provide support. <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces were able to cut the battalion into disorganized groups, with L Company engaging forces in the pass and I Company under attack from forces on the north ridge behind them. By noon, the <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> forces on the higher ground had enveloped the American forces.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war. The fight showed that American forces were weak and {{unprepared}} for the war; outdated equipment was insufficient to fight <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> armor and poorly trained and inexperienced units were no match for better-trained <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops– though the disparity in number of troops engaged certainly {{had a profound effect}} on the outcome of this and future battles. Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops to capture. Smith also said he felt he had stayed too long in his position, allowing <b>North</b> <b>Korean</b> troops to envelop the force and cause heavy casualties as it retreated.
