40|$|ABSTRACT. Pistachio (Pistacia vera) <b>nuts</b> with {{shell and}} kernel defects detract from {{consumer}} acceptance and, in some cases, {{may be more}} prone to insect damage, mold decay, and/or aflatoxin contamination. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop imaging algorithms to improve sorting of <b>nuts</b> with the following shell defects: oily stains, dark stains, adhering hull, and the following kernel defects: navel orangeworm (NOW) damage, fungal decay, and Aspergillus molds, all of which indicate risk of aflatoxin contamination. Imaging algorithms were developed to distinguish normal <b>nuts</b> from those <b>nuts</b> with oily stains, dark stains, and adhering hull as well as <b>nuts</b> having kernel defects. Image algorithm testing on a validation data set showed that <b>nuts</b> having oily stain, dark stain, or adhering hull could be distinguished from normal <b>nuts</b> with an accuracy of 98 %. Removing <b>nuts</b> with oily stain, dark stain, and adhering hull will also remove 89. 7 % of <b>nuts</b> with kernel decay, 93. 8 % of <b>nuts</b> with Aspergillus molds present, and 98. 7 % of NOW positive <b>nuts...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{center of}} mass of the whole system (containing the mixed <b>nuts)</b> in an {{arbitrary}} state is not optimally low; it has the tendency to be higher due to there being more empty space around the larger Brazil <b>nuts</b> than around smaller <b>nuts.</b> When the <b>nuts</b> are shaken, the system has the tendency {{to move to a}} lower energy state, which means moving the {{center of mass}} down by moving the smaller <b>nuts</b> down and thereby the Brazil <b>nuts</b> up.|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} the ?, ?, and (?+?) -tocopherol isomers and the amounts of the {{minerals}} Se, Zn, Ca, Fe, K, Mn, Mg, and Cu were analyzed in chestnuts. High contents of Zn (> 65 %) relative to the recommended dietary intake (RDI) were found in all chestnuts except macadamia <b>nuts</b> (25 % of the RDI). All samples had Se contents higher than the RDI: Brazil <b>nuts</b> > macadamia <b>nuts,</b> cashew <b>nuts</b> > pecans > almonds > pistachio <b>nuts</b> > hazelnuts > European <b>nuts.</b> A greater concentration of ?-tocopherol was found in almonds (30 % of RDI). All samples, except for hazelnuts, almonds, and macadamia <b>nuts,</b> had (?+?) - tocopherols, with the largest amount found in pistachios.
