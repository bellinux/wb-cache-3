The city was dominated by the K'iche' until the Spanish Conquest of the early 16th century.|$|E

[...] In the early 1960s, Iowa21 was {{straightened}} through Keokuk County near Guernsey and Deep River. [...] This caused {{the eastern end of}} Iowa85 to move east back {{to the point where it}} had turned into an east–west route in the 1930s. [...] The route would remain this way for nearly thirty years. [...] In 1994, the westernmost [...] of Iowa85 was turned over to the City of Montezuma.

500|$|The desired or correct {{sentence}} spacing {{is often}} debated but many sources <b>now</b> <b>say</b> additional space {{is not necessary}} or desirable. [...] From around 1950, single sentence spacing became standard in books, magazines and newspapers, {{and the majority of}} style guides that use a Latin-derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence. [...] However, some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable. [...] The debate continues. [...] Many people prefer double sentence spacing for informal use because that was how they were taught to type. [...] There is a debate on which convention is more readable; the few recent direct studies conducted since 2002 have produced inconclusive results.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked why}} he had not asked Meckiff to bowl {{at the other end}} to gauge the {{judgment}} of the other umpire, Lou Rowan, Benaud replied [...] "over the years I have always accepted the umpire's decision". The Australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent, and one of his predecessors Lindsay Hassett believed Meckiff should have been used at reduced speed. Rowan later indicated his concurrence with Egar, writing in his book The Umpire's Story, [...] "There is nothing I can <b>now</b> <b>say</b> that will alter the opinions already expressed that his [...] delivery was unfair". For his part, Meckiff said: [...] "the game is bigger than the individual" [...] and he backed Benaud's decision because doing otherwise [...] "could only have added fuel to the controversy".|$|E

Rinuccio defends Schicchi in an aria [...] "Avete torto" [...] (You're mistaken), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive.

Rinuccio and Lauretta listen in despair as Schicchi announces that he will {{have nothing to do with}} such people. Lauretta makes a final plea to him with [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] (Oh, my dear papa), and he agrees to look at the will. After twice scrutinizing it and concluding that nothing can be done, an idea occurs to him. He sends his daughter outside so that she will be innocent of what is to follow.|$|E

500|$|In early 2010, an Afghan man {{approached}} the NDS claiming to represent senior Taliban commander Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. Offering a letter allegedly written by Mansour, he said Mansour was interested {{to open a}} channel for negotiations. Saleh's people started testing the credentials of the supposed messenger, and judged them to be false, closing the case. The man then approached other Afghan government institutions. Saleh recounts, [...] "When I learned ... {{that he was going}} through a different avenue, I warned the government that if it is this Aminullah, if he claims this, and if it is this guy, trust me, he is not representing anybody; it's a scam. ... Be careful. This is not Mansour. But there was a perception that Amrullah is against talks, so let's sideline him." [...] The Afghan man, who lived in Pakistan where the Taliban's leadership council is based, subsequently held three meetings with NATO and Afghan officials. Having been flown from Pakistan to Kabul on a NATO airplane, the man met with President Karzai in the presidential palace. In late 2010, it turned out, that the supposed representative for Mansour was an impostor as Saleh had previously warned. The New York Times writes: [...] "In an episode that could have been lifted from a spy novel, United States and Afghan officials <b>now</b> <b>say</b> the Afghan man was an impostor." ...|$|E

2500|$|From a musician’s {{perspective}} or piano player’s perspective, he matters {{because he}} {{figured out how}} to do things no one had ever done before, at least in a rhythm-and-blues context....
