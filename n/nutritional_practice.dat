The major problems are protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies such as vitamin A, iron, and Iodine. During HSDP I & II, In addition to the efforts by Agricultural and Rural Development Sector which has the role of making adequate nutrition available to the population, the Health Sector initiated enhancing good <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice</b> through health education and treatment of severely malnourished children and prevention of nutritional health problems through provision of micronutrients to the vulnerable group of the population (mothers and children). Nutrition has also been made part of packages of the HEP.One of the achievements of HSDP III is {{the development and implementation}} of the National Nutrition Strategy and programme. To achieve HSDP target of creating access for 90% of children 6-59 months for nutritional screening, nutritional screening is underway every three months at HP level with plan to screen more than 95% of the 6-59 months children. With respect to the plan to increase the proportion of infants 0-5 months exclusively breast fed from 38% to 63%, a study done in four regions of (Amhara, Oromiya, SNNP and Tigray) showed that the prevalence of exclusive breast feeding has reached 76% in 2008/09.|$|E

40|$|Background: Malnutrition {{is common}} in elderly. Possible causes are {{multimorbidity}} and natural changes from ageing. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to describe nutritional competence and <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice</b> among health care workers in nursing homes in two municipalities. Method: Health care workers from ten nursing homes received an electronic questionnaire. The questionnaire included 49 items regarding practice of documentation, self-reported nutritional competence, and knowledge about anthropometric measures and body mass index. In addition, familiarity of key documents and guidelines about nutrition were assessed. The data was analyzed with frequencies, Chi-square, and regression analyses. Results: Out of 542 invited participants, 185 (34 %) responded to the survey, of which 37 % were registered nurses. The majority reported good nutritional competence. A small proportion were familiar with relevant documents about nutrition; 25 % knew the “Norwegian dietary guidelines” and 37 % were familiar with the “Dietary handbook”. The health care workers reported to have a good <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice,</b> especially of documenting food intake. The practice of measuring weight and height both on admission and regularly was good, but knowledge and practice regarding body mass index were insufficient. The staff wished for increased knowledge about nutrition, especially in dementia and patients with chronical diseases. Conclusion: Self-perceived nutritional competence and -practice were relatively good, but there is room for improvement especially in regarding and familiarity with relevant documents and use of body mass index. The health care workers wanted more knowledge about nutrition. Key Words: Health care worker, nursing home, nutritional competence, <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice,</b> elderly, malnutritio...|$|E
40|$|Background/Objectives: Malnutrition {{is present}} in 20 – 50 % of hospitalized patients, and {{nutritional}} care is a challenge. The aim was to evaluate whether {{the implementation of a}} nutritional strategy would influence nutritional care performance in a university hospital. Subjects/Methods: This was a prospective quality improvement program implementing guidelines for nutritional care, with the aim of improving <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice.</b> The Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS) 2002 was used. Point prevalence surveys over 2 years to determine whether <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice</b> had improved. Results: In total, 3604 (70 %) of 5183 eligible patients were screened and 1230 (34 %) were at nutritional risk. Only 53 % of the at-risk patients got nutritional treatment and 5 % were seen by a dietician. The proportion of patients screened increased from the first to the eighth point prevalence survey (P= 0. 012), but not the proportion of patients treated (P= 0. 66). The four initial screening questions in NRS 2002 identified 92 % of the patients not at nutritional risk. Conclusions: Implementation of nutritional guidelines improved the screening performance, but did not increase the proportion of patients who received nutritional treatment. Point prevalence surveys were useful to evaluate <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice</b> in this university hospital. In order to improve practice, we suggest using only the four initial screening questions in NRS 2002 to identify patients not at risk, better education in nutritional care for physicians and nurses, and more dieticians employed. Audit of implementation of guidelines, performed by health authorities, and specific reimbursement for managing nutrition may also improve practice. </p...|$|E

30|$|Early enteral {{nutrition}} {{is the preferred}} administration route, according to current guidelines. However, reasons for withholding {{enteral nutrition}} varied between centers, and were not evidence based. [29, 30]. These large variations in responses from PICUs reflect the absence of guidance regarding many practical nutrition delivery issues. One example {{is the lack of}} any pediatric studies on prokinetic use in the PICU population. Additionally, the indications for and benefits of post-pyloric feeding on nutrition goal achievement in PICU remain unclear [31, 32]. Local written nutrition guidelines and local nutrition support teams would also help to improve <b>nutritional</b> <b>practices</b> within PICUs [33].

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of beliefs on <b>nutritional</b> <b>practices</b> of pregnant women in Saveh University of Medical Sciences, Iran. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional and analytical study carried out on 260 pregnant women in health centers of Saveh University of Medical Sciences. A multiplestage sampling protocol was used. Data was collected based on the health belief model (susceptibility, severity, perceived benefits and barriers, self-efficacy and cues to action) as well as the checklist of practices of pregnant women about diet. Independent t-test, oneway ANOVA and Bivariate (Pearson’s) correlation were conducted to analyze the data. All the analyses were performed in SPSS version 21. Results: The mean age of participant was 5 ± 27. 4 and the mean gestational age was 5. 5 ± 2. 4.

40|$|Strength {{training}} elicits sports {{related and}} health benefits {{for both men}} and women. Although sexual dimorphism is observed in exercise metabolism, there is little information outlining the specific nutritional needs of women strength athletes. Many women athletes restrict energy intake, specifically fat consumption, in order to modify body composition, but this <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice</b> is often counter‐productive. Compared to men, women appear to be less reliant on glycogen during exercise and less responsive to carbohydrate mediated glycogen synthesis during recovery. Female strength athletes may require more protein than their sedentary and endurance training counterparts to attain positive nitrogen balance and promote protein synthesis. Therefore, women strength athletes should put less emphasis on a very high carbohydrate intake and more emphasis on quality protein and fat consumption in the context of energy balance to enhance adaptations to training and improve general health. Attention to timing of nutrient ingestion, macronutrient quality, and dietary supplementation (for example, creatine) are briefly discussed as important components of a nutritionally adequate and effective strength training diet for women...|$|E

A total of 123 doctors (including general medicine, endocrinology, and critical care) and 56 dietitians completed a questionnaire. Doctors displayed moderate confidence in providing nutrition care but were less confident in their skills relating to advocacy and leadership. Dietitians displayed greater confidence than doctors in providing nutrition care but similarly lacked confidence in skills relating to advocacy and leadership.

40|$|The {{pancreas}} is a {{major player}} in nutrient digestion. In chronic pancreatitis both exocrine and endocrine insufficiency may develop leading to malnutrition over time. Maldigestion is often a late complication of chronic pancreatic and depends on the severity of the underlying disease. The severity of malnutrition is correlated with two major factors: (1) malabsorption and depletion of nutrients (e. g., alcoholism and pain) causes impaired nutritional status; and (2) increased metabolic activity due to the severity of the disease. Nutritional deficiencies negatively affect outcome if they are not treated. Nutritional assessment and the clinical severity of the disease are important for planning any nutritional intervention. Good <b>nutritional</b> <b>practice</b> includes screening to identify patients at risk, followed by a thoroughly nutritional assessment and nutrition plan for risk patients. Treatment should be multidisciplinary and the mainstay of treatment is abstinence from alcohol, pain treatment, dietary modifications and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. To achieve energy-end protein requirements, oral supplementation might be beneficial. Enteral nutrition may be used when patients do not have sufficient calorie intake as in pylero-duodenal-stenosis, inflammation or prior to surgery and can be necessary if weight loss continues. Parenteral nutrition is very seldom used in patients with chronic pancreatitis and should only be used in case of GI-tract obstruction or as a supplement to enteral nutrition...|$|E
