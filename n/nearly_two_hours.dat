Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.|$|E

Under these conditions the 91st Regiment managed to reach Kosor from Penek (a distance of just 8km) in 21 hours. Other units reached their destinations at a similar rate. While Enver was ordering a night attack, elements of the X Corps were spending the night in the villages of Kosor, Arsenik, and Patsik, which were 40, 35 and 30 kilometers from Sarikamish respectively. The Allahüekber Mountains were still to be crossed. Thousands of Turkish soldiers died of hypothermia in the snow.|$|E

Button extended his Championship lead by one point to 15 ahead of Barrichello, with just three races remaining. Vettel was 25 points behind Button while Webber's crash meant he was now officially {{out of the running}} for the World Championship. Brawn would need 12 points from the remaining three races to clinch the Constructors' Championship, while Ferrari's poor race, with neither driver scoring points, allowed McLaren to close the gap to Ferrari to three points in the battle for third.|$|E

The assault on the battery was successful, capturing the guns and scattering the troops from Illinois and Iowa. Hamilton repulsed the attack on his position and then sent a portion of his command to the assistance of Davies, who rallied his men, drove the Confederates out of the battery, and recaptured the guns.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 1799, after reconnoitering two French frigates in L'Orient, St Fiorenzo and HMS Amelia sailed towards Belle Île. Conditions were hazy and {{although}} Neale had sighted some vessels, {{it was only}} when he had passed the island that he discovered three French frigates and a large gun vessel. At that instant a sudden squall carried away Amelias main-top-mast and fore and mizzen top-gallant masts; the fall of the main-top-mast tore away much of the mainsail from the yard. Neale shortened St Fiorenzos sail and ordered Amelia to keep close to St Fiorenzo to maintain the weather gage, and to prepare for battle. An action commenced but the French vessels avoided close-quarter action and, although the British ships came under fire from shore batteries, they had to bear down on the French three times to engage them. After <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> the French wore ship and sailed away to take refuge in the Loire, with the gun-vessel returning to Belle Île.|$|E

After forcing the door Henry Blogg found two dogs, one a large St. Bernard the other a small terrier. The terrier, which had been terrified ran away, deep into the {{wreckage}} of the ship, never to be seen again. The St Bernard was carefully carried down a rope ladder to the safety of H F Bailey. In another cabin the lifeboat men found several cage-birds and these were also rescued.The H F Bailey returned to its berthing at the shed at the end of Cromer Pier. The lifeboat arrived at 1:00pm on 16 October, <b>nearly</b> fifty <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> after she had first launched from Cromer. Lifeboat H F Bailey had travelled a total distance of seventy miles on the Rescue. The rescued St Bernard was taken by the Police and placed in quarantine for six months. A grateful Captain Solvatore presented the dog to Henry Blogg after the quarantine period. Henry Blogg christened the dog Monte and Blogg became deeply attached to his first and only dog. Monte died in 1935 but his memory lives on as he is the mascot and corporate symbol at the Henry Blogg Lifeboat Museum in Cromer, Norfolk.|$|R

Lancashire recovered somewhat before rain stopped play for <b>nearly</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> but when the players returned, Abdur Razzak ran through the middle order.

As the conspirators entered the building the electric lighting was switched off throughout the palace. While several officers of the Royal Guard were involved in the plot, the majority of the guards on duty were not. However in the darkness and confusion they did not attempt an effective defense.

[...] Edward Falco corroborated, [...] "Her poems, spoken out loud or heard {{in the process of}} reading, offer a subtle, magnificent jazz: a music for the intellect, felt on the tongue and in the body, resonating in the mind. And nowhere is the music of Fultons poetry more stirring than in Sensual Math." [...] Sensual Math contained a long sequence [...] "reimagining Daphne and Apollo." [...] Donald Riggs writes helpfully about Fultons translation from the Latin and concludes, [...] "It is within this larger and deeper context that Ovids tale of Daphne and Apollo takes on, in Fultons version, an expanded significance: that of the suppression of womens power by the Indo-Aryan patriarchal culture."
