There he saw his first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the finches he was <b>not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.|$|E
25|$|A {{difficulty}} {{encountered in}} the creation of models is that often Leonardo had not entirely thought through the mechanics of a machine before he drew it, or else he used a sort of graphic shorthand, simply <b>not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> draw a gear or a lever at a point where one is essential {{in order to make a}} machine function. This lack of refinement of mechanical details can cause considerable confusion. Thus many models that are created, such as some of those on display at Clos Luce, Leonardo's home in France, do not work, but would work, with a little mechanical tweaking.|$|E
25|$|In Lancashire's second innings, Ottis Gibson got {{two quick}} wickets as Lancashire fell to 22 for 3 shortly before stumps {{on the second}} day, but Australians Stuart Law and Andrew Symonds batted well {{together}} with a 111-run partnership before Law was out to Henderson. Symonds powered on from there, bludgeoning 17 fours in his 121, and Glen Chapple and Warren Hegg made season-best scores of 60 and 77 respectively as they added for 121 for the eighth wicket. Lancashire declared on 368 for 9, <b>not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> send in James Anderson to bat, thinking he might be better use with the ball. Indeed, he was - he took three for 39 before stumps on day three, as Leicestershire collapsed to 78 for 5 in chase of 399. There wasn't much respite {{on the fourth day}} either - after Dinesh Mongia and Habib had added 27, Anderson came back with two quick wickets, finishing with five for 79. Dominic Cork and debutant leg-spinner Simon Marshall wrapped up the Leicestershire chase as they were all out for 164.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the idea}} of the cunning folk began to appear in the {{literature}} of the period. In 1638, the playwright Thomas Heywood published his comedy, The Wise Woman of Hogsdon, whilst in 1684 another playwright, Edward Ravenscroft, published his own play about a cunning woman. With the decline in the witch trials {{in the latter part of}} the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, partly due to the rise of the Enlightenment amongst the educated elite, a new law was introduced, the Witchcraft Act of 1736. Unlike earlier laws, this did not accept the existence of magic, and was designed to be used to prosecute those who claimed magical powers as being fraudulent; it could therefore be very damaging to the cunning profession. The new regulations imposed by the Witchcraft Act of 1736 laid down a maximum penalty of a year's imprisonment for the crime of deceiving people by claiming magical powers, but in effect, during the rest of the eighteenth century, there were very few prosecutions, with most authorities <b>not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> enforce this particular law.|$|E
25|$|The Civil War {{increased}} {{the importance of}} Jeffersonville, as the city {{was one of the}} principal gateways to the South during the war, due to its location directly opposite Louisville. It was served by three railroads from the north and had the waterway of the Ohio River. This factor influenced its selection as one of the principal bases for supplies and troops for the Union Army. Operating in the South, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad furnished the connecting link between Louisville {{and the rest of the}} South. Camp Joe Holt was instrumental in keeping Kentucky within the Union. The third largest Civil War hospital, Jefferson General Hospital was located in nearby Port Fulton (now within Jeffersonville) from 1864 to 1866, as it was close to the river and Louisville. The original land was seized by the federal government from the Honorable Jesse D. Bright, United States Senator, a sympathizer of the Confederate cause. During the war it housed 16,120 patients in its 5,200 beds and was under the command of Dr. Middleton Goldsmith. A cemetery was built for fallen soldiers down the hill, but the wooden grave markers had decayed by 1927, causing the Jeffersonville city council to build a ball field over the cemetery, and <b>not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> move the graves, located on Crestview Avenue. The Jeffersonville Quartermaster Intermediate Depot had its first beginning in the early days of the Civil War, near its present location.|$|E

2500|$|Deceit, fraud, and {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation, are {{all legal}} terms related to deliberately making an untruthful statement. In law, the criterion used {{is that the}} person did not actually have an [...] "honest belief" [...] (or [...] "honestly held belief") that their statement was true. More exactly, it is an untruthful statement that is made (a) knowingly, and either (b) without belief in its truth or (c) reckless {{as to whether or}} not it is true. At times, recklessness, silence, or omission can also be enough to make a misrepresentation fraudulent or deceitful, for example where the person showed either utter indifference or a lack of care whether or not the statement was true, or deliberately stays silent when a previous statement is no longer the case. This can also include <b>not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> check whether or not the statement is true. Fraud and deceit differ from negligence, because they are based on dishonesty while negligence means something closer to 'unreasonable carelessness' or 'lack of expected professional skill'.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 November 1808, Marshal Nicolas Soult {{replaced}} Bessières {{in command}} of the II Corps with Mouton's troops designated the 1st Division. The next day, Soult crushed an outclassed Spanish [...] army at the Battle of Burgos. Seeing the Spanish deployed in a bad position, the French marshal placed Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud's dragoon division on the left, Antoine Lasalle's light cavalry in the center, and Mouton's infantry on the right. <b>Not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> wait for divisions under Pierre Hugues Victoire Merle and Jean Pierre François Bonet to arrive, Soult ordered an attack. After a cavalry charge collapsed the Spanish right wing, Lasalle's horsemen swung to take the left wing in flank while Mouton's foot soldiers mounted a frontal attack. In the subsequent slaughter, French losses were probably less than 200 while the Spanish may have lost 2,500 killed and wounded and another 900 captured. The same regiments fought under Merle at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809, but Rey was no longer with the division by that time. The brigadiers were Reynaud, Jacques Thomas Sarrut, and Jean Guillaume Barthélemy Thomières.|$|E
2500|$|Raids {{during the}} Blitz {{produced}} the greatest divisions and morale {{effects in the}} working-class areas. Lack of sleep, insufficient shelters and inefficiency of warning systems were causes. The loss of sleep was a particular factor, with many <b>not</b> <b>bothering</b> <b>to</b> attend inconvenient shelters. The Communist Party made political capital out of these difficulties. In {{the wake of the}} Coventry Blitz, there was widespread agitation from the Communist Party over the need for bomb-proof shelters. Many Londoners, in particular, took to using the Underground railway system, without authority, for shelter and sleeping through the night. So worried were the Government over the sudden campaign of leaflets and posters distributed by the Communist Party in Coventry and London, that the police were sent to seize their production facilities. The Government, up until November 1940, was opposed to the centralised organisation of shelter. Home Secretary Sir John Anderson was replaced by Morrison soon afterwards, {{in the wake of a}} Cabinet reshuffle as the dying Neville Chamberlain resigned. Morrison warned that he could not counter the Communist unrest unless provision of shelters were made. He recognised the right of the public to seize tube stations and authorised plans to improve their condition and expand them by tunnelling. Still, many British citizens, who had been members of the Labour Party, itself inert over the issue, turned to the Communist Party. The Communists attempted to blame the damage and casualties of the Coventry raid on the rich factory owners, big business and landowning interests and called for a negotiated peace. Though they failed to make a large gain in influence, the membership of the Party had doubled by June 1941. The [...] "Communist threat" [...] was deemed important enough for Herbert Morrison to order, with the support of the Cabinet, the stoppage of the Daily Worker and The Week; the Communist newspaper and journal.|$|E
