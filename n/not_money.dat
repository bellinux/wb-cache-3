5|$|Yuricich's {{previous}} {{work had been}} as Director of Photography for Photographic Effects on Close Encounters, and he and Trumbull reassembled the crew and equipment from the feature, adding more personnel and space. Time, <b>not</b> <b>money,</b> was the main issue; Trumbull had to deliver in nine months twice the effects as found in Star Wars or Close Encounters, which had taken years to complete. The Glencoe-based facilities the teams had used for Close Encounters were deemed insufficient, and a nearby facility was rented and outfitted with five more stages equipped with camera tracks and systems. Dykstra and his 60-person production house Apogee Company were subcontracted to Trumbull.|$|E

[...] However, Williams suggested that the exiles give the natives a gratuity in the form of tools, coats and wampum. [...] On 24 March 1638 Williams drew up the deed granting Aquidneck Island to the settlers. [...] The deed was signed [...] "at Narragansett" [...] (likely Providence) by the sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi, with Williams and Randall Holden being the witnesses. [...] The names of many of the exiles were included on the deed; Coddington's name appeared first because he was responsible for the gratuity.|$|E
500|$|The gap was filled, {{beginning}} in 1787, by private minters and companies, who issued copper halfpenny and penny tokens. Although <b>not</b> <b>money</b> {{in a legal}} sense, they served that purpose, and rapidly spread across the country. Many of the manufacturers of these tokens were found in Birmingham, where industrialist Matthew Boulton [...] struck large numbers of tokens [...] and also constructed the Soho Mint, {{the first to be}} powered by steam. He aggressively lobbied for a contract to strike official copper coins. In 1797, the government gave Boulton a contract to strike 480 tonnes of copper pennies and 20 tonnes of copper twopences. The first official British coins of those denominations to be made of copper, they were also the first official British coins to be struck by steam rather than by muscle power.|$|E
500|$|Private gold pieces, {{sometimes}} dubbed [...] "pioneer gold", {{were struck}} {{several times during}} the 19th century from locally produced bullion in areas where federal coins were scarce. These unofficial coins came from sites ranging from Georgia to Oregon. [...] Many, ranging in denomination from 25 cents to 50 dollars, are relics of the California Gold Rush and its aftermath. [...] The fifty-dollar denomination was struck by private minters such as Kellogg and Co. The private $50 pieces were round in form, but those struck by Augustus Humbert for the U.S. Assay Office at San Francisco, prior to the establishment of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, were octagonal. Humbert's pieces were <b>not</b> <b>money</b> in a legal sense, as Congress had not authorized them as legal tender, and were officially deemed ingots. Nevertheless, they contained their full value in gold. [...] Bearing the denomination [...] "Fifty Dollars", they were called [...] "slugs" [...] or [...] "quintuple eagles" [...] by the public. They circulated widely in California and elsewhere in the Far West, and were accepted on par with federal gold coins.|$|E

500|$|Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine {{was more}} {{critical}} in his review, though {{he gave it}} a 2.5star (out of 4) rating. While he positively called Gaga's performances outrageous and [...] "occasionally fierce", he questioned Gaga's authenticity, both on stage and in the pre-concert scenes. Ultimately, he wrote, [...] "Unsurprisingly, HBO's Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden raises more questions about Stefani Germanotta (Gaga's birth name) than it answers, which is probably as it should be." [...] Radio host Howard Stern also compared the black-and-white scenes of the special to Madonna: Truth or Dare, adding that when he darts a glance at Lady Gaga, she is occasionally registered in his brain as Madonna. On his show, Stern was also critical of inappropriateness and unreasonability of the numerous speeches Gaga gave between the songs in the special, calling them [...] "", [...] "drivel", and [...] "condescending". Dedicating over {{half an hour of}} his show on May 9 and 10, 2011, to express his criticism of the concert, Stern compared the manner of Gaga's speaking to professional wrestling due to echoing, Gaga's gasping between the words, and the audience's arguable inability to hear the words enough to understand them. In particular, Gaga claimed in the concert that her incentive to work is to [...] "set [...] free", <b>not</b> <b>money.</b> Stern attempted to debunk that claim by arguing that Gaga takes potentially psychiatric problems of her audience lightly by urging her fans to [...] "forget all of [...] insecurities" [...] overnight.|$|E
