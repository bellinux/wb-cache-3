5|$|The {{flowers are}} fed at by {{a range of}} <b>nectarivorous</b> birds: mainly honeyeaters, {{including}} the New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), white-cheeked honeyeater (P. nigra), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), singing honeyeater (Lichenostomus virescens), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops) and red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata). Lorikeets have also been observed feeding at the flowers, as have insects, including ants, bees, and aphids. Of these, evidence suggests that only birds are effective pollinators. Insects apparently play no role in pollination, since inflorescences do not form follicles when birds are excluded in pollinator exclusion experiments; and pollination by mammals has never been recorded in this species.|$|E
5|$|Four {{species of}} bird have been {{observed}} visiting the flowers of B.telmatiaea: the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). The introduced European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also commonly observed, and visits by ants and Hylaeus plasterer bees have been recorded. Visits by <b>nectarivorous</b> mammals have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their scats have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other Banksia species have consistently demonstrated their involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the B.telmatiaea spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks at dawn and dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed {{in the morning and}} evening respectively, as opposed to insects, which are most active during the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} found in {{southeast}} Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and southwest Western Australia in open forest and woodland, and is a common visitor to urban gardens and parks. Loud and conspicuous, the red wattlebird is generally found in trees, where it gets most of its food; occasionally it forages on the ground. It {{is one of the}} largest <b>nectarivorous</b> birds in the world, feeding from a wide variety of flowering plants. Insects also comprise part of its diet. It is territorial and at times aggressive to birds of other species, often defending rich sources of nectar. Breeding throughout its range, the red wattlebird builds a cup-shaped nest in a tree and raises one to two broods a year. Although it has declined in places from land clearing, it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|There are {{primarily}} two feeding guilds in Lepidoptera – the <b>nectarivorous</b> who obtain {{the majority of}} their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices of rotting fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are substantial differences between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding guilds. Hawkmoths (family Sphingidae) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corrollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially noctuid moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies. Certain noctuid species have developed piercing mouthparts; the proboscis has sclerotised scales on the tip with which to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices. Proboscises in some Heliconius species have evolved to consume solids such as pollen. Some other moths, mostly noctuids, have modified proboscises to suit their mode of nutrition – lachrymophagy (feeding on tears of sleeping birds). The proboscises often have sharp apices as well as a host of barbs and spurs on the stem.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study in}} Bundjalung National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales found that B.aemula inflorescences are foraged {{by a variety}} of small mammals, including marsupials such as yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), and rodents such as pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi), Australian swamp rat (R. lutreolus) and grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) and even the house mouse (Mus musculus). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of <b>nectarivorous</b> birds, making them effective pollinators. Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) were also observed visiting B.aemula and their heads and bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.aemula include rainbow lorikeet and scarlet and Lewin's honeyeaters. Several other honeyeaters were recorded on B.aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the New Holland, brown, white-cheeked, and tawny-crowned honeyeaters, noisy miner, little wattlebird and noisy friarbird. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.aemula pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and yellow-faced honeyeaters and silvereyes. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced honeybee) have also been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Megabats mostly roost {{in trees}} and shrubs. Only those that possess {{echolocation}} {{venture into the}} dark recesses of caves. Because they eat fruit, some megabat species are unpopular with orchard owners. Megabats are frugivorous or <b>nectarivorous,</b> i.e., they eat fruits or lick nectar from flowers. Often, the fruits are crushed and only the juices are consumed. The teeth are adapted to bite through hard fruit rinds.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{producers}} of nectar, banksias are {{a vital part}} of the food chain in the Australian bush. They are an important food source for all sorts of <b>nectarivorous</b> animals, including birds, bats, rats, possums, stingless bees and a host of invertebrates. Furthermore, they are of economic importance to Australia's nursery and cut flower industries. However these plants are threatened by a number of processes including land clearing, frequent burning and disease, and a number of species are rare and endangered.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{tarantula}} hawks are <b>nectarivorous.</b> The {{consumption of}} fermented fruit sometimes intoxicates {{them to the}} point that flight becomes difficult. While the wasps tend to be most active in daytime summer months, they tend to avoid high temperatures. The male tarantula hawk does not hunt; instead, it feeds off the flowers of milkweeds, western soapberry trees, or mesquite trees (females feed on these same plants, as well). Male tarantula hawks have been observed practicing a behavior called hill-topping, in which they sit atop tall plants and watch for passing females ready to reproduce. Females are not very aggressive, in that they are hesitant to sting, but the sting is extraordinarily painful.|$|E
25|$|Large fruit-eating {{birds in}} {{tropical}} forests depend on trees which bear fruit {{at different times}} of the year. Many species, such as pigeons and hornbills, {{have been shown to be}} able to decide upon foraging areas according to the time of the year. Birds that show food hoarding behavior have also shown the ability to recollect the locations of food caches. <b>Nectarivorous</b> birds such as hummingbirds also optimize their foraging by keeping track of the locations of good and bad flowers. Studies of western scrub jays also suggest that birds may be able to plan ahead. They cache food according to future needs and risk of not being able to find the food on subsequent days.|$|E
500|$|Like other banksias, B.ericifolia plays host to a {{wide variety}} of pollinators and is a vital source of nectar in autumn, when other flowers are scarce. It has been the subject of a number of studies on pollination. A 1998 study in Bundjalung National Park in Northern New South Wales found that B.ericifolia inflorescences are foraged by a variety of small mammals, {{including}} marsupials such as Antechinus flavipes (yellow-footed antechinus), and rodents such as Rattus tunneyi (pale field rat) and Melomys burtoni (grassland mosaic-tailed rat). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of <b>nectarivorous</b> birds, making them effective pollinators. A 1978 study found Rattus fuscipes (bush rat) to bear large amounts of pollen from B.ericifolia and suggested the hooked styles may play a role in pollination by mammals. [...] Other visitors recorded include Apis mellifera (European honeybee).|$|E

50|$|The Indian {{flying fox}} is frugivorous or <b>nectarivorous,</b> i.e., they eat fruits or lick nectar from flowers. At dusk, these bats forage for ripe fruit. While ingesting fruit, these bats expel waste that pollinates and {{disperse}} seeds.|$|E
50|$|A pollen-presenter {{is an area}} {{on the tip of}} the pistil in {{flowers of}} plants of the family Proteaceae. In this family, the anthers are {{difficult}} to access for potential pollination vectors such as bees, birds and <b>nectarivorous</b> mammals.|$|E
50|$|Mohoidae is {{a family}} of Hawaiian species of {{recently}} extinct, <b>nectarivorous</b> songbirds in the genera Moho (ōō) and Chaetoptila (kioea). These now extinct birds form their own family, representing the only complete extinction of an entire avian family in modern times, when the disputed family Turnagridae is disregarded for being invalid.|$|E
50|$|Species of <b>nectarivorous</b> {{birds that}} have been {{observed}} feeding on B. nivea include Acanthorhynchus superciliosus (Western Spinebill). Black Cockatoos have also been recorded feeding upon the seed, {{though it is not}} clear which species of black cockatoo was observed, Calyptorhynchus baudinii (Baudin's Black Cockatoo) or C. latirostris (Carnaby's Black Cockatoo).|$|E
50|$|Apapane {{generally}} feed on nectar from flowers, preferably {{from the}} ōhia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) tree. These birds are mainly found in koa (Acacia koa) and ōhia lehua forests where the flower count is high. Although primarily <b>nectarivorous,</b> the diet of a grown apapane {{also includes a}} variety of insects like grasshoppers, caterpillars and bugs of all sorts.|$|E
50|$|Species of <b>nectarivorous</b> {{birds that}} have been {{observed}} feeding on B. grandis include Anthochaera carunculata (Red Wattlebird). Purpureicephalus spurius (Red-capped Parrot) has also been recorded feeding upon the seed, as have Black Cockatoos, {{though it is not}} clear which species of black cockatoo was observed, Calyptorhynchus baudinii (Baudin's Black Cockatoo) or C. latirostris (Carnaby's Black Cockatoo).|$|E
50|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, the Japanese white-eye competes with other native {{passerine}} bird species, {{including those of}} the same genus, such as the Bonin white-eye (Apalopteron familiare). In Hawaii, the Japanese white-eye competes with native passerines such as the common 'amakihi, for food (such as nectar and fruit), as well as for space. In Hawaii, the Japanese white-eye has been observed visiting endemic (native) floral species thought to have coevolved with endemic <b>nectarivorous</b> avian species (those that eat nectar). This means that, over time, changes in native flowers have triggered changes in native birds that feed on the nectar of these flowers; the latter change then triggers another change in the flowers, and the whole process continues to repeat itself. The visitation of the white-eye, along with the disappearance of those endemic <b>nectarivorous</b> passerine bird species, suggests that the white-eye is out-competing those endemic species for the floral resource (nectar).|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} bat feed on nectar, their {{lifestyle}} {{similar to that}} of <b>nectarivorous</b> birds. There is significant overlap between flowers pollinated by bats and hummingbirds - both need similarly-composed nectar to keep up energy-intensive hovering flight. In the Americas there is particularly close association between some species of columnar cacti and bat species, who provide pollination services in exchange for nectar with composition matching their nutritional needs. <b>Nectarivorous</b> bats are at particular risk of extinction due to their reliance on particular species of flowering plants.A single marsupial species, the honey possum, feeds on nectar and pollen exclusively. It raises fewer young which grow more slowly than other marsupials of its size, because of the time-consuming effort of nectar-drinking from many flowers to support itself, which limits its available energy. It may spend periods in deep sleep to reduce wasted energy and shows the typical nectarivore adaptations for excess water-removal.|$|E
50|$|Megabats mostly roost {{in trees}} and shrubs. Only those that possess {{echolocation}} {{venture into the}} dark recesses of caves. Because they eat fruit, some megabat species are unpopular with orchard owners. Megabats are frugivorous or <b>nectarivorous,</b> i.e., they eat fruits or lick nectar from flowers. Often, the fruits are crushed and only the juices are consumed. The teeth are adapted to bite through hard fruit skins.|$|E
50|$|Its {{eventual}} extinction in wild {{state of}} the species seems for a large part due to coextinction with native <b>nectarivorous</b> birds. K. cookei seems to be adapted to bird pollination like most related Malvaceae. The birds, Drepanidinae, were extirpated from dryland forest by Polynesians, and most remaining species entirely succumbed to mosquito-borne diseases like avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) and fowlpox in the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|The five known (as at October 2015) adult {{specimens}} {{of this species}} were collected from the flowers of Micromyrtus sessilis (near Euabalong West, NSW) and an unidentified species in Leptospermum (Goobang Range, NSW). As is typical for species in Castiarina, the adults of this species are doubtless <b>nectarivorous,</b> feeding on the nectar of the adult host plants when in peak bloom. They may also feed on the petals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flowers are}} fed at by {{a range of}} <b>nectarivorous</b> birds, mainly {{sunbirds}} and sugarbirds, including the orange-breasted sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea), southern double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris chalybeus), malachite sunbird (Nectarinia famosa), and the Cape sugarbird (Promerops cafer). In order to reach the nectar, the bird must push its bill into the inflorescence. As it does so, its bill and face gets brushed with pollen, thereby allowing for possible pollination.|$|E
50|$|Nectarivores, like gleaners, will {{frequently}} employ hovering during foraging. Hovering nectarivores {{are more}} likely to have rounded wingtips, which aids in maneuverability. Nectarivores that land on the flower before feeding have worse maneuverability. Nectarivores in general have lower aspect ratios, which makes them more suited to flight in a cluttered environment. Nectarivores that migrate to seasonal food resources, such as the genus Leptonycteris, have lower wing-loading than <b>nectarivorous</b> species with small home ranges.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} methods for {{excluding}} pollinators. A cage may exclude <b>nectarivorous</b> {{birds and mammals}} but allow access by insects. A net may exclude all but the smallest animals, yet permit wind-pollination. Insect repellent may prevent visits by insects whilst allowing access by birds and mammals. Bags {{may be used to}} prevent all but autogamous pollination. Bagging flowers only during the day or night makes it possible to exclude diurnal or nocturnal visitors respectively.|$|E
