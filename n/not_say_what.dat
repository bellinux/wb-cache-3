5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs were}} {{prepared}} in-house at the Philadelphia Mint by Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber, {{who designed the}} obverse and his assistant, George T. Morgan, who prepared the reverse. They did not seek outside artists to submit proposals. Numismatic author Q. David Bowers suggested that this was because Secretary McAdoo had sought non-employees to propose designs for the five Panama-Pacific coins along with those sketches prepared by Barber and his assistants, and the Mint's engravers had prepared {{only two of the}} five, and that because the artist assigned one, Evelyn Longman, had fallen ill. When the McKinley designs were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts on March 31, 1916, it recommended changes, though Don Taxay, who so stated, does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> they were. In any event, no alteration was made, and the designs were approved.|$|E

25|$|To {{keep the}} chapel, Davenne calls a young woman, Cécilia, {{secretary}} of the auction house that has regained a ring {{that had belonged to}} Julie. The friendship between the two seems to evolve when Paul Massigny, a French politician and Davenne's former best friend dies. The film suggests that Massigny once betrayed Davenne but does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> constituted the betrayal. When Davenne first visits Cécilia at home Davenne discovers that the living room is full of pictures of Massigny and, without asking for explanations, leaves.|$|E
25|$|On 16 June, LulzSec {{posted a}} random {{assortment}} of 62,000 emails and passwords to MediaFire. LulzSec stated they released this {{in return for}} supporters flooding the 4chan /b/ board. The group did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> websites the combinations were for and encouraged followers to plug them into various sites until they gained access to an account. Some reported gaining access to Facebook accounts and changing images to sexual content and others to using the Amazon.com accounts of others to purchase several books. Writerspace.com, a literary website, later admitted that the addresses and passwords came from users of their site.|$|E
25|$|The Code {{recognized}} the importance of intent. A man who killed another in a quarrel must swear he did not do so intentionally and was then only fined according to the rank of the deceased. The Code does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> would be the penalty of murder, but death is so often awarded where death is caused, that we can hardly doubt that the murderer was put to death. If the assault only led to injury and was unintentional, the assailant in a quarrel had to pay the doctor's fees. A brander, induced to remove a slave's identification mark, could swear to his ignorance and was free. The owner of an ox that gored a man on the street was only responsible for damages if the ox was known by him to be vicious—even if it caused death. If the mancipium died a natural death under the creditor's hand, the creditor was free. In ordinary cases, a person was not responsible for accident or if they exercised more than proper care. Poverty excused bigamy {{on the part of a}} deserted wife.|$|E

500|$|The falsification {{principle}} {{has been}} developed as an alternative theory by which {{it may be possible}} to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is unfalsifiable because there is no way that it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, analytic philosopher Antony Flew argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement [...] "God loves us" [...] both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.|$|E
500|$|Eden did {{suggest a}} counter-proposal on 1 July, {{but it was}} reduced, Bauer writes, to a ridiculous minimum. He told the American {{government}} that the British would allow Brand to return to Budapest with a message for Eichmann suggesting that 1,500 Jewish children be given safe passage to Switzerland, 5,000 from Bulgaria and Romania be allowed to leave for Palestine, and that Germany guarantee safe conduct for ships carrying Jewish refugees. He did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> he would offer in return. On 11 July Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{put an end to}} the idea when he told Eden that the murder of the Jews was [...] "probably the greatest and most horrible crime ever committed," [...] and that there should be [...] "no negotiations of any kind on this subject". Of Brand's mission he wrote: [...] "The project which has been put forward through a very doubtful channel seems itself also to be of the most nondescript character. I would not take it seriously." ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the tape}} (which {{may have been}} {{recorded}} a month earlier), bin Laden boasted that [...] "our situation is getting better, while your situation is getting worse." [...] It also threatened future attacks on the United States, and simultaneously offered a [...] "long truce", while <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>what</b> the truce would involve. The White House immediately rejected the truce offer.|$|R

2500|$|The {{invention}} of crème Chantilly is often credited incorrectly, and without evidence, to François Vatel, maître d'hôtel at the Château de Chantilly in the mid-17th century. But the name Chantilly is first connected {{with whipped cream}} in the mid-18th century, around {{the time that the}} Baronne d'Oberkirch praised the [...] "cream" [...] served at a lunch at the Hameau de Chantillybut did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> exactly it was, or call it Chantilly cream.|$|E
2500|$|The 'calm' lasted nine months. Then, on 21 April 1982, after a {{landmine}} {{killed an}} Israeli officer {{while he was}} visiting a South Lebanese Army gun emplacement in Taibe, Lebanon, the Israeli Air Force attacked the Palestinian-controlled coastal town of Damour, killing 23 people. Fisk reports further on this incident: [...] "The Israelis did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> the soldier was doing ... I discovered that he was visiting one of Haddad's artillery positions (Christian militia) and that the mine could have been lain [...] {{as long ago as}} 1978, perhaps even by the Israelis themselves".|$|E
2500|$|The PAC took {{in about}} $113,700 between February 2005, when it registered, and June 2006. [...] Of that, more than $42,000 {{was used to}} pay the salary and {{expenses}} of Willis-Leon. (Willis-Leon has disputed the amount of her compensation — which was calculated from government records by the Center for Responsive Politics, a political watchdog group — but would <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> the correct amount was).

2500|$|Murray {{said through}} his {{attorney}} {{that he did}} not prescribe or administer pethidine or oxycodone to Jackson, but did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what,</b> if anything, he did prescribe or administer. Los Angeles police said the doctor spoke to officers immediately after Jackson's death, and during an extensive interview two days later. They stressed that they found [...] "no red flag" [...] and did not suspect foul play. On June 26, police towed away a car used by Murray, stating that it might contain medication or other evidence. The police released the car five days later.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1972 election, McGovern ran on a {{platform}} that advocated withdrawal from the Vietnam War {{in exchange for the}} return of American prisoners of war and amnesty for draft evaders who had left the country, an anti-war platform that was anticipated by McGovern's sponsorship of the 1970 McGovern-Hatfield amendment that sought to end U.S. participation in the war by Congressional action. However, during a meeting with Democratic Governors conference, Nevada Governor Mike O'Callaghan asked McGovern what he would do if the North Vietnamese refused to release American POW's after a withdrawal. McGovern responded, [...] "Under such circumstances, we'd have to take action," [...] although he did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> action.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012 a Parisian {{auction house}} {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text. In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an [...] "ambassador of the human spirit". The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: [...] "I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling'," [...] he says. Saint-Exupéry's text does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> the word is, but experts believe it could be [...] "guerre" [...] (or [...] "war"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as {{a key factor in}} military confrontations between nations.|$|E

2500|$|In a January 5, 1995, {{interview}} with Kathleen Gingrich, mother of Republican politician Newt Gingrich, on Eye to Eye, Mrs. Gingrich {{said she could}} <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> her son thought about First Lady Hillary Clinton on the air. Chung asked Mrs. Gingrich to [...] "just whisper it to me, just between you and me," [...] and Mrs. Gingrich replied that her son thought of Clinton as a [...] "bitch". Many people interpreted Chung's suggestion that if Mrs. Gingrich would whisper this statement it would be promised that the statement would be off the record. Bill Carter for The New York Times reported, [...] "Ms. Chung had become the object {{of some of the}} most ferocious criticism, justified or not, ever directed at any network anchor as a result of her now infamous {{interview with}} Speaker Newt Gingrich's mother, Kathleen." [...] The interview was also parodied on Saturday Night Live.|$|E
2500|$|She then {{wrote to}} her mother, Queen Victoria: ...I have heard {{different}} things about poor Rudolf which may perhaps interest you. Prince Bismarck {{told me that the}} violent scenes and altercations between the Emperor and Rudolf had been the cause of Rudolf's suicide. I replied that I had heard this much doubted, upon which he said Reuss had written it and it was so! He would send me the despatch to read if I liked, but I have declined. I did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>what</b> I thought, which is that for thirty years I have had the experience of how many lies Prince Bismarck's diplomatic agents (with some exceptions) have written him, and therefore I usually disbelieve what they write completely, unless I know them to be honest and trustworthy men. Szechenyi, the Ambassador at Berlin, whom we know very well, tells me that there had been no scenes with the Emperor, who said to Szechenyi: Dies ist der erste Kummer, den mein Sohn mir macht.|$|E

[...] One fan had recalled reading a handful of letters in soap opera publications after Luke and Noah's first kiss {{along the lines of}} [...] "I don't care if Luke is gay, but I don't want to see it." [...] Bloom stated that there was a [...] "minimal" [...] negative reaction from viewers about the storyline. Despite this, she could not clarify what [...] "minimal" [...] meant in this case. There had been no organized campaign by conservative or parent advocacy groups that monitor television content.
