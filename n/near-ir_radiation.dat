5000|$|Efficiency of UCNPs doped {{with only}} {{activators}} is usually low, {{due to their}} low absorption cross section and necessary low concentration. Sensitizer ions are doped into the host lattice along with the activator ions in UCNPs to facilitate Electron Transfer Upconversion. The most commonly used sensitizer ion is trivalent Yb3+. This ion provides a much larger absorption cross-section for incoming <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation,</b> while only displaying a single excited 4f state. And since the energy gap between the ground level and this excited state matches well with the [...] "ladder" [...] gaps in the common activator ions, resonant energy transfers between the two dopant types. [...] Typical UCNPs are doped with approximately 20 mol% sensitizer ions and less than 2 mol% activator ions. These concentrations allow adequate distance between activators, avoiding cross-relaxation, and still absorb enough excitation radiation through the sensitizers to be efficient.  Currently, other types of sensitizers are being developed to increase the spectral range available for upconversion, such as semi-conductor nanocrystal-organic ligand hybrids.|$|E

40|$|I {{present a}} review of both {{experimental}} and theoretical studies performed during the recent three years, which deal with the physical properties and possible applications of graphene placed on ferroelectric (organic or Pb(ZrxTi 1 -x) O 3 (PZT) ceramic) substrates. The system 'graphene-on-ferroelectric substrate' has unique advantages {{in comparison with the}} graphene deposited on SiO 2 or on dielectrics with high dielectric permittivity. In particular, one can obtain high (~ 1012 cm- 2) carrier concentrations in the doped graphene-on-ferroelectric structures for moderate (of the order of 1 V) gate voltages. The existence of a hysteresis (or anti-hysteresis) in the dependence of electrical resistance of graphene channel on the gate voltage facilitates creating bistable systems for different applications. The use of ferroelectric substrates has already enabled developing of robust elements of non-volatile memory of a new generation. These elements operate for more than 105 switching cycles and store information for more than 103 s. Such systems can be characterised theoretically by ultrafast switching rates (~ 10 - 100 fs). A theoretical analysis has also demonstrated that the structures 'graphene-on-PZT ferroelectric substrate' would result in developing efficient and fast small-sized modulators of mid-IR and <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiations</b> for different optoelectronic applications.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the use of}} solar control and electrochromic glazing in trucks. The purpose has been to study the decrease in solar energy transport into the cab and how to utilize the technology. The solar spectrum consists of both visible light and <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation,</b> and solar control glazing transmits {{the majority of the}} visible light and reflects or absorbs most of the <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation.</b> Electrochromic glazing has variable transmittance, which enables the driver to regulate the energy flow through the window. A decrease in energy transfer can reduce the use of air conditioning and give a lower peak temperature in the cab. This could generate a better fuel economy and a possibility to reduce the cost of the polymer material in the instrument panel. Five different types of glass were tested in several experiments to determine the reduction in heat transfer. The experiments evaluate the performance of the glass in an environment with simulated solar radiation and forced convection, caused by the speed of the truck. The tests showed that during a sunny day with an irradiance of 1000 W/m 2 there is a possibility to lower the cab temperature by 5 °C and the inflow of energy by nearly 90 W/m 2. A survey was carried out to get a subjective assessment of the use of solar control and electrochromic glazing, and other potential technical applications. The general consensus was that the decrease of solar radiation would create a better working environment for the drivers...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the occurrence and properties of disks around young stars, emphasizing in particular how these {{may relate to}} planet formation {{and the evolution of}} the solar system.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of}} near-infrared radiation from hot dust for Compton cooling of electrons/positrons in quasar jets. In our model, {{we assume that the}} non-thermal radiation spectra observed in OVV quasars are produced by relativistic electrons/positrons accelerated in thin shells which propagate down the jet with relativistic speeds. We show that the Comptonization of the near-IR flux is likely to dominate the radiative output of OVV quasars in the energy range from tens of keV up to hundreds of MeV, where it exceeds that produced by Comptonization of the UV radiation reprocessed and rescattered in the Broad Emission Line (BEL) region. The main reason for this {{lies in the fact that}} the jet encounters the ambient IR radiation over a relatively large distance as compared to the distance where the energy density of the broad emission line light peaks. In the soft- to mid energy X–ray band, the spectral component resulting from Comptonization of the <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> joins smoothly with the synchrotron-self-Compton component, which may be responsible for the soft X–ray flux.

As life evolved, continental surfaces changed gradually and non- uniformly from deserts through microbial mats to land plants, modifying the reflective properties of the ground and most probably the distribution of moisture and cloudiness. Here, we used a radiative transfer model of the Earth, together with geological paleo-records of the continental distribution and a reconstructed cloud distribution, to simulate the visible and <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> reflected by our planet as a function of Earth's rotation.

A new Fourier Transform Spectrometer called CLARS-FTS has been deployed since May 2010 at JPL's California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (CLARS) on Mt.

40|$|Many radicals, due {{to their}} {{electronic}} structure, have low-lying electronic states transitions to which lie in the near-IR. They often carry {{more information about the}} molecules than the transitions in the UV. However, these transitions even in the most important atmospheric radicals have not been thoroughly investigated {{due to their}} weakness and low attainable concentrations of radicals. This thesis describes the application of cavity ringdown spectroscopy to detection of near-IR states of some atmospherically important radicals. The near-IR cavity ringdown spectrometer constructed for these experiments is described in detail and characterized. The pulsed <b>near-IR</b> laser <b>radiation</b> was generated by sequential Raman shifting of the output of a tunable dye laser in hydrogen. The constructed multi-pass Raman cell extended the tunable range of the available dye laser continuously from the visible to 6000 cm- 1 with 0. 15 cm- 1 resolution. The sensitivity of the instrument is ~ 0. 5 % of the mirror loss. The near-IR A<-X transition in peroxy radicals offers detection specificity for at least small radicals. The sensitivity of this transition to hydrogen atom substitution has been explored. The spectra of chloro-ethyl, -propyl, -butyl and -butenyl peroxy radicals in the 7000 - 8600 cm- 1 region are reported. The origin bands of the electronic transition were found to be shifted by 200 cm- 1 to the red. The spectra have more complex structure than those of unsubstituted homologues. DFT calculations predicted multiple conformers for C 2 H 4 ClO 2 and C 3 H 6 ClO 2 with the energies within 2 kcal/mol. Tentative assignment of the C 2 H 4 ClO 2 spectrum is presented. The integrated cross-section for the transition in chloro-ethyl peroxy radical is estimated from the known rate of self-reaction.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{details the}} design, construction and characterization of a sensitive, fast ion beam spectrometer {{to record the}} absorption spectra of molecular ions. It is the first work to use the noise immune cavity-enhanced optical heterodyne molecular spectroscopy (NICE-OHMS) technique {{in conjunction with a}} fast ion beam. Additionally, it is the first work outlining direct electronic spectroscopy in an ion beam. Direct spectroscopy of a fast molecular ion beam offers many advantages over competing techniques, including the generality of the approach to any molecular ion, the complete elimination of spectral confusion due to neutral molecules, and the mass-identification of individual spectral lines. Fast ion beam spectroscopy allows for sub-Doppler absorption spectra to be recorded. While some techniques, such as velocity modulation spectroscopy, provide semi-rigorous ion/neutral discrimination, the spectrometer employed in this dissertation provides a rigorous, spatial discrimination against background neutrals. The major challenge is the intrinsic weakness of absorption and dispersion signals resulting from the relatively low ion density in the beam. The primary goal of designing this instrument is to enable acquisition of cold, rotationally-resolved, gas-phase spectra of molecular ions in the 2 - 5 μm region. For this dissertation in particular, the goal was to build an instrument able to acquire the uncooled, rotationally-resolved, gas-phase spectrum of N 2 + in the near IR at 920 nm, using an ion beam. By characterizing this instrument in terms of linewidth and sensitivity, we are confident that we can {{move on to the next}} steps, of building a difference frequency generation laser, performing mid-IR spectroscopy, and implementing supersonic cooling. The spectra obtained in the mid-IR will be valuable for applied astronomical and fundamental spectroscopic research. Direct infrared spectroscopy of an ion beam was pioneered by the Saykally group in 1989 - 1990, but has not been attempted since that time. Our ion beam instrument uses a Ti:Sapphire laser to produce <b>near-IR</b> (NIR) <b>radiation</b> at 920 nm. NICE-OHMS is set up using two electrooptic modulators and a medium finesse cavity (F= 450) with a free spectral range of 113 MHz. The optical cavity increases the path length of absorption, and the heterodyne spectroscopy reduces the noise to near the shot noise limit. The laser is calibrated to sub-MHz accuracy using an optical frequency comb. A fast ion beam instrument was constructed, using the most recent advances in ion beam technology, including cylindrical benders and a beam-modulated time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The cylindrical benders help to maximize the ion density in the interaction region, and the mass spectrometer offers improved resolution and online mass analysis. The ion beam is made collinear with the laser beam inside of the NICE-OHMS cavity. The NIR NICE-OHMS setup has a noise equivalent absorption of 2 x 10 ^− 11 cm^− 1 Hz^− 1 / 2, which is 50 times more sensitive than the previous instrument. Several transitions of the 1 – 0 band of the A ^ 2 Pi_u – X ^ 2 Sigma^+_g Meinel system of N_ 2 ^+ with linewidths of ~ 120 MHz have been measured. An optical frequency comb is used to calibrate the absolute value of the transition frequencies to within 8 MHz of the values obtained for a sub-Doppler calibrated positive column discharge.

40|$|Broad-band {{spectra of}} the FSRQ (flat-spectrum-radio quasars) {{detected}} in the high energy gamma-ray band imply {{that there may be}} two types of such objects: those with steep gamma-ray spectra, hereafter called MeV-blazars, and those with flat gamma-ray spectra, GeV-blazars. We demonstrate that this difference can be explained {{in the context of the}} ERC (external-radiation-Compton) model using the same electron injection function. A satisfactory unification is reachable, provided that: (a) spectra of GeV-blazars are produced by internal shocks formed at the distances where cooling of relativistic electrons in a jet is dominated by Comptonization of broad emission lines, whereas spectra of MeV-blazars are produced at the distances where cooling of relativistic electrons is dominated by Comptonization of <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> from hot dust; (b) electrons are accelerated via a two step process and their injection function takes the form of a double power-law, with the break corresponding to the threshold energy for the diffusive shock acceleration. Direct predictions of our model are that, on average, variability time scales of the MeV-blazars should be longer than variability time scales of the GeV-blazars, and that both types of the blazar phenomenon can appear in the same object.

40|$|The recent European {{recommendation}} on {{the efficacy}} of sunscreen products requests now a minimum ratio of UVA/UVB protection. However, the visible and the infrared (IR) parts of the sun spectrum have received little attention concerning their possible contribution to skin damage. A common biophysical answer for the different wavelengths of the sun spectrum {{can be found in}} the creation of excess free radicals - mainly reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thanks to electron spin resonance spectroscopy applied to skin biopsies, we determined for the first time the free radical action spectrum covering UV and visible light (280 - 700 nm). Convolution of the action spectrum with sunlight spectral irradiance showed that 50 % of the total skin oxidative burden was generated by visible light. Creation of ROS by visible light was experimentally confirmed by varying the illuminance of a spotlight. We also evidenced the creation of excess free radicals by <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation.</b> In that case, free radical generation does not depend exclusively on the dose, but also on the skin temperature increase initiated by near-IR light. Some phenomena which are still unclear, such as the question about the deleterious or beneficial role of sunlight, are reviewed, implying the research on new protection strategies for the prevention of skin cancer.

40|$|The {{development}} of high average and peak power ultrashort pulsed fiber lasers {{is important for}} many critical research, industrial, and defense applications. However, the performance of mode-locked fiber oscillators still lags behind that of solid-state counterparts such as Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:sapphire lasers. Despite the drawbacks in cost, size and required maintenance, Ti:sapphire remains the workhorse of ultrafast science. One of the remaining challenges for fiber lasers to overcome is their limited set of accessible wavelengths. Unfortunately, readily available ytterbium, erbium and thulium fiber lasers can produce coherent radiation only near 1, 1. 55 and 2 μm, respectively. There remain {{a significant number of}} wavelength regions that fiber lasers cannot address. In this thesis, novel fiber lasers producing ultrashort pulses at wavelengths not currently accessible with established active rare-earth-doped fibers are investigated. Our main approach is to use various nonlinear optical effects to generate new laser wavelengths. First, a watt-level synchronously pumped Raman fiber oscillator generating tens of nanojoules femtosecond pulses is demonstrated. Stimulated Raman scattering in a passive fiber within an oscillator cavity allows formation of Raman pulses that are spectrally redshifted with respect to the pump pulses. World-record output pulse energy and conversion efficiency have been achieved with our femtosecond Raman fiber laser design. We have also demonstrated a high power, widely tunable all-fiber optical parametric oscillator (FOPO) based on four-wave mixing in a passive fiber. The FOPO is synchronously pumped with an Yb³⁺-doped mode-locked fiber laser working at ~ 1040 nm. The FOPO produces ultrashort pulses tunable from 760 to 1560 nm. Record pulse energy is generated at the output of the femtosecond FOPO. Depending on the configuration of the FOPO, the duration of produced pulses varies between 170 fs and 3 ps. This new laser source has similar performance to standard Ti:sa femtosecond lasers so it can potentially replace the latter in many applications. Ultrashort optical pulses in the mid-IR and long-IR range (2 - 20 μm) have many important applications in gas sensing, counter-measures, etc. The realization of the ultrashort pulses in the mid-IR and long-IR wavelengths requires the use of free-space nonlinear crystals. An efficient mid-IR source based on difference frequency generation (DFG) in an AgGaS₂ crystal using femtosecond erbium/thulium pump fiber laser has been proposed and demonstrated. The photon conversion efficiency of the pump wave (1. 55 μm) to idler wave (9. 2 μm) has been measured to be 16 %, which is today a record for conversion of <b>near-IR</b> light <b>radiation</b> from fiber lasers to 9 μm spectral range. Potentially the photon conversion efficiency can be increased up to 60 % by using pump pulses having higher peak power. Finally, generation of supercontinuum (SC) light in the mid-IR spectral range is also demonstrated. It is well known that SC produced in standard optical fibers is limited to ~ 6 μm by material absorption. The liquid core optical fiber platform has been proposed to address this matter. Several highly nonlinear liquids have minimal absorption in the mid-IR wavelength range, which potentially allows us to create broadband SC light in this spectral region. SC generation up to 2. 4 μm in an integrated hollow core optical fiber filled with CS₂ has been demonstrated. Further {{development of}} the liquid core optical fiber platform should allow generation of the SC covering wavelengths beyond 6 μm...|$|R
40|$|Methanol {{intoxication}} produces toxic {{injury to}} the retina and optic nerve, resulting in blindness. The toxic metabolite in methanol intoxication is formic acid, a mitochondrial toxin known to inhibit the essential mitochondrial enzyme, cytochrome oxidase. Photobiomodulation by red to <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> has been demonstrated to enhance mitochondrial activity and promote cell survival in vitro by stimulation of cytochrome oxidase activity. The present studies were undertaken {{to test the hypothesis}} that exposure to monochromatic red radiation from light-emitting diode (LED) arrays would protect the retina against the toxic actions of methanol-derived formic acid in a rodent model of methanol toxicity. Using the electroretinogram as a sensitive indicator of retinal function, we demonstrated that three brief (2 min, 24 s) 670 -nm LED treatments (4 J/cm 2), delivered at 5, 25, and 50 h of methanol intoxication, attenuated the retinotoxic effects of methanol-derived formate. Our studies document a significant recovery of rod- and cone-mediated function in LED-treated, methanol-intoxicated rats. We further show that LED treatment protected the retina from the histopathologic changes induced by methanol-derived formate. These findings provide a link between the actions of monochromatic red to near-IR light on mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in vitro and retinoprotection in vivo. They also suggest that photobiomodulation may enhance recovery from retinal injury and other ocular diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction is postulated to play a role...|$|E
40|$|The here {{presented}} {{monitoring method}} {{is based on}} the UV-Iight detection being emitted by the welding plasma plume and the measurement of the <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> of the glowing spatters which are thrown out of the welding pool. The results of the above mentioned spatter detection are used to approximate the size of the occurred holes in the weld. A third sensor is used for monitoring the workpiece temperature. This additional signal is very important when welding thin metal sheets (e. g. overlap welds). Further the implementation of the presented monitoring method in an industrial instrument is described (LWM 900; see Figs 3 if.). This instrument is a self-learning real-time monitoring system which needs several teach welds for creating a position-true process reference. In the following automatic mode it compares the most important features of the actual weld with those of the learned reference. Using fuzzy-logic routines the probability is determined that a metallographically important welding failure has happened. The LWM 900 has been developed initially for monitoring the C 02 - welding process. The Nd-YAG laser welding process differs slightly from it. This fact has to be considered accor-dingly for a proper signal detection. Additionally, {{due to the fact that}} most of the used de-tectors are sensitive to the wavelength of the Nd-YAG laser, some measures have to be considered to reject unwanted influences in this connection. 1...|$|E
40|$|We present near-IR imaging {{polarimetry}} {{observations of}} the nucleus of Cygnus A, taken with the NICMOS camera of the HST at a wavelength of 2. 0 microns. These maps reveal a highly collimated region of polarized emission straddling the nucleus and extending to a radius of 1. 2 arcseconds. Remarkably, this feature coincides with one, but only one, limb of the edge-brightened bicone structure seen in the total intensity image. The high degree (P_k ~ 25 %) and orientation of the extended polarization feature are consistent with a scattering origin. Most plausibly, the detection of polarization along only one limb of the bicone {{is a consequence of}} intrinsic anisotropy of the near-IR continuum within the radiation cones, with the direction of maximum intensity of the <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> field significantly displaced {{from the direction of the}} radio axis. The unresolved nuclear core source is also highly polarized (P_k > 28 %), with a position angle close to the perpendicular to the radio axis. Given that this high degree of nuclear polarization can only be explained in terms of dichroic extinction if the dichroic mechanism is unusually efficient in Cygnus A, it is more likely that the nuclear polarization is due to the scattering of nuclear light in an unresolved scattering region close to the AGN. In this case, the flux of the core source in the K-band is dominated by scattered rather than transmitted quasar light, and previous extinction estimates based on K-band photometry of the core substantially underestimate the true nuclear extinction.

40|$|We {{report on}} Gemini/GNIRS {{observations}} of the binary T Tauri system V 582 Mon (KH 15 D) at three orbital phases. These spectra allow us to untangle five components of the system: the photosphere and magnetosphere of star B, the jet, scattering properties of the ring material, and excess <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> previously attributed to a possible self-luminous planet. We confirm an early-K subgiant classification for star B and show that the magnetospheric He I emission line is variable, possibly indicating increased mass accretion at certain times. As expected, the H_ 2 emission features associated with the inner part of the jet show no variation with orbital phase. We show that the reflectance spectrum for the scattered light has a distinctive blue slope and spectral features consistent with scattering and absorption by a mixture of water and methane ice grains in the 1 - 50 μm size range. This suggests that the methane frost line is closer than ∼ 5 AU in this system, requiring that the grains be shielded from direct radiation. After correcting for features from the scattered light, jet, magnetosphere, and photosphere, we confirm the presence of leftover near-IR light from an additional source, detectable near minimum brightness. A spectral emission feature matching the model spectrum of a 10 M_J, 1 Myr old planet {{is found in the}} excess flux, but other expected features from this model are not seen. Our observations, therefore, tentatively support the picture that a luminous planet is present within the system, although they cannot yet be considered definitive. Comment: Accepted by Ap...|$|E
40|$|Distant {{planets in}} {{globally}} ice-covered, "snowball", states {{may depend on}} increases in their host stars' luminosity to become hospitable for surface life. Using a General Circulation Model (GCM), we simulated the equilibrium climate response of a planet {{to a range of}} instellations from an F-, G-, or M- dwarf star. The range of instellation that permits both complete ice cover and at least partially ice-free climate states {{is a measure of the}} climate hysteresis that a planet can exhibit. An ice-covered planet with high climate hysteresis would show a higher resistance to the initial loss of surface ice coverage with increases in instellation, and abrupt, extreme ice loss once deglaciation begins. Our simulations indicate that the climate hysteresis depends sensitively on the host star spectral energy distribution. Under fixed CO 2 conditions, a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star exhibits a smaller climate hysteresis, requiring a smaller instellation to initiate deglaciation than planets orbiting hotter, brighter stars. This is due to the higher absorption of <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> by ice on the surfaces and greenhouse gases and clouds in the atmosphere of an M-dwarf planet. Increases in atmospheric CO 2 further lower the climate hysteresis, as M-dwarf snowball planets exhibit a larger radiative response than G-dwarf snowball planets for the same increase in CO 2. For a smaller hysteresis, planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone will thaw earlier in their evolutionary history, and will experience a less abrupt transition out of global ice cover.

40|$|The ongoing {{searches}} for exoplanetary systems have revealed {{a wealth of}} planets with diverse physical properties. Planets even smaller than the Earth have already been detected, and the efforts of future missions are placed on the discovery, and perhaps characterization, of small rocky exoplanets within the habitable zone of their stars. Clearly {{what we know about}} our planet will be our guideline for the characterization of such planets. But the Earth has been inhabited for at least 3. 8 Ga, and its appearance has changed with time. Here, we have studied the Earth during the Archean eon, 3. 0 Ga ago. At that time one of the more widespread life forms on the planet were purple bacteria. These bacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms and can inhabit both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Here, we used a radiative transfer model to simulate the visible and <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> reflected by our planet, taking into account several scenarios regarding the possible distribution of purple bacteria over continents and oceans. We find that purple bacteria have a reflectance spectrum which has a strong reflectivity increase, similar to the red edge of leafy plants, although shifted redwards. This feature produces a detectable signal in the disk-averaged spectra of our planet, depending on cloud amount and on purple bacteria concentration/distribution. We conclude that by using multi-color photometric observations, it is possible to distinguish between an Archean Earth in which purple bacteria inhabit vast extensions of the planet, and a present-day Earth with continents covered by deserts, vegetation or microbial mats.

40|$|Tremendous strides {{have been}} made in the {{understanding}} of interstellar material over the past twenty years thanks to significant, parallel developments in two closely related areas: observational IR astronomy and laboratory astrophysics. Twenty years ago the composition of interstellar dust was largely unknown and the notion of abundant, gas phase, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) anywhere in the interstellar medium (ISM) considered impossible. Today the dust composition of the diffuse and dense ISM is reasonably well constrained and the spectroscopic case for interstellar PAHs, impossibly large molecules by early interstellar chemistry standards, is very strong. PAH spectral features are now being used as new probes of the ISM. PAH ionization states reflect the ionization balance of the medium while PAH size and structure reflect the energetic and chemical history of the medium. Aromatic carbon-rich materials ranging in size from PAHs and PAH nanoclusters, to sub-micron and micron-sized dust grains represent an important component of the ISM. These species: (1) dominate the heating and cooling of interstellar clouds via energetic photoelectron ejection and infrared (IR) emission; (2) moderate the ionization balance in photodissociation regions and molecular clouds; (3) moderate the composition of the gas phase and play an important role in determining the chemistry of the ISM; (4) contribute to the interstellar extinction in the near IR, visible, and UV spectral regions; and (5) convert UV, visible, and <b>near-IR</b> <b>radiation</b> to mid- and far-IR radiation in the ISM and, as such, are responsible for the well known, widespread family of mid-IR emission features with major components near 3. 3, 6. 2, 7. 7, 8. 6, and 11. 3 microns...|$|E
