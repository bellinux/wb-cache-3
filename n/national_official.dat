The next year, he began printing Gazeta Teatrului <b>Naţional</b> (<b>official</b> voice of the National Theater, published until 1836), and translated Molière's Amphitryon into Romanian. In 1839, Heliade also translated Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote from a French source. The first collection of his own prose and poetry works saw print in 1836. Interested {{in the development of}} local art, he contributed a brochure on drawing and architecture in 1837, and, during the same year, opened the first permanent exhibit in Wallachia (featuring copies of Western paintings, portraits, and gypsum casts of various known sculptures).|$|E
25|$|In 1913 {{she became}} a <b>national</b> <b>official</b> of the Union, {{requiring}} her {{to move back to}} her home city of Berlin. During World War I Kähler supported left wing SPD politicians, that included Clara Zetkin and Rosa Luxemburg in rejecting the party's policy of Burgfrieden (a truce with the government, promising to refrain from any strikes during the war) and attended an international socialist women's anti-war conference in Berlin organised by Zetkin in 1915. After the War Germany and Berlin witnessed a period of politically driven civil conflict known as the German Revolution during which the imperial government was replaced by the Weimar Republic. As a notable feminist and union official Luise Kähler was instrumental in leading her Union through the turmoil caused by the civil unrest. The new republic in Germany needed to reform its archaic domestic servant laws particularly since thousands of domestic workers were giving up their employment as the economy of the Weimar Republic went into free fall. Many smaller unions survived only by merging into larger conglomerations.|$|E
500|$|Operation Epsom {{has been}} {{analysed}} by many military historians and commentators. S. A. Hart wrote in 2007, that post-war publication of memoirs by Allied generals {{had led to}} disputes along national lines during the 1950s and 1960s, with American historians generally critical of Montgomery and {{the actions of the}} Anglo-Canadian forces, while [...] "pro-Montgomery" [...] historians set out to refute these criticisms. Also published during this period were the <b>national</b> <b>official</b> campaign histories, which were thoroughly-researched but avoided detailed critical analysis of the controversies. During the 1980s, revisionist writers concentrated on the perceived deficiencies of the Allies and since the late 1990s, two schools of thought have been revising the revisionists, some expanding on revisionist work, by providing a more detailed campaign analysis and those who have tried to show that the techniques employed by the Anglo-Canadian forces were appropriate to conditions in Normandy.|$|E

500|$|Four days later, the DA {{submitted}} a complaint to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) about censorship {{by the public}} broadcaster after the SABC informed the DA it would not continue broadcasting a DA television advert titled [...] "ANC Ayisafani", meaning [...] "the ANC's not the same", and five DA radio adverts aired on 8 and 9 April 2014. According to the DA's Mmusi Maimane, who appears in the television advert, the SABC banned all DA adverts from 11 public radio stations {{as well as the}} television advert. ICASA announced that it would hold public hearings on the matter on Thursday the 17th, 6 days after the DA lodged their complaint. Following the DA's announcement that it would submit an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court requesting a ruling on the adverts before the long Easter weekend commencing Good Friday, the day after ICASA's proposed public hearing date, the ICASA hearings commenced 2 days earlier than originally scheduled. On the day after the hearing, the ban was lifted temporarily as the SABC had failed to provide reasons for the ban during the ICASA hearings and requested more time to prepare a response. The DA also objected to the SABC not allowing the <b>national</b> <b>official</b> opposition party to participate in a televised election debate on land reform on SABCin the first 2 weeks of April. On 25 April, ICASA upheld the SABC's ban on the television advert finding that it contravened ICASA's regulations on party election broadcasts. ICASA ordered that a photograph taken by The Citizen photographer Alaister Russell of a police officer firing rubber bullets at unarmed residents during the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest be removed from the advert as [...] "the police should not be seen {{as a threat to the}} community". In the advert, Maimane says [...] "We've seen a police force killing our own people" [...] while the photograph is shown on the screen. The South African Police Service had earlier {{submitted a}} complaint to ICASA that this footage would incite violence against police officers.On 15 April 2014, a protest campaign against corruption with the slogan [...] "Vukani! Sidikwe! (Wake up! We are Fed up!) Vote No", supported by over 100 ANC veterans, was launched by former government ministers Ronnie Kasrils and Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. The IEC has requested a legal opinion on whether the campaign contravenes the Electoral Act. The campaign urges ANC supporters to either spoil their votes or vote for a smaller party. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu welcomed the campaign, and human rights activist and cleric Barney Pityana describes it as [...] "a campaign to bring rationality, order, morality and decency back into our electoral system" [...] in a Mail & Guardian opinion piece.|$|E
