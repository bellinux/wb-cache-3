Based on a review of literature on <b>networked</b> <b>organisations,</b> a theoretical framework is developed and applied to three case studies. The results indicate that <b>networked</b> <b>organisations</b> in health care services are mainly driven by socio-economic and organisational conditions, in which information and communication technology plays an increasingly important facilitative role. Furthermore, the case findings indicate that <b>networked</b> <b>organisations</b> in health care develop through different phases: from pilot practices to institutionalisation.

40|$|International audienceThe paper {{proposes a}} context-driven {{approach}} to {{decision making in}} flexible <b>networked</b> <b>organisations</b> {{for the purpose of}} selecting partners for a specific task. The main idea of the approach is to represent the members of the <b>networked</b> <b>organisation</b> by services they provide. This makes it possible to replace the configuration of the <b>networked</b> <b>organisation</b> with that of services constituting it. Such representation benefits from the principles of the service-oriented architectures, such as service autonomy, abstraction, standardisation, and reusability. For the interoperability purposes the services communicate in terms of a common ontology. To improve the flexibility of the operational decision support each particular situation is described by a narrow context that contains only information that is relevant to the situation...|$|R

No matter why the groupware was initially deployed it is in general very difficult to monitor and evaluate how it is actually used and integrated with the work practice.
