For this purpose, a <b>nylon</b> <b>salt</b> of 1, 5 -diamino- 2 -methylpentane (Dytek A) and isophthalic acid (IPA) was used and reactions were carried out via both solid-state polymerization (SSP) of the <b>nylon</b> <b>salt</b> with PA 6 and melt copolymerization (MP) of the <b>nylon</b> <b>salt</b> with e-caprolactam for comparison. For the SSP the <b>nylon</b> <b>salt</b> was pre-mixed with the amorphous phase of PA 6 by a solution mixing process, followed by evaporation of the solvent, after which transamidation reactions were forced below the Tm of PA 6.

40|$|Loss of diamine and {{distinct}} transition phenomena from the solid to the melt state restrain solid-state polymerization (SSP) of <b>nylon</b> <b>salts</b> from industrial application. To depress these phenomena temperatures {{well below the}} melting point of the starting material are employed, resulting however in low reaction rates. The need to use catalysts arises and accordingly in this study hexamethylenediammonium adipate (HMA) particles were polymerized containing a strictly controlled amount of uniformly distributed catalyst. The catalysts included boric, sulphuric, and phosphoric acids with boric acid being the most effective in accelerating the reaction while eliminating the tendency to agglomeration. In general, catalyst concentration up to a critical value plays a considerable role in the overall behavior.

40|$|The {{solid-state}} polyamidation of nylon salts comprises {{an attractive}} research field. The low sublimation rate of dodecamethylenediamine ensures salt stability and accurate relationships between amine end-group analysis {{and extent of}} the reaction. This accuracy is further enhanced by studying the solid-state polyamidation of dodecamethylenediammonium adipate (DMA), a <b>nylon</b> <b>salt</b> with a low melting point. Reaction rate {{was found to be}} influenced drastically by temperature, but the temperature range to effect true solid-state reaction is actually limited. Even at temperatures significantly below the melting point of DMA, a transition of the process, from the solid to the melt state, was clearly observed. Kinetic data obtained were tested against well known solid-state and melt reaction models. Nevertheless, none of them can exclusively describe the polyamidation studied, possibly because the true reaction model should take into consideration the process leading to the solid-melt transition observed. © 1984...|$|E

40|$|Polycondensation {{reactions}} on nylon salts can {{be carried}} out in the melt or, alternatively, in the solid state. Nevertheless, in the latter case, a distinct transition to the melt state may take place, depending {{on the nature of the}} <b>nylon</b> <b>salt</b> and reaction temperature. For the particular case of the dodecamethylenediammonium adipate this phenomenon has been attributed to water accumulation within the reacting structure. In this paper, based on previously reported preliminary results, the generalization of this mechanism is attempted for other typical cases of nylon salts, namely tetra- and hexamethylenediammonium adipate, and hexa- and dodecamethylenediammonium sebacate. All these salts when polymerized in the solid state may pass through a melt or quasi-melt stage. The polymerization runs were monitored both by end groups and water determinations. The experimental data obtained support the proposed mechanism according to which the polycondensation water tends to be sorbed at the polar hydrophilic groups with next effect the disturbance of the reacting regular structure. Then the mobility of the system increases and more water can be diffused out, but the reaction temperature plays a predominant role in the overall reaction behaviour. © 1990...|$|E
40|$|Solid-state polyamidation (SSP) {{processes}} may proceed {{under three}} different modes: in the pure solid state (mode I), through melt intermediates (mode II) {{and in the}} pure solid state accompanied by water separation in a different phase (mode III). In previous studies, on typical aliphatic diamine-aliphatic diacid <b>nylon</b> <b>salts,</b> the role of polycondensation water formed has been investigated and a qualitative model has been proposed to explain the typical mode II observed. In this work, monomer structures more organized in terms of polar coordination and rigidity are considered to reveal different modes of SSP behaviour. Ethylenediammonium maleate, ethylenediammonium fumarate and hexamethylenediammonium fumarate were selected to exhibit either coexistence of modes II and III or predominance of mode III. Interpretation of the phenomena {{in terms of the}} role of polycondensation water is again attempted. © 1990...|$|R
40|$|Solid state polyamidation of <b>nylon</b> <b>salts</b> may be accompanied, {{depending}} on the reaction conditions, by a typical transition of the process from the solid to the melt state. For an explanation of this phenomenon, dodecamethylenediammonium adipate, a typical salt with such a transitional behaviour, has been chosen for further study. The possibility {{of the formation of}} an eutectic system monomer-polymer has been excluded {{and the role of the}} water of polycondensation has been taken into account. Water quantitative determinations proved that a significant amount of the water produced, during the course of the reaction, cannot be removed out of the reacting grains. Due to the deliquescent behaviour of the monomer, it is proposed that this water accumulation results in the formation of lower melting point areas. Overlapping of the latter explains the transition observed. © 1985...|$|R

Polycondensation of <b>nylon</b> <b>salts</b> with various contributions of DAPIS afforded a family of homo- and copolyamides, which were characterized using complementary spectroscopic techniques. The chemical structure of the materials was determined by FT-IR, 1 D and 2 D liquid-state NMR spectroscopy, whilst the supramolecular arrangement, conformational changes upon heating, and molecular mobility of the polymers were investigated by solid-state 13 C{ 1 H} Cross-Polarization/Magic-Angle Spinning (CP/MAS) NMR and 13 C{ 1 H} Insensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transfer (INEPT) experiments. The abundance of the different DAPIS conformers was determined by DFT-D computational methods. The thermal properties of the polyamides were tested for polymers with different amounts of isohexide units in the backbone by DSC and TGA, demonstrating that the increasing amounts of isohexide diamines efficiently decrease their melting points and slightly decrease their thermal stability.

40|$|Solid state {{polymerization}} {{reactions are}} of considerable scientific and industrial interest. In some cases <b>nylon</b> <b>salts</b> {{can be converted}} to polyamides through intermediates of lower melting point, involving a solid-melt-solid sequence which is incompatible with known solid state polyamidation processes. A new solid state polyamidation process is described for use with salts, prepolymers, or amino acids which provides good temperature control and the avoidance of agglomeration of particles. The process comprises: (a) suspension of the particles of raw material (salt, amino acid or prepolymer) in an inert solvent; (b) reaction at the boiling point of the solvent with continuous distillation and feeding of solvent; (c) reactions at higher temperatures by feeding with the correct solvent; (d) separation of the formed granules of polymer by centrifugation, and (e) washing and drying. This process was tested for the solid state polymerization of hexamethylenediammonium maleate, which polymerizes through intermediates of lower melting point, and the following factors were examined: (a) presence and amount of dispersing agents; (b) nature of inert solvent; (c) grain size of salt; (d) distillation rate; (e) the ratio of salt: inert solvent and (f) temperature and time. © 1976...|$|R
40|$|Novel, {{semicrystalline}} polyamides and copolyamides were synthesized {{from a new}} carbohydrate-based diamine, namely isoidide- 2, 5 -dimethyleneamine (IIDMA).

Depending on the chemical compositions, the number average molecular weights (Mn) of the polyamides were in the range of 4000 – 49000 g/mol. With increasing IIDMA content in the synthesized copolyamides, their corresponding glass transition temperatures (Tg) increased from 50 °C to approximately 60 – 67 °C while the melting temperatures (Tm) decreased from 220 to 160 °C. The chemical structures of the polyamides were analyzed by NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. Both differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) analyses revealed the semicrystalline character of these novel copolyamides. Variable-temperature (VT) 13 C 1 H cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (CP/MAS) NMR and FT-IR techniques were employed to study the crystal structures as well as the distribution of IIDMA moieties over the crystalline and amorphous phases of the copolyamides. The performed ab initio calculations reveal that the stability of the IIDMA moieties is due to a pronounced 2 ̆ 2 boat 2 ̆ 2 conformation of the bicyclic rings.
