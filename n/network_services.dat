40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an extended}} definition of <b>service</b> <b>networks.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>network</b> definition, {{which can be}} used for classifying <b>service</b> <b>networks,</b> comprises two parts: the <b>service</b> <b>network</b> declaration and the <b>service</b> <b>network</b> specification. The <b>service</b> <b>network</b> specification consists of the specification of the network characteristics, the node characteristics, and the link characteristics. Each of these three characteristics comprises a set of criteria. One fraction of the criteria has been identified through literature research on <b>services,</b> <b>networked</b> organizations, and <b>service</b> <b>network</b> concepts. The remaining fraction of criteria {{is the result of a}} case study analysis. The <b>service</b> <b>network</b> case study has been taken from the information technology sector (i. e., the network of Cloud computing services). The analysis of the case study identified characteristics that are important for describing IT <b>service</b> <b>networks</b> but cannot be captured with the existing definitions of <b>service</b> <b>networks.</b> Classification scheme, <b>service</b> science, Cloud computing, <b>service</b> <b>network,</b> social <b>network,</b> <b>service</b> <b>network</b> evaluation. ...|$|R
