25|$|Closer {{as friends}} over summer 2006, sexual tension between Babe and Josh becomes evident. Even though still married to JR, Babe starts to have romantic {{feelings}} for Josh and feels the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> {{for him when}} Dr. Greg Madden (the man he believes to be his father) goes missing. Babe supports Josh, talks him down, and tries {{to be there for}} him as a friend. When it is found that Greg Madden has died due to being buried alive underground for weeks, Babe sticks by Josh and seeks to help him through this. This enrages JR, causing more problems for their marriage. Due to the lack of communication, JR's murder attempt on her, their increased fighting, the Greg Madden murder mystery looming over their heads, and the search for Kate (JR's long-lost sister), JR and Babe begin shutting down on one another. This leads Babe to turn to Josh, confiding in him even more and spending more time with him.|$|E

In that way, Nolan keeps his personality and {{point of view in}} every aspect of the film. [...] "If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then {{why did you want to}} do an action film?" [...] A famously secretive filmmaker, Nolan is also known for his tight security on scripts, even going as far as telling the actors of The Dark Knight Rises the ending of the film verbally to avoid any leaks and also keeping the Interstellar plot secret from his composer Hans Zimmer.|$|E
500|$|The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) {{announced}} in September 2009 that it [...] " [...] to prioritise" [...] and {{would most likely}} be sending a weakened squad to tour Bangladesh. The press theorised that possible candidates to be rested included captain Andrew Strauss, Paul Collingwood, Stuart Broad and James Anderson. When the squad was officially {{announced in}} January 2010, only Strauss and Anderson were omitted from the touring squad. The reason given for Anderson's break was to give him opportunity to undergo a specialist review and rehabilitation for a chronic injury to his right knee, to enable {{him to return to}} full fitness for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. The decision to rest Strauss was rationalised by national selector Geoff Miller as [...] "the selectors feel it is important that he takes a break ahead of an extremely busy programme of international cricket". This decision was not universally accepted, with former England captains Ian Botham and Michael Atherton among those who spoke out against the move; Botham claimed: [...] "As captain you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> with your team ... I think it’s a major mistake." ...|$|E

[...] "We thought about a sequel to Ferris Bueller, where he'd be in college or at his first job, and {{the same kind of}} things would happen again. But neither of us found a very {{exciting}} hook to that. The movie is about a singular time in your life." [...] "Ferris Bueller is about the week before you leave school, it's about the end of school—in some way, it doesn't have a sequel. It's a little moment and it's a lightning flash in your life. I mean, you could try to repeat it in college or something but it's a time that you don't keep. So that's partly why I think we couldn't think of another", Broderick added. [...] "But just for fun", said Ruck, [...] "I used to think why don't they wait until Matthew and I are in our seventies and do Ferris Bueller Returns and have Cameron be in a nursing home. He doesn't really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> but he just decided his life is over, so he committed himself to a nursing home. And Ferris comes and breaks him out. And they go to, like, a titty bar and all this ridiculous stuff happens. And then, {{at the end of the}} movie, Cameron dies." ...|$|E

[...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E
