50|$|The fossils in {{the cave}} were {{investigated}} by noted 19th-century palaeontologists Edward Drinker Cope, Henry C. Mercer, and Charles M. Wheatley. Some of the fossils, such as an unnamed member of Genus Dicaelus are unique to this cave and have <b>not</b> been <b>identified</b> <b>elsewhere.</b>|$|R
40|$|We present 594 radial {{velocity}} measurements for 71 white dwarfs obtained during {{our search for}} binary white dwarfs and <b>not</b> reported <b>elsewhere.</b> We <b>identify</b> three excellent candidate binaries, which require further observations to confirm our preliminary estimates for their orbital periods, and one other good candidate. We investigate whether our data support {{the existence of a}} population of single, low mass (<~ 0. 5 solar masses) white dwarfs (LMWDs). These stars are difficult to explain in standard models of stellar evolution. We find that a model with a mixed single/binary population is at least ~ 20 times more likely to explain our data than a pure binary population. This result depends on assumed period distributions for binary LMWDs, assumed companion masses and several other factors. Therefore, the evidence in favour of the existence of a population of single LMWDs is not sufficient, in our opinion, to firmly establish the existence of such a population, but does suggest that extended observations of LMWDs to obtain a more convincing result would be worthwhile.

40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to determine}} the obstacles that BEE mining entrepreneurs face at the growth stage of their business. The objective {{of the study is}} to gain insights into both internal and external factors, identify common obstacles which have <b>not</b> been <b>identified</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> The study was a qualitative study where twenty BEE mining entrepreneurs were interviewed. This entailed face to face interviews where themes were recorded and analysed. The interview entailed semi structured questions, where interviewees were asked about obstacles both in the external and internal environment, experienced during the growth stage. In terms of the results many obstacles were identified. The obstacles that BEE mining entrepreneurs faced at the growth stage, ranged from access to finance, regulatory obstacles, lack of skills, infrastructure, unrealistic expectations, economic factors and political factors.

50|$|Chrisstanleyite, Ag2Pd3Se4, is a {{selenide}} mineral that crystallizes in high saline, acidic hydrothermal solution at {{low temperatures}} {{as part of}} selenide vein inclusions in and alongside calcite veins. It tends {{to be found in}} assemblages of other selenides: jagueite, naumannite, fischesserite, oosterboschite, and tiemannite, and it is a solid solution mineral with jagueite Cu2Pd3Se4 in which it shares a unique crystal structure that has <b>not</b> been <b>identified</b> <b>elsewhere</b> (Paar et al. 1998; Nickel 2002; Paar et al. 2004). Chrisstanleyite and jagueite are unlike the other minerals of the selenide family as {{they do not have a}} sulfide analogue (Topa et al. 2006). First discovered by Werner Paar from a sample received from Hopeâ€™s Nose, Torquay, Devon, England, chrisstanleyite has since been discovered in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and in El Chire, La Rioja, Argentina. Chrisstanleyite was named after the Deputy Head and Associate Keeper at the Department of Mineralogy at The Natural History Museum in London.|$|R
40|$|Citrus sinensis is a {{perennial}} woody species, for which genetic {{approaches to the}} study of reproductive development are not readily amenable. Here, the usefulness of the CitEST Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) database is demonstrated as a reliable new resource for identifying novel genes exclusively related to Citrus reproductive biology. We performed the analysis of an EST dataset of the CitEST Project containing 4, 330 flower-derived cDNA sequences. Relying on bioinformatics tools, sequences exclusively present in this flower-derived sequence collection were selected and used for the identification of Citrus putative flower-specific genes. Our analysis revealed several Citrus sequences showing significant similarity to conserved genes known to have flower-specific expression and possessing functions related to flower metabolism and/or reproductive development in diverse plant species. Comparison of the Citrus flower- specific sequences with all available plant peptide sequences unraveled 247 unique transcripts <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> <b>elsewhere</b> within the plant kingdom. Additionally, 49 transcripts, for which no biological function could be attributed by means of sequence comparisons, were found to be conserved among plant species. These results allow further gene expression analysis and possibly novel approaches to the understanding of reproductive development in Citrus...|$|R
40|$|Immunohistochemical {{distribution}} and quantification of crystal matrix protein. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the immunohistochemical {{distribution and}} quantification of crystal matrix protein (CMP). CMP, a 31 kDa glycoprotein, is the principal macromolecule found in calcium oxalate crystals generated in human urine, and is a potent inhibitor of crystal aggregation. A polyclonal rabbit anti-human CMP antibody was used to examine renal tissue by immunohistochemical techniques and light microscopy (N = 45). Twenty-five other human organs were similarly assessed. Quantification was performed using a visual analogue scale. CMP was visible as cytoplasmic staining in the epithelial cells of the TALH and the distal convoluted tubule including the macula densa in a subgroup of nephrons. CMP was <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the urinary tract or in the extrarenal organs examined. Despite a trend indicating that the kidneys of normal men had more CMP than those of normal women, the difference failed to reach significance (P = 0. 11). There was, however, more CMP in the stone formers group compared with either normal men (P < 0. 01) or normal women (P < 0. 01). This protein may be an important determinant of calcium oxalate kidney stone disease...|$|R
