Today the Formosan clouded leopard is considered a subspecies of <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> under the trinomial <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> brachyurus. It is now believed to be extinct.|$|R

50|$|The Sunda {{clouded leopard}} was long {{regarded}} as a subspecies of the clouded leopard, and named <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> diardi.The genetic analysis of hair samples of <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> and <b>Neofelis</b> diardi implies that they diverged 1.4 million years ago, after having used a now submerged land bridge to reach Borneo and Sumatra from mainland Asia.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has recognised that the clouded leopard (<b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> is, in fact, two separate species, which differ markedly {{with respect to}} craniodental and pelage morphology and genomic characters. There is confusion about the origin and inaccuracies {{in the description of}} the nominal specimen, and the undisputed lack of a type specimen prompts designation of a neotype of <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa.</b> In this paper a neotype specimen consisting of a skin, a skull, and a mandible (BM 1955. 1644) is designated, which is housed at the Natural History Museum (NHM) in London. The type locality of <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> is fixed as Chumphon, Peninsular Thailand, under Article 76 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, rather than the original and dubious locality of Canton, China by Edward Griffith. Descriptive data of the neotype specimen are accompanied by comparisons with other specimens of both species of <b>Neofelis,</b> N. <b>nebulosa</b> and N. diardi...|$|R

50|$|Neofelis is a genus {{comprising}} two extant felid {{species from}} Southeast Asia: the clouded leopard (<b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> of mainland Asia, and the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) of Sumatra and Borneo.|$|R
50|$|The {{generic name}} Neofelis was first {{proposed}} by John Edward Gray in 1867 as comprising two species; Neofelis macrocelis {{occurring in the}} Himalaya, Malacca, and Thailand, and Neofelis brachyurus occurring in the former Formosa.Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic classification of Neofelis in 1917, but admitted only the single species <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> with several subspecies and macrocelis as the type specimen. For almost 90 years, the classification of Neofelis as a monotypic genus was widely accepted.In 2006, Neofelis diardi {{was found to be}} distinct from its continental relative <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> and classified as a separate species.|$|R

50|$|The Sunda {{clouded leopard}} (Neofelis diardi), {{also known as}} the Sundaland clouded leopard, is a {{medium-sized}} wild cat found in two Indonesian islands of Borneo and Sumatra.

40|$|The {{cytogenetics}} {{of eight}} Felidae species in Thailand were {{investigated by the}} colchicines-hypotonic fixation-air drying technique followed by a conventional technique. All species studied have an identical number of 38 diploid chromosomes, indicating a close genetic relationship among species. At a deep study level, the genetic relationships of eight Felidae species were accessed by the AFLP method. Blood samples were collected from sources locating in their original regions for DNA extraction. With ten successful primer combinations, a total of 4208 scorable bands were generated. Of these bands, 18. 91 % are polymorphic. Percentages of Polymorphic Bands (PPB) for each primer combination range from 15. 00 to 23. 59 %. The generating bands were used for dendrogram construction. The average genetic similarity values among all Felidae species are 68. 20 % (between Panthera tigris and <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> to 85. 53 % (between Prionailurus bengalensis and Prionailurus viverrinus). The dendrogram shows that the eight Felidae species were clustered together and the subfamily Pantherinae and Felinae with <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> are distinguished. The Felinae, Prionailurus bengalensis, Prionailurus viverrinus, Catopuma temminckii, Felis chaus, Pardofelis marmorata and <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> were clustered together with 91 % bootstrap support and the Pantherinae, Panthera pardus is clustered with Panthera tigris with 92 % bootstrap support.

50|$|Its coat {{is marked}} with irregularly-shaped, dark-edged ovals which {{are said to}} be shaped like clouds, hence its common name.

50|$|Animals in {{the delta}} include the Indian python (Python molurus), clouded leopard (<b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa),</b> Indian {{elephant}} (Elephas maximus indicus) and crocodiles, which live in the Sundarbans. Approximately 182 endangered Bengal tigers (Panthera tigris tigris) are believed to inhabit the Sundarbans.The Ganges-Brahmaputra basin has tropical deciduous forests that yield valuable timber: sal, teak, and peepal trees are found in these areas. The delta region has mangrove trees.|$|R
50|$|<b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> {{is listed}} in CITES Appendix I and {{protected}} over most of its range. Hunting is banned in Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is not legally protected outside Bhutan's protected areas. Hunting is regulated in Laos. No information about its protection status is available from Cambodia. These bans, however, are poorly enforced in India, Malaysia, and Thailand.|$|R
50|$|The {{clouded leopard}} (<b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa)</b> is a wild cat {{occurring}} from the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia into China.

Thirty-six fixed mitochondrial and nuclear nucleotide differences, and 20 microsatellite loci with nonoverlapping allele-size ranges distinguished the populations â€” a degree of differentiation equivalent to, or greater than, comparable measures among the Panthera species â€” and strongly support a species-level distinction between <b>Neofelis</b> <b>nebulosa</b> and <b>Neofelis</b> diardi.|$|R
