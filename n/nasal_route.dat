30|$|Mucosal {{surfaces}} are rich of immunologic organs, thus all mucosal sites are theoretically {{able to be}} used as vaccinated routes. On the basis of logical and practical considerations, oral and <b>nasal</b> <b>routes</b> are focused on the delivery of mucosal vaccines (Levine, 2003). Although oral administration of vaccines has been successfully used against polio, cholera and typhoid fever, intranasal delivery is {{the most effective way to}} induce potent and broad mucosal immune responses at multiple mucosal sites (Holmgren and Czerkinsky, 2005). Moreover, oral delivery of large amount of immunogens easily elicits oral tolerance and is challenged by stomach acids upon ingestion, inhibiting the usage of oral vaccines (Holmgren et al., 2003; Levine, 2003). The small surface area of nasal mucosa requires a low amount of antigens and the absence of acidity in nasal environment keeps the stability of antigens (De Magistnis, 2006).|$|R

In normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice, ovalbumin (OVA) delivered by either the oral or <b>nasal</b> <b>routes</b> or by aerosol inhalation was able to prime CTL immunity in both high- and low-dose regimens. To address the relevance of these CTLs to autoimmune disease, OVA was given to mice that transgenically expressed this antigen in their pancreatic β-cells.

Both orally and nasally sensitized mice experienced airway hyperreactivity on nasal peanut challenge. The peanut challenge also induced lung eosinophilia and type 2 helper T-cell-type cytokines in orally sensitized mice. In contrast, peanut challenge in nasally sensitized mice promoted neutrophilia and higher levels of lung MAC- 1 + I-Ab low cells and inflammatory cytokines.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Striped skunks were experimentally infected with a low pathogenic (LP) H 4 N 6 avian influenza virus (AIV) and monitored for 20 days post infection (DPI). All of the skunks exposed to H 4 N 6 AIV shed large quantities of viral RNA, as detected by real-time RT-PCR and confirmed for live virus with virus isolation, from nasal washes and oral swabs (maximum # 106. 02 PCR EID 50 equivalent/mL and # 10 5. 19 PCR EID 50 equivalent/mL, respectively).

40|$|Streptomycin, the {{foremost}} class of drugs called aminoglycosides {{to be discovered}} is the only antibiotic remedy for tuberculosis. Streptomycin cannot be given orally, but must be administered by regular intramuscular injections as it {{is reported to have}} unreliable absorption throughout the GIT. Further to this, its use in cerebral tuberculosis is minimal as it does not cross the blood brain barrier and drug induced irreversible ototoxicity (Type B toxicity) additionally limits its use. Furthermore, streptomycin is majorly excreted unchanged in urine, as a result of which it is accumulated in kidneys, leading to nephrotoxicity when given continuously for more than 2 - 3 months.

In the present work we propose the newer drug delivery concepts for effective delivery of streptomycin in a bioavailable form with minimal side effects.

Here we have extended this work by combining CTA 1 -DD with ISCOMS, which normally target dendritic cells and/or macrophages. ISCOMS containing a fusion protein comprising the OVA 323 – 339 peptide epitope linked to CTA 1 -DD were highly immunogenic when given in nanogram doses by the s. c., oral, or <b>nasal</b> <b>routes,</b> inducing a wide range of T cell-dependent immune responses.
