40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{tolerance}} synthesis, which involves {{the allocation of}} the specified assembly tolerances among the component dimensions of an assembly to ensure a specified yield. Even though the issue of tolerance synthesis has been discussed widely, most research often assumes that component alternatives have equal <b>nominal</b> <b>values.</b> Therefore, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are negligible. However, there may be situations where the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are different. In such cases, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> should be considered. This paper attempts to include stackup and component <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> to the deterministic tolerance synthesis.

5|$|While {{inflation}} has eroded away {{the achievements of}} most films from the 1960s and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides the Star Wars and Superman franchises, James Bond and Star Trek films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners {{in an era of}} much higher individual ticket prices. When properly adjusted for inflation, however, on that comparative scale Gone with the Wind—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their <b>nominal</b> <b>value,</b> except where stated otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the money supply as a determinant of the <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of output, that is, the quantity theory of money. Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.|$|E

In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion.

5|$|The {{national}} French standard until 1799 {{was based}} on a famous artefact called the , which probably dates back to {{the second half of the}} 15th century. It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238kg. The set is now shown in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. The total <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of the set is 50 marcs de Troyes or marcs de Paris, a mark being 8ounces. The ounce poids de marc had therefore a metric equivalent of 30.59g. The poids de marc was used as a national French standard for trading, for gold, silver and jewels, and for weighing medicine. It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the French Revolution, the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries' pound in the French apothecaries' system, which otherwise remained a standard system of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{good deal}} of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of light dimming as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques that they hope to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the amount of light received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its <b>nominal</b> <b>value),</b> and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E

A popular approach is to use the value di 3 erence metric (VDM) to de 0 ne a real-valued distance measure on <b>nominal</b> <b>values.</b> However, VDM treats the attributes separately and ignores any possible interactions among attributes. In this paper, we propose the use of adaptive dissimilarity matrices for measuring the dissimilarities between <b>nominal</b> <b>values.</b> These matrices are learned via optimizing an error function on the training samples. Experimental results show that this approach leads to better classi 0 cation performance.
