All villages in the surrounding district {{with two or three}} exceptions have been plundered and burnt; twenty thousand Christians have been slaughtered in Armenia and its environs. In Haftewan, a village of Salmas, 750 corpses without heads have been recovered from the wells and cisterns alone. Why? Because the commanding officer had put a price on every Christian head... In Dilman crowds of Christians were thrown into prison and driven to accept Islam.|$|E
500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was {{grateful}} for his appearance as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK.

500|$|According to {{the review}} {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup, issue #0 received an average score of 7.3/10 based on 23 reviews from critics. Leia Calderon of Comic Book Resources (CBR) gave it four-out-of-five stars writing, [...] "Overall, Bendis and Coipel's Civil War II #0 serves {{the sole purpose}} of laying out the foundation for the series. Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only real issue is the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of reason to worry about Civil War II. But the good <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that you might expect from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song and rated it {{four out of five}} stars. He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, but the good <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really." [...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the only thing she has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if she slips up for a second, we'll all be watching..." [...] Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows [...] "her Gen-Y stripes", and [...] "forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' – pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it {{as one of the best}} tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's [...] "Party in U.S.A.," [...] this song is all about how out of place Lovato feels in La La Land." ...|$|E

2500|$|Theatre {{writer and}} {{historian}} John Kenrick wrote, [...] "the bad <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this Follies {{is a dramatic}} and conceptual failure. The good <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it also features {{some of the most}} exciting musical moments Broadway has seen in several seasons.

Since there are infinitely many indices, we don't want finite sets of indices to matter. A consistent choice of index sets that matter is given by any free ultrafilter U on the natural numbers; these can be characterized as ultrafilters that do not contain any finite sets. (The good <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Zorn's lemma guarantees the existence of many such U; the bad <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they cannot be explicitly constructed.)

40|$|After {{a general}} {{discussion}} of electron drift in a gas volume with electric and magnetic fields, distortions in the r and r phi coordinates arising from inhomogeneities {{of the electric}} and magnetic fields in the HARP TPC are calculated. Inhomogeneities of the electric field arise from i) positive ions released by cosmic rays, ii) positive ions released by interaction secondaries, iii) positive ions released by beam muons, iv) positive ions released from beam particles downstream of the inner field cage, and v) a high voltage misalignment between the outer and inner field cages. Also, distortions arising from the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field are calculated. These effects resolve the controversy on unphysical numbers of 'wrong-charge' TPC tracks. The bad <b>news</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> effects <b>are</b> too big to be neglected.

2500|$|After the Obama {{administration}} reduced federal immigration enforcement, Democratic counties {{reduced their}} immigration enforcement more than Republican counties; a paper by a University of Pennsylvania PhD candidate found [...] "that Democratic counties with higher non-citizen population shares saw greater increases in clearance rates, {{a measure of}} policing efficiency, with no increase in crime rates. The results indicate that reducing immigration enforcement did not increase crime and rather led {{to an increase in}} policing efficiency, either because it allowed police to focus efforts on solving more serious crimes or because it elicited greater cooperation of non-citizens with police." [...] A 2003 paper by two Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found [...] "that while the volume of illegal immigration is not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. Border enforcement meanwhile is significantly negatively related to crime rates. The bad <b>news</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the deterrent effect of the border patrol diminishes over this time period, and the net impact of more enforcement on border crime since the late 1990s is zero." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special. By April 1965, Time featured the Peanuts gang on its magazine cover, perhaps prompting a call from John Allen of the New York-based McCann Erickson Agency.

The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special for advertising during the holiday season.

Next, {{it was time for}} the Team nominations: each of the participants had to nominate his suspected Mole(with secret votes only in the first and second series): the contestant receiving most of the votes became the second executable Team member; in case of draw between some contestants, the one of them who received most of the votes by the audience was declared the Team suspected contestant. So, the 2 suspects had to answer a 10 questions questionnaire about the Mole identity: the contestant who got most of the answers wrong had to leave the game. In case of draw, in the first series the contestant spending more time answering the questions was eliminated from the game; in the second series, during the questionnaire contestants heartbeat was controlled by a [...] "cardio frequency meter", so the contestant having the fastest average heartbeat was executed: that made the Mole executable too!
