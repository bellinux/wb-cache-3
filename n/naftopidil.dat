However, it remains unclear how <b>naftopidil</b> decreases nocturnal urine production. Here, we investigated the effects of <b>naftopidil</b> on arginine-vasopressin (AVP) plasma level and urine production and osmolality in rats centrally administered with noradrenaline (NA). NA (3 or 30  μg/kg) was administered into the left ventricle (i. c. v.) of male Wistar rats 3  h after <b>naftopidil</b> pretreatment (10 or 30  mg/kg, i. p.).

Voiding behaviors of <b>naftopidil</b> (30  mg/kg, i. p.) -administered male Wistar rats were observed during separate light- and dark cycles. Administration of NA decreased plasma AVP levels and elevated urine volume, which were suppressed by systemic pretreatment with <b>naftopidil</b> (30  mg/kg, i. p.). Urine osmolality decreased 1  h after NA administration. However, <b>naftopidil</b> by itself had no effect on plasma AVP levels or urodynamic parameters during light- and dark cycles.

Using a rat model of detrusor overactivity caused by cerebral infarction (CI), we undertook the present study {{to determine whether the}} effect of an 1 -blocker, <b>naftopidil,</b> is dependent on the suppression of C-fiber afferents. 	 	Methods 	To induce desensitization of C-fiber bladder afferents, we injected resiniferatoxin (0. 3 mg/kg, RTX) sub-cutaneously to female Sprague-Dawley rats 2 days prior to left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (RTX-CI rats). As controls we used rats without RTX treatment (CI rats). MCAO and insertion of a polyethylene catheter through the bladder dome were performed under halothane anesthesia.

40|$|Introduction: There {{have been}} reports {{that one of the}} factors {{affecting}} the efficacy of α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists (α 1 -blocker; α 1 -B) was prostate volume (PV). However, there are few reports of short-term prospective trials comparing the efficacy of α 1 -B by PV. We examined the influence of PV on the short-term efficacy of <b>naftopidil</b> dose increase therapy to administration of 75 mg/day after an initial dose of 50 mg/day. Materials and Methods: A total of 85 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) received 50 mg/day of <b>naftopidil</b> for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the dosage of <b>naftopidil</b> was increased to 75 mg/day for a further 4 weeks. We divided the patients into two groups of PV ≥ 40 mL at baseline (Group L) and PV < 40 mL at baseline (Group S). Results: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS storage symptoms, and IPSS quality-of-life score were significantly improved at 4 and 8 weeks compared with baseline in both Groups. IPSS voiding symptoms (IPSS-VS) were significantly improved at 4 and 8 weeks compared with baseline in Group S. IPSS and IPSS-VS were significantly improved at 8 weeks compared with 4 weeks only in Group L. IPSS-VS and intermittency at 4 weeks were significantly decreased in Group S compared with Group L. Maximum flow rate was significantly improved at 8 weeks compared with baseline in Group L.

Patients and methods: <b>Naftopidil,</b> 50  mg/d or 75  mg/d, was given to 117 patients having BPH aged 50  years and older who had international prostate symptom scores (IPSS) ≥ 8. They were prospectively followed for 3  years with periodic evaluation. If <b>naftopidil</b> was terminated, the reason was determined. For patients with termination, an outcome survey was done to evaluate the status of retreatment for BPH at 3  years. Results: Twenty-five patients (21. 4 %) continued the same medication for 3  years. The total IPSS, quality of life index, BPH problem index, and maximum flow rate were significantly improved during 3  years. Treatment failure defined as symptomatic progression (an increase in the IPSS of ≥ 4 points compared to the baseline value), development of acute urinary retention, conversion to other α 1 -blockers, add-on of a 5 α-reductase inhibitor, or conversion to surgery was observed in 41 patients (35. 0 %). In the univariate analysis, age, prostate volume, and serum prostate-specific antigen were predictors of treatment failure.

Thirty one patients were enrolled in a randomized crossover study. Fourteen patients were initially prescribed <b>naftopidil</b> 75 mg (N) for 8 weeks, followed by tamsulosin 0. 2 mg and solifenacin 5 mg (TS) for 8 weeks (group N); another 17 were initially prescribed TS, followed by N (group TS). The efficacy variables were the changes in international prostate symptom score (I-PSS), quality of life (QOL) score, overative bladder symptom score (OABSS), and post-void residual (PVR) urine volume. After the study, a questionnaire survey was carried out about the choice of treatment.

40|$|A {{crossover}} {{study was conducted}} to identify the best α 1 -adrenoceptor (α 1 AR) antagonist for individual patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). One hundred thirteen patients (mean age 70. 8 years) were enrolled. All patients met BPH clinical study guidelines. Seven agents were utilized:tamsulosin 0. 2 mg, silodosin 8 mg, urapidil 60 mg, <b>naftopidil</b> 50 mg, prazosin 1 mg, terazosin 2 mg, and doxazosin 1 mg. Patients were initially prescribed tamsulosin or silodosin for a week and then urapidil for a week. Two weeks later, they were prescribed the better of the 2 agents for a week and a new agent for the next week. This cycle was repeated until all 7 agents were tested. Efficacy was evaluated with the International Prostate Symptom Score. The agent rankings were doxazosin (25 [22 %]), silodosin (22 [19 %]), urapidil (19 [17 %]), <b>naftopidil</b> (17 [15 %]), terazosin (12 [11 %]), tamsulosin (11 [10 %]), prazosin (7 [6 %]).

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of <b>naftopidil</b> and tamsulosin with pre-dnisolone as medical expulsive therapy for distal ureteric stones. Materials and Methods: Between July 2010 and March 2012, 120 adult patients pre-senting with distal ureteric stones of size 5 to 10 mm were randomized equally to tamsu-losin (group A), <b>naftopidil</b> (group B) or watchful waiting (group C). Tamsulosin or nafto-pidil was given for a maximum of four weeks. In addition patients in group A and B were given 5 mg prednisolone once daily (maximum one week). Stone expulsion rate, time to stone expulsion, analgesic use, number of hospital visits for pain, follow-up and endoscopic treatment and adverse effects of drugs were noted. Statistical analyses were done using chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and analysis of variance. Results: There was a statistically higher expulsion rate in groups A (70 %) and B (87. 5 %) as compared to group C (32. 5 %) (p＜ 0. 001). The expulsion rates were not statistically different between groups A and B (p= 0. 056). The mean time to expulsion was com-parable between groups A and B but longer in group C. Analgesic use was significantly lower in groups A and B. Average number of hospital visits for pain, follow-up and endo-scopic treatment was similar in all groups. There was no serious adverse event.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} neuronally induced atrial arrhythmias can be modified by α-adrenergic receptor blockade. In 30 anesthetized dogs, trains of five electrical stimuli (1 mA; 1 ms) were delivered immediately after the P wave of the ECG to mediastinal nerves associated with the superior vena cava. Regional atrial electrical events were monitored with 191 atrial unipolar electrodes. Mediastinal nerve sites were identified that reproducibly initiated atrial arrhythmias. These sites were then restimulated following 1 h (time control, n = 6), or the intravenous administration of <b>naftopidil</b> (α 1 -adrenergic blocker: 0. 2 mg/kg, n = 6), yohimbine (α 2 -adrenergic blocker: 1 mg/kg, n = 6) or both (n = 8). A ganglionic blocker (hexamethonium: 1 mg/kg) was tested in four dogs. Stimulation of mediastinal nerves sites consistently elicited atrial tachyarrhythmias. Repeat stimulation after 1 h in the time-control group exerted a 19 % decrease of the sites still able to induce atrial tachyarrhythmias. Hexamethonium inactivated 78 % of the previously active sites. Combined α-adrenoceptor blockade inactivated 72 % of the previously active sites. Bradycardia responses induced by mediastinal nerve stimulation were blunted by hexamethonium, but not by α 1, 2 -adrenergic blockade. <b>Naftopidil</b> or yohimbine alone eliminated atrial arrhythmia induction from 31 % and 34 % of the sites (similar to time control). We conclude that heterogeneous activation of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system results in atrial arrhythmias that involve intrinsic cardiac neuronal α-adrenoceptors. In contrast to the global suppression exerted by hexamethonium, we conclude that α-adrenoceptor blockade targets intrinsic cardiac local circuit neurons involved in arrhythmia formation and not the flow-through efferent projections of the cardiac nervous system...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Antagonists of α 1 -adrenergic receptors (α 1 ARs) relax {{prostate}} {{smooth muscle}} and relieve voiding and storage symptoms. Recently, increased expression of α 1 ARs with change of its subtype expression {{has been proved}} in bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). To search for the evidence of changes in α 1 ARs subtype expression and activity in the peripheral and spinal routes, the effects of spinal and peripheral administration of tamsulosin (an α 1 A/D-selective AR), <b>naftopidil</b> (an α 1 A/D-selective AR), and doxazosin (non-selective AR) on bladder activity were investigated in a rat model with or without BOO. Methods: A total of 65 female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the BOO surgery group (n= 47) and the sham surgery group (n= 18). After 6 weeks, cystometry was assessed before and after intrathecal and intra-arterial administrations of tamsulosin, <b>naftopidil,</b> and doxazosin. Results: After intra-arterial administrations of all three drugs, bladder capacity (BC) was increased and maximal intravesical pressure (Pmax) was decreased in both BOO and the sham rat models (P< 0. 05). After intrathecal administration of all three drugs, BC was increased and Pmax was decreased in only the BOO group. The episodes of involuntary contraction in the BOO rat models were decreased by intra-arterial administration (P= 0. 031). The increase of BC after intrathercal and intra-arterial administrations of α 1 ARs was significantly greater in the BOO group than in the sham group (P= 0. 023, P= 0. 041). In the BOO group, the increase of BC and decrease in Pmax were greater by intra-arterial administration than by intrathecal administration (P= 0. 035).

Patients and methods: A retrospective study was carried out on 217 BPH patients who had received Avishot™ for more than 6 months and then were switched to Flivas™ at the same dose and timing. The two drugs contain the same principal ingredient and display the same pharmacokinetic properties. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), QOL score, and average monthly ambient temperature at the patients’ residence area from the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System in Japan were used for the evaluation. Results: A significant change in urinary storage symptoms (P = 0. 006), and especially in nighttime frequency (P < 0. 001), was observed by switching drugs, suggesting the perceived placebo effect. There was significant improvement of daytime frequency (P < 0. 05), nighttime frequency (P < 0. 001), storage symptoms (P < 0. 001), and total IPSS (P < 0. 05) when the magnitude of ambient temperature change from before and 3 months after switching drugs was higher than 10 °C, while no significant improvement was noted in any of the parameters examined when the same was lower than 10 °C. Conclusion: The present study showed the nonspecific effect of magnitude of ambient temperature change was involved in the perceived placebo effect on LUTS, especially on storage symptoms, by switching drugs. The nonspecific effect on LUTS with BPH needs to be considered when evaluating subjective treatment efficacy of drugs for LUTS with BPH in routine clinical practice. The present study supports the lifestyle advice “avoid exposing the lower body to cold temperature” or “keep warm when it is cold” for LUTS with BPH.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that cocaine may induce activation of cortical (cEEG) and hippocampal (hEEG) electroencephalographic signals, concurrent with inhibition of penile erection, via an {{action on the}} hippocampal formation. The present study further evaluates the role of noradrenergic neurotransmission at the hippocampal formation in this process, using adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats anaesthetized and maintained by chloral hydrate. Unilateral microinjection of cocaine (100 [*]nmoles) into the hippocampal CA 1 or CA 3 subfield or dentate gyrus elicited significant activation of both cEEG and hEEG activity. At the same time, the intracavernous pressure (ICP), our experimental index for penile erection, underwent a discernible reduction. Co-administration of equimolar doses (250 [*]pmoles) of prazosin, <b>naftopidil,</b> yohimbine or rauwolscine significantly reversed those effects elicited by cocaine on cEEG, hEEG and ICP. Microinjection unilaterally of equimolar doses (5 [*]nmoles) of norepinephrine, phenylephrine or BHT 933 into the hippocampal formation, similar to cocaine, also induced appreciable cEEG and hEEG excitation, with a simultaneous decrease in ICP. We conclude that cocaine may activate cEEG and hEEG and decrease ICP via noradrenergic neurotransmission, possibly engaging at least α 1 A/D-, α 2 B- and α 2 C-adrenoceptors at the hippocampal formation...|$|E
40|$|This review {{evaluates the}} role of α-adrenoceptor antagonists as a {{potential}} treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). Cochrane, Google Scholar and Pubmed were accessed to retrieve sixty-two articles for analysis. In vitro studies demonstrate that doxazosin, prazosin and terazosin (quinazoline α-antagonists) induce apoptosis, decrease cell growth, and proliferation in PC- 3, LNCaP and DU- 145 cell lines. Similarly, the piperazine based <b>naftopidil</b> induced cell cycle arrest and death in LNCaP-E 9 cell lines. In contrast, sulphonamide based tamsulosin did not exhibit these effects. In vivo data was consistent with in vitro findings as the quinazoline based α-antagonists prevented angiogenesis and decreased tumour mass in mice models of PCa. Mechanistically the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of the α-antagonists appear largely independent of α 1 -blockade. The proposed targets include: VEGF, EGFR, HER 2 /Neu, caspase 8 / 3, topoisomerase 1 and other mitochondrial apoptotic inducing factors. These cytotoxic effects could not be evaluated in human studies as prospective trial data is lacking. However, retrospective studies show a decreased incidence of PCa in males exposed to α-antagonists. As human data evaluating the use of α-antagonists as treatments are lacking; well designed, prospective clinical trials are needed to conclusively demonstrate the anticancer properties of quinazoline based α-antagonists in PCa and other cancers...|$|E
