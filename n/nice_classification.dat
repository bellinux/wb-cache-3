40|$|Congenital {{heart disease}} (CHD) is a {{frequent}} cause of pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), with diverse etiology and outcome. We aimed to describe phenotypic heterogeneity in pediatric PAH associated with CHD (PAH-CHD), assess {{the applicability of the}} <b>Nice</b> CHD <b>classification,</b> and explore whether this classification accurately reflects patient/disease characteristics and survival. All children with CHD from a contemporary cohort of consecutive pediatric PAH patients followed in three major referral centers (Denver, New York, the Netherlands) were characterized and classified {{on the basis of the}} latest proposed clinical classification for PAH-CHD (World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension, Nice, 2013). According to this classification, 24 % of 134 children were classified into group 1, 14 % into group 2, 19 % into group 3, and 30 % into group 4; 11 % could not be classified. Types of CHD and hemodynamic profile differed between groups, with the highest right atrial pressure in group 4 (P < 0. 040). Group 3 children had Down syndrome less frequently (P = 0. 011) but other (un) defined syndromes most frequently (P = 0. 063) and received most intense PAH-targeted therapy (P = 0. 003). With 15 deaths and one lung transplant (12 %; median follow-up: 4. 3 years), survival differences could not be demonstrated between the groups in the <b>Nice</b> CHD <b>classification.</b> Pediatric PAH-CHD is a heterogeneous condition frequently associated with extracardiac, developmental factors that are believed to affect disease development. The <b>Nice</b> CHD <b>classification</b> identifies groups with specific patient/disease characteristics. However, a substantial proportion of children could not be classified.

We prove that Boolean algebras that support a finitely additive non-atomic uniformly regular measure are metrically isomorphic to a subalgebras of the Jordan algebra with the Lebesgue measure. We give some partial analogues {{to be used}} for a classification of algebras that support a finitely additive non-atomic measure with a higher uniform regularity number. We show that some naturally induced equivalence relations connected to metric isomorphism are quite complex even on the Cantor algebra and therefore probably we cannot hope for a <b>nice</b> general <b>classification</b> theorem for finitely–additive measures.

40|$|AbstractVarious {{experimental}} {{investigations have}} shown a sharp transition between satisfiability and unsatisfiability of CNF formulas with L clauses over n variables as c=L/n is varied. For 2 -SAT {{it has been shown}} theoretically that a threshold phenomenon occurs at the critical value c= 1. For 3 -SAT experimental results show a sharp transition near c= 4 but no such threshold phenomenon has already been proved. Noticing that the XOR-SAT problem (in which one uses the ‘exclusive or’ instead of the usual ‘or’) is a special case of satisfiability which is solvable in polynomial time as decision problem as well as counting problem leads to the natural question: is there a satisfiability threshold for XOR-SAT? In this paper, we answer this question in establishing a threshold phenomenon for XOR-SAT, with associated critical value c= 1. So, consider randomly generated XOR-CNF formulas F. We prove that F is satisfiable with probability 1 −o(1) whenever c 1 as n tends to infinity. Indeed, in following the <b>nice</b> terminology <b>classification</b> given by Erdös and Rényi for random graphs, we obtain much better: we exhibit a probability distribution function that gives a complete understanding of the transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability for random XOR-SAT formulas...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple yet effective supervised deep hash approach that constructs binary hash codes from labeled data for large-scale image search. We {{assume that the}} semantic labels are governed by several latent attributes with each attribute on or off, and classification relies on these attributes. Based on this assumption, our approach, dubbed supervised semantics-preserving deep hashing (SSDH), constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an objective function defined over classification error and other desirable hash codes properties. With this design, SSDH has a <b>nice</b> characteristic that <b>classification</b> and retrieval are unified in a single learning model. Moreover, SSDH performs joint learning of image representations, hash codes, and classification in a point-wised manner, and thus is scalable to large-scale datasets. SSDH is simple and can be realized by a slight enhancement of an existing deep architecture for classification; yet it is effective and outperforms other hashing approaches on several benchmarks and large datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, SSDH achieves higher retrieval accuracy, while the classification performance is not sacrificed. Comment: To appear in IEEE Trans.

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic yield of narrow band imaging (NBI) colonoscopy for polyp detection compared with standard colonoscopy. In this prospective study, 505 patients that underwent total colonoscopy were randomized into two groups: 226 patients in NBI group and 279 in non-NBI group (standard colonoscopy). The primary endpoints were polyp detection rate (PDR) and adenoma detection rate (ADR) in both groups. Polyps detected with NBI technique were characterized according to the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (<b>NICE)</b> <b>classification.</b> The total number of polyps detected in NBI group was significantly higher compared with non-NBI group (325 polyps in 226 patients versus 189 polyps in 279 patients, respectively). PDR in NBI group was 55. 3 %, versus 43. 3 % in non-NBI group. ADR in NBI group was significantly higher compared with non-NBI group (35. 3 % versus 20 %, respectively). The proportion of detected adenomas in the left-sided colon was significantly higher in NBI group (72. 8 % versus 61. 06 % in non-NBI group), which was related to an increased number of small adenomas detected in NBI group.

It creates clear and bright endoscopic images using short-wavelength, narrow-band laser light combined with white laser light. The illuminating light and signal processing emphasize slight color differences in abnormal regions that approximate the normal {{color of the}} mucosa. As a result, regions initially appearing red become a deeper shade of red, while regions originally appearing white become brighter, yet with natural tones. This process facilitates recognition of slight differences in {{the color of the}} mucosa and clarifies the boundaries of the mucosal pit. Aim: To determine whether LCI of the colon can improve the correlation between endoscopic findings and pathological diagnosis. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy requiring polypectomy or removal by biopsy forceps if possible were recruited. Probable polyp histology was assessed by two endoscopists using the Narrow-band imaging International Colorectal Endoscopic (<b>NICE)</b> <b>classification</b> and LCI data. All detected polyps were sent to the pathology department for pathological diagnosis by two pathologists. Results: In total, 94 polyps were found in 43 patients.

40|$|Stiprus prekių ženklas, tai viena pagrindinių sėkmingo verslo sudedamųjų dalių. Prekių ženklais yra laikomi bet kokie žymenys, kurie gali būti pavaizduoti grafiškai bei kurių esminė funkcija – vieno asmens prekes ar paslaugas atskirti nuo kito asmens prekių ar paslaugų. Tačiau tam, kad ženklui būtų suteikiama teisinė apsauga, kuri padeda apsisaugoti nuo nesąžiningų konkurencijos veiksmų, prekių ženklą reikia įregistruoti nacionaliniu, Europos Sąjungos arba tarptautiniu lygiu. Tam, kad būtų užtikrinta vienoda šalių praktika prekių ženklų registravimo atžvilgiu, 1957 m. buvo sukurta Nicos klasifikacija, sudaryta iš bendro prekių ir paslaugų klasių sąrašo, kartu su reikalingais paaiškinimais, bei abėcėlinio prekių ir paslaugų sąrašo su atitinkamos klasės nuoroda, kuriai yra priskiriama kiekviena prekė ar paslauga. Teigdami paraišką įregistruoti atitinkamą prekių ženklą, pareiškėjai dažnai nurodo tik atitinkamos Nicos klasifikacijos klasės antraštės bendrąsias sąvokas. Iki 2012 metų birželio mėnesio klasių antraščių bendrosios sąvokos buvo interpretojamos remiantis dviem požiūriais. Pirmasis požiūris teigė, jog „klasių antraštės apima visą klasę“, o antrasis nurodė, jog „reiškia tai, kas parašyta. “ Nenuostabu, kad valstybių tarnybose skirtingai interpretuojant klasių antraščių bendrųjų sąvokų naudojimą prekių ženklo registracijos paraiškose, kilo didelių abejonių nustatinėjant tokios registracijos teikiamos apsaugos ribas. 2012 m. birželio 19 d. Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teisme buvo priimtas sprendimas vadinamojoje „IP Translator“ byloje, sukėlęs daugiau klausimų nei pateikęs atsakymų. Atsižvelgiant į tai, šiame darbe buvo siekama analizuojant minėtą sprendimą bei jo pasekoje Europos Sąjungos prekių ženklų ir dizaino paskelbtus Bendruosius pranešimus, Europos Parlamento ir Tarybos reglamentą Nr. 2015 / 2424 išsiaiškinti, ar norint nustatyti prekes ir paslaugas, kurioms yra prašoma prekių ženklo apsaugos pakanka nurodyti Nicos klasifikacijos klasių antraščių bendrąsias sąvokas. Darbe buvo išsiaiškinta, jog iš visų Nicos klasifikacijos klasių antraščių bendrųjų sąvokų tik penkios nėra pakankamai aiškios ir tikslios, dėl ko tik jomis remiantis be papildomo patikslinimo nėra galimybės nustatyti kokia yra atitinkamos prekių ženklo registracijos suteikiamos apsaugos apimtis. Todėl, kaip nurodoma naujajame Europos Parlamento ir Tarybos reglamente Nr. 2015 / 2424, Nicos klasifikacijos klasių antraščių bendrųjų sąvokų naudojimas yra galima, jeigu nėra pažeidžiamas aiškumo bei tikslumo kriterijus. Strong {{trademark}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} components of successful business. Any marks, which are illustrated graphically and have the essential function to separate goods and services from another person’s goods and services, are considered to be trademarks. However in order to grant legal protection to the trademark that helps to protect against unfair competitive actions, the trademark has to be registered on the national, European Union’s or international level. In order to ensure the unanimous registration practice of trademarks in the Special Union, <b>Nice</b> <b>classification</b> was created in 1957. This classification consists of common list of classes, necessary explanations and alphabetic list of goods and services with the reference of certain class, to which the product or service is attributed. It covers 45 classes in total. It is an often case in practice that the applicant indicates only general concepts of certain heading of the <b>Nice</b> <b>Classification</b> in the registration application. Two approaches were predominant among the States until June 2012, which were applied to explain the usage of general concepts of classes’ headings in registration applications. The first approach is when “the headings of classes cover the entire class”, thus accordingly, when the agencies use the second approach, they “see what is written” and the headings were assessed literally. Therefore there is no wonder that big doubts arouse while setting the protection limits of registration in different countries, where the usage of general concepts of headings in the registration applications was interpreted differently. The decision of the Court of Justice in so called “IP Translator” case had an especially big influence on the approach that the situation has to be changed because of such legal ambiguity. It was solved in the aforementioned case whether the general concepts of the heading of the class 41 “Education, Entertainment, Training, Sport and Cultural Activities” cover the translation services, as well. The prejudicial matters were used essentially to learn whether the usage of general concepts of headings of the classes of <b>Nice</b> <b>Classification</b> is possible in the application for trademark’s registration and how clearly and accurately the goods and services are identified, with regard to which the trademark’s protection is requested. Although this decision was waited in expectation to solve the problem of legal ambiguity, but actually it raised more questions than answers. Therefore the purpose of this work is to learn whether it is enough to indicate the general concepts of headings of the classes of <b>Nice</b> <b>Classification</b> in order to identify goods and services, with regard to which the trademark’s protection is requested. The main focus is given to the analysis of general notices published by ESINT with regard to application of <b>Nice</b> <b>Classification.</b> According to the General notification of 20 February 2014 on acceptability of classification terms for general practice v 1. 0, it was attempted to learn the criteria, with the help of which it should be determined whether certain term is clear and precise. It was determined that descriptions of certain goods and services are considered sufficiently clear and precise only when their protection scope may be determined according to usual meaning of their descriptions. If it is not possible to understand what the protection scope is, the sufficient precision and clarity may be achieved through identification of certain factors, for example characteristic, purpose and/or identified sector of the market. Besides, the situations may be possible that the same term is used in description of several classes. However it will be sufficiently clear and precise in one class, and completely unclear in another. The analysis of the General notification of 20 February 2014 on execution of the decision in the case “IP Translator” v 1. 2 helped to distinguish three modes, on the ground of which the possibility is granted to the applicants to ensure the protection of the entire alphabetic list when applying for the trademark’s registration after the decision in the case “IP Translator”. So the applicants may fill out the declaration, to mark the field electronically or to name each concept separately. The attention should be paid to the fact that each country chooses individually whether to apply one or several modes. In order to learn, which general concepts of <b>Nice</b> <b>Classification</b> are not clear and precise, the General notification of 28 October 2015 on the practice of application of general concepts of headings of the classes of <b>Nice</b> <b>Classification</b> v 1. 2 was used. It helped to distinguish 5 general concepts, i. e. concept of the class 7 “Machinery”, concept of the class 37 “Repairs” and “Installation services”, concept of the class 40 “Treatment of materials”, and concept of the class 45 “Personal and social services rendered by others to meet the needs of individuals”. In the end of the work the attention was paid to the fact that one of the essential outcomes of the case “IP Translator” was the new Regulation of the European Parliament and Council No. 2015 / 2424, that has replaced in part the Regulation on Community’s trademark. The new regulation contains the provision that the general concepts of headings of the classes of <b>Nice</b> <b>Classification</b> have to be interpreted literally, i. e. they cover the goods and services, which are meant literally by appropriate general concept...|$|E

This classification system {{was based on}} narrow-band imaging (NBI) technology, leaving uncertainty regarding its applicability to other systems. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess accuracy and reliability of histologic predictions for polyps < 1 cm by applying the <b>NICE</b> <b>classification</b> to the Fujinon Spectral Imaging Color Enhancement (FICE) System. A video library of 55 polyps < 1 cm histologically verified with FICE was prospectively created, including polyps that fulfilled inclusion criteria (morphology, size, histology) in consecutive colonoscopies. Six endoscopists with experience in electronic chromoendoscopy independently reviewed the polyp images, scored the polyps as adenomatous or hyperplastic, and assigned a level of confidence to the predictions. Twenty videos were reassessed at 6 months. The diagnostic performances of the endoscopists was calculated both combined and individually according to the histopathology of the polyps. A mixed-effect logistic regression model, in which polyps were considered as random effects, and polyp histology, confidence level, and readers were considered as fixed effects, was used. Results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Of the 55 polyps (mean size 4. 6 mm), 29 (53 %) were adenomas, and 26 (47 %) were hyperplastic. Across all the readers and observations, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) were 77 %, 75 %, 88 %, 75 %, 77 %, and 0. 82, respectively. Individual rater accuracy ranged from 66 % to 96 %, being < 90 % in 5 of 6 cases. Overall, 68. 5 % of predictions (226 / 330) were made with high confidence, although there was high variability (Fleiss kappa, 0. 15; 95 % CI, 0. 08 - 0. 22). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and AUC for predictions made with high confidence were 81 %, 80. 5 %, 80 %, 77 %, 82 %, and 0. 88 being significantly more accurate as compared with a low confidence of diagnosis (OR 2. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 4. 7). Regarding the performance of the individual NICE criteria, the odds of adenoma detection were 3. 4 (95 % CI, 1. 8 - 6. 3) and 4. 0 (95 % CI, 2. 1 - 7. 5) by using surface and vessels patterns alone, as compared with the color criterion. Interrater and intrarater agreement with the NICE was only moderate (interrater: Fleiss kappa, 0. 51; 95 % CI, 0. 44 - 0. 56; intrarater: kappa, 0. 40; 95 % CI, 0. 20 - 0. 60).

Although magnifying chromoendoscopy {{had been a}} reliable diagnostic tool, narrow-band imaging (NBI) has been developed in Japan since 1999 and has now replaced the major role of chromoendoscopy because of its convenience and simplicity. In this paper, we principally describe the efficacy of magnifying chromoendoscopy and magnifying colonoscopy with NBI for detection, histological prediction, estimation of the depth of early colorectal cancer, and future prospects. Although some meta-analyses have concluded that NBI is not superior to white light imaging for detection of adenomatous polyps in screening colonoscopy, NBI with magnification colonoscopy is useful for histological prediction, or for estimating the depth of invasion. To standardize these diagnostic strategies, we {{will focus on the}} NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (<b>NICE)</b> <b>classification</b> proposed for use by endoscopists with or without a magnifying endoscope. However, more prospective research is needed to prove that this classifica-tion can be applied with satisfactory availability, feasibility, and reliability. In the future, NBI might contribute to the evaluation of real-time histological prediction during colonoscopy, which has substantial benefits for both reducing the risk of polypectomy and saving the cost of histological evaluation by resecting and discarding diminutive adenomatous polyps (resect and discard strategy). 1...|$|E

Let V be a Euclidean space, that is, a finite dimensional real linear {{space with a}} symmetric positive definite inner product �, �. Recall {{the definition of a}} reflection V in ([1]) : Definition 1. A reflection in V with respect to a vector α ∈ V is defined by the formula: sα(x) = x − 2 �x, α � α. �α, α� Definition 2. An abstract root system in V is a finite set Δ of nonzero elements of V such that (1) Δ spans V; (2) for all α ∈ Δ, the reflections sα(β) = β − 2 �β, α � α �α, α� map the set Δ to itself; (3) the number 2 �β,α � �α,α� is an integer for any α, β ∈ Δ. A root is an element of Δ. Remark 3. This definition may seem weird to you, but wait till you see the examples. A golden rules in mathematics is that if you can define an object for which there are enough, but not too many nontrivial examples, it must have important implications. If a <b>nice</b> <b>classification</b> of such objects is available, it is a discovery. This indeed is the case with the abstract root systems. They arise naturally in the theory of semisimple Lie algebras, and {{play an important role in}} a wide range of problems of algebra, representation theory and mathematical physics. At the same time, they can be defined and largely dealt with by means of linear algebra. This will be our goal...|$|E
40|$|Accurate optical {{characterisation}} {{and removal}} of small adenomas (< 10  mm) at colonoscopy would allow hyperplastic polyps {{to be left}} in situ and surveillance intervals to be determined {{without the need for}} histopathology. Although accurate in specialist practice the performance of narrow band imaging (NBI), colonoscopy in routine clinical practice is poorly understood. NBI-assisted optical diagnosis was compared with reference standard histopathological findings in a prospective, blinded study, which recruited adults undergoing routine colonoscopy in six general hospitals in the UK. Participating colonoscopists (N= 28) were trained using the NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic (<b>NICE)</b> <b>classification</b> (relating to colour, vessel structure and surface pattern). By comparing the optical and histological findings in patients with only small polyps, test sensitivity was determined at the patient level using two thresholds: presence of adenoma and need for surveillance. Accuracy of identifying adenomatous polyps < 10  mm was compared at the polyp level using hierarchical models, allowing determinants of accuracy to be explored. Of 1688 patients recruited, 722 (42. 8 %) had polyps < 10  mm with 567 (78. 5 %) having only polyps < 10  mm. Test sensitivity (presence of adenoma, N= 499 patients) by NBI optical diagnosis was 83. 4 % (95 % CI 79. 6 % to 86. 9 %), significantly less than the 95 % sensitivity (p< 0. 001) this study was powered to detect. Test sensitivity (need for surveillance) was 73. 0 % (95 % CI 66. 5 % to 79. 9 %). Analysed at the polyp level, test sensitivity (presence of adenoma, N= 1620 polyps) was 76. 1 % (95 % CI 72. 8 % to 79. 1 %). In fully adjusted analyses, test sensitivity was 99. 4 % (95 % CI 98. 2 % to 99. 8 %) if two or more NICE adenoma characteristics were identified. Neither colonoscopist expertise, confidence in diagnosis nor use of high definition colonoscopy independently improved test accuracy. This large multicentre study demonstrates that NBI optical diagnosis cannot currently be recommended for application in routine clinical practice. Further work is required to evaluate whether variation in test accuracy is related to polyp characteristics or colonoscopist training.
