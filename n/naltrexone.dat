5|$|It is {{sold as a}} {{combination}} drug with <b>naltrexone</b> as Contrave.|$|E
5|$|It is {{sold under}} many trade names {{worldwide}} and in combinations with <b>naltrexone.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Naltrexone</b> is a {{competitive}} antagonist for opioid receptors, effectively blocking {{the effects of}} endorphins and opioids. <b>Naltrexone</b> is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence when <b>naltrexone</b> is in the body there is {{a reduction in the}} pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol. Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking. Nalmefene also appears effective and works by a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using <b>naltrexone</b> or another opioid antagonists to treat {{alcoholism}} by having the person take the medication {{about an hour before}} they drink alcohol, and only then. The medication blocks the positive reinforcement effects of ethanol and hopefully allows the person to stop drinking or drink less.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion, {{when used}} for {{treating}} obesity {{over a period}} of 6 to 12 months, may result in weight loss of 2.7kg over placebo. This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications, such as sibutramine or orlistat. It has been studied in combination with <b>naltrexone.</b> Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In September 2014, a combination (bupropion/naltrexone) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or <b>naltrexone</b> may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E
25|$|Acamprosate {{may work}} better than <b>naltrexone</b> for {{eliminating}} drinking, while <b>naltrexone</b> may decrease the desire for alcohol to a greater extent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Naltrexone</b> is marketed {{under the}} trade name Revia and Vivitrol. In the United States as of 2016, <b>naltrexone</b> tablets cost about US$0.91 per day. The extended-release {{injections}} cost about $1,248.50 per month ($41.62 per day). <b>Naltrexone</b> {{is also used}} in formulation with bupropion (bupropion/naltrexone) to treat obesity in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{closely related}} medication, methylnaltrexone, {{is used to}} treat opioid-induced {{constipation}} but does not treat addiction as it does not cross the blood brain barrier. Nalmefene is similar to <b>naltrexone</b> and {{is used for the}} same purposes as <b>naltrexone.</b> <b>Naltrexone</b> {{should not be confused with}} naloxone, which is used in emergency cases of opioid overdose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Naltrexone</b> is a {{medication}} primarily {{used in the}} management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. <b>Naltrexone</b> is a pure opioid antagonist and works by blocking the activity of opioids.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, <b>naltrexone</b> {{implants}} {{that are}} surgically implanted are available, While these are manufactured in Australia, {{they are not}} authorized for use within Australia, but only for export. By 2009, <b>naltrexone</b> implants showed encouraging results.|$|E
25|$|The plasma {{half-life}} of <b>naltrexone</b> and its metabolite 6β-naltrexol are about 4 hours and 13 hours, respectively.|$|E
25|$|A <b>naltrexone</b> {{treatment}} {{study by}} Anton et al., {{released by the}} National Institutes of Health in February 2008 and published in the Archives of General Psychiatry, has shown that alcoholics having a certain variant of the opioid receptor gene (G polymorphism of SNP Rs1799971 in the gene OPRM1), known as Asp40, demonstrated strong response to <b>naltrexone</b> and were {{far more likely to}} experience success at cutting back or discontinuing their alcohol intake altogether, while for those lacking the gene variant, <b>naltrexone</b> appeared to be no different from placebo. The G allele of OPRM1 is most common in individuals of Asian descent, with 60% to 70% of people of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian ancestry having at least one copy, as opposed to 30% of Europeans and few Africans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Naltrexone</b> and its active {{metabolite}} 6β-naltrexol are competitive antagonists at the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) to {{a lesser}} extent, and to a far lesser and possibly insignificant extent, at the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). The Ki affinity values of <b>naltrexone</b> at the MOR, KOR, and DOR have been reported as 0.0825 nM, 0.509 nM, and 8.02 nM, respectively, demonstrating a MOR/KOR binding ratio of 6.17 and a MOR/DOR binding ratio of 97.2.|$|E
25|$|It {{is being}} studied along with <b>naltrexone</b> and {{sorbitol}} for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary disease that causes peripheral neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Vivitrol, a <b>naltrexone</b> {{formulation}} for depot injection, {{was approved}} by the FDA on April 13, 2006, for the treatment of alcohol dependence.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that 5HT3 antagonists may be beneficial. Preliminary clinical data finds that low-dose <b>naltrexone</b> (LDN) may provide symptomatic improvement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Naltrexone</b> {{should not}} be used by persons with acute {{hepatitis}} or liver failure, or those with recent opioid use (typically 7–10 days).|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} {{medications}} {{used to help}} prevent a return to drinking: disulfiram, <b>naltrexone,</b> and acamprosate. They are used after withdrawal has occurred.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{medications}} including opioid antagonists such as <b>naltrexone</b> {{have been}} shown to be effective in the treatment of alcoholism, although research has not yet demonstrated long-term efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Extended-release depot {{injections}} of <b>naltrexone,</b> administered once per month, have proven somewhat effective in treating opioid abuse, {{an approach that}} avoids the compliance issue that arises with oral formulations.|$|E
25|$|A {{pilot study}} found that Low-dose <b>naltrexone,</b> a very {{inexpensive}} drug, helped patients with active Crohn's disease. In the study, 89% of patients exhibited a response to therapy, and 67% achieved remission within four weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} side effects {{reported}} with <b>naltrexone</b> are gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping. These adverse effects are {{analogous to the}} symptoms of opioid withdrawal, as the mu receptor blockade will increase GI motility.|$|E
25|$|In {{combination}} with samidorphan or <b>naltrexone</b> (μ-opioid receptor antagonists), buprenorphine {{is under investigation}} {{for the treatment of}} cocaine dependence, and recently demonstrated effectiveness for this indication in a large-scale (n = 302) clinical trial (at a high buprenorphine dose of 16mg but not a low dose of 4mg).|$|E
25|$|Bupropion/naltrexone is a {{combination}} drug used for weight loss in those that are either obese or overweight with some weight-related illnesses It combines low doses of bupropion and <b>naltrexone.</b> Both drugs have individually shown some evidence of effectiveness in weight loss, and the combination {{has been shown to}} have some synergistic effects on weight.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{characteristics}} of the patient group in the US, the first study was done on white patients and the next without regard for ethnicity. Anton et al. found that patients of African descent did not have much success with <b>naltrexone</b> in treatment for alcohol dependence because of lacking the relevant gene.|$|E
25|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using opiate antagonists such as <b>naltrexone</b> to treat alcoholism. The patient takes the {{medication}} about an hour (and only then) before drinking to avoid side effects that arise from chronic use. The opioid antagonist blocks the positive reinforcement effects of alcohol and allows the person to stop or reduce drinking.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{have been approved}} {{for the treatment of}} substance abuse. These include replacement therapies such as buprenorphine and methadone as well as antagonist medications like disulfiram and <b>naltrexone</b> in either short acting, or the newer long acting form. Several other medications, often ones originally used in other contexts, have also been shown to be effective including bupropion and modafinil. Methadone and buprenorphine are sometimes used to treat opiate addiction. These drugs are used as substitutes for other opioids and still cause withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Nalbuphine is a semi-synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist {{analgesic}} of the phenanthrene series. It is chemically {{related to the}} widely used opioid antagonists, naloxone and <b>naltrexone,</b> and the potent opioid analgesic, oxymorphone. It is available in two concentrations, 10mg and 20mg of nalbuphine hydrochloride per mL. Both strengths contain 0.94% sodium citrate hydrous, 1.26% citric acid anhydrous, 0.1% sodium metabisulfite, and 0.2% of a 9:1 mixture of methylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives; pH is adjusted, if necessary, with hydrochloric acid. The 10mg/mL strength contains 0.1% sodium chloride.|$|E
25|$|Both {{analgesia}} {{and drug}} addiction are {{functions of the}} mu opioid receptor, the class of opioid receptor first identified as responsive to morphine. Tolerance {{is associated with the}} superactivation of the receptor, which may be affected by the degree of endocytosis caused by the opioid administered, and leads to a superactivation of cyclic AMP signaling. Long-term use of morphine in palliative care and the management of chronic pain always entails a risk that the patient develops tolerance or physical dependence. There are many kinds of rehabilitation treatment, including pharmacologically based treatments with <b>naltrexone,</b> methadone, or ibogaine.|$|E
25|$|Activation of {{both the}} GHB {{receptor}} and GABA(B) {{is responsible for the}} addictive profile of GHB. GHB's effect on dopamine release is biphasic. Low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor. Higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via GABA(B) receptors as do other GABA(B) agonists such as baclofen and phenibut. After an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor. Both the inhibition and increase of dopamine release by GHB are inhibited by opioid antagonists such as naloxone and <b>naltrexone.</b> Dynorphin {{may play a role in}} the inhibition of dopamine release via kappa opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|The structure-activity {{relationship}} of morphine {{has been extensively}} studied. As {{a result of the}} extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength of morphine) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including naloxone (Narcan), <b>naltrexone</b> (Trexan), diprenorphine (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and nalorphine (Nalline). Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine. The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like apomorphine are devoid of narcotic effects.|$|E
25|$|Aside from antipsychotics, {{there is}} scant {{reliable}} research {{about the effectiveness}} or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Results of the handful of randomized controlled trials that have been performed suggest that risperidone, the SSRI fluvoxamine, and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol may be effective in reducing some behaviors, that haloperidol {{may be more effective}} than the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, and that the opioid antagonist <b>naltrexone</b> hydrochloride is not effective. In small studies, memantine has been shown to significantly improve language function and social behavior in children with autism. Research is underway on the effects of memantine in adults with autism spectrum disorders. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications and the medications can have adverse side effects.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{is quickly}} {{hydrolysed}} {{in the liver}} to pethidinic acid and is also demethylated to norpethidine, which has half the analgesic activity of pethidine but a longer elimination half-life (8–12 hours); accumulating with regular administration, or in renal failure. Norpethidine is toxic and has convulsant and hallucinogenic effects. The toxic effects mediated by the metabolites cannot be countered with opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxone or <b>naltrexone,</b> and are probably primarily due to norpethidine's anticholinergic activity probably due to its structural similarity to atropine, though its pharmacology has not been thoroughly explored. The neurotoxicity of pethidine's metabolites is a unique feature of pethidine compared to other opioids. Pethidine's metabolites are further conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted into the urine.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{capsules}} can be {{dried and}} used for decorations, but they also contain morphine, codeine, and other alkaloids. These pods can be boiled in water to produce a bitter tea that induces a long-lasting intoxication (See Poppy tea). If allowed to mature, poppy pods (poppy straw) can be crushed and used to produce lower quantities of morphinans. In poppies subjected to mutagenesis and selection on a mass scale, researchers {{have been able to}} use poppy straw to obtain large quantities of oripavine, a precursor to opioids and antagonists such as <b>naltrexone.</b> Although millennia older, the production of poppy head decoctions {{can be seen as a}} quick and dirty variant of the Kábáy poppy straw process, which since its publication in 1930 has become the major method of obtaining licit opium alkaloids worldwide, as discussed under the Wikipedia Morphine article.|$|E
25|$|Opioid effects (adverse or otherwise) can be {{reversed}} with an opioid antagonist such as naloxone or <b>naltrexone.</b> These competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists {{but do not}} activate the receptors. This displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. However, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter {{than that of the}} opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. In patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. This is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. An infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. Opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. However, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.|$|E
