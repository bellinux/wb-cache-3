50|$|Attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio (ACR) is a {{parameter}} that {{is measured}} when testing a communication link, {{which represents the}} overall performance of the cable. ACR is a mathematical formula that calculates the ratio of attenuation to <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> for each combination of cable pairs. ACR is expressed as a figure in decibels (dB), between the signal attenuation produced by a wire or cable transmission medium and the <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> (NEXT). In order for a signal to be received with an acceptable bit error rate, the attenuation and the crosstalk must both be minimized. Crosstalk can be reduced by ensuring that twisted-pair wiring is tightly twisted and is not crushed, and by ensuring that connectors between wire and cable media are properly rated and installed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Near-End</b> <b>Crosstalk</b> (NEXT) is {{an error}} {{condition}} {{that describes the}} occurrence of a signal from one wire pair radiating to and interfering with the signal of another wire pair. It is the difference in amplitude (in dB) between a transmitted signal and the crosstalk received on other cable pairs at the same end of the cabling. Higher NEXT values correspond to better cabling performance. A higher value is desirable as it would indicate that the power transmitted is greater in magnitude than the power induced onto another wire pair given that the NEXT measurement is simply a difference calculation. NEXT must be measured from each pair to each other pair in twisted pair cabling and from {{each end of the}} connection. NEXT is measured 30 meters (about 98 feet) from the injector / generator. Higher near end crosstalk values correspond to higher overall circuit performance. Low NEXT values on a UTP LAN that will be using an older signaling standard (IEEE 802.3i and earlier) are particularly detrimental.It could be an indication of improper termination.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Frequency {{and time}} domain models are {{developed}} for backplane (BP), {{printed circuit board}} (PCB), and silicon interposer (SI) links using six-port transfer matrices (ABCD matrices) for bumps, vias and connectors, and coupled multicon-ductor transmission lines for traces. The six-port transfer matrix approach enables easy computation of the transfer function, as well as <b>near-end</b> and far-end <b>crosstalk.</b> The intersymbol interference is accounted for by computing the pulse response for the worst case bit pattern. Furthermore, the models developed here are used to optimize the data-rate and trace width {{for each of the}} links, so that the aggregate bandwidth obtained per joule of energy supplied to the link is maximized. The modeling and optimization approach developed here serves as a good platform to compare the air-gap interconnects against BP, PCB, and SI interconnects on lossy dielectrics. It is shown that air-gap interconnects can provide an aggregate bandwidth improvement of 3 ×– 4 × for BP links at a comparable energy per bit, and a 5 ×– 9 × improvement in aggregate bandwidth of PCB links at the expense of 20 % higher energy per bit. For SI links, air-gap interconnects are shown to provide a 2 ×– 3 × improvement in aggregate bandwidth and a 1 ×– 1. 5 × improvement in energy per bit.

40|$|Abstract—Crosstalk {{reduction}} is analyzed for a reconfigured category-five cable network using electromagnetic topology-based simulation. The reconfigured network {{results in a}} marked reduction in inductive <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> for the unshielded twisted-pair cable network. Analyses show that half-loop shifting of the generator-pair wires placed next to the receptor {{is the most effective}} way to control the <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> level. This is primarily due to additional coupling sources induced on receptor wires that effectively deactivate the original cross coupling effect. The analysis also reveals the usefulness of electromagnetic topology-based simulations. The technique applied in this paper is applicable for any large network systems. A sub-network compaction scheme is critical in creating the equivalent junctions that provide a significant reduction in total computational time and total computer memory requirement for analyzing large network systems.

40|$|Increasing {{data rates}} over {{electrical}} channels with significant frequency-dependent loss is difficult due to excessive inter-symbol interference (ISI). In {{order to achieve}} sufficient link margins at high rates, I/O system designers implement equalization in the transmitters and are motivated to consider more spectrally-efficient modulation formats relative to the common PAM- 2 scheme, such as PAM- 4 and duobinary. The first work, reviews when to consider PAM- 4 and duobinary formats, as the modulation scheme which yields the highest system margins at a given data rate {{is a function of}} the channel loss profile, and presents a 20 Gb/s triple-mode transmitter capable of efficiently implementing these three modulation schemes and three-tap feedforward equalization. A statistical link modeling tool, which models ISI, crosstalk, random noise, and timing jitter, is developed to compare the three common modulation formats operating on electrical backplane channel models. In order to improve duobinary modulation efficiency, a low-power quarter-rate duobinary precoder circuit is proposed which provides significant timing margin improvement relative to full-rate precoders. Also as serial I/O data rates scale above 10 Gb/s, crosstalk between neighboring channels degrades system bit-error rate (BER) performance. The next work presents receive-side circuitry which merges the cancellation of both <b>near-end</b> and far-end <b>crosstalk</b> (NEXT/FEXT) and can automatically adapt to different channel environments and variations in process, voltage, and temperature.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{primary goal}} of this thesis is to {{fabricate}} a magnetic film between the coplanar transmitted stripline for crosstalk suppression. Crosstalk is caused from undesired inductive and capacitive coupling of signals between two conductors. The effective crosstalk suppression results from the inductive coupling of circuit elements through the lossy properties of magnetic material during ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). Several techniques were used to fabricate ferrite films, including ferrite plating, screen printing, and pressure die casting. Ferrite plating produce nanostructured zinc iron oxide (ZnFe₂O₄) films with lower crystallinity and do not exhibit cross talk suppression. Interesting, the films show a higher roughness with increasing film thickness. The contact angle measurement indicates the films changing from hydrophobic to hydrophilic with increasing film thickness. Screen printing was used to fabricate yttrium iron garnet (Y₃Fe₅O₁₂) films to replace ferrite plating zinc ferrite films, because of the magnetic properties of yttrium iron garnet film. The results show that screen-printed films can achieve far-end crosstalk suppression by 10 12 dB, however, no suppression effect for <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk.</b> It is believed that the polymeric binder caused the problem. A pressure die casting technique was used to fabricate the yttrium iron garnet films. These films achieve the far-end crosstalk by 22 dB and the <b>near-end</b> <b>crosstalk</b> by 8 dB at higher frequency 3. 75 GHz. For G- 113 and TTVG- 1600 screen-printed films, the resonant frequency occurs at about 0. 75 GHz.

30|$|In {{a digital}} {{subscriber}} line (DSL) system with strong crosstalk, the detection and cancellation of interference signals {{have the potential to}} improve the overall data rate performance. However, as DSL crosstalk channels are highly frequency selective and multiuser detection is suitable only when crosstalk is strong, the set of frequency tones in which multiuser detection may be used must be carefully chosen. Further, this problem of tone selection is highly coupled with the transmit power spectra of both direct and interfering signals, so the optimal solution requires the tone selection problem to be solved jointly with the multiuser spectrum optimization problem. The main idea of this paper is that the above joint optimization may be done efficiently using a dual decomposition technique {{similar to that of the}} optimal spectrum balancing algorithm. Simulations show that multiuser detection can increase the bit rate performance in a remotely deployed ADSL environment.
