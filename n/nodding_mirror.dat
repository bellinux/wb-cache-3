40|$|One {{criterion}} of image quality is its geometric similarity {{to the control}} test. The ability of television, phototelevision, phototelegraphic, and other systems to transmit geometrically similar images {{is characterized by the}} geometric distortion coefficient. Linear distortions result from the inaccuracy of scanning mechanism element assembly, and distortions can be minimized during adjustment operations or may be easily compensated during image reception. Brief descriptions are given of the possible sources of nonlinear distortions which arise in these devices due to the scanning mechanism, objective distortion, or the <b>nodding</b> <b>mirror...</b>|$|E
50|$|The basic {{spectrohelioscope}} is {{a complex}} machine that uses a spectroscope to scan {{the surface of the}} sun. The image from the objective lens is focused on a narrow slit revealing only a thin portion of the suns surface. The light is then passed through a prism or diffraction grating to spread the light into a spectrum. The spectrum is then focused on another slit that allows only a narrow part of the spectrum (the desired wavelength of light for viewing) to pass. The light is finally focused on an eyepiece so the surface of the Sun can be seen. The view, however, would be only a narrow strip of the Sun's surface. The slits are moved in unison to scan across the whole surface of the sun giving a full image. Independently <b>nodding</b> <b>mirrors</b> can be used instead of moving slits to produce the same scan: the first mirror selects a slice of the sun, the second selects the desired wavelength.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{technical}} subjects {{need to be}} solved before planetary rover navigation could {{be a part of}} future missions. The sensors which will perceive terrain environment around the rover will require critical development efforts. The image laser range finder (ILRF) discussed here is one of the candidate sensors because of its advantage in providing range data required for its navigation. The authors developed a new compact-sized ILRF which is a quarter of the size of conventional ones. Instead of the current two directional scanning system which is comprised of <b>nodding</b> and polygon <b>mirrors,</b> the new ILRF is equipped with the new concept of a direct polygon mirror driving system, which successfully made its size compact to accommodate the design requirements. The paper reports on the design concept and preliminary technical specifications established in the current development phase...|$|R
