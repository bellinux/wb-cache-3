40|$|AbstractIn Germany, diamond {{grinding}} {{is frequently}} {{used to improve}} the evenness and skid resistance of concrete pavement surfaces. Since diamond grinding has been observed to affect tyre/pavement <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> favourably, the relationship among surface texture, concrete composition and <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> of concrete pavement surfaces has been systematically investigated. The simulation program SPERoN was used in a parameter study to investigate the main factors which affect <b>noise</b> <b>emission.</b> Based {{on the results of}} the simulations, textured concrete surfaces were produced by using a laboratory grinding machine. As well as the composition of the concrete, the thickness and spacing of the diamond blades were varied. The ability of the textured surfaces to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> was assessed from the texture characteristics and air flow resistance of textured surfaces measured in the laboratory. It was found that concrete composition and, in particular, the spacing of the blades affected the reduction in <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> considerably. The <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> behaviour of numerous road sections was also considered in field investigations. The pavement surfaces had been textured by diamond grinding during the last years or decades. The results show that diamond grinding is able to provide good, durable noise-reducing properties. Several new pavement sections were investigated using thicknesses and spacings of the blades similar to those used in the laboratory to optimize <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> reduction. It is concluded that diamond grinding is a good alternative to exposed aggregate concrete for the production of low-noise pavement surfaces...|$|R

40|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>emission</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{concerns}} in wind turbine industry and especially for small scale wind turbines, which are mostly erected to the urban areas; the concern is turning into a problem. This paper focuses on the optimization of six airfoils which are widely used on small scale wind turbines in terms of the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> and performance criteria and the numerical computations are performed for a typical 10 kW wind turbine. The main purpose of this optimization process is to decrease the <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> levels while increasing the aerodynamic performance of a small scale wind turbine by adjusting the shape of the airfoil. The sources of the broadband <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> are defined and their dominancy is investigated with respect to the operating conditions. While redesigning, together with the principals of reducing the airfoil self-noise, the aerodynamic prospects of increasing the performance have been taken into account. The codes which are based on aero-acoustic empirical models and a collection of well-known aerodynamic functions are used in this study. The results obtained from the numerical analysis of the optimization process have shown that, the considered commercial airfoils for small scale wind turbines are improved in terms of aero-acoustics and aerodynamics. The pressure sides of the baseline airfoils have been manipulated together with the trailing edge and redesigned airfoils have lower levels of <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> and higher lift to drag ratios. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Several components {{contribute to the}} <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> of a pump, e. g. pressure pulsations originating from the hydraulics or electromagnetic forces in the electrical drive. In {{order to reduce the}} <b>noise</b> <b>emission,</b> it is necessary to identify the share of each source in the overall noise level. This can be achieved by vibration measurements and spectral analysis on the pump and appropriate models of the underlying noise-generating processes. In this paper, the most important noise sources in centrifugal pumps and their electrical drives will be explained. The effect of these sources will be illustrated by measurement results of structure- and fluid-borne sound power. Possible remedies and their effect on noise reduction will be discussed...|$|R
