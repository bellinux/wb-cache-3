50|$|A {{mobility}} shift assay is electrophoretic {{separation of}} a protein-DNA or protein-RNA mixture on a polyacrylamide or agarose gel {{for a short}} period (about 1.5-2 hr for a 15- to 20-cm gel). The speed at which different molecules (and combinations thereof) move through the gel is determined by their size and charge, and to a lesser extent, their shape (see gel electrophoresis). The control lane (DNA probe without protein present) will contain a single band corresponding to the unbound DNA or RNA fragment. However, assuming that the protein is capable of binding to the fragment, the lane with protein present will contain another band that represents the larger, less mobile complex of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>probe</b> bound to protein which is 'shifted' up on the gel (since it has moved more slowly).|$|E

40|$|Four {{strains of}} Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii {{originating}} from Eucalyptus camaldulensis, three from Australia {{and one from}} San Francisco, were tested for their serotype, virulence for mice, {{and a number of}} genetic and molecular characteristics.

Electrophoretic karyotypes of the strains from Australia were identical, although they were collected from sites at least 15 to 500 km apart. The electrophoretic karyotype of the strain from San Francisco was {{the same as that of}} the Australian isolates except for the mobility of one chromosome. On the contrary, no two isolates of serotype B (of a total of 11) from clinical sources were the same, regardless of their geographic origin. Furthermore, none of the clinical isolates showed a chromosomal banding pattern identical to that of Eucalyptus-originated strains. The Eucalyptus-originated strains failed to form dikaryons when crossed with the tester strains of the two varieties of F. neoformans. Hybridization analysis with a <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>probe</b> (AccuProbe C. neoformans Culture Confirmation Test; Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, Calif.), however, showed signals of equal intensity for clinical strains and the Eucalyptus-originated strains.

40|$|Microbial sub {{populations in}} field and {{laboratory}} {{studies have been}} shown to display high heterogeneity in morphological and physiological parameters. Determining the real time state of a microbial cell goes beyond live or dead categories, as microbes can exist in a dormant state, whereby cell division and metabolic activities are reduced. Given the need for detection and quantification of microbes, flow cytometry (FCM) with molecular probes provides a rapid and accurate method to help determine overall population viability. By using SYTOX Green and SYTOX Orange in the model cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa to detect membrane integrity, we develop a transferable method for rapid indication of single cell mortality. The molecular probes used within this journal will be referred to as green or orange nucleic acid probes respectively (although there are other products with similar excitation and emission wavelengths that have a comparable modes of action, we specifically refer to the fore mentioned probes). Protocols using molecular probes vary between species, differing principally in concentration and incubation times. Following this protocol set out on M. aeruginosa the green <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>probe</b> was optimized at concentrations of 0. 5 μM after 30 min of incubation and the orange <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>probe</b> at 1 μM after 10 min.

Conversely, 5 μM concentrations and higher in both probes exhibited a type of non-specific staining, whereby 'live' cells produced a target fluorescence, leading to an over representation of 'non-viable' cell numbers. The positive controls (heat killed) provided testable dead biomass, although the appropriateness of control generation remains subject to debate.
