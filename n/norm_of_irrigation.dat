Application of drop technology promoted decrease in consumption of irrigating water for 35. 8 % on potatoes and 39. 0 %- on a tomato. Among vegetable cultures the best indicator is noted in experiences with a cucumber – 47. 4 %. On a white cabbage the economy <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water was minimum (30. 3 %) percentagewise, but the water volume 3 (1720 m /ha) rather high. The cabbage is hygrophilous vegetable culture, it consumes a lot of water, it explains big consumption <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water and smaller percent of economy. On bulb onion which is also exacting to an irrigation mode, 33. 6 % of water resources are saved. At the accounting <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water consumption there were also considered the expenditure of water on formation of an additional crop of cultures. It is established that when using drop technology efficiency of potatoes and vegetable cultures considerably increases. Intensive development and formation of a powerful biomass of plants is noted.

The economic values <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water vary from one governorate to the other even in the same region (lower, middle, and upper Egypt). In the same region the variation in economic value <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water is due to the variations in the costs and revenue of the crop production and not to the variation in the quantity <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water. While, in different regions the variation in economic value <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water <b>of</b> the crop is due to the variations in the costs and revenue of the crop production and the quantity <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water.

The characteristics <b>of</b> overhead <b>irrigation</b> {{with a tray}} collecting runoff water (combination <b>of</b> overhead <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation) were investigated at the same time. Irrigation usage (the amount of water supplied per pot / amount <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water) with a combination <b>of</b> overhead <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was improved compared to overhead irrigation alone. The growth of garden type Cyclamen grown under a combination <b>of</b> both overhead <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was significantly greater than that grown in either wick irrigation, ebb & flow irrigation or overhead irrigation. Notably, smaller growth was achiered in garden type cyclamen grown with overhead <b>irrigation.</b> The growth <b>of</b> Vinca grown in a combination <b>of</b> overhead <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation was significantly greater than that grown with overhead irrigation alone.

However, the growth of Pansy grown under overhead irrigation was significantly greater than that grown in a combination <b>of</b> overhead <b>irrigation</b> and subirrigation.

Five treatments <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water with average salinity levels of 1. 6, 3. 9, 6. 3, 8. 6, and 10. 9 dS/m were designed. For each treatment, 7 mm water was applied when the soil matric potential (SMP) 0. 2 m directly underneath the drip emitters was below - 20 kPa, except during the seedling stage. To ensure the seedling survival, 28 mm water was applied after sowing during the seedling stage. Results indicate that amount of applied water decreases as salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water increases. The emergence will be delayed when the salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water is higher than 6. 3 dS/m, but these differences will be alleviated if there is rainfall during emergence period. The final emergence percentage is not changed when salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> is less than 6. 3 dS/m, and the percentage decreases by 2. 0 % for every 1 dS/m increase when the salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water is above 6. 3 dS/m, but the decreasing rate will be reduced if there is rainfall. The plant height and yield decrease with the increase <b>of</b> salinity <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water. The height of plants decreases by 0. 6 - 1. 0 % for every 1 dS/m increase in salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water. The yield decreases by 1. 8 % for every 1 dS/m increase in salinity level <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water, and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) increases with increase in salinity <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water. The soil salinity increases as the salinity <b>of</b> <b>irrigation</b> water increasing after drip irrigation with saline water in the beginning, but the soil salinity in soil profile from 0 to 120 cm depths can be maintained in a stable level in subsequent year irrigation with saline water.
