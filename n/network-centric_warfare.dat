5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for <b>network-centric</b> <b>warfare,</b> and improved situation awareness.|$|E

Telemetry is particularly vital in Air Force Flight Test and Evaluation. As such, this paper has a specific emphasis and provides discussion within this domain.

40|$|Engineering of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) {{requires}} {{one to take}} {{a holistic}} approach that includes the physical modeling {{and analysis of the}} missile defense operating environment, development of metrics and techniques to analyze the communication requirements of the net-centric Ballistic Missile Defense warfare, and the use of architectural patterns and other software technologies to shape the emergent behavior of the BMDS taking into account of the system's interoperability, composability, extensibility, and dynamic reconfigurability. This report summarizes the work in FY 07 to investigate new technologies to support the development of the BMDS. We developed new scoring functions for the fusion of sensor data, an algorithm for multiple hypothesis tracking, a distributed medium access control protocol and data dissemination algorithm for wireless networks of cooperative radar systems, simulation models for <b>network-centric</b> electronic <b>warfare</b> metrics study and for the prediction of the over the horizon radar system footprints, technologies for the correct specification and validation of temporal behaviors in a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) based system-of-systems, runtime verification of system-level requirements of distributed reactive systems using MSC-Assertions, and safety assurance of reconfigurable and selfreconfigurable systems. We also evaluated the effectiveness of the real-time Java technology for BMDS software and the potential impact of integrating the Air Force YAL- 1 A Attack Laser into the BMDS...|$|R
25|$|Kamov Ka-25, Kamov Ka-28, and the Kamov Ka-31: The Ka-25 was {{acquired}} by the Indian Navy in 1980 for anti-submarine warfare, but had severe technological limitations. The Ka-28s were acquired in the mid-80s, and {{were said to be}} a quantum leap over their predecessors from an ASW standpoint.

25|$|Reports {{surfaced}} in March 2011 that NASA 926 was observed performing flights from Nellis AFB testing a new sensor package being carried in its pallet system payload bay {{over the period}} of 15 November 2011 until 1 February 2012. Although {{the reason for the}} deployment to the Nellis Test and Training Ranges (NTTR) was unknown, it was linked to testing sensors within the NTTR. Since both NASA 926 and 928 have carried BACN (Battlefield Airborne Communications Node) payloads in Afghanistan performing <b>network-centric</b> <b>warfare</b> missions, it was speculated that the Canberra was testing new sensors and antennas used by BACN to relay communications between command and control centers and ground troops located within valleys and ridges in the Afghanistan mountains.|$|E

40|$|Reuse {{has been}} very {{difficult}} {{or in some cases}} impossible in the Modeling and Simulation (M&S) discipline. This paper focuses on how reuse can be accomplished by using a conceptual model (CM) in a community of interest (COI). We address the issue of reuse in a multifaceted manner covering many areas (types) of M&S such as discrete, continuous, Monte Carlo, system dynamics, gamingbased, and agent-based. M&S is commonly employed and reuse is critically needed by many COIs such as air traffic control, automobile manufacturing, ballistic missile defense, business process reengineering, emergency response management, military training, <b>network-centric</b> operations and <b>warfare,</b> supply chain management, telecommunications, and transportation. We present how a CM developed for a COI can assist in reuse for the design of any type of large-scale complex M&S application in that COI. A CM becomes an asset for a COI and offers significant economic benefits through its effective reuse...|$|R
40|$|Information, and the {{knowledge}} gained from it, has been the key component to strategic planning since the earliest combat operations. Success in the Information Age {{is defined by the}} military's ability to communicate effectively in a dynamic environment and share relevant information seamlessly. Sharing information is a critical element to understanding missions that employ the operational concept of <b>Network-Centric</b> Operations and <b>Warfare</b> (NCOW). Discovering valuable information is vital towards our capacity to predict and/or prevent circumstances in our current war against terrorist organizations. This thesis describes fundamental concepts of information sharing and information discovery. Through the use of a systems engineering approach, this thesis created a common vision of an information sharing and discovery (ISD) system, evaluates the role of ISD in network-centric systems (NCS), and discusses the relationship of NCS to NCOW. This study also employs the system architecture method to establish the operational concept of ISD systemsderive requirements for future acquisitions of ISD systemsanalyze the interactions that ISD systems have with external systemsand establish a functional architecture for the ISD system. This research approach provides guidance for the development and integration of future ISD systems {{in order to meet the}} needs of future DoD NCS. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
2500|$|Current {{military}} explorations into swarming {{address the}} spectrum of military operations, from strategic through tactical. An expert group evaluated swarming's role in the [...] "revolution in military affairs" [...] or force transformation. They observed that military swarming is primarily tactical, sometimes operational and rarely strategic, and is a complement to other efforts rather than a replacement for them. Swarming is a logical extension of <b>network-centric</b> <b>warfare,</b> but the networks needed to make swarming routine will be available around 2010-2011. At present, the networking for swarming is only available in specific contexts.|$|E
