25|$|Energy {{varies with}} temperature, density, {{collision}} speed and fuel. To reach <b>net</b> <b>power</b> production, reactions must occur rapidly {{enough to make}} up for energy losses. Plasma clouds lose energy through conduction and radiation. Conduction is when ions, electrons or neutrals touch a surface and escape. Energy is lost with the particle. Radiation is when energy escapes as light. Radiation increases with temperature. To get <b>net</b> <b>power</b> from fusion, these losses must be overcome. This leads to an equation for power output.|$|E

25|$|Fusor: This method uses an {{electric}} field to heat ions to fusion conditions. The machine typically uses two spherical cages, a cathode inside the anode, inside a vacuum. These machines {{are not considered}} a viable approach to <b>net</b> <b>power</b> because of their high conduction and radiation losses. They are simple enough to build that amateurs have fused atoms using them.|$|E
25|$|A locomotive's {{control system}} is {{designed}} so that the main generator electrical power output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, {{as well as the}} way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the <b>net</b> <b>power</b> produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (see power curve graph for notch 8).|$|E
25|$|By contrast, Bussard {{argued that}} the plasma had a {{different}} structure, temperature distribution and well profile. These characteristics have not been fully measured and {{are central to the}} device's feasibility. Bussard's calculations indicated that the bremsstrahlung losses would be much smaller. According to Bussard the high speed and therefore low cross section for Coulomb collisions of the ions in the core makes thermalizing collisions very unlikely, while the low speed at the rim means that thermalization there has almost no impact on ion velocity in the core. Bussard calculated that a polywell reactor with a radius of 1.5 meters would produce <b>net</b> <b>power</b> fusing deuterium.|$|E

25|$|In principle, {{gasification}} {{can proceed}} from {{just about any}} organic material, including biomass and plastic waste. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it {{may be used for}} power production in gas engines, gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the Fischer–Tropsch process. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the <b>net</b> <b>power</b> production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 paper {{demonstrated}} that a dense plasma focus had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees Celsius, sufficient for boron fusion, and that fusion reactions were occurring primarily within the contained plasmoid, {{a necessary condition}} for <b>net</b> <b>power.</b> The focus consists of two coaxial cylindrical electrodes made from copper or beryllium and housed in a vacuum chamber containing a low-pressure fusible gas. An electrical pulse is applied across the electrodes, heating the gas into a plasma. The current forms into a minuscule vortex along the axis of the machine, which then kinks into a cage of current with an associated magnetic field. The cage of current and magnetic-field-entrapped plasma is called a plasmoid. The acceleration of the electrons about the magnetic field lines heats the nuclei within the plasmoid to fusion temperatures.|$|E
25|$|As ZETA {{continued}} to generate positive results, plans {{were made to}} build a follow-on machine. The new design was announced in May; ZETA II would be a significantly larger US$14million machine whose explicit goal would be to reach 100million K, and generate <b>net</b> <b>power.</b> This announcement gathered praise even in the US; The New York Times ran {{a story about the}} new version. Machines similar to ZETA were being announced around the world; Osaka University announced their pinch machine was even more successful than ZETA, the Aldermaston team announced positive results from their Sceptre machine costing only US$28,000, and a new reactor was built in Uppsala University that was presented publicly later that year. The Efremov Institute in Leningrad began construction of a smaller version of ZETA, although still larger than most, known as Alpha.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND : To achieve good performance, taekwondo athletes should {{optimize}} the stance {{position of the}} foot on the ground. OBJECTIVE : The {{aim of this study}} is to compare generated <b>net</b> joint <b>power</b> (hip, knee and ankle) during stance phase, magnitude of peak foot velocity of the attacking lower extremity and execution stance time produced from three stance positions (forward " 0 °", diagonal " 45 °", orthogonal " 90 °") in the taekwondo roundhouse kick. METHODS : Ten taekwondo athletes participated in the study; their experience of practicing taekwondo ranged between 13. 8 ± 5. 8 years. The kinetics and kinematics of the athletes’ movement during the roundhouse kick were recorded. The execution stance time and the magnitude of peak foot velocity were determined. The <b>net</b> joint <b>power</b> of the kicking lower extremity during the stance phase was calculated using the inverse dynamics method. Then the peak <b>net</b> joint <b>power</b> was determined. RESULTS : The analysis of variance for repeated measures showed that there is a significant main effect of the stance position on the peak <b>net</b> hip joint <b>power</b> in the three planes. In addition, the stance position does not affect the magnitude of the peak foot velocity of the kicking lower extremity and execution stance time. CONCLUSIONS : The necessity to produce a higher <b>net</b> hip joint <b>power</b> in the stance phase of the roundhouse kick from the position when the feet are placed orthogonal to the target of the kick, compared with the execution of the kick from the forward or diagonal position, must be taken into account for purposes of rationalizing strength training of taekwondo athletes or for selecting the technique of the roundhouse kick...|$|R
