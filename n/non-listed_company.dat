40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{elaborate}} on how subject positions promoting shareholder value are infused with an outcome focus. Design/methodology/approach – The study employs Foucault's perspectives on government and the interrelations between objectivity and subjectivity {{in the analysis of}} in-depth case data gathered in one shareholder value-oriented-listed company and one <b>non-listed</b> <b>company.</b> Findings – The outside financial market discipline that objectifies shareholder value-oriented company executives makes them subjects in their own organisation, allowing them to redirect discipline onwards and thereby objectify their subordinates. The <b>non-listed</b> <b>company</b> executives, due to the relatively closed governance structure of their company and the lack of outside ownership, are not subject to such continuous outside discipline; they lack the same access to the means to create tangible outcomes within their organisations. The subject positions promoting shareholder value are focused on outcomes, whereas the <b>non-listed</b> <b>company</b> subject positions are focused on processes. Research limitations/implications – The subject positions of actors within different types of non-listed companies and listed companies without a shareholder focus form a target for future studies. Originality/value – The study contributes to the literatures on manager subject position formation and shareholder value. These contributions are achieved by uncovering a novel consequence of subject position formation and by revealing a mechanism by which outcome focus is tied with shareholder value.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation examines managerial myopia and subject positions in companies with different governance structures. The study investigates how {{the use of}} time models is potentially related to myopia and how organisational controls {{are tied to the}} potential for myopia through time models. The time models, researched in the dissertation, are socially constructed mental models on time; more specifically, models that managers construct and use in order to function simultaneously in three periods, the past, the present, and the future. In addition, the study investigates how subject positions, with regard to action/inaction, differ between executives in a listed company and a nonlisted company. The data consists of 42 interviews and archival data gathered in three companies in the financial services industry in Finland; one shareholder value oriented listed company, one mutual company and one coalition of independent savings banks. The dissertation consists of four essays. The first essay covers a general introduction to time models in a Foucauldian framework. The second essay, with the assistance of time models, extends towards solving the paradox of the twofold nature (short and long term orientation) of share price. The third essay explores how organisational controls (exemplified by company culture, share price, and the Balanced Scorecard) are tied to myopia and assist in influencing myopia, through time models. The fourth essay compares subject positions in a listed and <b>non-listed</b> <b>company,</b> partly explaining the time models presented in earlier essays. The findings of the study are as follows. Shareholder value oriented, listed company executives focus on a present-based time model, and the form of rationality associated with it, whereby present efficiency and effectiveness are experienced as the base for future success; the model reflects thinking that is directed from the present towards the future. The time models of the actors in the <b>non-listed</b> <b>company</b> are found to be more flexible and variant than those of listed company executives. In non-listed companies, executives and managers construct and follow past-, present-, and/or futurebased time models and their associated rationalities. In the past-based model, it is assumed that the past is the base on which it is possible to build the present and/or the future (thinking is directed from the past towards the present and/or the future). In the future-based model, it is considered that future plans are the base on which present actions should be determined (thinking is directed from the future back and towards the present). Subject positions in a listed company are tied to present action, unlike those in a <b>non-listed</b> <b>company,</b> which are tied to inaction. The emphasis on action explains the wide popularity and diffusion of shareholder value. Building on the extant literature, myopia is redefined to be a disproportionate concern for business matters which do not contribute to the long-term success of the focal company; it is revealed to be represented as an excessive focus on a given time base, without the orientation away from it, albeit implied as necessary by time models. In this regard, the listed shareholder value oriented company myopia presents itself as an excessive focus on action at present inside the present-based model. <b>Non-listed</b> <b>company</b> myopia is related to an extensive focus on the future or the past, in addition to the present, and a potential focus on inaction whenever present action would be in the longterm interests of the focal actors. Organisational control systems that focus on only one measure tend to highlight the myopic tendencies of that measure. In this regard, share price is shown to be connected with the present-based time model and reinforce its potential myopic tendencies. The paradox of simultaneous short and long time orientation of share price that has been revealed by the previous literature is partly resolved; share price is shown to be constructed as long-term by company executives and as short-term by outsiders who criticise the present-based time model. In the study, company culture is shown to be tied to the past-based time model, and the Balanced Scorecard, along with cybernetic systems more generally, to the future-based time model. In order to decrease myopia, organisational control systems need to be balanced, and designed according to the relevant context...|$|E
40|$|In {{acquisitions}} {{of private}} companies, the valuation {{of a private}} target is the financial analytical skills that general managers may want to learn and understand more than any other. Rather than rely entirely on financial specialists, managers {{would like to know}} how to do it themselves for two reasons. First, understanding valuation is critical for successful acquisition by not overpaying beyond synergy potential. Second, it has become a prerequisite for meaningful participation in a company's resource-allocation decisions. This paper introduces assets-, market-, and cash flow- based valuation methods for a <b>non-listed</b> <b>company</b> and applies them to the case of Miele Korea. Miele & Cie, KG, a global home appliances manufacturer headquartered in German, has intended in 2005 to enter into the Korean market by acquiring a subsidiary of Ssangyong Corporation, Komie Ltd., an exclusive distributor of Miele products in Korea.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} firm {{valuation}} for tax purposes of <b>non-listed</b> <b>company</b> shares and its sensitivity towards different market conditions. Since {{the value of}} a private company cannot be observed on the stock market the value has to be estimated. Due to uncertainty, expected future profits may not serve as a tax base. Therefore, in Germany e. g., a tax value is derived {{on the basis of a}} combination of net assets and historic profits - the so called Stuttgart Method. A Discounted Cash Flow Model, as a generally accepted method of firm valuation, is used as a proxy for the market value. In this analysis a simulation quantifies the gap between both approaches for firms of six different industries. Thereby, we find out which industries are discriminated and which are subsidized by taxation. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the value gap with regard to the relevant value drivers (cost of capital, financial structure, corporate tax rates, growth, and timing effects) is investigated. In the basic setting the value is only 31, 3 % to 92, 4 % of the market value. Thus, tax values lead to a severe undervaluation of the company. Moreover, the span of the relations shows that the firms are treated unequally. Variations show that overvaluations are also likely to be observed. These results are helpful to design a true and fair tax base. [...] firm valuation,gift tax,inheritance tax,tax value,sensitivity analysis,value gap,discounted cash flow...|$|E

Prospering in this environment have lead many companies to embark on programmes of restructuring and refocusing their companies in order to face the new challenges locally and globally. For this reason {{the purpose of this}} study is to determine if management in non-listed companies based in Gauteng have a formalised business plan in place to achieve its short-term objectives and a formalised strategy that would synergise the company's short-term objectives with its long-term vision. The reason for undertaking this research was to enable the researcher to provide an in-depth analysis of the strategic planning process used by nonlisted companies in Gauteng when in developing its business strategy in a transformational environment. The researcher relied on quantitative research techniques and the following data collection method was utilised.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the entrepreneur’s tax burden in the dual income tax system is studied. The dual system taxes income from capital at a flat rate, but earned income at progressive rates. The media view claims the entrepreneur {{to be able to}} take his pay as favourably taxed income from capital. It is shown not to be supported by the recent data nor by deductive analysis in case of start-ups when (i) proper opportunity costs of the outside employment option and (ii) the financial capital tied in the company, (iii) the constraint on the maximum dividend taxed as capital income and (iv) the obsolescence of the tax surpluses (corporation taxes on undistributed profits) in the imputation system are taken into account. Instead it is shown to be optimal for the entrepreneur to raise dividends from his start-up also as earned income. Therefore, the entrepreneur’s tax equilibrium implies tax-indifference between raising the marginal euro from his company either in the form of dividend or capital gains income. Because the latter is double-taxed, the marginal tax rate on dividends as earned income must equal the average (and marginal) tax rate on capital gains. The split-rule into capital and earned income is shown to offer a minor incentive for supplying additional entrepreneurial effort, but the system itself discriminates capital formation of start-up enterprises in contrast to old capital from the past tax regimes. Finally, it is stressed how the previous tax system was tilted towards channelling income from the <b>non-listed</b> <b>company</b> to the household sphere in the form of wages and earned income while the dual income tax system tilts such reporting incentives towards income from capital without tax avoidance...|$|E

One important contribution to the topic consists in comparing the estimates of publicly-listed and <b>non-listed</b> <b>companies.</b> As far as we know, the comparative method had not be used before. A logistic model shows that in both groups, headcount reduction occurs in less-productive and financially distressed firms, resorting to downsizing as a defensive response to an adverse economic shock.
