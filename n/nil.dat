Elgo explains to the party that he wished to use the crystals to achieve immortality, and predicted that the crystals, sensing his purpose, would split the world hoping to halt his plans. Elgo then utilized the power of <b>Nil</b> to move between the worlds and ensured that the Warriors collect the crystals in effort to restore the world so that he could achieve his goals. The Warriors and Elgo battle, with Elgo using the power of <b>Nil</b> against them. When he is defeated, Elgo loses control of <b>Nil</b> and it mutates him into a dark monster. The Warriors, seeing that <b>Nil</b> will ravage their world unchecked, fight the transformed Elgo and win. As <b>Nil</b> reverses its flow and life is returned to the world, all the Warriors flee, apart from Dusk and Alba, who are presumed dead. Soon however, they are revealed to be alive, saved by the spirits of Vata and the Mask. The game ends with the Warriors reunited, and the world and its crystal restored.|$|E
