5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} {{that this was the}} case, but Fermi was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure.</b> The only way to settle this was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June, Morris {{ordered the}} 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese {{landed in the}} Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company {{advancing}} along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move {{and most of it}} had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure,</b> and ordered Major General Arthur Allen's 7th Division to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{suggests that}} a synod, or ecclesiastical conference to discuss church affairs and rules, was held at London {{during the early years}} of the mission, possibly shortly after 603. Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon native who became a missionary to the continental Saxons, mentions such a synod being held at London. Boniface says that the synod legislated on marriage, which he discussed with Pope Gregory III in 742. Higham argues that because Augustine had asked for clarifications on the subject of marriage from Gregory the Great, it is likely that he could have held a synod to deliberate on the issue. Nicholas Brooks, another historian, is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> that there was such a synod, but does not completely rule out the possibility. He suggests it might have been that Boniface was influenced by a recent reading of Bede's work.|$|E

25|$|In {{the hours}} after Hades and Zelena return to Storybrooke, Zelena {{goes off to}} find the others and leaves the baby with Hades. While she is gone, King Arthur, who just escaped from the jail and is being tracked down by Mary Margaret, Merida and the dwarves, stumbles upon Hades, but he kills Arthur as he sees him as a threat. Zelena finds Regina and Robin Hood and tries to {{convince}} them that Hades has changed his ways. Emma, David and Henry are reunited with Snow and Merida and explain the details of Hades' deception but Emma's vengeance against Hades is making her too emotional. Zelena and Hades are talking about the others not believing that he changed. Hades gets a weapon, known as the Olympian Crystal (Zeus's thunderbolt), which can kill anybody, even a god. He also suggests that they leave Storybrooke but Zelena is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> if she wants to. As Emma, Merida and David find Arthur's body at the Storybrooke Bridge, David tries to calm down a furious Emma, who's trying to protect Storybrooke from Hades' wrath.|$|E

A few {{commentators}} picked the Bulldogs as a possible [...] "sleeper team" [...] to make the Final Four.

500|$|After {{the death}} of Dejan, his province, except for the župe of Žegligovo and Upper Struma, was {{appropriated}} to nobleman Vlatko Paskačić, whose hereditary land was Slavište directly to the south. [...] Vukašin Mrnjavčević, of whom there are no notable mentions until 1365, became more powerful (ultimately the most powerful nobleman in Macedonia) after the deaths of Vojislav Vojinović, Dejan and despot Jovan Oliver (whose status in Macedonia was very high), as Vukašin's rise would have been unlikely during the lifetime of these men. Vukašin's younger brother Jovan Uglješa is also thought to {{have participated in the}} dismemberment of Dejan's province, as he used this chance to take the provinces which bordered on the oblast (province) of Ser (Serres). No one looked to the young sons of Dejan who would later become very important. Dejan's death benefited Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa, not so much in territorial expansion (which is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure),</b> but because Dejan's disappearance ended any stronger candidate to counter the Mrnjavčević family.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} deflects {{the romantic}} attention of fellow attending Mark Sloan, admitting that she finds him attractive but wishes {{to keep her}} private life separate from her working life. She also develops a friendship with Callie Torres which becomes temporarily strained when Callie is led to believe Hahn has romantic designs on her. Although Hahn laughs off the notion, {{she goes on to}} kiss Callie in front of Sloan, to prove that he couldn't handle a threesome with the two of them, leaving Callie stunned. In the season four finale, Callie initiates a second passionate kiss, which Hahn reciprocates. The two attempt a romantic relationship, but while Erica comes to terms with her sexuality quickly, Callie is <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> of herself, and sleeps with Mark Sloan to [...] "make sure". Erica initially forgives her, but eventually decides that she does not want a relationship with Callie while she is still so unsure about her sexuality, and so leaves her post at Seattle Grace.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was shot from May 23 to 24, 2008 on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, with {{director}} Joseph Khan. American recording artist Britney Spears filmed a cameo appearance for the video on June 4 at the Warner Bros. lot in Los Angeles. An on set [...] "insider" [...] said that Spears' scene was short, only consisting of her driving in a passing car and waving {{to the other}} girls. On June 12, 2008 it was announced by MTV News that the cameo had been cut from the final video. Scherzinger was asked why Spears got cut from the video. She said: [...] "I honestly am <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure.</b> You shoot {{a lot of things}} when you do a video. Some things stay in but other things don't make the cut and Britney just didn't make it. I've seen a little clip of her performance and she looked adorable so I really wish she was in it! Hopefully we'll work together in the future." [...] A short clip of the music video was released online on June 12, 2008; a day before the video's premiere on June 13, 2008 on FNMTV.|$|E

500|$|Brundage quickly {{displayed}} what writer Roger Butterfield in a 1948 {{article for}} Life magazine termed [...] "a dictatorial temperament." [...] In 1929, American track star Charlie Paddock stated that Brundage and other sports officials were making {{money for the}} AOC by using him as a gate attraction, while treating him badly; Brundage shot back accusing Paddock of [...] "untruths" [...] and [...] "sensationalism of the rankest sort". The runner turned professional, escaping Brundage's jurisdiction. In 1932, soon after winning three medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, track star Mildred [...] "Babe" [...] Didrikson appeared in an automobile advertisement, and the Brundage-led AAU quickly suspended her amateur status. Didrikson objected {{that she had not}} been paid and that regardless, the rules for maintaining amateur status were overcomplex. In the first of several well-publicized run-ins he had with female athletes, Brundage replied that he had not had any problem with the rules when an Olympic athlete himself, and stated, [...] "You know, the ancient Greeks kept women out of their athletic games. They wouldn't even let them on the sidelines. I'm <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> but they were right." [...] According to Butterfield, Brundage was suspicious of female athletes, suspecting that some were actually men in disguise.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{publication}} in 1999, Battle Royale became a bestseller in Japan. The novel was earlier {{entered into the}} 1997 Japan Horror Fiction Awards, but was eventually rejected {{in the final round}} with no winner that year. All three members of the final round's selection committee that year admitted Battle Royale was the best work, but declined to award it due to its controversial content. Hiroshi Aramata said that while it was the best nominee in terms of [...] "story, structure, and subject matter," [...] he felt it {{was too much of a}} Kinpachi-sensei parody and suspected its content would cause problems. Katsuhiko Takahashi felt that although it was the superior work as far as its construction as a novel, giving the award to a story about students killing each other at [...] "this time" [...] would hurt the reputation of the competition. Mariko Hayashi said that while she believed it was the best of the four novels, it was like reading an [...] "unpleasant near-future manga" [...] and [...] "No matter how squarely it might be horror or how interesting it might be, I'm <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> we should be writing stories like this." [...] In 2001, Kōji Ōnuma wrote , a dissertation that explores the themes of the book.|$|E
500|$|With little {{progress}} made on securing a high-profile candidate, Committee working groups held interviews. Of the eight men who applied, {{the most prominent}} was former congressman John Hoeppel, who promised to keep [...] "the Jews and the niggers" [...] out of the district. [...] On October 6, 1945, the Monrovia News Post reported that while Dexter seemed the likely candidate, [...] "of course anything can happen in politics and generally does". [...] The News Post stated that other names discussed by the Committee included [...] "Lt. [...] Richard Nixon, U.S.N.R., of Whittier." [...] Congressman Voorhis wrote his father and political adviser, Charles Voorhis, on October 15, [...] "I understand the General {{has decided not to}} run in the 12th district. [...] Dr. Dexter would, in my opinion, be hard to beat. [...] But at least it would be a clean, decent campaign, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> I wouldn't prefer that even if I lost." [...] Herman Perry, Whittier Bank of America branch manager and Nixon family friend, wrote to Nixon, who was then a lieutenant commander in the Navy, telling him he should apply for the Committee's endorsement. [...] Nixon replied enthusiastically. [...] When Dexter finally turned the Committee down, he recommended Nixon, his onetime student. [...] Dexter died only days later of a heart attack, and Patton died in an auto accident before the 1946 campaign began.|$|E

500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to say no to the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>sure</b> that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But I always had trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E
