Withdrawals began in 1964, with the final locomotives removed from service in 1968. Several examples have survived into the preservation era in varying states of repair, including Evening Star.|$|E
25|$|The cathedral has a {{heliometer}} (solar observatory) {{dating to}} 1690, {{one of a}} <b>number</b> <b>built</b> in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole {{in one of the}} minor domes acts as pinhole camera, projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at solar noon (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, la Meridiana, on the floor, running precisely north–south. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter solstices; signs of the zodiac show the various other dates throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s the Daimler CO chassis {{became the}} main model, {{followed}} by a similar, but heavier, CW 'austerity' model produced during World War II (100 with the Gardner 5LW engine (CWG5), the rest with the AEC 7.7-litre engine – CWA6) and in postwar years production worked through the Daimler CV to the long-running Daimler CR Fleetline, built from 1960 to 1980 (CVG5 and CVG6 had been a common type of bus in Hong Kong between 1950 and 1988 and Fleetline had also become a major type of bus in Hong Kong until 1995). Small numbers of single deck vehicles were also built. Many British bus operators bought substantial numbers of the vehicles and there were also a <b>number</b> <b>built</b> for export. The standard London double-decker bus bought from 1970 to 1978 was the Daimler Fleetline.|$|E

500|$|... "When Love Takes Over" [...] is a synthpop and [...] "uplifting floor-filler" [...] {{produced}} by Guetta and his associate Frédéric Riesterer. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard magazine {{described it as}} a [...] "pop <b>number</b> <b>built</b> around a lush piano loop and throbbing percussion" [...] with trance elements. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song was written in the key of F Mixolydian with a time signature of common time and a tempo of 130 beats per minute. The chord progression is Cm/F–Gm/F–F4–F. The final recording and mixing took place at Gum Prod Studios in Paris. Some elements of the song were compared to the riff and piano opener in the song [...] "Clocks" [...] by Coldplay.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several years, Howe's {{business}} expanded into engineering consulting and, much more profitably, general contracting. His firm came to dominate the construction of grain elevators in the West, as the Saskatchewan and Alberta wheat pools gave him much of their construction business. This made him unpopular among private wheat companies: [...] his firm did not receive any contracts to build terminal elevators for private corporations in the 1920s, but exceeded the <b>number</b> <b>built</b> by all other contractors combined, thanks to business from those cooperatives. [...] Howe's elevators were built more quickly, were better designed, and were cheaper to construct than those of his competitors. He worked to add to their efficiency; the Dominion-Howe unloader he helped design emptied a grain car in eight minutes, needing only two operators; the same operation had previously taken an hour for a crew of 20men.|$|E
500|$|The episode's musical {{performances}} were generally well-received, {{though a few}} reviewers, including Benigno, chafed at the continued emphasis on Broadway showtunes. Both of the major dance numbers came in for considerable praise, and [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] garnered the most superlatives: Fallon wrote, [...] "Brittany's performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] was thrilling. It was the most adrenaline-pumping musical number the series has produced: intricately choreographed, expertly shot and edited, perfectly woven into the story, and performed exquisitely by Heather Morris." [...] VanDerWerff [...] "enjoyed the ginormous production <b>number</b> <b>built</b> around it quite a bit", and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez called it a [...] "stellar performance". Kubicek stated, [...] "this was unbelievably superb, easily my favorite performance of the entire season". Futterman noted that [...] "Brittany's vocals are nowhere near the power of Beyoncé's, but they're just fine for this performance, the real focus {{of which is the}} dancing." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{improve the}} {{mobility}} of the Nebelwerfer units, a ten-tube [...] launcher was mounted on a lightly armored Sd.Kfz. 4 [...] "Maultier" [...] half-track chassis as the 15cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Selbstfahrlafette Sd.Kfz. 4/1 (based on the Opel [...] "Maultier", or [...] "Mule", half-track). Three hundred of these were produced, split evenly between launchers and ammunition carriers (which were identical except for the launcher). These were superseded in production by the 15cm Panzerwerfer 42 auf Schwerer Wehrmachtsschlepper (Panzerwerfer auf SWS), which had improved cross-country mobility and had greater ammunition storage than the [...] "Maultier". The exact <b>number</b> <b>built</b> of the latter weapon is unknown, but evidence suggests that fewer than 100 were completed {{before the end of}} the war.|$|E
60|$|Inachus {{had several}} sons, who Reigned in several parts of Peloponnesus, and there built Towns; as Phoroneus, who built Phoronicum, {{afterwards}} called Argos, from Argus his grandson; Ægialeus, who built Ægialea, afterwards called Sicyon, from Sicyon {{the grandson of}} Erechtheus; Phegeus, who built Phegea, afterwards called Psophis, from Psophis the daughter of Lycaon: and these were the oldest towns in Peloponnesus then Sisyphus, the son of Æolus and grandson of Hellen, built Ephyra, afterwards called Corinth; and Aëthlius, the son of Æolus, built Elis: and before them Cecrops built Cecropia, the cittadel of Athens; and Lycaon built Lycosura, reckoned by some the oldest town in Arcadia; and his sons, who were at least four and twenty in <b>number,</b> <b>built</b> each of them a town; except the youngest, called Oenotrus, who grew up after his father's death, and sailed into Italy with his people, and there set on foot the building of towns, and became the Janus of the Latines. Phoroneus had also several children and grand-children, who Reigned in several places, and built new towns, as Car, Apis, &c. and Hæmon, the son of Pelasgus, Reigned in Hæmonia, afterwards called Thessaly, and built towns there. This division and subdivision has made great confusion {{in the history of}} the first Kingdoms of Peloponnesus, and thereby given occasion to the vain-glorious Greeks, to make those kingdoms much older than they really were: but by all the reckonings abovementioned, the first civilizing of the Greeks, and teaching them to dwell in houses and towns, and the oldest towns in Europe, could scarce be above two or three Generations older than the coming of Cadmus from Zidon into Greece; and might most probably be occasioned by the expulsion of the Shepherds out of Egypt in the days of Eli and Samuel, and their flying into Greece in considerable numbers: but it's difficult to set right the Genealogies and Chronology of the Fabulous Ages of the Greeks, and I leave these things to be further examined.|$|E
