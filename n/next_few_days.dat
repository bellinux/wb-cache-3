5|$|On 7 January 2010 a Brussels-London train {{broke down}} in the Channel Tunnel, {{resulting}} in three other trains failing to complete their journeys. The cause of the failure was the onboard signalling system. Due to the severe weather, a limited service was operated in the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tensions mounted further, and in {{the evening}} of 21 or 22 June (sources vary), angry workers began {{building}} barricades and assaulting police and military patrols, killing {{those who did not}} surrender. About a hundred barricades were constructed {{over the course of the}} <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{first part}} of Vasey's plan {{involved}} the blocking of the Killerton Trail to prevent the Japanese from using it as an escape route, {{and to provide a}} jumping off point for a later advance by the 18th Infantry Brigade. The 2nd Battalion, 163rd Infantry, under Major Walter R. Rankin, set out early on 9 January 1943. Company G, covering the flank of the advance, was strongly engaged by Japanese heavy machine gun, mortar, and rifle fire. The remainder of the battalion established themselves astride the trail in a new position which was named Rankin after the battalion commander. The attack had cost four dead and six wounded. More casualties would be taken holding the position over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
60|$|New {{assurance}} {{of the truth}} came upon him in the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> following <b>days,</b> when it was put forth how the wounded man had been married on his bed, and to whom, and how, though always in a dangerous condition, he was a shade better. Bradley would far rather have been seized for his murder, {{than he would have}} read that passage, knowing himself spared, and knowing why.|$|R
5|$|The remnant low drifted south {{towards the}} Gulf of Mexico before being absorbed by a cold front (which also picked {{remnants}} of Subtropical Depression Twenty-two), and moving northeast. This cold front, of which Tammy's remnants were a part, affected {{much of the}} Northeastern United States over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|A rogue unit of insurgents {{headed by}} Algirdas Klimaitis and {{encouraged}} by Germans from the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst, started anti-Jewish pogroms in Kaunas (Kovno) {{on the night}} of 25–26 June 1941. Over a thousand Jews perished over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> in what was the first pogrom in Nazi-occupied Lithuania. Different sources give different figures, one being 1,500 and another 3,800, with additional victims in other towns of the region.|$|E
5|$|During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575km (355mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> the depression gradually developed and organised further, {{as it moved}} towards the west-southwest {{under the influence of}} a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.|$|E

5|$|On 5 April The Observer (the Guardians sister paper) {{published}} the first photograph of Tomlinson {{lying on the}} ground next to riot police. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not surprised that he had had a heart attack. When journalists asked whether he had been in contact with police officers before his death, they were told the speculation would upset the family.|$|E
2500|$|Shortstop Jason Bartlett {{suffered}} a [...] "mild" [...] right hamstring strain {{during a game}} on May 29 as he attempted to field a ground ball hit into center field.

5|$|On August11, a {{tropical}} cyclone appeared east of Luzon. Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> it {{moved across the}} Philippines, passing near the island of Mindoro on August13. The system moved across the South China Sea, intensifying into a typhoon as it approached Vietnam. Although it paralleled the coast, the system dissipated over the Gulf of Tonkin on August17.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone soon {{moved on}} a northwestward course and {{encountered}} wind shear. Bret weakened into a depression on August 23, {{due to the}} wind shear over the system. The next morning, the depression became a tropical wave with no low-level circulation left. The wave was soon absorbed by a trough of low pressure during the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{impactor}} returned {{images as}} late as three seconds before impact. Most of the data captured was stored on board the flyby spacecraft, which radioed approximately 4,500 images from the HRI, MRI, and ITS cameras to Earth over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> The energy from the collision was similar in size to exploding five tons of dynamite and the comet shone six times brighter than normal.|$|E
5|$|Over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> months, <b>Day</b> {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina {{to meet his}} requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her.

50|$|In October 1910 a third {{aircraft}} was bought, and immediately damaged, by Thomas Sopwith, who upon {{delivery of the}} aircraft to Brooklands made brief taxying trials and then stalled on his first attempted takeoff. Sopwith was unhurt and the aircraft suffered only minor damage. Sopwith managed considerably better on his <b>next</b> attempt a <b>few</b> <b>days</b> later, but a cylinder head burst on 4 November and Sopwith sold the aircraft, buying a biplane which was also manufactured by Wright.|$|R
5|$|A {{weakening}} trend soon occurred, with it weakening to a Category1 hurricane {{early on}} September15. About four days later, the hurricane completed its cyclonic loop and then headed west-northwestward. The system weakened to {{a tropical storm}} early on September20. During the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the storm decelerated and turned westward. Late on September22, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued westward, until dissipating at 1800UTC on September23, while located about 745 miles (1,200km) east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} aging of Fe 0 -core/oxide-shell {{nanoparticles}} in water {{with a focus on}} changes in (i) the composition and structure of the particles (by XRD, TEM, XPS, and bulk Fe 0 content), and (ii) the reactivity of the particles (by carbon tetrachloride reaction kinetics, electrochemical corrosion potentials, and H 2 production rates). The results show that nano-Fe 0 becomes more reactive between 0 and ~ 2 days exposure to water, and then gradually loses reactivity over the <b>next</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>days.</b> The behavior of unaged nano-Fe 0 in our laboratory experiments may be similar to that in fi eld-scale applications for source-zone treatment due to the short reaction times involved. However, nano-Fe 0 that has been aged in water for> 3 days acquires properties that are relatively stable over weeks or even months...|$|R
5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya.
