The sides of the train, which is a standard livery, consists of a shiny black area covering the middle portion of the train from just above the windows to below the windows, followed by a bold red stripe and a thinner grey stripe {{at the bottom of}} the train. These trains were fitted with Mobitec MobiLED electronic destination displays for train run numbers.|$|E
25|$|These train {{cars are}} fitted with green-blue tinted Glastroch (Germany) windows glass, and are almost {{identical}} to the first generation train cars before its refurbishment, except that its traction produces a louder, lower-pitched noise when accelerating/braking. The run <b>number</b> <b>display</b> {{on the front of}} each train is made up of electronic green flip-dot display, as opposed to the manual plastic rollers of the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, while the rubber strips between the doors are thicker. The trains have a full white body and a thick red stripe in the middle. Similar to the Kawasaki Heavy Industries C151 trains, the Siemens C651 trains have no visual passenger information systems, but have a built-in audio announcement system until the STARIS was installed and activated around 2010.|$|E

5000|$|Considering the {{difficulties}} of the operating area, Northwestel provides a fairly modern telecommunications network, including a basic level of such features as Call waiting, dial-up Internet, Call <b>Number</b> <b>Display</b> in 58 exchanges (62 communities & localities), and, in the largest centres which are still smaller than Bell Canada's fair-sized towns, video conference services. More advanced features, such as Name Display, are not available, and long distance transmission of Call <b>Number</b> <b>Display</b> is limited to just 14 communities. They also provide cable services, as [...] "TheEdge", with television and DSL Internet in some communities, many of them with government assistance. As NetKaster they also provide Two-way Satellite Internet access to Alberta {{and parts of the}} NWT and Nunavut and planned expansion in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Yukon.|$|E

Mr Skaf allegedly phoned the maximum security facility at 1.30 pm on Wednesday, 22 September 2002, and was put through to a duty officer. He gave his name and telephone number and asked to speak to his son. When the officer told him that outside calls had to be booked in advance and approved for set times, Mr Skaf offered to pay $100 to be put through to his son. The officer dismissed the offer and ended the conversation. He immediately called the number from the calling <b>number</b> <b>display</b> and Mustafa Skaf answered.|$|E

50|$|In June 2016, cars 7501-7510 and 7928 {{had their}} route signs {{modified}} with green circle/red diamond LED signs and a LED <b>number</b> <b>display,</b> {{similar to those}} on the R62As originally used on the 7 (and currently on the 6). This modification was done presumably {{due to the fact}} that passengers on the 7 cannot visually differentiate between an express train and local train, despite the announcements and digital signage. In the following year, 7501 had the LCD destination indicator parts of its destination signs replaced with LED panels to make them aesthetically similar to the route indicator. It is currently unknown if the remainder of the R188 fleet will be retrofitted with these features.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{mechanisms}} used by signaling methods prior to SS7 (battery reversal, multi-frequency digit outpulsing, A- and B-bit signaling), these older methods could not communicate much signaling information. Usually only the dialed digits were signaled, and merely during call setup. For charged calls, dialed digits and charge number digits were outpulsed. SS7, being a high-speed and high-performance packet-based communications protocol, can communicate {{significant amounts of}} information when setting up a call, during the call, {{and at the end}} of the call. This permits rich call-related services to be developed. Some of the first such services were call management related, call forwarding (busy and no answer), voice mail, call waiting, conference calling, calling name and <b>number</b> <b>display,</b> call screening, malicious caller identification, busy callback.|$|E

50|$|By 1976, the {{replacement}} of the huge number of manual signal boxes with centralised power-signalling coupled with computer-based train control and more modern telecommunications systems meant that it was no longer necessary to display headcodes throughout the railway network. Outside the Southern Region blinds were set to 00 or 0000, and discs/lamps to the former express passenger code. Roller blinds were later blanked or plated over to show two dots and new trains introduced for service outside the Southern Region after this time usually had no train reporting <b>number</b> <b>display</b> equipment. Many trains intended to run over Southern Region lines were designed to display the numeric route-code portion of the train reporting number, which they still display, usually as a dot-matrix display.|$|E

5000|$|In 1975 Commodore {{introduced}} {{a number of}} scientific calculators (like the SR4148/SR4148R and SR4190R) providing a variable scientific notation, where pressing the [...] and [...] keys shifted the exponent and decimal point by ±1 in scientific notation. Between 1976 and 1980 the same exponent shift facility was also available on some Texas Instruments calculators of the pre-LCD era such as early SR-40, TI-30 and TI-45 model variants utilizing (...) instead. This {{can be seen as}} a pre-cursor to a feature implemented on many Casio calculators since about 1978/1979 (f.e. in the FX-501P/FX-502P), where <b>number</b> <b>display</b> in engineering notation is available on demand by the single press of a (...) button (instead of having to activate a dedicated display mode as on most other calculators), and subsequent button presses would shift the exponent and decimal point of the number displayed by ±3 in order to easily let results match a desired prefix. Some graphical calculators (for example the fx-9860G) in the 2000s also support the display of some SI prefixes (f, p, n, µ, m, k, M, G, T, P, E) as suffixes in engineering mode.|$|E
