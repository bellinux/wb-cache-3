40|$|Nitrification inhibitors {{have been}} claimed {{to offer a}} means of {{achieving}} better control of the delivery of applied fertilizer nitrogen to crops. However, considerable variability in reported usefulness of nitrification inhibitors indicates a need for further research on their effectiveness under different agricultural conditions. A series of experiments was conducted to examine effects of the nitrification inhibitor <b>nitrapyrin</b> [2 -chloro 6 -(trichloromethyl) pyridine] on soil N availability and transformation {{and the influence of}} certain factors (soil pH, relative mobility, temperature etc.,) on its effectiveness. Because urea is rapidly becoming most favoured on a world scale attention was focussed on this as a form of fertilizer N. After selecting a suitable soil type a field experiment was set-up to compare the N supplying capacity of urea to that of other common commercial N fertilizers and to evaluate N utilization efficiency of a test crop (barley cv. Triumph). Urea compared unfavourably with ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate but was better than ammonium sulphate in terms of plant growth and yield on the acid soil used thus warranting improvement practices viz. the use of lime as a soil amendment and/or nitrification inhibitor as a fertilizer amendment. The effect of liming on certain N transformation processes and on the effectiveness of "nitrapyrin" was studied in the glasshouse and the _laboratory. Liming promoted urease activity, nitrification and potential denitrification of soil whereas <b>nitrapyrin</b> significantly reduced nitrification. Liming reduced the effectiveness of nitrification inhibition probably because of faster recovery of nitrifiers in limed soil. The importance of considering the total duration of inhibition in establishing inhibitor effectiveness was underlined. <b>Nitrapyrin</b> also had a marked effect on production of nitrous oxide by denitrification. There was no visible phytotoxic effects of <b>nitrapyrin</b> nor was there any measurable effect on plant height or top dry matter production of barley during 45 days of growth in the glasshouse. However, liming resulted in better plant growth. The relative mobility of <b>nitrapyrin</b> compared to urea and ammonium-N may be a critical factor in determining its effectiveness as an inhibitor. In leaching column experiments, it was found that most of the added urea moved with the wetting front while the rest was hydrolysed. Added ammonium-N moved more slowly but at a sufficent speed to effect separation from <b>nitrapyrin.</b> <b>Nitrapyrin</b> scarcely moved at all. Measured effects of temperature, soil moisture and air flow on persistence of <b>nitrapyrin</b> indicated that it is likely to persist longer in cool, moist soils exposed to minimal air flows. <b>Nitrapyrin</b> application had little or no effect on the growth of barley (cv. Triumph) in a field experiment in which, amongst other treatments, a single application of urea plus <b>nitrapyrin</b> was compared with a split application of the same amount of urea without <b>nitrapyrin.</b> Higher yields were obtained with split application of urea. Liming enhanced vegetative growth but this was not reflected uniformly in final yield of dry matter or grain. In conclusion, although control over nitrification was obtained by use of <b>nitrapyrin</b> under glasshouse/laboratory conditions its use could not be justified under field conditions experienced during this study.

The differences of AOA and AOB membrane structures lead to different membrane permeability, and thus cause different nitrification activities (Shen et al. 2008; Schouten et al. 2000). In addition, they occupy different ecological niches due to their dissimilar sensitivity to soil properties, such as nitrogen concentration, pH, water content, and so on (Morimoto et al. 2011; Shen et al. 2008).

40|$|Nitrification inhibitors (NIs) {{have been}} used {{extensively}} to reduce nitrogen losses and increase crop nitrogen nutrition. However, information is still scant regarding the influence of NIs on nitrogen transformation, nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emission and nitrogen utilization in plastic-film-mulched calcareous soil under high frequency drip-fertigated condition. Therefore, a field trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of <b>nitrapyrin</b> (2 -chloro- 6 -(trichloromethyl) -pyridine) on soil mineral nitrogen (N) transformation, N 2 O emission and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in a drip-fertigated cotton-growing calcareous field. Three treatments were established: control (no N fertilizer), urea (225 kg N ha- 1) and urea+nitrapyrin (225 kg N ha- 1 + 2. 25 kg <b>nitrapyrin</b> ha- 1). Compared with urea alone, urea plus <b>nitrapyrin</b> decreased the average N 2 O emission fluxes by 6. 6 - 21. 8 % in June, July and August significantly in a drip-fertigation cycle. Urea application increased the seasonal cumulative N 2 O emission by 2. 4 kg N ha- 1 compared with control, and <b>nitrapyrin</b> addition significantly mitigated the seasonal N 2 O emission by 14. 3 % compared with urea only. During the main growing season, the average soil ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 +-N) concentration was 28. 0 % greater and soil nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 [...] N) concentration was 13. 8 % less in the urea+nitrapyrin treatment than in the urea treatment. Soil NO 3 [...] N and water-filled pore space (WFPS) were more closely correlated than soil NH 4 +-N with soil N 2 O fluxes under drip-fertigated condition (P< 0. 001). Compared with urea alone, urea plus <b>nitrapyrin</b> reduced the seasonal N 2 O emission factor (EF) by 32. 4 % while increasing nitrogen use efficiency by 10. 7 %.

Several experiments {{were performed to}} investigate molecular, cellular, and apical endpoints to define the key events leading to the tumor formation. These data support a mode-of-action (MoA) characterized by constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) nuclear receptor activation, increased hepatocellular proliferation leading to hepatocellular foci and tumor formation. Specifically, <b>nitrapyrin</b> induced a dose-related increase in the Cyp 2 b 10 /CAR-associated transcript and protein. Interestingly, the corresponding enzyme activity (7 -pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) was not enhanced due to nitrapyrin-mediated suicide inhibition of PROD activity. <b>Nitrapyrin</b> exposure elicited a clear dose-responsive increase in hepatocellular proliferation in wild-type mice, but not in CAR knock-out mice, informing that CAR activation is an obligatory key event in this test material-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, <b>nitrapyrin</b> exposure induced a clear, concentration-responsive increase in cell proliferation in mouse, but not human, hepatocytes in vitro. Evaluation of the data from repeat dose and MoA studies by the Bradford Hill criteria and a Human Relevance Framework (HRF) suggested that nitrapyrin-induced mouse liver tumors are not relevant to human health risk assessment because of qualitative differences between these two species.

40|$|AbstractThe soil archaeon Nitrosotalea devanaterra is a {{representative}} of an abundant ammonia oxidising archaeal lineage. The effects of three nitrification inhibitors (allylthiourea (ATU), dicyandiamide (DCD) and <b>nitrapyrin)</b> on growth in both soil and liquid culture were compared. DCD and <b>nitrapyrin</b> inhibited nitrification at similar concentrations to bacterial ammonia oxidisers. Although DCD completely inhibited nitrification, some growth occurred in liquid cultures. Surprisingly, Nitrosotalea devanaterra was less susceptible to inhibition by ATU, which stimulated, rather than inhibited, nitrification in soil microcosms. Inhibition thresholds and responses may reflect differences in ammonia oxidation mechanisms between archaea and bacteria...|$|E

Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science-Zeitschrift Fur Pflanzenernahrung Und Bodenkunde, 166, (4), 513 - 518. Sponsorship: Ministry of Education, Government of PakistanThe aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of the {{nitrification inhibitor}} <b>nitrapyrin</b> on the fate and recovery of fertilizer nitrogen (N) and on N mineralization from soil organic sources. Intact soil cores were collected from a grassland field. Diammonium phosphate (DAP) and urea were applied as N sources. Cores were equilibrated at - 5 kPa matric potential and incubated at 20 ?C for 42 to 56 days. Changes in NH 4 +-N, accumulation of NO 3 [...] N, apparent recovery of applied N, and emission of N 2 O (acetylene was used to block N 2 O reductase) were examined during the study. A significant increase in NH 4 +-N released through mineralization was recorded when <b>nitrapyrin</b> was added to the control soil without N fertilizer application. In the soils to which N was added either as urea or DAP, 50 - 90 % of the applied N disappeared from the NH 4 +-N pool. Some of this N (8 - 16 %) accumulated as NO 3 [...] N, while a small proportion of N (1 %) escaped as N 2 O. Addition of <b>nitrapyrin</b> resulted in a decrease and delay of NH 4 +-N disappearance, accumulation of much lower soil NO 3 [...] N contents, a substantial reduction in N 2 O emissions, and a 30 - 40 % increase in the apparent recovery of added N.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of nitrification inhibitor <b>nitrapyrin</b> on N transformations, recovery and to prevent formation of NO 3 -N which could be lost by leaching and denitrification. Intact soil cores were collected from a grassland field, incubated under aerobic conditions at 20 °C with 70 % WFPS.

With an equal annual nitrogen (N) application rate (1217 kg N ha - 1 yr - 1), six treatments under three biochar amendment rates – namely, 0 t ha - 1 (C 0), 20 t ha - 1 (C 1) and 40 t ha - 1 (C 2) – with compound fertilizer (CF) or urea mixed with NI of <b>nitrapyrin</b> as chlorinated pyridine (CP) were studied in these field experiments. The results showed that, {{although there was no}} significant influence on soil organic carbon (SOC) content or total nitrogen (TN), <b>nitrapyrin</b> could result in a significant increase in soil pH during the experimental period. <b>Nitrapyrin</b> significantly decreased cumulative N 2 O emissions by 15. 9 – 32. 1 % while increasing vegetable yield by 9. 8 – 41. 9 %. Thus, it also decreased yield-scaled N 2 O emissions significantly. In addition to the differential responses of the soil pH, biochar amendment significantly increased SOC and TN. Compared with the treatments without biochar addition, the cumulative N 2 O emissions showed {{no significant difference in the}} CF or the CP group treatments but increased slightly (not significantly) by 7. 9 – 18. 3 % in the CP group treatments. Vegetable yield was enhanced by 7. 1 – 49. 5 % in the CF group treatments compared with the treatments without biochar amendment, while there was no significant difference in the CP group treatments, and the yield-scaled N 2 O emissions were thus decreased significantly.
