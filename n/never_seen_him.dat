5|$|Although Khan {{has bought}} Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, {{saying that she}} has <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> as being more than a friend. Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys {{the set of the}} film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour {{deadline}} to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E
5|$|The {{funeral service}} for Pat Nixon {{took place in}} the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> more distraught.|$|E
25|$|One biographer {{described}} Cannon as {{an unpleasant}} and deceitful person. Although he “loved power and prestige, profit and pleasure,“ Cannon {{was a distant}} and aloof individual. One Anti-saloon League colleague described him as “cold as a snake” and another, {{with whom he has}} worked closely for forty years, reported having <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> laugh and rarely smile.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{can seem}} mindful of which {{individuals}} have watched {{them in the}} past. In an experiment with Siamese fighting fish, two males were made to fight each other while being watched by a female, whom the males could also see. The winner and the loser of the fight were then, separately, given a choice between spending time next to the watching female or to a new female. The winner courted both females equally, but the loser spent more time next to the new female, avoiding the watcher female. In this species, females prefer males they have seen win a fight over males they have seen losing, and it therefore makes sense for a male to prefer a female that has <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{as opposed to a}} female that has seen him lose.|$|E
500|$|He {{died of a}} self-inflicted {{gunshot wound}} after the {{shooting}} ended. ABC News reports that his behavior seemed to become more erratic in {{the weeks leading up}} to the shooting, and that it is believed he stopped taking medication beforehand. His girlfriend, Jessica Baty, confirmed that Kazmierczak was taking Xanax (anti-anxiety), Ambien (sleep aid), and Prozac (antidepressant), all of which were prescribed to him by a psychiatrist. She said that he stopped taking Prozac about three weeks prior to the February 14 shooting. She also said that, during their two-year courtship, she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> display violent tendencies and she expressed bewilderment over the cause of the rampage. [...] "He was anything but a monster," [...] Baty said. [...] "He was probably the nicest, most caring person ever." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{working with}} actors, Nolan prefers {{giving them the}} time to perform as many takes of a given scene as they want. [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} the {{lighting}} and camera setups, the technical things, take all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes.... If an actor tells me they can do something more with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues." [...] Gary Oldman praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> raise his voice to anyone". He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to [...] "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Schwimmer {{made his}} Off-Broadway directorial debut in Fault Lines at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York. The {{production}} won a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times, which wrote: [...] "Based on Fault Lines... we can't really tell whether Schwimmer has much talent as a director. We're surprised he didn't try something more challenging for his debut. If not much else, Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs". The New York Post, however, noted that Schwimmer [...] "knows {{a thing or}} two about freewheeling banter... and for a good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue, expertly delivered". In February 2009, he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder's three-act play Our Town as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre. [...] "Schwimmer... turns in a poignant, richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs. I've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer's post-Friends stage work in London and New York, and I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> better", commented the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
500|$|MacLaren {{was invited}} by the Melbourne Cricket Club {{to bring a}} team to Australia during the English winter of 1901–02. This was the last privately {{organised}} team to represent England at Test level in Australia, with subsequent ones playing under the colours of the MCC. Many leading players were unavailable—Yorkshire's Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were not permitted to tour by their captain Lord Hawke. The team was judged to be weak, but contained several players {{at the beginning of}} their careers who went on to success at Test level. Sydney Barnes was chosen by MacLaren after playing only a handful of county matches. Barnes' success on his single appearance for Lancashire in 1901 convinced MacLaren of his worth, to the surprise and disparagement of commentators, most of whom had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> Barnes began the tour well, but did not get on with his captain. During a storm on part of the sea journey, MacLaren, speculating on their chances of survival, commented to a team member: [...] "If we go down, at least that bugger Barnes will go down with us." [...] The team lost their first match and continued to struggle. MacLaren clashed with authorities in Melbourne over his right to choose an umpire, but he began to bat well at Sydney, where he scored 145 and 73 in a tour match.|$|E
500|$|... "The Grinning Man" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from critics, and was watched by 9.91 million viewers, with a 36% {{share of the}} total television audience. The episode beat ITV's Marple in the same time-slot, with Geraldine McEwan's last episode as Agatha Christie's famous sleuth receiving just 4.48 million viewers and a 15% audience share. The Sunday Times AA Gill was critical of the episode, suggesting that the series had been revived: [...] "because of some dire piece of market research where they asked single, lonely, overweight, over-40 women who keep cats and believe in ghosts who they fancied most on television, and Alan Davies must have beaten Huw Edwards by a woolly head." [...] Of the episode itself, he wrote: [...] "It skids between procedural whodunit realism and cartoonish fantasy {{in a way that}} defies belief and interest. It is a dull confusion of unknotted loose ends that breaks its own rules, suspends common sense and dumps so much unexplained plot that all suspense drains away through the holes in the story." [...] The Herald's Alasdair McKay was critical of Davies' acting in the episode, writing that: [...] "it really is difficult {{to tell the difference between}} the comedian and the accidental detective in David Renwick's comedy drama. Davies doesn't act, he tries to stay awake, occasionally pausing for a cryptic insight." [...] While The Scotsmans Paul Whitelaw similarly noted that Davies appeared to be playing [...] "a slightly grumpier version" [...] of himself, he was [...] "quite impressed" [...] by Davies performance, having <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> act before. Whitelaw found that [...] "the episode itself left a lot to be desired", writing that its central mystery was [...] "solid" [...] and its solution was [...] "satisfyingly creepy", but that [...] "At two hours in length it was fatally overstretched [...] It was as though Renwick, who also directed, had been given 120 minutes to fill without having enough material to fill them – the narrative equivalent of an interminable jam session based around some fundamentally decent riffs." [...] Steve Pratt, writing for The Northern Echo, was similarly critical of the episode's length, deeming the Adam Klaus subplot [...] "nonsense" [...] which [...] "could easily be removed without loss". Pratt suggested that [...] "This would also help reduce the overlong two-hour running time, during which my attention wandered more often than it should have done." [...] The Observers Euan Ferguson shared a similar sentiment, writing that the episode: ...|$|E

2500|$|After a {{year and}} a half of marriage, his new wife had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> perform in front of an audience, and the first {{occasion}} came unplanned. As told by actor comedian Alan King, it happened during a dinner by the New York Friars' Club at the Waldorf Astoria in 1946, honoring the career of Sophie Tucker. Jolson and his wife were in the audience along with a thousand others, and George Jessel was MC. He asked Al, privately, to perform at least one song. Jolson replied, [...] "No, I just want to sit here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walcott {{returned}} to the international fold on 3 March 2010 in a friendly against Egypt. It was his first international start for nine months. He faded after a bright start {{and was replaced by}} Shaun Wright-Phillips after 57 minutes as England recovered from a goal down to beat Egypt 3–1 at Wembley Stadium. His performance came under heavy criticism from Chris Waddle who said of Walcott, [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> develop. He just doesn't understand the game for me – where to be running, when to run inside a full back, when to just play a one-two. It's all off the cuff. I just don't think he's got a football brain and he's going to have problems. Let's be honest, good defenders would catch him offside every time." ...|$|E

2500|$|EastEnders lead {{director}} Matthew Robinson {{recommended the}} actor Leslie Grantham for the part. Grantham had previously {{appeared on the}} London Fringe in a stage play Robinson had written. His only TV appearance at that point had been as Kiston, a small part in a 1984 Doctor Who serial Resurrection of the Daleks directed by Robinson. Julia Smith remembered that she had taught Grantham at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and regarded him as a [...] "mature student", although she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> [...] "in action". They needed the character of Den to have [...] "panache, charisma and electricity". They were initially uncertain about casting Grantham, but they both felt that the actor had [...] "something", which {{they went on to}} describe as a [...] "tensed up internal emotion of some sort, that was being held in. There was something behind the eyes, too. Barely contained violence almost..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sam Worthington, {{who worked}} with Cameron on Avatar, stated on The Jay Leno Show that Cameron had very high {{expectations}} from everyone: he would use a nail gun to nail the film crew's cell phones to a wall above an exit door in retaliation for unwanted ringing during production. Other actors, such as Bill Paxton and Sigourney Weaver, have praised Cameron's perfectionism. Weaver said of Cameron: [...] "He really does want us to risk our lives and limbs for the shot, but he doesn't mind risking his own." [...] Michael Biehn has also praised Cameron, claiming [...] "Jim is a really passionate person. He cares more about his movies than other directors care about their movies", but added [...] "I’ve <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> yell at anybody." [...] However, Biehn did claim Cameron is [...] "not real sensitive {{when it comes to}} actors and their trailers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In press interviews, Myrons Captain Neal leveled {{criminal}} charges against the captains of Adriatic and H.P.

At a special Steamboat Inspection Service hearing, Captain Neal stated: I was clinging {{to the roof of}} the pilothouse when the McIntosh hailed me shortly after the Myron went down from under me. The McIntosh drew alongside me, not more than [...] away. Although it was dusk, the ship was so close that I had no difficulty in making out her name. I talked to the captain and expected that he would put out a yawl and pick me up. He did not do so, nor attempt in any way to help me.

2500|$|In March 2004, Vine {{said that}} she had only seen Thomson once, in an art shop, in the {{previous}} two years. She later told The Times that it was [...] "impossible to explain" [...] why she married Thomson, that he didn't [...] "give a s*** about art or the Stuckist movement", and that he saw her as a means of gaining his own publicity: [...] "When I met him and he saw some of my history, he saw dollar signs. He is a very exploitative man." [...] Thomson said she showed herself in a manner to gain the largest amount of attention or sympathy, avoided reality and created a fantasy world : [...] "Now it makes me question a lot of things she told me about her past." [...] In June 2007, Vine said that the marriage was consummated in 2001, {{a few weeks after the}} ceremony—"I owed him that"—and Thomson then paid off her debts of £20,000, after which [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> again." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Rockstar's {{president}} Sam Houser, it {{was their}} intention {{to start a new}} chapter of Max Payne's life with the game: [...] "This is Max as we've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before, a few years older, more world-weary and cynical than ever." [...] The press release states that since the last game, Max has left New York City behind and [...] "drifted from bad to worse." [...] The press release goes on to say Max has been double-crossed in this new city and is searching for both the truth and a way out. The game is set in São Paulo, Brazil, several years after the events of ending of the second game. Max Payne now works in executive protection for the wealthy Rodrigo Branco and his family in the hopes of escaping the memories of his troubled past. When a street gang kidnaps Rodrigo's wife, Fabiana, Max is pulled into a conspiracy of shadowy, warring factions threading every aspect of São Paulo society in a deadly web that threatens to engulf everyone and everything around him.|$|E
2500|$|In January {{he started}} 15/8 second {{favourite}} for the Irish Champion Hurdle but after leading {{for most of}} the way and rallying strongly on the run-in he was beaten a head by the mare Like-A-Butterfly. On 13 March 2003 Limestone Lad made his final racecourse appearance when he ran {{for the second time in}} the Stayers' Hurdle at Cheltenham. His preparation for the race had been disrupted after he had suffered from a respiratory infection which forced him to miss an intended run in the Boyne Hurdle. He started joint-favourite with the French gelding Baracouda, and led until being overtaken at the last flight and finishing third behind Baracouda and Iris's Gift. Bowe commented, [...] "He was actually devastated after the race. They know when they've been beaten and I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> as put out. There was no consoling him. It took a couple of days for him to cheer up". There were plans to run the horse at Punchestown later that spring, but he never ran again.|$|E
