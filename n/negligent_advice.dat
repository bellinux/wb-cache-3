40|$|The {{number of}} {{malpractice}} cases brought against tax advisers for <b>negligent</b> tax <b>advice</b> has increased greatly in recent years. In {{most of these}} cases, the plaintiffs attempt to recover interest charged by the IRS on the tax liability that {{is a result of}} the adviser 2 ̆ 7 s negligence. There is no national rule regarding the recovery of interest, and the issue has been decided in the courts on a state-by-state basis, with some states yet to address the issue. Traditionally, recovery of interest is not allowed as a matter of law; however, in an increasing number of states, courts have held that the issue is a matter of fact and allow recovery if a plaintiff can prove damages. Courts in South Dakota and Pennsylvania held in 2006 that the recovery of interest is possible and is a matter of fact to be decided on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

5000|$|In ICS Ltd v West Bromwich BS itself, a {{group of}} investors had been given <b>negligent</b> <b>advice</b> by various {{building}} societies (including West Bromwich BS), financial advisers and solicitors, and so had potential claims for breach of statutory duty.

5000|$|Investors {{received}} <b>negligent</b> <b>advice</b> {{from their}} financial advisers, solicitors and building societies, including West Bromwich Building Society ('West Bromwich BS'). They had claims in tort and for breach of statutory duty. The investors had been encouraged by financiers to enter [...] "Home Income Plans", which meant mortgaging their properties to get cash {{that they would}} put into equity linked bonds. They lost money when house prices and stocks fell. Under the Financial Services Act 1986 section 54 the Securities and Investments Board started the Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd, where investors could be directly compensated for their losses, and ICS would try recoup the cost by suing the building societies on everyone’s behalf. Accordingly, to get the compensation investors signed a contract to assign their claims to ICS. But in section 3(b) of the claim form the assignment excluded ‘Any claim (whether sounding in rescission for undue influence or otherwise) that you have or may have against the West Bromwich Building Society’, so that investors could still sue on some claims individually. While ICS Ltd was suing, West Bromwich BS argued that ‘or otherwise’ meant that claims for damages, as well as rescission, had not been assigned. ICS Ltd argued that the clause actually meant that claims for damages had been assigned, because ‘or otherwise’ referred to rescission based claims other than undue influence, but not damages.|$|E
40|$|Professionals may {{be liable}} to legal action over {{matters such as}} giving <b>negligent</b> <b>advice</b> to their clients. But their duty of care extends further, to such matters as {{preventing}} the risk of injury on their premises, as the following case illustrates. In earlier articles, I have made some ovservations concerning the liability that accountants and other professions can incur as a result of: (a) their giving <b>negligent</b> <b>advice</b> or their negligent handling of clients' matters; (b) notices and signs displayed in their offices; (c) their partners. In this concluding article, some observations are made concerning the liability that accountants and other professional can incur from their premises...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{object of}} this paper is to examine whether the {{improvements}} in technology that enhance community understanding of the frequency and severity of natural hazards also increased the risk of potential liability of planning authorities in negligence. In Australia, the National Strategy imposes a resilience based approach to disaster management and stresses that responsible land use planning can reduce or prevent the impact of natural hazards upon communities. Design/methodology/approach - This paper analyses how the principles of negligence allocate responsibility for loss suffered by a landowner in a hazard prone area between the landowner and local government. Findings - The analysis in this paper concludes that despite being able to establish a causal link between the loss suffered by a landowner and the approval of a local authority to build in a hazard prone area, it would be in the rarest of circumstances a negligence action may be proven. Research limitations/implications - The focus {{of this paper}} is on planning policies and land development, not on the <b>negligent</b> provision of <b>advice</b> or information by the local authority. Practical implications - This paper identifies the issues a landowner may face when seeking compensation from a local authority for loss suffered due to the occurrence of a natural hazard known or predicted to be possible in the area. Originality/value - The paper establishes that as risk managers, local authorities must place reliance upon scientific modelling and predictive technology when determining planning processes in order to fulfill their responsibilities under the National Strategy and to limit any possible liability in negligence...|$|R
2500|$|If {{a trustee}} has broken a duty {{owed to the}} trust, there are three main remedies. First, {{specific}} performance may generally be awarded {{in cases where the}} beneficiary merely wishes to compel a trustee to follow the trust's terms, or to prevent an anticipated breach. Second, for losses, beneficiaries may claim compensation. The applicable principles are disputed, given the historical language of requiring a trustee to [...] "account" [...] for things which go wrong. One view suggested that at the very moment a trustee breaches a duty, for instance by making an erroneous investment without considering relevant matters, beneficiaries have a right to see the trust accounts are surcharged, to erase the transpiring loss (and [...] "falsified" [...] to restore to the trust fund unauthorised gains). In Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns the argument was taken to a new level, where a solicitor (a fiduciary, like a trustee) was given £1.5m by Target Holdings Ltd to hold for a loan for some property developers, but released the money before it was meant to (when purchase of the development property was completed). The money did reach the developers, but the venture was a flop, and money lost. Target Holdings Ltd attempted to sue Redferns for the whole sum, but the House of Lords held that the loss was caused by the venture flop, not the solicitor's action outside instructions. It was, however, observed that the common law rules of remoteness would not apply. Similarly in Swindle v Harrison a solicitor, Mr Swindle, could not be sued for the loss of Ms Harrison's second home's value after he gave her <b>negligent</b> and dishonest <b>advice</b> about loans, because she would have taken the loan and made the purchase anyway, and the house value drop was unrelated to his breach of duty.|$|R
40|$|Actions for {{wrongful}} life, as {{they have}} come unfortunately to be styled, encompass various types of claim. These include claims for alleged negligence after conception, those based on <b>negligent</b> <b>advice</b> or diagnosis prior to conception concerning possible effects of treatment given to the child's mother, contraception or sterilisation, or genetic disability. This distinguishes such claims from those for so called wrongful birth, which are claims by parents {{for the cost of}} raising either a healthy or a disabled child where the unplanned birth imposes costs on the parents as a result of clinical negligence. Two of the more controversial cases to have reached the High Court of Australia which are if interest to us here in the past decade are Cattanach v Melchior where the court, by a narrow majority (McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ; Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon dissenting) acknowledged recovery for wrongful birth. In the second joined appeals of Harriton v Stephens and Waller v James; Waller v Hoolahan the court overwhelmingly precluded a ‘wrongful life’ claim (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ; Kirby J dissenting). Both cases raised issues around the sanctity and value of life and the nature of harm and the assessment of damages, and this brief note affords us the opportunity to consider {{the way in which the}} ‘life as legal loss’ arguments were treated by the various judges in both cases...|$|E
