The Background section also provides relates the project purpose material on smoke dispersion and air quality forecasting systems. The goal of Section 2 is to illustrate how the accomplished tasks contribute towards the project objective of providing smoke dispersion and fire environment datasets to validate smoke dispersion and air quality. Section 2 provides a summary description of the study area, the fire events studied, and the data collected for each fire. The study methods for collecting primary data (airborne and Lidar observations) and ancillary data (e. g. burned area, fuels, and weather) are described in Section 3. The primary deliverable of this project is a dataset for the evaluation of plume rise and smoke dispersion models. The structure and content of this dataset is described in Section 3. The project results for each fire event studied are reported in Section 4. On a fire event basis, Section 4 summarizes each fire, describes the specific primary and ancillary observations collected for each fire, and provides an inventory of the data files contained in the project dataset.

40|$|Music-making {{software}} is increasingly available to amateur or hobbyist musicians, and affords {{the possibility of}} professional- quality recordings to non-professional music-makers working from their home computers. Based on audio/video recordings and screen capture data of two such musicians working collaboratively and for fun, this paper aims to unpack an array of features of the order and organisation of various amateur music-making activities. Topically, this paper addresses how such music-makers utilise various available resources to facilitate their collaborative efforts: through the invention and usage of idiosyncratic ‘technical’ terms borne from audio properties of the sounds at hand; a reliance on the shared availability of visual properties of the composition and the software on-screen; through the use <b>of</b> <b>accompanying</b> written <b>documents,</b> and so on. Further comments are made on the technological and methodological demand of analysing work that is primarily available only through the fine detail of a computer screen and through ad hoc invented ‘technical’ terms. Hence, the overall aim is to highlight some of the empirical and methodological issues pertaining to understanding the work of amateur music-makers, and how {{they might be able}} to work towards professional-quality recordings despite still learning what it takes to do so...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between trade liberalisation, consumers' environmental awareness and a negative environmental externality in consumption. We adopt an international Hotelling duopoly setup, where firms are located in two asymmetric countries. We find that, if the intensity of environmental externality is common knowledge for country governments, this setup delivers <b>no</b> need <b>of</b> <b>accompanying</b> trade policies in order to enforce trade liberalisation. In the opposite case, in which information is asymmetric, i. e., the small country's Government cannot observe the positive enviromental effects of its firm's exports to foreign consumers, we find that: (i) the Pareto optimum is always enforced, since the brown country always relaxes the distortionary trade policy, and (ii) cheating on the environmental externality allows the brown country's government to extract extra surplus from the green country. Allowing for trade in green technology delivers opposite conclusions: the externality is minimised and welfare is maximised in equilibrium if information is symmetric while trade liberalisation with asymmetric information always entails a second best outcome...|$|R
