5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested <b>Nixon,</b> <b>and</b> the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Nixon's advisors denied he had {{abandoned}} {{a desire to}} bring the American people together. However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the voters who had cast their ballots for him, and should seek {{to win over the}} voters who had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, as the key to reelection in 1972. According to Safire, after taking office, <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> his advisors decided he need not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> his policies—they became known as the Silent Majority. Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> demand his removal.|$|E

5|$|Breathitt was an {{important}} adviser to Governor John Y. Brown, Jr., who appointed him to the University of Kentucky's Board of Trustees in 1981 and 1982.

5|$|Chotiner was in {{many ways}} the most {{interesting}} personality in Nixon's political camp: aggressive, egocentric, a professional among amateurs, brilliant, overbearing, ruthless, engaging, habitually guilty of overkill, constantly enlarging his area of operation. Painted in sinister colors by the press, he was both a public relations problem for <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> an invaluable campaign strategist.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, Chandler {{was given}} serious {{consideration}} as the vice-presidential running mate of Alabama's former Governor George Wallace in the latter's American Independent Party {{bid for the}} U.S. presidency.

5|$|In mid-May, Nixon, {{interviewed by}} David Broder of The Washington Post, {{mentioned}} the Maryland governor {{as a possible}} running mate. As Agnew continued to meet with <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> with the candidate's senior aides, there was a growing impression that he was moving into the Nixon camp.

5|$|As was {{usual in}} California at the time, both <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> Voorhis cross-filed {{in the other}} party's primary, a {{practice}} Voorhis had long adopted. Winning both primaries virtually assured election. Each candidate won his own party's primary, with Voorhis garnering {{a considerable number of}} votes in the Republican primary, and outpolling Nixon by 7,000votes overall. Nixon gained momentum, however, when the newspapers pointed out that Voorhis's total percentage of the vote had decreased from 60% in 1944 to 53.5%.|$|E
5|$|Both Douglas and Nixon {{announced}} their candidacies in late 1949. In March 1950 Downey withdrew from a vicious primary battle with Douglas by announcing his retirement, after which Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy joined the race. Boddy attacked Douglas as a leftist {{and was the}} first to compare her to New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who was accused of being a communist. Boddy, <b>Nixon,</b> <b>and</b> Douglas each entered both party primaries, a practice known as cross-filing. In the Republican primary, Nixon was challenged only by cross-filers and fringe candidates.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950 campaign, both <b>Nixon</b> <b>and</b> Douglas {{were accused}} of having a voting record {{comparable}} to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio. The sole congressman from the American Labor Party at the time, Marcantonio represented East Harlem. He was accused of being a communist, though he denied being one; he rarely discussed the Soviet Union or communism. Marcantonio opposed restrictions on communists and the Communist Party, stating that such restrictions violated the Bill of Rights. He regularly voted against contempt citations requested by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), on which Nixon served.|$|E
