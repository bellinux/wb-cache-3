5|$|Lieutenant General Sir Edwin Alfred Hervey Alderson, KCB (8 April 1859 – 14 December 1927) was {{a senior}} British Army officer who served in several campaigns of the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries.</b> During the First World War he was placed {{in command of the}} Canadian Expeditionary Force {{during the first half of}} the war but made enemies amongst the Canadian {{political}} and military elite and suffered disastrous casualties during operations in 1915/16 which forced his sidelining and eventual retirement from service.|$|E
5|$|Much work on hypercomplex {{numbers and}} group {{representations}} {{was carried out}} in the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries,</b> but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras. Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon in the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries.)</b> C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E

25|$|The Pittsburgh seam was America's {{principal}} seam of {{coal production}} {{during the late}} <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century. Pittsburgh-seam coal was ideally suited to making coke, particularly for iron blast furnaces. It fostered the development of much of southwestern Pennsylvania, particularly {{a section of the}} Pittsburgh seam known as the Connellsville district. The Pittsburgh seam was America's principal seam of coal production during the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> century.|$|R
5|$|The {{area around}} Pensford was an {{important}} coal mining area during the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries</b> when it formed part of the Somerset Coalfield, {{although there are no}} working coal mines today. The line of the now disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive Pensford Viaduct and on to Midsomer Norton. The area suffered serious flooding during the storm of 10 July 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley, around Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only caudal vertebrae known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists in the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries</b> thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{their main}} campus in Broadmoor, the {{congregation}} also operates Beth Israel Cemetery, {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Located at 19th Street and 5th Avenue, it was originally outside of Meridian's city limits and {{was intended to be}} a rural cemetery, but the city has since expanded and annexed the area containing the cemetery. The cemetery contains generations of German and Alsatian immigrants, as well as many big names of the largely mercantile Jewish community of the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries.</b> Beth Israel Cemetery is the only remaining built memorial for many of Meridian's early Jews since the era of the 1879 and 1906 temple buildings, neither of which still stands.|$|E

5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries.</b> Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} {{independent}} and united Armenia was the main goal of the Armenian national liberation movement during the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries.</b> By the 1890s, a low-intensity armed conflict developed between the three major Armenian parties—the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnak), Hnchak and Armenakan— and the Ottoman government. Calls from the great powers for reforms in the Armenian provinces and Armenian aspirations of independence resulted in the Hamidian massacres between 1894 and 1896, during which up to 300,000 Armenian civilians were slaughtered by the order of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, after whom the massacres were named. After the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, some Armenians felt that the situation would improve; however, a year later the Adana massacre took place and Turkish-Armenian relations deteriorated further. After the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, the Ottoman government was pushed to accept the reforms in the Armenian provinces in early 1914.|$|E
5|$|Because the key {{distinguishing}} characteristic Marsh {{noted for}} Pteranodon was {{its lack of}} teeth, any toothless pterosaur jaw fragment, wherever it {{was found in the}} world, tended to be attributed to Pteranodon during the late <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> <b>early</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>centuries.</b> This resulted in a plethora of species {{and a great deal of}} confusion. The name became a wastebasket taxon, rather like the dinosaur Megalosaurus, to label any pterosaur remains that could not be distinguished other than by the absence of teeth. Species (often dubious ones now known to be based on sexual variation or juvenile characters) have been reclassified a number of times, and several subgenera have in the 1970s been erected by Halsey Wilkinson Miller to hold them in various combinations, further confusing the taxonomy (subgenera include Longicepia, Occidentalia, and Geosternbergia). Notable authors who have discussed the various aspects of Pteranodon include Bennett, Padian, Unwin, Kellner, and Wellnhofer. Two species, P. orogensis and P. orientalis, are not pteranodontids and have been renamed Bennettazhia oregonensis and Bogolubovia orientalis respectively.|$|E
