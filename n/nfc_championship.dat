5|$|Vikings placekicker Gary Anderson {{had joined}} the team that {{off-season}} after playing for three different teams in his 16-year NFL career. In 1998, {{he became the first}} placekicker in NFL history to convert every field goal and extra point attempted. He finished the regular season 35/35 on field goals, with a long of 53 yards, and 59/59 on extra points. As a result, he was voted to the 1998 NFC Pro Bowl team, the fourth Pro Bowl invitation of his career, and was voted to the AP All-Pro team for the first time. He also converted every field goal and extra point attempt in a Divisional playoff round victory against the Arizona Cardinals the week before the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship.</b> Entering the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game, his last miss was on December 15, 1997, against the Denver Broncos, when {{he was a member of}} the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E

As they had in Week 12, the Giants defense held San Francisco's offense in check, limiting San Francisco to one touchdown and two field goals. The 49ers defense also held the Giants' offense in check, limiting the Giants to four Matt Bahr field goals through the midway point of the fourth of quarter. In the game's waning moments Erik Howard caused a Roger Craig fumble, and Lawrence Taylor recovered it. The Giants drove down the field and got into field goal range for Bahr. On the game's last play, Bahr hit a 42–yard field goal to give the Giants the NFC title, 15–13, over the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. Bahr set an <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game record with his fifth field goal of the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, the Giants {{defeated the}} Packers 37–20. Manning threw for 330 {{yards and three}} touchdowns, {{two of them to}} wide receiver Hakeem Nicks.

Neither the Falcons nor the Vikings reached the Super Bowl again until the 2016 NFL season, when the Falcons lost in {{overtime}} to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. Although the game long stood as the proudest {{moment in the history}} of the Falcons franchise, the 1998 <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game has been remembered for the effect it had on the Vikings players and their fan base, as it is seen by some sportswriters as one of the most devastating losses in NFL history.|$|E
5|$|The Packers {{lost to the}} San Francisco 49ers in a Wild Card Round {{playoff game}} in 1998. Favre had rallied the team with a {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Antonio Freeman with 1:56 remaining in the game to put the Packers up 27–23.

5|$|The loss of Harris {{to injury}} after the twelfth {{game of the}} season coincided with a decline in {{defensive}} performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than twenty points (23 points to the Arizona Cardinals in week six and 31 to the Miami Dolphins in week 9). After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points in six of the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the New Orleans Saints in the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game were held below 21 points.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, the excitement that surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1999 {{season the}} Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins {{had been the}} first-ever draft choice of the {{expansion}} Carolina Panthers and {{in his second season}} led the Panthers to the <b>NFC</b> <b>Championship</b> game. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially when there was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E

50|$|He did {{not suffer}} any major {{injuries}} during his entire career, {{but at the end}} of the 1983 season, because of the accumulation of wear and tear, he ended up needing surgery to repair both shoulders and decided to retire.
