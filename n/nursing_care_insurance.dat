50|$|Almost all of Margret Dieck's {{academic}} work concerns {{the topic of}} social disequilibria in seniority, what means: with the socially disadvantaged groups of the elderly. Her focus {{is not only to}} analyse, but to reach policy and society, and thus go beyond theory and to provide bases for implementation. Dieck's scientific aims are......to bring the social protection and security of the elderly on one level and on the same standards with the social protection of all other population groups. This aim provokes, inter alia, her engagement for the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>insurance</b> and, eventually, for the financing of social services....to fight and to overcome the reasons and causes of social distress and of under-supply (so-called “social weakness”) of the problematic seniority groups....to put constant effort in influencing policy and society, to let theory become practice....to strengthen the socio-politico-economic positions and ideas of the gerontological community in Germany. Concerning this, Dieck is occasionally blunt, sometimes even harsh in her diction. But she is always convinced of her concern's eligibility, being the social policy....to indirectly, and partly as well directly, represent the interests of those members of seniority, whose interests are only insufficiently observed.One important work beneath the already mentioned is “Sozialpolitik für ältere Menschen” (Social Policy for the Elderly), published together with Gerhard Naegele in 1978: This work is considered the programmatic foundation of a socio-politico-scientific research area in the social gerontology. An other one is “Wohnen und Wohnumfeld älterer Menschen in der Bundesrepublik”, on living conditions of the elderly in Germany, published in 1979. This monography is considered a benchmark of gerontological literature until today.Further publications of Dieck are on- women and aging,- family relations in higher age,- sanitary and custodial care of the elderly,- poverty and wealth in higher age,- elderly employees,- retirement and work-related “disposal” in higher age,- nursing care insurance,- social services and their financing.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of long-term care insur-ance (LTCI) in Japan, home care services have received more national attention. Because the uti-lization of home-visit nursing is increasing, eval-uation {{of the effectiveness of}} home-visit <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> will be needed. Although there are a few out-come research studies of home-visit <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> in Japan, outcomes research, especially related to the LTCI, will be needed much more in the future. This article shows a framework to easily identify variables that are important {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} home-visit <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> in Japan. The home-visit nursing station, which is equiva-lent to the home care agency in the UnitedStates, is gaining popularity in Japan. However, there is no methodology to evaluate the quality of care in Japan, such as the Outcome Assessment Information Set (OASIS) that is used in the United States. Although the home-visit nursing station needs to evaluate the effectiveness and quality of home-visit <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> in Japan, there is little outcome research of home-visit <b>nursing</b> <b>care.</b> Therefore, it is important to indicate a framework for quality assessment of this system. The purpose is to introduce a framework to begin to identify variables that are important to evaluate the effective-ness of home-visit <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> in Japan. HOME-VISIT NURSING CARE IN JAPAN The home-visit nursing station for the elderly was established in 1992 under Japan’s health law for the elderly (Social Insurance Society, 2000). Under this law, public health nurses, nurses, assistant nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists can provide care for elderly people by using a public money-sharing medical insurance system. Then, the home-visit nursing station was supported in 1994 under the Health Insurance Act (Social Insurance Society, 2000).

The major results are the following: 1. The home care service industry is well underway, {{and as a result}} many major private companies have strengthened their day care service and facilities care service businesses that have a high profit ratio. 2. There are still many non-specialized care service companies which are advancing into the care service industry, making use of management resources such as know-how, talented personnel, capital, equipment and facilities, distribution channels, and information. 3.

40|$|In a long-run social experiment, {{personal}} budgets {{have been}} tested as an alternative home care program of the German long-term <b>care</b> <b>insurance</b> (LTCI). By granting the monetary value of in-kind services in cash, personal budgets are considered to enable customized home care arrangements, thereby avoiding costly <b>nursing</b> home <b>care</b> and thus saving LTCI spending. However, personal budgets also compete with the already existing and less generous cash option of the LTCI. Any transition from the receipt of cash benefits to personal budgets thus challenges the view of personal budgets as a cost savings device, unless personal budgets sufficiently reduce the use of costly <b>nursing</b> home <b>care</b> to balance these extra costs. This paper therefore contrasts the short-term costs of implementing personal budgets with potential cost savings if personal budgets enhance the stability of home care and avoid costly <b>nursing</b> home <b>care.</b> For this purpose, the paper investigates the effects of personal budgets on the duration of home care until moving {{to a nursing home}} as well as the perceived stability of home care.

The <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> process is considered the basic scientific method of advanced <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> leading to solution of problems.

Thanks to the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> process a <b>nurse</b> has a holistic view of a patient and is able to provide quality <b>care.</b> <b>Nursing</b> <b>care</b> is provided in compliance with the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> process principles with regard to the specifics of geriatric care in senior homes. A senior home nurse takes into consideration the specifics of the individual phases of <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> process in seniors. Senior homes provide residential services to people with lower self-sufficiency particularly caused by higher age and to those who need regular care in the field of self-sufficiency and personal care. Unfavourable social situation does not allow these people to live in their domestic environment. Complex care provided in senior homes substitutes for domestic environment. Seniors are also given health care provided by general nurses. The aim of the thesis was to examine <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> process application in a senior home and the importance of the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> process {{from the point of view}} of senior home nurses.

Qualitative research by means of in-depth interview and questioning of nurses in a selected senior home in South Bohemia was chosen for collection of necessary information.
