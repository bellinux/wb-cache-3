30|$|Simplifying their {{business}} was {{a strategy of}} five of the 20 by ceasing one enterprise type among the mix. In the case of dairying, one had left this enterprise and turned to non-farming uses of the land while the other had decided to focus exclusively on the dairy. In other cases, labour costs are a driver: one farm ceased beef production because cattle require more labour than sheep but on another the farmer felt the reverse was the case and reduced his flock to a small pedigree flock and doubled cattle numbers. The other reasons given for enterprise changes were to meet environmental scheme requirements (discussed below) and to reflect {{the impact of the}} Single Payment Scheme, and in one case, the impact of deciding to convert to organic production, which meant the land could <b>not</b> carry so <b>many</b> <b>livestock.</b>|$|R

In 2002, remaining plants are charging up to $ 70 for cows, $ 60 for pigs and $ 200 per horse to pickup animal carcasses from farms in their area. As a result, <b>many</b> <b>livestock</b> farms no longer have affordable access to rendering service. <b>Many</b> <b>livestock</b> producers are unsure of what they should or could be doing to properly dispose of the occasional animal carcass. Brief anonymous surveys conducted in western New York and northern Pennsylvania reveal a widespread practice of improper mortality disposal.
