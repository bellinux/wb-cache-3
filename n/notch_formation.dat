40|$|Recent works (Evelpidou et al., 2012) {{suggest that}} the modern tidal notch is disappearing {{worldwide}} due sea level rise over the last century. In order to assess this hypothesis, we measured modern tidal notches in several of sites along the Mediterranean coasts. We report observations on tidal notches cut along carbonate coasts from 73 sites from Italy, France, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece, Malta and Spain, plus additional observations carried outside the Mediterranean. At each site, we measured notch width and depth, and we described {{the characteristics of the}} biological rim {{at the base of the}} notch. We correlated these parameters with wave energy, tide gauge datasets and rock lithology. Our results suggest that, considering ‘the development of tidal notches the consequence of midlittoral bioerosion’ (as done in Evelpidou et al., 2012) is a simplification that can lead to misleading results, such as stating that notches are disappearing. Important roles in <b>notch</b> <b>formation</b> can be also played by wave action, rate of karst dissolution, salt weathering and wetting and drying cycles. Of course <b>notch</b> <b>formation</b> can be augmented and favoured also by bioerosion which can, in particular cases, be the main process of <b>notch</b> <b>formation</b> and development. Our dataset shows that notches are carved by an ensemble rather than by a single process, both today and in the past, and that it is difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle them and establish which one is prevailing. We therefore show that tidal notches are still forming, challenging the hypothesis that sea level rise has drowned them...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses X-ray {{computed}} tomography {{to track the}} mechanical response of a vertebrate (Barnacle goose) long bone subjected to an axial compressive load, which is increased gradually until failure. A loading rig was mounted in an X-ray {{computed tomography}} system so that a time-lapse sequence of three-dimensional (3 D) images of the bone’s internal (cancellous or trabecular) structure could be recorded during loading. Five distinct types of deformation mechanism were observed in the cancellous part of the bone. These were (i) cracking, (ii) thinning (iii) tearing of cell walls and struts, (iv) <b>notch</b> <b>formation,</b> (v) necking and (vi) buckling. The results highlight that bone experiences brittle (<b>notch</b> <b>formation</b> and cracking), ductile (thinning, tearing and necking) and elastic (buckling) modes of deformation. Progressive deformation, leading to cracking was studied in detail using digital image correlation. The resulting strain maps were consistent with mechanisms occurring at a finer-length scale. This paper {{is the first to}} capture time-lapse 3 D images of a whole long bone subject to loading until failure. The results serve as a unique reference for researchers interested in how bone responds to loading. For those using computer modelling, the study not only provides qualitative information for verification and validation of their simulations but also highlights that constitutive models for bone need to take into account a number of different deformation mechanisms...|$|E

In this paper, the structural behaviours of the glass–fibre composite strengthened concrete structures subjected to uni-axial compression and three point bending tests are discussed through experimental studies. Two types of concrete structure are used in present study, they are concrete cylinder and rectangular concrete beam. Discussion on the environmental effects of composite strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) structures is also addressed. Experimental {{results show that the}} use of glass–fibre composite wrap can increase the load carrying capacity of the plain concrete cylinders with and without <b>notch</b> <b>formation.</b> The flexural load capacity of the concrete beam increases to more than 50 % by bonding 3 layers of glass–fibre composite laminate on the beam tension surface.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation on the mechanical properties of the laboratory size rectangular concrete beams with the <b>notch</b> <b>formation</b> on the tension surface strengthened by using fibre reinforced plastic composites. Fibre-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have been embedded at the interface between the concrete surface and external bonded composites to measure the strain variations when the strengthened structures were subjected to three-point bending load. Multiplexing strainsensing technique has been used for measuring the strains in different locations of the beam by using one single optical fibre. External bonded strain gauges were also attached on the surfaces of composites to measure the surface strain and the results were compared with that obtained from the embedded FBG sensors. The observation in the experiments showed that the flexural load capacity of the strengthened concrete beams was increased significantly after strengthening by laying-up the composite laminate for both plain and notched concrete structures. Debond and concrete failure occurred at the plate end region when the thick composite laminate was used. The embedded FBG sensors could provide the indication to the operator when the structure serviced in strange conditions.

They are among the largest evacuated features in the exterior plasmaspheric boundary. They can last for days and exhibit a variety of shapes. It appears that weak convection and limited erosion precedes <b>notch</b> <b>formation</b> at the westward, near-Earth edge of the convection plume. Eighteen clear notch events were found and analyzed in 2000. Among these events, notches were found to drift as slowly as 44 % of corotation. In only one case was a notch found to drift at the corotation rate within measurement error. On average, these notches drift at about 21. 5 h d(sup - 1) or 90 % of the corotational rate. Notches sometimes exhibit an interior structure that appears as an extended prominence of dense plasma, which forms a W- or M-like feature in IMAGE/EUV images, depending on viewing perspective. Initial modeling suggests that notches and notch prominences may be caused in part by intense small-scale potential structures that result from the localized injection of ring current plasma. Plasma filling rates during recovery are examined in three L shell ranges from L = 2 to L = 3. 5 with rates ranging from 5 to 140 cm(sup - 3) d(sup - 1).

40|$|Large scale {{underground}} bulk mining {{methods such as}} Block Caving {{allow for}} mass extraction of large, low grade ore bodies in a cost effective manner. They involve de-stabilising large volumes of rock to induce significant stress changes in the surrounding rock mass. When caving operations are established in deep, high stress environments in hard competent rock, the potential for brittle damage to tunnel excavations exists. Whilst high stress to strength ratio, large scale caving mines set in hard competent rock are few, the industry is trending towards such operations. Having tools which can assist site based engineers in observing, measuring, and forward predicting the location and depth of brittle damage to tunnel excavations can lead to less disruption to mining activities and risk mitigation in these mines. This thesis presents a methodology to assist site based engineers in observing, measuring, and forward predicting the location and depth of brittle damage to tunnel excavations using linear elastic modelling in caving operations. The thesis demonstrates that existing brittle damage empirical relations derived by Diedrichs (1999), Martin et al. (1999), and Kaiser et al. (2000), that assume the rock mass strength is governed by cohesion, are applicable for modelling the location and depth of damage associated with the on-set of damage to tunnel excavations in brittle rock that exhibit randomly orientated, low persistence, jointing. The thesis also presents a methodology for forming damage criteria that can predict the location and depth of damage associated with more significant brittle damage that results in spalling and <b>notch</b> <b>formation</b> to tunnel excavations; assuming {{that some of the}} cohesive strength of the rock mass has been lost and some frictional strength has been mobilised as the damage increases. A key finding of the thesis is that a lower bound 95 % confidence fit was the best approach to use when forming the damage criteria from the stress state data. Another key finding was that reasonable correspondence was achieved between the inflexion points in the extensometer displacement vs time curves and the transition of the rock mass from its elastic to in-elastic response...|$|E
40|$|The steeply-dipping-dolostone-hosted caves of the Sierra de Arnero (N Spain) contain low-gradient relict canyons {{with up to}} ten mapped {{levels of}} {{ferromanganese}} stromatolites and associated wall notches over a vertical range of 85 m, the highest occurring 460 m above base level. Despite a plausible speleogenetic contribution by pyrite oxidation, and the irregular cave-wall mesomorphologies suggestive of hypogenic speleogenesis, the Arnero relict caves are dominantly epigenic, {{as indicated by the}} conduit pattern and the abundant allogenic sediments. Allogenic input declined over time due to a piracy-related decrease in the drainage area of allogenic streams, explaining the large size of the relict Arnero caves relative to the limited present-day outcrop area of the karstified carbonates. Allogenic-sediment input also explains the observed change from watertable canyons to phreatic conduits in the paleo-downstream direction. Stromatolites and notches arguably formed in cave-stream passages at the watertable. The best-defined paleo-watertables show an overall slope of 1. 7 °, consistent with the present-day relief of the watertable, with higher-slope segments caused by barriers related to sulfide mineralization. The formation of watertable stromatolites favored wall notching by the combined effect of enhanced acidity by Mn–Fe oxidation and shielding of cave floors against erosion. Abrasive bedload further contributed to <b>notch</b> <b>formation</b> by promoting lateral mechanical erosion and protecting passage floors. The irregular wallrock erosional forms of Arnero caves are related partly to paragenesis and partly to the porous nature of the host dolostones, which favored irregular dissolution near passage walls, generating friable halos. Subsequent mechanical erosion contributed to generate spongework patterns. The dolostone porosity also contributes to explain the paradox that virtually all Arnero caves are developed in dolostone despite being less soluble than adjacent limestone. U-series dating of carbonate speleothems and paleomagnetic data from ferromanganese stromatolites and clastic sediments indicate that the paleo-watertables recorded 320 m above the present-day watertable formed during the Matuyama Chron but prior to 1. 5 Ma, implying long-term base-level-lowering rates from 125 to 213 m/Ma. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of paleomagnetic dating of cave ferromanganese stromatolites. These deposits are excellent geomagnetic recorders and offer a direct way to delineate and date paleo-watertables, especially in caves developed in dolostone.

40|$|Abstract Background In the {{developing}} vertebrate nervous system {{elevated levels of}} Notch signaling activity can block neurogenesis and promote formation of glial cells. The mechanisms that limit Notch activity to balance formation of neurons and glia from neural precursors are poorly understood. Results By screening for mutations that disrupt oligodendrocyte development in zebrafish we found one allele, called vu 56, that produced excess oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Positional cloning revealed that the vu 56 allele is a mutation of fbxw 7, which encodes the substrate recognition component of a ubiquitin ligase that targets Notch and other proteins for degradation. To investigate {{the basis of the}} mutant phenotype we performed in vivo, time-lapse imaging, which revealed that the increase in OPC number resulted from production of extra OPCs by ventral spinal cord precursors and not from changes in OPC proliferation or death. Notch signaling activity was elevated in spinal cord precursors of fbxw 7 mutant zebrafish and inhibition of <b>Notch</b> signaling suppressed <b>formation</b> of excess OPCs.

To further address how these pathways coordinate in the process, we specifically disrupted Notch 1 or Jagged 1 in the endocardium of mouse embryonic hearts and showed that Jagged 1 -Notch 1 signaling in the endocardium is essential for EMT and early valvular cushion formation. qPCR and RNA in situ hybridization assays reveal that endocardial Jagged 1 -Notch 1 signaling regulates Wnt 4 expression in the atrioventricular canal (AVC) endocardium and Bmp 2 in the AVC myocardium. Whole embryo cultures treated with Wnt 4 or Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif 1) show that Bmp 2 expression in the AVC myocardium is dependent on Wnt activity; Wnt 4 also reinstates Bmp 2 expression in the AVC myocardium of endocardial Notch 1 null embryos. Furthermore, while both Wnt 4 and Bmp 2 rescue the defective EMT resulting from Notch inhibition, Wnt 4 requires Bmp for its action.

40|$|Nickel and {{chromium}} are not {{commonly found}} in carbonate or mixed carbonate depositional environments. All lithologies from a 100 -meter section in the middle part of the Lower Ordovician Fillmore Formation at a single locality, the “Pyramid Section”, contain anomalous levels of nickel and chromium. Preliminary data has also shown that there is significantly more nickel in the matrix of two FPCs (range of 0. 22 – 0. 24 ppm) from the pyramid section than found in the other lithologies at that section (0. 05 – 0. 10 ppm). However, at a separate locality, “Section C”, in {{the lower part of}} the Fillmore Formation neither nickel nor chromium were detected in any lithology. This suggests that the nickel and chromium came from a source that was either spatially or temporally restricted. Two questions arose from these findings. One, what is the source of the nickel and chromium? Two, is there more than one source for nickel in the flat-pebble conglomerates (FPCs) of this section? The nickel and other trace element anomalies were initially discovered using XRF, and subsequently confirmed with inductively coupled plasma –atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Possible sources of these elements include 1) Meteorite impact during middle Fillmore time, 2) hydrothermal vents at the time of deposition of the middle part of the Fillmore Formation, or 3) the granitic intrusion in the <b>Notch</b> Peak <b>Formation.</b> The concentration of nickel in two of the flat-pebble conglomerates might support the hypothesis that these beds are event deposits resulting from meteorite impact, but petrographic analysis of thin sections did not reveal any evidence to confirm meteorite impact as a possible source, such as spherules. A hydrothermal vent generally does not contain that amount of energy and movement of elements is localized. A Jurassic intrusion, the Notch Peak Stock, is closer to the Pyramid Section than it is to Section C. The most likely source is the granitic intrusion.

40|$|AbstractArthrosis {{following}} rupture of {{the anterior}} cruciate ligament has been analysed in two series. The first series was derived from a review of 150  cases of reconstruction of the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} with a follow-up of 3  years or more. Arthrosis was seen to have developed in 13. 3  %. The second series was concerned with 64  cases of unilateral arthrosis treated by upper tibial valgus osteotomy in whom {{there had been a}} previous rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. The ‘tolerance interval’ – that is the time between the original ligamentous injury and the time of osteotomy – for the development of arthrosis was very variable, ranging in the natural-history cases from 10 to 50  years, with a mean of 35  years. It is important to recognise the radiological signs of the onset of arthrosis. These are osteophytosis of the intercondylar <b>notch,</b> osteophyte <b>formation</b> at the posterior part of the medial tibial plateau, and, in particular, narrowing of the medial joint line with posterior subluxation of the medial femoral condyle, well seen in lateral radiographs whilst standing on one lower limb. Early arthroses, appearing after 10  years, may occur as a ‘natural arthrosis’, but it develops much more frequently after surgical treatment that had failed to correct anterior laxity and particularly when it had been performed on knees that were already pre-arthrotic. The main factor in arthrosis is anterior laxity measured radiologically by an ‘active Lachman’ radiograph. Removal of the medial meniscus which in itself, is liable to produce arthrosis, is even more harmful in anterior cruciate laxity since it doubles the degree of anterior subluxation of the tibia seen on unilateral weight-bearing. The development of varus deformity, which characterises progressive arthrosis, has its origin in wear of the posterior part of the medial tibial plateau caused by anterior cruciate laxity. Other factors play an important part such as associated lateral laxity, constitutional genu varum and weakness of the hamstring muscles, which oppose the subluxating action of the quadriceps...|$|R

Acquisition of elytra, highly modified beetle forewings, is an important innovation that has driven the successful radiation of beetles.

In this study, we performed a series of RNA interference (RNAi) experiments in both Tribolium and Drosophila to understand the contributions of ab {{to the evolution of}} beetle elytra. We found that (i) ab is essential for proper wing vein patterning both in Tribolium and Drosophila, (ii) ab has gained a novel function in determining the unique elytron shape in the beetle lineage, (iii) unlike Hippo and Insulin, other shape determining pathways, the shape determining function of ab is specific to the elytron and not required in the hindwing, (iv) ab has a previously undescribed role in the <b>Notch</b> signal-associated wing <b>formation</b> processes, which appears to be conserved between beetles and flies. These data suggest that ab has gained a new function during elytron evolution in beetles without compromising the conserved wing-related functions.

Previous speculation has suggested that Gro may be orthologous to the yeast corepressor Tup 1. In support of this idea, a detailed alignment between the C-terminal WD-repeat domains of these two proteins shows that each Gro WD repeat is most similar to the Tup 1 WD repeat occupying the corresponding position in that protein. Our analysis of Gro–histone interactions provides further support for a close evolutionary relationship between Gro and Tup 1. In particular, we show that, as with the N-terminal region of Tup 1, the N-terminal region of Gro is necessary and sufficient for direct binding to histones. The highest affinity interaction is with histone H 3 and binding is primarily observed with hypoacetylated histones. Using transient transfection assays, we show that a Gal 4 –Gro fusion protein containing the histone-binding domain is able to repress transcription. Deletions that weaken histone binding also weaken repression. These findings, along with our recent report that Gro interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd 3, suggest a mechanism for Gro-mediated repression...|$|R

Further, no S wave was seen in leads II and aVF, and no Q wave was observed in V 3 and V 4. ST segment mostly showed the flat wave and upward waves. T wave showed mainly positive form but diphasic type was sometimes seen. <b>Notching</b> <b>formation</b> on QRS complex was traced mostly on the downward deflection of R and secondly on top of R waves. Close relation may be recognized between the form of ST segment and direction of deflection of T wave. 3. Electrocardiogram of K dogs are characterized as follows. P wave in most cases showed positive wave excepting negative one in leads aVR and V 1. PQ segment showed flat wave in limb lead, aVL and aVF, but in recordings from the unipolar chest lead the segment showed downward deflection. QRS complex may be classified into 12 types. Rs and RS types were mostly seen but the QRS in aVR and aVL was mainly constructed of Q and S waves. In the unipolar chest lead, Q waves were not observed in recording of V 3. Upward deflection and 0 -line type of ST in limb lead, downward in aVL&aVR, and upward in unipolar chest lead were respectively observed. Positive T waves were observed in most cases, but in aVR and aVL the T waves showed negative. Notchings on QRS were usually found on the downward deflection of R and next most frequently on upward deflection of R. In regard {{to the relationship between}} the forms of ST and T waves, same conclusions were reached as in the S dogs. 4. Some differences were observed between the electrocardiograms of S and K dogs, which were concerned with figure and measurement value of each wave in each lead. But fundamental differences were not observed electrocardiographically. 5. In regard to the clinical application of the electrocardiogram on dogs, the authors considered that the electrocardiograph is a useful instrument for diagnose of the heart conditions. First of all fixing method is important : the writers consider it best to put the dog on his back with extremities bandaged to the table, because the movement of the dog may be prevented during the recording of the electrocardiogram. The needle electrode is useful. The electrode is applied to the subcutaneous area under the lead position, then for some time the electrode should be kept as it is, so the injury current may be destroyed and no influence of injury currents may be recognized in the traced wave. It is needful for diagnosis of the heart condition that recording of the electrocardiogram should be made by many leads as possible. But in clinic many leads are not applied to the patient. Therefore, authors consider it practical and useful for clinical examination that diagnosis of arrhythmia be conducted by lead II of the limb lead, and then that unipolar lead be used to learn about the positional changes of the heart. Records from the unipolar chest lead are valuable for learning about the heart muscle condition especially to ascertain if there have been damages to the ventriclar muscles...|$|R
40|$|A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease (ADAM) 10 exerts {{essential}} roles during organ {{development and}} tissue integrity in different organs, mainly through {{activation of the}} Notch pathway. However, only {{little is known about}} its implication in liver tissue physiology. Here we show that in contrast to its role in other tissues, ADAM 10 is dispensable for the Notch 2 -dependent biliary tree formation. However, we demonstrate that expression of bile acid transporters is dependent on ADAM 10. Consequently, mice deficient for Adam 10 in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes and liver progenitor cells develop spontaneous hepatocyte necrosis and concomitant liver fibrosis. We furthermore observed a strongly augmented ductular reaction in 15 -week old ADAM 10 Δhep/Δch mice and demonstrate that c-Met dependent liver progenitor cell activation is enhanced. Additionally, liver progenitor cells are primed to hepatocyte differentiation in the absence of ADAM 10. These findings show that ADAM 10 is a novel central node controlling liver tissue homeostasis. Highlights: Loss of ADAM 10 in murine liver results in hepatocyte necrosis and concomitant liver fibrosis. ADAM 10 directly regulates expression of bile acid transporters but is dispensable for <b>Notch</b> 2 -dependent <b>formation</b> of the biliary system. Activation of liver progenitor cells is enhanced through increased c-Met signalling, in the absence of ADAM 10. Differentiation of liver progenitor cells to hepatocytes is augmented in the absence of ADAM 10...|$|R
40|$|Transcription factor CTIP 2 (chicken {{ovalbumin}} upstream promoter transcription factor-interacting protein 2), {{also known}} as BCL 11 B, is expressed in hair follicles (HFs) of embryonic and adult skin. Ctip 2 -null mice exhibit reduced HF density during embryonic development. In contrast, conditional inactivation of Ctip 2 in the epidermis (Ctip 2 ep-/-mice) leads to a shorter telogen and a premature entry into anagen during {{the second phase of}} hair cycling without a detectable change in the number of HFs. Keratinocytes of the bulge stem cells (SCs) niche of Ctip 2 ep-/- mice proliferate more and undergo reduced apoptosis compared with the corresponding cells of wild-type mice. However, premature activation of follicular SCs in mice lacking CTIP 2 leads to the exhaustion of this SC compartment in comparison with Ctip 2 L 2 /L 2 mice, which retained quiescent follicle SCs. CTIP 2 modulates expression of genes encoding EGFR and <b>NOTCH</b> 1 during <b>formation</b> of HFs and those encoding nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic calcineurin-dependent 1 and LIM homeobox 2 during normal hair cycling in adult skin. The expression of most of these genes is disrupted in mice lacking CTIP 2, and these alterations may underlie the phenotype of Ctip 2 -null and Ctip 2 ep-/- mice. CTIP 2 appears to serve as a transcriptional organizer that integrates input from multiple signaling cues during HF morphogenesis and hair cycling...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} genetically {{faithful}} model of medulloblastoma with increased tumor incidence {{compared with the}} current best model we activated the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway by transgenically expressing a constitutively active form of Smoothened in mouse cerebellar granule neuron precursors (ND 2 :SmoA 1 mice). This resulted in early cerebellar granule cell hyper-proliferation and a 48 % incidence of medulloblastoma formation. Gene expression studies showed {{an increase in the}} known Shh targets Gli 1 and Nmyc that correlated with increasing hyperplasia and tumor <b>formation.</b> <b>Notch</b> 2 and the Notch target gene, HES 5, were also significantly elevated in Smoothened-induced tumors showing that Shh pathway activation is sufficient to induce Notch pathway signaling. In human medulloblastomas reverse transcription-PCR for Shh and Notch targets revealed activation of both of these pathways in most tumors when compared with normal cerebellum. Notch pathway inhibition with soluble Delta ligand or gamma secretase inhibitors resulted in a marked reduction of viable cell numbers in medulloblastoma cell lines and primary tumor cultures. Treatment of mice with D 283 medulloblastoma xenografts with a gamma secretase inhibitor resulted in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, confirming that Notch signaling contributes to human medulloblastoma proliferation and survival. Medulloblastomas in ND 2 :SmoA 1 mice and humans have concomitant increase in Shh and Notch pathway activities, both of which contribute to tumor survival...|$|R
40|$|Notch signal {{transduction}} appears {{to involve the}} ligand-induced intracellular processing of <b>Notch,</b> and the <b>formation</b> of a processed Notch-Suppressor of Hairless complex that binds DNA and activates the transcription of Notch target genes. This suggests that loss of either Notch or Su(H) activities should lead to similar cell fate changes. However, previous data indicate that, in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo, mesectoderm specification requires Notch but not Su(H) activity. The determination of the mesectodermal fate is specified by Single-minded (Sim), a transcription factor expressed in a single row of cells abutting the mesoderm. The molecular mechanisms by which the dorsoventral gradient of nuclear Dorsal establishes the single-cell wide territory of sim expression are not fully understood. We have found that Notch activity is required for sim expression in cellularizing embryos. In contrast, at this stage, Su(H) has a dual function. Su(H) activity was required to up-regulate sim expression in the mesectoderm, and to prevent the ectopic expression of sim dorsally in the neuroectoderm. We have shown that repression of sim transcription by Su(H) is direct and independent of Notch activity. Conversely, activation of sim transcription by Notch requires the Su(H) -binding sites. Thus, Notch signalling appears to relieve the repression exerted by Su(H) and to up-regulate sim transcription in the mesectoderm. We propose a model in which repression by Su(H) and derepression by Notch are essential {{to allow for the}} definition of a single row of mesectodermal cells in the blastoderm embryo...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in Norrin, the ligand of a {{receptor}} complex {{consisting of}} FZD 4, LRP 5 and TSPAN 12, cause severe developmental blood vessel defects in the retina and progressive {{loss of the}} vascular system in the inner ear, which lead to congenital blindness and progressive hearing loss, respectively. We now examined molecular pathways involved in developmental retinal angiogenesis in a mouse model for Norrie disease. Comparison of morphometric parameters of the superficial retinal vascular plexus (SRVP), including the number of filopodia, vascular density and number of branch points together with inhibition of Notch signaling by using DAPT, suggest no direct link between Norrin and <b>Notch</b> signaling during <b>formation</b> of the SRVP. We noticed extensive vessel crossing within the SRVP, which might be a loss of Wnt- and MAP kinase-characteristic feature. In addition, endomucin {{was identified as a}} marker for central filopodia, which were aligned in a thorn-like fashion at P 9 in Norrin knockout (Ndp(y/-)) mice. We also observed elevated mural cell coverage in the SRVP of Ndp(y/-) mice and explain it by an altered expression of PDGFβ and its receptor (PDGFRβ). In vivo cell proliferation assays revealed a reduced proliferation rate of isolectin B 4 -positive cells in the SRVP from Ndp(y/-) mice at postnatal day 6 and a decreased mitogenic activity of mutant compared with the wild-type Norrin. Our results suggest that the delayed outgrowth of the SRVP and decreased angiogenic sprouting in Ndp(y/-) mice are direct effects of the reduced proliferation of endothelial cells from the SRVP...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{simplified}} and genetically conserved zebrafish pronephros is {{an excellent}} model to examine the cryptic processes of cell fate decisions during the development of nephron segments {{as well as the}} origins of associated endocrine cells that comprise the corpuscles of Stannius (CS). Using whole mount in situ hybridization, we found that transcripts of the zebrafish genes t-box 2 a (tbx 2 a) and t-box 2 b (tbx 2 b), which belong to the T-box family of transcription factors, were expressed in the caudal intermediate mesoderm progenitors that give rise to the distal pronephros and CS. Deficiency of tbx 2 a, tbx 2 b or both tbx 2 a/b reduced the size of the distal late (DL) segment, which was accompanied by a proximal convoluted segment (PCT) expansion. Further, tbx 2 a/b deficiency led to significantly larger CS clusters. These phenotypes were also observed in embryos with the from beyond (fby) c 144 mutation, which encodes a premature stop codon in the tbx 2 b T-box sequence. Conversely, overexpression of tbx 2 a and tbx 2 b in wild-type embryos expanded the DL segment where cells were comingled with the adjacent DE, and also decreased CS cell number, but notably did not alter PCT development—providing independent evidence that tbx 2 a and tbx 2 b are each necessary and sufficient to promote DL fate and suppress CS genesis. Epistasis studies indicated that tbx 2 a acts upstream of tbx 2 b to regulate the DL and CS fates, and likely has other targets as well. Retinoic acid (RA) addition and inhibition studies revealed that tbx 2 a and tbx 2 b are negatively regulated by RA signaling. Interestingly, the CS cell expansion that typifies tbx 2 a/b deficiency also occurred when blocking Notch signaling with the chemical DAPT (N-[N-(3, 5 -difluorophenacetyl) -L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester). Ectopic activation of Notch in Tg(hsp 70 ::Gal 4; UAS::NICD) (NICD) embryos led to a reduced CS post heat-shock induction. To further examine the link between the tbx 2 a/b genes and <b>Notch</b> during CS <b>formation,</b> DAPT treatment was used to block Notch activity in tbx 2 a/b deficient embryos, and tbx 2 a/b knockdown was performed in NICD transgenic embryos. Both manipulations caused similar CS expansions, indicating that Notch functions upstream of the tbx 2 a/b genes to suppress CS ontogeny. Taken together, these data reveal {{for the first time that}} tbx 2 a/b mitigate pronephros segmentation downstream of RA, and that interplay between Notch signaling and tbx 2 a/b regulate CS formation, thus providing several novel insights into the genetic regulatory networks that influence these lineages...|$|R
