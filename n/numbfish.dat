5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete worms and crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} {{moderate}} electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> is {{a fairly}} {{inactive}} species that spends {{long periods of time}} buried motionless in sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (particularly those of the family Maldanidae) and crustaceans (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans. Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> can defend itself with a modest electric shock. Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Torpedo, the marbled {{electric}} ray belongs to the subgenus Torpedo, which differs from the other subgenus Tetronarce in having fringed margins on their spiracles and generally ornate dorsal coloration. Other common names for this species include common crampfish, marbled torpedo, <b>numbfish,</b> and spotted torpedo.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>numbfishes</b> are a {{group of}} {{electric}} rays (order Torpediniformes) in the family Narcinidae. They are bottom-dwelling cartilaginous fishes with large, rounded pectoral fin discs and long tails. They can produce an electric discharge for defense, from which their scientific name is derived (Greek narke, meaning [...] "paralysis").|$|R
50|$|Members of {{this family}} are {{commonly}} known as the <b>numbfishes,</b> and are found almost worldwide in warm temperate and tropical continental and continental insular waters. They are strictly marine, so are absent from rivers and lakes. They occur in sandy beaches, muddy enclosed bays, estuaries, off coral reefs and river mouths, and on the upper continental slope to a depth of 1,071 m.|$|R
50|$|<b>Numbfishes</b> vary {{in color}} from whitish or {{yellowish}} to brownish, grey-brown, greenish, reddish, or black above, either plain or with small to large spots, blotches, bars or lines, sometimes forming complex eye-shaped spots or ocelli on the pectoral fins. They are usually white underneath, or black in deep-water species. The large, kidney-shaped electric organs {{at the base}} of the pectoral fins are visible through the skin.|$|R
5|$|The Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> is {{frequently}} caught incidentally by trawlers of Australia's South East Trawl Fishery, which operate throughout its range. It is discarded after capture with an unknown, but probably high, rate of survival. Since this species {{does not appear}} to be threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> has a trowel-shaped {{pectoral}} fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly equal size and shape, with the first originating over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back, along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Numbfishes</b> are slow-swimming bottom-dwellers {{that feed}} on small fishes and {{invertebrates}} off the bottom; their protrusible jaws aid in removing prey from the substrate. They can generate a moderate shock if disturbed and contact {{is made with}} the electric organs; the electrical discharges of narcinids have been measured at 8-37 volts, {{much less than the}} electric rays of the genus Torpedo. All species are ovoviviparous, with eggs hatching inside the mother.|$|R
50|$|Small to {{medium-sized}} rays, adult <b>numbfishes</b> {{range from}} 15 to 66 cm long, though most {{are less than}} 50 cm. They have oval, rounded, or shovel-shaped pectoral discs and stout tails of equal or longer length. The snout is moderately elongated, rounded, or rounded-angular, differing from the narkids in being supported by broad rostral cartilages. The mouth is straight, with stout, elongated, and highly protrusible jaws and a prominent groove around its periphery. The nostrils are just forward of the mouth and connected to it by a broad groove; the nasal flaps are short, but merged into a broad nasal curtain that overlaps the mouth. The small teeth have a single moderate cusp; the teeth and tooth bands are exposed when the mouth is closed (except in Diplobatis). Two prominent dorsal fins of roughly equal size and a large caudal fin are present.|$|R
5000|$|Like other <b>numbfishes,</b> {{the giant}} {{electric}} ray can deliver a painful electric shock. This species is nocturnal and spends the day half-buried under sand. At night, it moves into shallow bays to feed, mostly on polychaete worms but perhaps also on sea squirts. It moves {{along the bottom}} by [...] "hopping" [...] on its flexible ribbed pelvic fins. If threatened by a predator, it exhibits a characteristic defense behavior in which it erupts from the bottom, arches its back, and performs a [...] "somersault" [...] in the water column. In one case, a diver was shocked when the ray landed on his back after such a maneuver. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by uterine [...] "milk" [...] produced by the mother. The females give birth to 4-15 young, measuring 11-12 cm (4.3-4.7 in) long. The reproductive cycle is annual, with ovulation and fertilization taking place in July and August. Males may exceed 11 years of age, and females 15 years.|$|R
500|$|Scottish naturalist John Richardson {{described}} the Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> in an 1841 contribution to Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. Classifying the new {{species in the}} genus Narcine, he gave it the specific epithet tasmaniensis as the holotype, a female [...] long, was collected from Port Arthur, Tasmania. Richardson noted that the ray was known locally as [...] "ground shark". Other common names for this species include electric ray, electric torpedo, little <b>numbfish,</b> and <b>numbfish.</b> In a 2012 phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA, Narcine {{was found to be}} polyphyletic, with the Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> belonging to a different lineage than the giant electric ray (N. entemedor).|$|E
500|$|Reproduction in the Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> is viviparous, {{with the}} {{developing}} embryos nourished to term via their yolk sacs. Females bear litters {{of one to}} eight pups (average eight); newborns measure [...] long. Males and females attain reproductive maturity at lengths of [...] and [...] respectively.|$|E
500|$|The {{common name}} [...] "coffin ray" [...] {{comes from the}} coffin-like shape of beached specimens, which become bloated after death. This species may also be {{referred}} to as crampfish, electric ray, <b>numbfish,</b> numbie, short-tail electric ray, or torpedo. Phylogenetic studies, based on morphology, have found that Hypnos is most closely related to the genus Torpedo. Hence, some taxonomists classify it with Torpedo in the family Torpedinidae (in its own subfamily, Hypninae). On the other hand, there are also taxonomists who believe Hypnos to be distinctive enough to merit its own separate family, Hypnidae.|$|E
500|$|The onefin {{electric}} ray or Cape <b>numbfish</b> (Narke capensis) {{is a common}} but little-known species of {{electric ray}} in the family Narkidae, native to South Africa and Namibia. It is a benthic fish found in shallow coastal bays over sandy or muddy bottoms. This small species reaches [...] in length, and has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc and a short, muscular tail that supports a large caudal fin. It can be identified by its single dorsal fin, which is located over the large pelvic fins. Its dorsal coloration is yellowish to dusky brown.|$|E
500|$|The Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> (Narcine tasmaniensis) is {{a species}} of {{electric}} ray in the family Narcinidae. Endemic to southeastern Australia, this common ray inhabits shallow continental shelf waters in the southern portion of its range and deeper continental slope waters in the northern portion of its range.

500|$|The Tasmanian <b>numbfish</b> {{is common}} off southeastern Australia; its range extends from Coffs Harbour in New South Wales to the Esperance Plains in Western Australia, and {{encompasses}} all of Tasmania. Around Tasmania, {{it can be}} found from inshore waters to a depth of [...] on the continental shelf. In more northerly waters, it inhabits the upper continental slope at depths of [...] This bottom-dwelling species favours a sandy or muddy substrate and is sometimes encountered in the vicinity of rocky reefs. Mature rays of both sexes appear to live apart from juveniles.|$|E
500|$|Hypnos monopterygius, {{also known}} as the coffin ray or Australian <b>numbfish,</b> is a species of {{electric}} ray endemic to Australia, where it is common in inshore waters shallower than [...] It is the sole member of its family [...] Hypnidae. This small species typically reaches [...] in length. Greatly enlarged pectoral fins and an extremely short tail, coupled with diminutive dorsal and caudal fins all concentrated towards the rear, give the coffin ray a distinctive pear-like shape. It is a varying shade of brown in color above, and has tiny eyes and a large, highly distensible mouth.|$|E
500|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the Atlantic torpedo was published in 1835 by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte, in his principal work Iconografia della Fauna Italica. Sixteen specimens were designated as the syntypes. The assignment of the southern African [...] "great torpedo" [...] to this species is provisional. Another type of electric ray found in the Indian Ocean off Mozambique may also belong to T. nobiliana. The Atlantic torpedo {{is placed in the}} genus Tetronarce, which differs from the other genus in the Torpedinidae family, Torpedo, in having generally plain coloration and smooth-margined spiracles.
