Yet the fourth proposition should be easily understood as a continuation of the general glut debate. Economists led by Malthus had argued that demand deﬁ ciency was the cause of recession and a body of unproductive consumers was needed to raise the level of demand if everyone who wished to work was to ﬁ nd employment. Mill&# 039;s answer was that to buy goods and services would not increase employment, or, in Mill&# 039;s own words, "demand for commodities is not demand for labour. "...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Complex {{formation}} between halloysites, from {{soil and}} geological sources, {{and a series}} of amides has been investigated. All the amides used can be intercalated to give single-layer complexes with basal spacings between 10. 4 A (for formamide) and 12. 4 A (for N,N-dimethylacetamide). When the interlayer space of halloysite has already been expanded by water, {{as is the case with}} fully hydrated samples, the rate and extent of intercalation depend more on the properties of the organic species than on the mineralogy of the clay. With partially and completely dehydrated halloysite, however, complex formation is influenced by the particle size, crystallinity, and iron content of the mineral. A large particle size, a high degree of crystallinity, and a low iron content are all conducive to complex formation. The iron content of halloysite also appears to affect particle shape. Low structural iron contents are associated with long tubular particles, intermediate contents with short and/or wide tubes, and high contents with spheroidal <b>nd</b> <b>other</b> non-tubular forms. Halloysites containing high amounts of extractable (non-structural) iron generally show a low intercalating ability. The ability of 1 : 1 type layer-silicates to form interlayer complexes with a wide range and variety of organic compounds has been known for a long time (MacEwan, 1946; Caill~re et al., 1950). Subsequent studies have been aimed at forming new complexes (Weiss et al., 1963, 1966; Carr & Hwa Chih, 1971), relating intercalation to the properties of the organic molecules (Olejnik et al., 1970), elucidating the structure of the resultan...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Reconstructions {{based on}} biogeography, palaeomagnetism andfacies {{distributions}} indicate that, in later Palaeozoic time, {{there were no}} wide oceans separating he major continents. During the Silurian and Early Devonian time, many oceans became narrower so that only the less mobile animals and plants remained distinct. There were several continental collisions: the Tornquist Sea (between Baltica and Avalonia) closed in Late Ordovician time, the Iapetus Ocean (between Laurentia and the newly merged continents of Baltica and Avalonia) closed in Silurian time, and the Rheic Ocean (between Avalonia and Gondwana and the separate parts of the Armorican Terrane Assemblage) closed (at least partially) {{towards the end of}} Early Devonian time. Each of these closures was reflected by migrations of non-marine plants and animals as well as by contemporary deformation. New maps, based on palaeomagnetic and faunal data, indicate that Gondwana was close to Laurussia during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, with fragments of Bohemia <b>nd</b> <b>other</b> parts of the Armorican Terrane Assemblage interspersed between. It follows that, after Early Devonian time, the Variscan oceans of central Europe can never have been very wide. The tectonic evolution of Europe during Devonian and Carboniferous time was thus more comparable with the present-day Mediterranean Sea than with the Pacific Ocean. Palaeozoic palaeoeontinents During the Palaeozoic era, there were several events when major continents rifted apart and others when they collided. No continent remained as a distinct entity throughout his era; so each palaeocontinent can only be defined after consideration of its history.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{tyrosine kinase}} activity of several growth factor receptors and retroviral oncogene prod-ucts suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation {{plays a key}} role in the processes of cell growth and transformation (for review, see Hunter and Cooper 1985, 1986). Al-though viral tyrosine kinases may bring about trans-formation through their overexpression r expression in a form lacking regulatory features present i their cellular counterparts, the activities of the growth factor receptor and proto-oncogene product yrosine kinases present in normal cells must be subject o strict control. By analogy with the well-characterized reversible phos-phorylation systems involving serine- or threonine-specific kinases and phosphatases (Krebs 1986), the activation of tyrosine kinases implies the functional existence of compatible tyrosine phosphatases. Such reversible tyrosine phosphorylations have been ob-served, for example, in the case of temperature-sensi-tive mutants of the pp 60 src tyrosine kinase, where the switch from a permissive to a nonpermissive t mpera-ture results in the loss of cellular phosphotyrosine and reversion of the transformed phenotype (Sefton et al. 1980) and in the dephosphorylation f the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in membrane vesicles incubated at 30 ~ following phosphorylation at 0 ~ (Carpenter et al. 1979; Brautigan et al. 1981). The phosphotyrosine phosphatases responsible for these phenomena <b>nd</b> <b>other</b> like enzymes potentially com-prise a primary mechanism for modulation or termina-tion of the activities and/or effects of their counterpart tyrosine kinases.

Este trabalho realiza um estudo do comportamento desse tipo de algoritmo sobre redes adhoc visando identi?car os fatores que podem in?u?nciar direta ou indiretamente a {{performance}} de uma aplica??o VoIP que os utilize como m?m?todo de localiza??o de seus n?s. More {{and more the}} demanding for mobility has been wanted by the users {{who want to have}} everything no matter where they are. The applications have been modi?ed in order to attend this needs demanded by the new environment without any predictable infrastructure or topology. The adhoc networks are very popular when concerning about non-infrastructures environment and many studies have been started looking for solutions and strategies to understand and adapt the applications originally created to work over client/server architecture. Voice over IP applications also have to be adapted to work properly over this environment and this study try to identify the factors which can impact on application performance.

40|$|Human activity-induced {{vibrations}} in slender structural sys tems {{become apparent}} {{in many different}} excitation modes and consequent action effects that cause discomfort to occupants, crowd panic and damage to public infrastructure. Resulting loss of public confidence in safety of structures, economic losses, cost of retrofit and repairs can be significant. Advanced computational and visualisation techniques enable engineers and architects to evolve bold and innovative structural forms, very often without precedence. New composite and hybrid materials that are making their presence in structural systems lack historical evidence of satisfactory performance over anticipated design life. These structural systems are susceptible to multi-modal and coupled excitation that are very complex and have inadequate design guidance in the present codes and good practice guides. Many incidents of amplified resonant response {{have been reported in}} buildings, footbridges, stadia a <b>nd</b> <b>other</b> crowded structures with adverse consequences. As a result, attenuation of human-induced vibration of innovative and slender structural systems very ofte n requires special studies during the design process. Dynamic activities possess variable characteristics and thereby induce complex responses in structures that are sensitive to parametric variations. Rigorous analytical techniques are available for investigation of such complex actions and responses to produce acceptable performance in structural systems. This paper presents an overview and a critique of existing code provisions for human-induced vibration followed by studies on the performance of three contrasting structural systems that exhibit complex vibration. The dynamic responses of these systems under human-induced vibrations have been carried out using experimentally validated computer simulation techniques. The outcomes of these studies will have engineering applications for safe and sustainable structures and a basis for developing design guidance...|$|R
