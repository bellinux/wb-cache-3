25|$|Lodge: Well, {{you are a}} {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. <b>Now,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E
25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to <b>now.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a scathing}} {{review of the}} first version, The New York Times critic Ben Brantley had said that Spider-Man may [...] "rank among the worst" [...] Broadway musicals. [...] In his review of the revised version, Brantley wrote, [...] "So is this ascent from jaw-dropping badness to mere mediocrity a step upward? Well, until last weekend ... I would have {{recommended}} Spider-Man only to carrion-feasting theater vultures. <b>Now,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew a less-than-precocious child of 10 or so, and had several hundred dollars to throw away, I would consider taking {{him or her to}} the new and improved Spider-Man." ...|$|E

[...] "If he keeps performing this way, he will definitely {{take a lot of}} wickets in international cricket. Now that he has come, I think I can play Test cricket a few more years.

2500|$|O'Brien, citing three {{anonymous}} {{people who}} worked with Trump, wrote {{in the book that}} Trump [...] "was not remotely close to being a billionaire," [...] stating that his actual net worth ranged between $150 million and $250 million. O'Brien also wrote that Trump was [...] "bored" [...] with Marla Maples {{at the time of their}} marriage: [...] "I was bored when she was walking down the aisle. I kept thinking, 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] O'Brien also stated that Trump was once asked by boxer Mike Tyson if he had an affair with his wife, Robin Givens. O'Brien quoted Trump: [...] "He said, 'Could I ask you, Are you fucking my wife?' <b>Now,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> froze, I'm dead ... You would have zero chance.

2500|$|Prior to the album's release T.I. {{decided to}} release a mixtape titled Fuck a Mixtape; the move was {{somewhat}} controversial due to its title, with many feeling he was insulting the Mixtape format. T.I. has addressed the issue by stating {{that it was a}} response to all the people who told him to just focus on an album and not on a mixtape. T.I. further defended his decision {{to release a}} mixtape by saying: [...] "I already have 60, 70 songs. A lot of these songs are period pieces that speak volumes to what's going on right <b>now.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> hold onto them next year or the year after, they'll be dated, because my life will be in another direction.

2500|$|In a 1986 Globe and Mail interview, Shaver {{said that}} she was being {{considered}} for a role in Joshua Then and Now, which would have promoted her career much farther than Desert Hearts. Donna Deitch assured her over the phone that she was right for her movie and told her she refused to hang up the phone until she got an answer. After five minutes, Shaver accepted the role. Shaver explained her feelings about the film. [...] "I was scared, not about the lesbianism [...] the script said, 'The passion builds' in the love scene, so once I knew how the passion built and where the camera would be, that was fine [...] but because someone wanted me to do what I'd wanted to do all along, and here it was, and all I had to do was say yes.

I'm back in movies now. I've got three lined up, {{and this is the}} fucking grand news. Tusk was the {{absolute}} bridge to Clerks III. Because of Tusk, I got my financing for Clerks III." [...] Smith continued, [...] "A year and change ago, I was trying to fucking desperately get Clerks III made for the 20th anniversary. And that desperation, I must have reeked of it, because I couldn't fucking find money and shit. But it was Tusk, it was people going 'Holy fuck! What else do you have?' And I was like, Clerks III, done. So everybody that's like, 'He failed, he failed,' thank you I failed into Clerks III. So, never trust anybody when they tell you how your story goes, man.

2500|$|Affleck became Lopez's muse {{when writing}} and {{recording}} the album. [...] "I wrote {{a lot of}} songs inspired, in a way, by what I was going through {{at the time that}} this album was being made, and he was definitely a big part of that," [...] she told MTV News. The singer took more of a [...] "hands-on role", co-writing more material than she had on her previous albums. The album was titled This Is Me... Then, as it was something she wanted to look back on in retrospection. Lopez explained, [...] "Who you are at that time, what kind of music you like, what kind of beats you're into, what kind of state of mind you're in, what you're attracted to ... it's all very telling of where you are in your life at that point. ... Twenty years from <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> give this [...] to one of my kids, I'll be like, 'This was me then, at that moment.'" [...] Lopez dedicated the album to Affleck, with the words [...] "You are my life ... my sole inspiration for every lyric, every emotion, every bit of feeling on this record" [...] written on the disc jacket.|$|E

2500|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1930s, Sturges operated under the strict auspices of the studio system, working on a string of scripts, some of which were shelved, sometimes with screen credit and sometimes not. While he was highly paid, earning $2,500 a week, he was unhappy with the way directors were handling his dialogue, and he resolved to take creative control of his own projects. He accomplished this goal in 1939 by trading his screenplay for The Great McGinty (written six years earlier) to Paramount in exchange for the chance to direct it. Paramount promoted the unusual deal as part of the film's publicity, claiming that Sturges had received just one dollar (in reality, he was paid $10 for legal reasons). Sturges' success quickly paved the way for similar deals for such writer-directors as Billy Wilder and John Huston. Sturges said, [...] "It's taken me eight years to reach what I wanted. But <b>now,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't run out of ideas – and I won't – we'll have some fun. There are some wonderful pictures to be made, and God willing, I will make some of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another artist, Brian Welch, whose solo debut was {{released}} to Christian markets, found their album pulled from some Christian bookstores after the music video for [...] "Flush" [...] {{was released}}. The video is {{an interpretation of}} the authors personal experience with methamphetamine, before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: [...] "The video for 'Flush' is about crystal meth addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're high or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right <b>now</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> continued using meth, but instead, I chose to surrender my life to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me... There is a huge message of hope on my CD and I believe those retailers that are pulling the CD from their shelves are robbing someone spiritually by taking it off of the shelves." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Yorke, {{many of his}} {{lyrics are}} {{motivated}} by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns, and written as [...] "a constant response to doublethink". The lyrics of the 2003 Radiohead album Hail to the Thief dealt with what he called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush and the unfolding War on Terror. Yorke wrote his 2006 solo single [...] "Harrowdown Hill" [...] about David Kelly, a whistleblower who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of mass destructions in Iraq. In a 2008 television performance of [...] "House of Cards", Yorke dedicated the chorus lyric, [...] "denial, denial", to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases. Despite his political concerns, in a November 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot, he said: [...] "In the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. It’s much harder to do that <b>now</b> ... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> was {{going to write a}} protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit. It’s not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someone’s mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ullman {{contends that}} her impersonations are played with great admiration and affection. [...] "I hope {{they take it}} in the right spirit!" [...] One person {{impersonated}} who's reacted positively to her portrayal as a kleptomaniac Dame who wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting public is actress Judi Dench. Dench's daughter, Finty Williams, posted a clip of Ullman playing her mother on Facebook with the caption, [...] "brilliant, just brilliant." [...] Critics also praised the impersonation, with one writer saying: [...] "Her impersonation of Dench is so spot on that, {{for a second or}} two, you can't be sure she is not the real deal. Her performance easily transcends the make-up thanks to her mastery of posture, gesture and facial control as well as pitch- perfect vocals." [...] While filming on location, on-lookers asked if they were filming a James Bond film after catching Ullman in character. At the 36th London Critics' Circle Film Awards, Judi Dench introduced herself as [...] "Tracey Ullman." [...] In April 2017, while speaking to BBC Radio 4's Front Row, Dench commented on Ullman's portrayal, saying that she doted on it, and dubbed Ullman as brilliant. [...] "But I get into trouble <b>now</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> go into a shop with a bag over my arm [...] A man came up to me in M the other day and said to me, 'I've got my eye on you'." ...|$|E
