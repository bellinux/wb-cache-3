5|$|During May {{we had a}} weird game at Bristol v. Gloucester. We scored 200 for 1 wicket. W. G. {{then went}} on and took 5 wickets, {{and we were all}} out for 300. He then {{proceeded}} to go in first and help himself to 288, and to get his hundredth century. I had the satisfaction of giving him a full pitch to get to his hundred, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted any help.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{was the son}} of Eata, who was {{descended from}} the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there. Ecgbert has been claimed to have been a student of Bede, who much later visited with Ecgbert in 733 at York, but this {{statement}} may simply mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, and <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was formally taught by him.|$|E
25|$|It {{should also}} be noted that it was usually only the frigates which took prizes; the ships of the line were far too {{ponderous}} to be able to chase and capture the smaller ships which generally carried treasure. Nelson always bemoaned that he had done badly out of prize money and even as a flag officer received little. This was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a bad command of captains but rather that British mastery of the seas was so complete that few enemy ships dared to sail.|$|E

25|$|Crabbe's {{shift in}} {{approach}} {{was not necessarily}} a bad thing. The flaw in Crabbe's poetry, however, is, according to Hazlitt, that, with all its detail, it misses much of life, emphasising much too heavily the oppressive and the squalid, along with the mean and malicious tendencies of human nature. Hazlitt points to ways in which all this might be incorporated into literature and yet made uplifting, as in tragedy. With Crabbe, we get mostly the oppressive. In this, Hazlitt finds Crabbe unimaginative. It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doesn't indulge in flights of fancy, but rather that he doesn't use his imagination to see, and help the reader see, into the minds and hearts of the poor, to feel what they feel in their situation. Instead, scrutinizing in detail the squalor of their surroundings, he attributes to them feelings he would have in their place.|$|E
25|$|Benítez {{has also}} had {{confrontations}} with Sam Allardyce when he was manager of Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers. When Allardyce was manager of Newcastle, he suggested Benítez would have been dismissed had Liverpool's European form been as bad as their league form. In a match in April 2009 when Allardyce was manager of Blackburn, he accused Benítez of arrogance over a gesture he made when Fernando Torres scored Liverpool's second goal. Allardyce suggested that Benítez had signalled {{the game was over}} despite Liverpool only having a two-goal lead. This view was later supported by Sir Alex Ferguson. Benítez, however, later explained this gesture: he said he had previously told Xabi Alonso to take a short free-kick. This instruction was ignored, which resulted in a goal. Benítez said that he had jokingly signalled to Alonso to ignore his instructions and <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought the game was effectively over.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{invited the}} author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and {{civilian}} at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so {{for the safety of the}} nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in a drawer and “never... see the light of day again.” The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis.|$|E

5000|$|Al-Warraq also doubted claims portraying Muhammad as a prophet: That Muhammad {{could predict}} certain events does <b>not</b> prove <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a prophet: {{he may have}} been able to guess successfully, but this does <b>not</b> mean <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had real {{knowledge}} of the future. And certainly the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was able to recount events from the past does <b>not</b> prove <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a prophet, because he could have read about those events in the Bible and, if he was illiterate, he could still have had the Old Testament read to him.|$|R

25|$|Marcus {{had much}} {{love and respect}} for his adoptive father. The tribute he gives Pius in the first book of the Meditations is the longest of any. He would have more {{influence}} on the young Marcus than any other person.From my father: gentleness and unshaken resolution in judgments taken after full examination; no vainglory about external honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had anything {{to contribute to the}} public advantage; the desire to reward every man according to his desert without partiality; the experience that knew where to tighten the reign, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E
500|$|The decision, by Judge Paul Breckenridge, {{found that}} Armstrong's fears of {{persecution}} by the Church were reasonable, and thus his conduct in {{turning over the}} documents in his possession to his attorneys was also reasonable. The judge issued a wide-ranging verdict, commenting of Hubbard that [...] "the evidence portrays {{a man who has}} been virtually a pathological liar {{when it comes to his}} history, background and achievements." [...] A few weeks later, a British judge ruled in a case heard at the Royal Courts of Justice that Hubbard had made a number of [...] "false claims" [...] about his military career: [...] "That he was a much decorated war hero. He was <b>not.</b> <b>That</b> <b>he</b> commanded a corvette squadron. He did <b>not.</b> <b>That</b> <b>he</b> was awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated. That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetics techniques. He was not crippled and was not blinded." [...] The judge, Mr. Justice Latey, noted: [...] "There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{story in}} the Cowboy-friendly newspaper, the Nugget, stated without {{attribution}} that [...] "The Sheriff stepped out and said : 'Hold up boys, don't go down there or there will be trouble; I have been down there to disarm them.'" [...] In his testimony, Behan repeatedly insisted he told the Earps that he only intended to disarm the Cowboys, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had actually done so. The article said that Behan [...] "was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it." [...] Given the Nugget close relationship to Behan (it was owned by Behan's deputy sheriff), it is likely they interviewed him. By Williams' account, Behan told Virgil Earp immediately after the gunfight a story that corroborated the Nugget report, which the newspaper altered afterward to a version that matched the story Behan later told at the coroner's inquest.|$|E

500|$|Regardless, Lee {{received}} Goodman's {{approval for}} the name Spider-Man and the [...] "ordinary teen" [...] concept, and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby [...] "immediately sat down for a story conference", Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, [...] "I hated {{the way he was}} doing it! <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did it badly—it just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic". Lee turned to Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|At 23:45, Farenholt and Laffey—still {{unaware of}} Gotō's {{approaching}} warships—increased speed to resume their stations {{at the front}} of the U.S. column. Duncans crew, however, thinking that Farenholt and Laffey were commencing an attack on the Japanese warships, increased speed to launch a solitary torpedo attack on Gotō's force without telling Scott what they were doing. San Franciscos radar registered the Japanese ships, but Scott was not informed of the sighting. By 23:45, Gotō's ships were only [...] away from Scott's formation and visible to Helenas and Salt Lake Citys lookouts. The U.S. formation at this point was in position to cross the T of the Japanese formation, giving Scott's ships a significant tactical advantage. At 23:46, still assuming that Scott was aware of the rapidly approaching Japanese warships, Helena radioed for permission to open fire, using the general procedure request, [...] "Interrogatory Roger" [...] (meaning, basically, [...] "Are we clear to act?"). [...] Scott answered with, [...] "Roger", only meaning that the message was received, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was confirming the request to act. Upon receipt of Scott's [...] "Roger", Helena—thinking they now had permission—opened fire, quickly followed by Boise, Salt Lake City, and to Scott's further surprise, San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Sherlock Holmes {{has been}} adapted {{numerous}} times for both films and plays, {{and the character}} has been played by over 70 different actors in more than 200 films. A number of film and television series have borne the title [...] "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", but {{some of these are}} either original stories, combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation of The Sign of the Four. Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia", is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story. Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty's Elementary and the BBC's Sherlock, even though in the story itself, the narration claims: [...] "It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler." [...] Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in the Granada Television series, Sherlock Holmes which ran from 1984 until 1994. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1990–1991, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. Bert Coules was the head writer, but stories were also written by Vincent McInerny and Peter Mackie, and directed by Patrick Rayner and Enyd Williams.|$|E
