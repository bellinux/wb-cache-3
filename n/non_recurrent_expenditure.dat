40|$|An {{important}} question is asked {{about the relationship between}} output and monetization of public servants wages and salaries structure: are variations in public servants wage and salaries plus monetization of fringe benefits transmitted to increase output, and do these variations in output constitute an important component of variations in monetization? Total <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> is regressed on wages and salaries and fringe benefits of public servants, monetization and real domestic absorption using General Moment Method (GMM). Again, the cost of governance equation which induces monetization is regressed on <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure,</b> labor and capital variables merged into one, capital stock and new salary package. The third equation expresses output as a function of cost of governance taking into account the possible effects of inflation, interest rate and new salary packed which include monetization booty. The empirical analysis is based on data from the Central Bank of Nigeria statistical Bulletin for the period of 1985 to 2010. The results show that wages and salaries, fringe benefits of public servants and monetization contribute significantly to <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> while the real domestic direct resources away from <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> towards capital expenditure. Again, variations in <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditures</b> are transmitted; they constitute the dominant component in the variations of cost of governance. In the output estimates, new salary package which has monetization as an important component varies in the right direction with output, and the implication is that new salary package through monetization increases productivity and output.

Using quarterly time series data, a clear pattern emerges of pre-election manipulations of fiscal policy by incumbent governments, mainly {{in the form of}} increased development spending and overall primary expenditure, followed in some cases by retrenchment in post-election periods. These findings are consistent with the predictions of rational opportunistic political business cycle theory. It is noteworthy that revenue was not statistically significantly related to elections, either in the pre- or post-election period. In this regard, electoral swings in fiscal deficits reflect a preference for influencing expenditures rather than taxation.

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{established}} that systematic intraoperative location and diligent dissection of the recurrent inferior laryngeal nerve during thyroidectomy are the keystones to assure its anatomic and functional preservation. The possibility of abnormal routes, like a non-recurrent cervical {{course of the}} inferior laryngeal nerve is an additional major argument for its systematic identification to avoid surgical damage. In 2517 cervicotomies performed between 1992 and 1997 for at least right thyroid lobe excision or parathyroid glands exploration, 20 cases of <b>non</b> <b>recurrent</b> laryngeal nerve were identified (0. 79 %). The embryological nature of such a nervous anatomical variation results originally from a vascular disorder, named arteria lusoria in which the fourth right aortic arch is abnormally absorbed, being therefore unable to drag the right recurrent laryngeal nerve down when the heart descends and the neck elongates during embryonic development.

40|$|Provides detail {{regarding}} {{trends in}} health expenditure between 2003 - 04 and 2013 - 14 for <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> and capital expenditure. Summary This report is {{a companion to}} Health expenditure Australia 2013 - 14. It provides more detail regarding trends in health expenditure between 2003 - 04 and 2013 - 14 for <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> and capital <b>expenditure.</b> <b>Recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> is categorised according to the whether the expenditure was on hospitals, primary health care, or other health goods and services. Of particular focus in this report are trends in the sources of funds for each category of health expenditure as well as variations between jurisdictions. Total expenditure by source of funds As noted in Health expenditure Australia 2013 - 14, over the decade from 2003 - 04 to 2013 - 14, <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> increased {{for all types of}} health goods and services, as did capital expenditure, and expenditure for all sources of funds. Growth in expenditure by governments has been relatively slow, however, over the past 2 years. In 2013 - 14, estimated Australian Government funding per person on health averaged $ 2, 725, which was $ 653 more in real terms than in 2003 - 04 but just $ 30 more in real terms than in the previous year. All state and territory governments except New South Wales reduced their per person expenditure in 2012 - 13. In 2013 - 14, Queensland, Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory continued to decrease their per person <b>expenditure.</b> Trends in <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> In 2013 - 14, $ 58. 8 billion was spent on Hospitals in Australia, $ 54. 7 billion on Primary health care and $ 32. 0 billion on Other health goods and services. Hospitals made up around 40 % of <b>recurrent</b> <b>expenditure</b> throughout the decade, Primary health care accounted for 38 % and the remaining 22 % was for Other health goods and services. In 2012 - 13 and 2013 - 14, Unreferred medical services attracted the highest share of Primary health care funding at 19. 1 % and 19. 3 %, respectively. This was different to earlier in the decade, when benefit-paid pharmaceuticals attracted the most spending from 2008 - 09 to 2011 - 12. Related to this, growth in expenditure on benefit-paid pharmaceuticals slowed in the last 3 years compared {{with the rest of the}} decade. This slower growth in expenditure was in contrast to a steady increase in the number of prescriptions dispensed over the same period; this suggests that slower expenditure growth in this case did not necessarily mean fewer services. Around 50 % of Other health goods and services expenditure is through Referred medical services, with an expenditure of $ 16. 1 billion in 2013 - 14. The fastest growth in expenditure on Referred medical services over the decade was by private health insurers (6. 1 %), who also had the highest growth in 2013 - 14 (5. 5 %). Trends in capital expenditure In 2013 - 14, there was $ 9. 1 billion in Capital expenditure related to health. There was a relatively rapid increase in Capital expenditure by the state and territory and local governments between 2009 - 10 and 2011 - 12, which was supported by the $ 5. 0 billion Health and Hospitals Fund established by the Australian Government in 2009.
