40|$|Version: 2 POLICY The Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) {{will provide}} ongoing {{financial}} assistance through the Guardianship Assistance Program (GAP) {{for the benefit}} of eligible children. See separate policy, 14. 1 Guardianship Assistance Program (GAP). The goal of this program is to promote permanency for children who may otherwise have their permanency delayed. Eligibility for Medicaid and the reimbursement of appropriate <b>Non-Recurring</b> <b>Expenses</b> (NRE) are not negotiated. Some eligible children may receive a periodic payment, as negotiated between the guardian and DCS. DCS will work collaboratively with families to understand and determine the current and ongoing needs of the child placed with guardians, and the costs of those needs, in order to assist the family in incorporating the child into the family. This policy outlines how such levels of assistance should be negotiated to determine the periodic payment amounts for guardianship assistance applicants who are determined to be eligible for guardianship assistance after July 1...|$|E

5000|$|First-pass success - As die sizes shrink (due to scaling), and wafer sizes go up (due {{to lower}} {{manufacturing}} costs), {{the number of}} dies per wafer increases, and the complexity of making suitable photomasks goes up rapidly. A mask set for a modern technology can cost several million dollars. This <b>non-recurring</b> <b>expense</b> deters the old iterative philosophy involving several [...] "spin-cycles" [...] to find errors in silicon, and encourages first-pass silicon success. Several design philosophies {{have been developed to}} aid this new design flow, including design for manufacturing (DFM), design for test (DFT), and Design for X.|$|R
2500|$|A threat {{representative}} Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) {{target for}} operational open-air testing {{has become an}} immediate test resource need. China is fielding the DF-21D ASBM, which threatens U.S. and allied surface warships in the Western Pacific. While the Missile Defense Agency has exo-atmospheric targets in development, no program currently exists for an endo-atmospheric target. The endo-atmospheric ASBM target is the Navy’s responsibility, {{but it is not}} currently budgeted. The Missile Defense Agency estimates the <b>non-recurring</b> <b>expense</b> to develop the exo-atmospheric target was $30 million with each target costing an additional $30 million; the endo-atmospheric target will be more expensive to produce according to missile defense analysts. Numerous Navy acquisition programs will require an ASBM surrogate in the coming years, although a limited number of targets (3-5) may be sufficient to validate analytical models ...|$|R
