5|$|Although males {{demonstrate}} little {{involvement in}} territorial disputes between <b>neighboring</b> communities, and ruffed lemur communities lack cohesiveness, females communally defend the community range against females of other communities. These disputes occur mostly during the hot, rainy season, when resources are more abundant and occur near {{the boundaries of}} community ranges. Spacing is maintained by scent marking and vocal communication. Ruffed lemurs {{are known for their}} loud, raucous calls that are answered by <b>neighboring</b> communities and subgroups within the same community.|$|E
