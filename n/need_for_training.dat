The containers should be visible in any areas that sharps are used and be placed in such degree that spillage and injury will not be likely to occur with use.|$|E
25|$|Oxen (singular ox) are cattle {{trained as}} draft animals. Often they are adult, {{castrated}} males of larger breeds, although females and bulls {{are also used}} in some areas. Usually, an ox is over four years old due to the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>training</b> and {{to allow it to}} grow to full size. Oxen are used for plowing, transport, hauling cargo, grain-grinding by trampling or by powering machines, irrigation by powering pumps, and wagon drawing. Oxen were commonly used to skid logs in forests, and sometimes still are, in low-impact, select-cut logging. Oxen are most often used in teams of two, paired, for light work such as carting, with additional pairs added when more power is required, sometimes up to a total of 20 or more.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Stewart was very happily still in command of the 2nd Battalion of the Argylls. Stewart {{was one of the few}} British officers to realise the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>training</b> in jungle warfare that would be necessary in order to defeat the Japanese in a war in Malaya. Due to this obsession with jungle training Stewart earned himself a reputation as a crank amongst the more traditional minded officers of Malaya Command. In early 1941 after his battalion had been transferred from India to Malaya, Stewart began rigorously training his men and developing new tactics to fight in all of the extreme and hostile natural terrain of Malaya. When the 2nd Argylls were thrown into the battle in early December 1941 they were to prove one of the few effective units the Japanese would face in their rapid advance down the peninsula, inflicting heavy casualties in every engagement. Sadly their effectiveness meant that they were continuously used as the buffer and suffered massive casualties as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Toastmasters {{originally}} began [...] as {{a series}} of short-lived speaking clubs organized by Ralph Smedley during his tenure with the YMCA.

As Smedley designed a club within the [...] "Y" [...] for speech training, he struggled for a name, until George Sutton, the general secretary, suggested calling it a Toastmasters club. The boys liked the name and the club was a success.|$|E
2500|$|After the Revolution, Rush {{proposed}} {{a new model}} of education for elite women that included English language, vocal music, dancing, sciences, bookkeeping, history, and moral philosophy. He was instrumental to the founding of the Young Ladies' Academy of Philadelphia, the first chartered women's institution of higher education in Philadelphia. [...] Rush saw little <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>training</b> women in metaphysics, logic, mathematics, or advanced science; rather he wanted the emphasis on guiding women toward moral essays, poetry, history, and religious writings. This type of education for elite women grew dramatically during the post-revolutionary period, as women claimed a role in creating the Republic. And so, the ideal of Republican motherhood emerged, lauding women's responsibility of instructing the young in the obligations of patriotism, the blessings of liberty and the true meaning of Republicanism. He opposed coeducational classrooms and insisted on the need to instruct all youth in the Christian religion.|$|E
