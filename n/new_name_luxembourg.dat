40|$|For some decades many {{villages in}} the Netherlands have been merging into new municipalities.

Attention will be paid to two types of <b>new</b> <b>names</b> that are chosen. The simplest solution is maintaining the name of one or more of the participants, but there is an important restriction: the <b>new</b> <b>name</b> should not be too long, and can do right only by few participants.
