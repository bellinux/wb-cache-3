500|$|From Autumn to Ashes {{formed on}} Long Island in 2000 with Francis Mark (drums, vocals), Steve Salvio (guitar) and Benjamin Perri (vocals) — Perri {{provided}} screaming vocals, while Mark sung clean vocals. Commenting {{on the name}} of their band, Scott Gross (guitar) said, [...] "you are absolutely <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> right answer on this one because that would pretty much end the band" [...] and that [...] "no one is going to know the reason {{and we are going to}} keep it that way." [...] The term [...] "Autumn" [...] refers to both the season and a fictional character the band created. Mark and Gross planned to use the character in a book. For the first few months as a touring band, From Autumn to Ashes claimed to have sold half of their equipment, a car, and spent between $3,000 and $4,000 making demos and hand distributing them.|$|E

Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series?

Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember. There have been peaks and troughs, like with any show, but right now things are good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their first {{project was}} to assess the {{administration}} of voter registration and elections in Montgomery, Alabama. [...] But they immediately ran into resistance. Circuit Judge George C. Wallace, who was elected as governor in support of white supremacy, ordered voter registration records to be impounded. [...] "They are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> records," [...] he said. [...] "And if any agent of the Civil Rights Commission comes down to get them, they will be locked up. ... I repeat, I will jail any Civil Rights Commission agent who attempts to get the records." [...] The hearing went forward with no shortage of evidence. Witness after witness testified to inappropriate interference with his or her right to vote. The Commissioners spent the night at Maxwell Air Base, because all the city's hotels were segregated.|$|E

2500|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétien's use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might [...] But you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and I've got to put people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident {{that he was going to}} win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|E

Hudson was not in good health and was taken ill on 9 December 1871 whilst visiting York. He returned by train to London and died 5 days later, aged 71. His body was taken by train from Euston Station to York where the hearse drove through the streets. Many turned out to pay last respects and shop owners lowered their window blinds as a mark of respect. Hudson was buried at the parish church at Scrayingham on 21 December in accordance with his wishes.|$|E

5000|$|On February 1, 2011 {{the song}} [...] "Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart" [...] was {{digitally}} previewed via online streaming. Thursday intentionally selected this song to preview first {{because it was}} the most radically different song off of No Devolución when compared to their older material. Geoff Rickly described releasing a heavier song as [...] "false advertising," [...] and by releasing [...] "Magnets Caught in a Metal Heart" [...] the group would send the message to their fans: [...] "You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> record you think you're going to get." [...] The song [...] "Past and Future Ruins" [...] became available for online streaming on February 22, 2011, and [...] "No Answers" [...] became available the following month on March 22.|$|E

[...] Marcia took it from him, thinking she was protecting a document from potentially being ruined, and in horror saw her name {{at the top of the}} list. According to Herodian, she cried out, [...] "Well done, indeed, Commodus. This is fine return for the kindness and affection I have lavished on you and for the drunken insults which I have endured from you all these years.

But joining up the core path network that Highland Council had to develop for access under the land reform legislation would be feasible". The project also received support from John Thurso, then the MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. However, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, who the Dunnet Head Education Trust had had discussions with, stated in 2010 that the project did not fit its remit for funding.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, Detroit mayor David Bing {{introduced}} {{a plan to}} demolish approximately 10,000 of an estimated 33,000 vacant homes in the city because they were “vacant, open, and dangerous.” The decision was driven by the reality that for financial constraints, the city's existing resources simply could not maintain providing services to all areas. However, the decision also reflected a desire to “right-size” Detroit by relocating residents from dilapidated neighborhoods to “healthy” ones. The idea of right-sizing and repurposing Detroit, however, is a contentious issue. Some locals are determined to stay put in their homes while others compare the efforts to past segregation and forced relocation. Mayor Bing clarified that people would {{not be forced to}} move, but residents in certain parts of the city [...] "need to understand they're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> kind of services they require." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Branford et al., [...] "technology {{does not}} {{guarantee}} effective learning" [...] and inappropriate use of technology can even hinder it. A University of Washington study of infant vocabulary shows that it is slipping due to educational baby DVDs. Published in the Journal of Pediatrics, a 2007 University of Washington study on the vocabulary of babies surveyed over 1,000 parents in Washington and Minnesota. The study found that for every one hour that babies 8-16 months of age watched DVDs and Videos they knew 6-8 fewer of 90 common baby words than the babies that did not watch them. Andrew Meltzoff, a surveyor in this study states that the result makes sense, that if the baby's 'alert time' is spent in front of DVDs and TV, instead of with people speaking, the babies are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same linguistic experience. Dr. Dimitri Chistakis, another surveyor reported that the evidence is mounting that baby DVDs are of no value and may be harmful.|$|E

Filipe poses the {{question}} that what if they eliminated Kristin because she's the bigger threat and then something worse happened to Laura's hip. They all feel that if she stays, Laura may not take the precautions necessary to protect herself. Helen and Tara vote to eliminate Kristin, while Mike, Ron, and Filipe vote for Laura, thus eliminating Laura from The Biggest Loser. The viewers do not hear her dismissed with the [...] "you are not the biggest loser" [...] phrase that Alison usually states whenever a contestant is eliminated from the show.

5000|$|Benjamin Boles from Now {{gave the}} album 3 stars out of 5, {{saying that the}} band does not sound [...] "exactly eclectic in mood, sound or even tempo" [...] and noticing that [...] "the best moments come when they shy away from their {{trademark}} wall-of-reverb blueprint". He concluded that [...] "it's a better album than their last, and diehard fans should be satisfied, but it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> rest ... very excited". Josh Modell of Spin gave the album a score of 5 out of 10 and found it [...] "more dull than hypnotic". He felt that [...] "it tries to assemble skyscrapers, but ends up muddling around without a strong foundation" [...] and noticed that Interpol sounds [...] "both strangely distant and overly familiar, like a band struggling to remember who they are". [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described it as [...] "bits and pieces of promising music without strong foundations", and stated that although [...] "the band sounds terrific", the album does not offer [...] "more {{than one or two}} truly memorable songs".|$|E

[...] "So I told him I was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up either. So he said, 'If you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up, I will get a policeman.'" [...] The police arrived and {{convinced}} a black man sitting behind the two women to move so that Mrs. Hamilton could move back, but Colvin still refused. She was forcibly removed from the bus and arrested by the two policemen, Thomas J. Ward and Paul Headley. This event took place nine months before the NAACP secretary Rosa Parks was famously arrested for the same offense. Claudette Colvin: [...] "My mother told me to be quiet about what I did.
