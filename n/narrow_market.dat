40|$|This study {{examined}} the sociometric characteristics of consumers 2 ̆ 7 interpersonal communication networks {{and the effects of}} market characteristics, consumer perceptions, psychological traits, and social tendencies on those networks. ^ It was hypothesized that consumers 2 ̆ 7 communication networks would vary with the market breadth of the product/service under investigation. For services of wider (versus <b>narrower)</b> <b>market</b> breadth, networks were hypothesized to be larger in size and characterized by stronger and more homophilous ties. Sociometric properties were also expected to vary with consumers 2 ̆ 7 independence in decision making and tendencies toward social affiliation. Other hypotheses theorized about the relationship between perceived risk and the qualification and safety credibility of the activated tie. ^ Survey data obtained from personal interviews with customers of four services was used to test these hypotheses. ^ As expected, consumers communication networks for services of wider (versus <b>narrower)</b> <b>market</b> breadth are characterized by stronger and more homophilous ties and have greater overlap with consumers 2 ̆ 7 primary social networks. Contrary to expectations, however, networks for services of <b>narrower</b> <b>market</b> breadth tend to be larger than those for services of wider market breadth. ^ While tie strength and homophily are not related to network density, as expected, stronger and more homophilous ties are more apt to be multiplex ties. That is, more closely linked and more similar network members are more apt to discuss multiple products/services. ^ As theorized, network size and homophily are inversely related to consumers 2 ̆ 7 independent judgment making, but the expected positive relationships between consumers 2 ̆ 7 role accumulation and these sociometric properties are not present. In addition, contrary to expectations, consumers with more roles have networks with stronger ties. ^ The hypothesized relationships between perceived (performance and psychosocial) risk and source characteristics (qualification and safety credibility, tie strength, and homophily) are not present. Furthermore, the safety credibility of the ties is unrelated to consumers 2 ̆ 7 independent judgment making. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study investigates {{whether the}} effect of {{industry}} specialization on audit fees depends on industry regulation and use of <b>narrower</b> <b>market</b> definitions. Two regulated industries (SIC 131 and SIC 602) and two non-regulated industries (SIC 357 and SIC 581) were selected for testing. Specialists in non-regulated industries are expected to charge higher fees than specialists in regulated industries, because scale economies are more likely in regulated industries. The {{results are consistent with}} specialists in non-regulated industries being able to charge higher audit fees. Specialist fee effects were not greater using narrower state and regional market share measures of specialization...|$|R
5000|$|Micro{{marketing}} is {{a marketing}} strategy in which marketing and/or advertising efforts {{are focused on}} {{a small group of}} tightly targeted consumers.For example, markets can be grouped into narrow clusters based on commitment to a product class or readiness to purchase a given brand. The approach requires a company to define very <b>narrow</b> <b>market</b> segments, and tailor offers or campaigns for that segment. Although, the approach can be more expensive due to customization and difficulties attaining scale economies, advancements in technology have facilitated the delivery of highly customised products to small groups or even individual customers. Nike ID [...] and Shoes of Prey [...] are often cited as practical examples of this approach. It should be evident that micromarketing is closely related to the concept of mass-customisation.|$|E
50|$|In {{adopting}} a narrow focus, the company ideally {{focuses on a}} few target markets (also called a segmentation strategy or niche strategy). These should be distinct groups with specialised needs. The choice of offering low prices or differentiated products/services should depend {{on the needs of}} the selected segment and the resources and capabilities of the firm. It is hoped that by focusing your marketing efforts on one or two <b>narrow</b> <b>market</b> segments and tailoring your marketing mix to these specialized markets, you can better meet the needs of that target market. The firm typically looks to gain a competitive advantage through product innovation and/or brand marketing rather than efficiency. A focused strategy should target market segments that are less vulnerable to substitutes or where a competition is weakest to earn above-average return on investment.|$|E

In March 1992, SGI announced it was acquiring MIPS Computer Systems, which became a subsidiary of SGI called MIPS Technologies, Inc. (MTI) in mid-1992. Development of the R8000 was transferred to MTI, where it continued. The R8000 {{was expected to be}} introduced in 1993, but it was delayed until mid-1994. The first R8000, a 75 MHz part, was introduced on 7 June 1994. It was priced at US$2,500 at the time. In mid-1995, a 90 MHz part appeared in systems from SGI. The R8000's high cost and <b>narrow</b> <b>market</b> (technical and scientific computing) restricted its market share, and although it was popular in its intended market, it was largely replaced with the cheaper and generally better performing R10000 introduced January 1996.|$|E

40|$|In a {{study of}} artists who {{launched}} independent record labels {{in the music industry}} from 1990 to 2013, we focus on explaining the paradox generated when prospective entrepreneurs accumulate broad functional experience, which signals to resource providers mastery of different skills and access to various information and resources but may also undermine the legitimacy of their entrepreneurial claims because they are not seen as specialists. To resolve this paradox, we theorize that the potential legitimacy discount of categorical membership can be avoided when individuals are classified according to multiple categories simultaneously. We find that the transition to entrepreneurship is most likely to occur when an artist’s functional experience is broad but market experience is narrow: he or she has mastered a variety of skills but solicited few audiences. We also find that the paradox of breadth is attenuated—the potential penalty of functional breadth and the corresponding need to develop <b>narrow</b> <b>market</b> experience are reduced—when the entrepreneur has alternate methods of signaling legitimacy, including high status and more-typical prior work experience. Moreover, some audiences are more disposed than others to allow an entrepreneur to pursue greater novelty. Our findings suggest that mastering a variety of skills is not universally beneficial for aspiring entrepreneurs. In some circumstances, such mastery is best coupled with a <b>narrow</b> <b>market</b> focus...|$|E
