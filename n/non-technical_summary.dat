40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{increasing}} {{implications for the}} economic and social life of the UK, as the reports of the UKCIP 1 and the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 20122 make clear. In particular, it will impact on the performance of our built environment – our buildings and the civil infrastructure that supports our urban communities and our communications networks. Recognising this, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council has funded successive programmes of research aimed at improving understanding of the impact of climate change on the built environment and into means of improving its adaptability and resilience. A recent phase of this research brought together a number of research projects, including COPSE, under the umbrella of the Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change (ARCC) Co-ordination Network (CN) 3. The ARCC CN has sought to develop close links between those directly involved in the research, who are principally in universities, and prospective users of the outputs, such as policy-makers, architects and engineering consultants. To that end, it has held conferences and technical events, published summaries of the research programmes and issued regular newsletters, with the aim of promoting the outputs of the research and facilitating their application. This publication further contributes to that overall aim. Academic research is, rightly, first published in peer-reviewed journals where it can be subject to the scrutiny of other researchers, and the findings compared with those of similar studies. Journal publications are often, though, not easily accessible for practitioners who will be principally concerned with the findings and their implications rather than the methods through which they were obtained. By contrast, short <b>non-technical</b> <b>summaries</b> do not provide a suitable basis for application of the findings. This publication seeks to fill that gap, in that it offers an overview of the COPSE project which, while summarising the research undertaken, gives most attention to the outputs and their relevance for practitioners. By also providing full details of the publications from COPSE research, it facilitates further investigation by those who wish to take advantage of latest research findings...|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. (Geography) Over {{the last}} three years, a number of {{environmental}} impact assessment reports (EIARs) pertaining to renewable energy (RE) projects have been submitted for environmental authorisation in South Africa. However, the quality of EIARs have been criticised internationally {{as well as in}} South Africa. Poor quality EIARs has the potential to negatively impact environmental decision-making processes and therefore it is vital to provide baseline data regarding the appraisal of such EIARs in South Africa. The present study has evaluated the quality of basic assessment reports (BARs) dealing with RE projects in South Africa. This is crucial in providing key insights to environmental management practice, especially if we are {{to determine whether or not}} RE projects have the potential to achieve sustainable development goals linked to clean development mechanisms (CDMs). Apart from assessing quality aspects, the goal of the study was also to analyse the strengths and weaknesses inherent in the EIARs involved. To address the research problem adequately, the Lee-Colley Review Package was utilised with minor adaptations where feasible. Based on the analyses derived from the review package selected, the overall quality of EIARs was found to be 70 % satisfactory whilst 80 % of the overall scores were borderline quality grades. The review areas pertaining to the description of the development and environment, together with the identification and evaluation of impacts, were better performed than the review areas concerning alternatives, mitigation measures and communication aspects of the EIARs. The strengths of the EIA processes related to the description of the project (purpose, objectives and nature) and site descriptions. Weaknesses of EIARs pertaining to RE projects were identified as insufficient <b>non-technical</b> <b>summaries</b> and poor summaries of the main issues. The review categories pertaining to waste management, mitigation measures and emphasis were not graded as weaknesses of the EIARs. Nevertheless, low numbers of satisfactory quality scores were documented for these review categories, which are particularly concerning. The fairly marginal quality of EIARs pertaining to RE projects may be attributed to lack of sufficient (human resources) capacity and transparency throughout the EIA process in South Africa. These aspects became evident through vague descriptions of impact prediction methods, insufficient elucidation of mitigation measures, a high degree of subjectivity and generally poor communication of EIA results to stakeholders involved. Apart from these findings, the study also made some recommendations for further studies such as the need to examine the following EIA aspects, namely, (1) the characterisation and reduction of elements of subjectivity within existing reports, (2) an assessment of the effectiveness of screening processes in South Africa and (3) the identification of obstacles and barriers hindering effective communication in the presentation of EIA results...|$|R
