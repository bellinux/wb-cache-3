5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome {{received}} a mixed critical reaction from reviewers upon launch, being praised for its visuals, story and high production values but criticized for its repetitive and simple gameplay. Cevat Yerli, CEO of Crytek, {{added that he}} was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the sales of the game. Upon launch, the game was supported with several multiplayer-focused downloadable content, but the originally planned Challenge Editor was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|However, Prime Minister Churchill was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> Ironside's progress, {{especially}} with regard {{to the creation of a}} mobile reserve. Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War, suggested that Ironside should be replaced by General Brooke (later Viscount Alanbrooke). On 17 July 1940 Churchill spent an afternoon with Brooke and was soon convinced that they were in close agreement as to how best to defend the nation. On 19 July Brooke replaced Ironside.|$|E
5|$|The Finns assured Yartsev that Finland was {{committed}} to a policy of neutrality, and the country would resist any armed incursion. Yartsev was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the reply, given Finland's military weakness. He suggested that Finland could cede, or lease, some islands in the Gulf of Finland along the seaward approaches to Leningrad, a suggestion the Finns rejected. Earlier in the mid-1930s, the Soviet ambassador in Helsinki, Eric Assmus, and the Leningrad Bolshevik party leader Andrei Zhdanov, had presented a similar proposal.|$|E

5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house under cover of {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes attributed the outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children and their mother were then bound and locked in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E
5|$|After being {{signed by}} Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{released}} their self-titled debut album in 1973 to poor sales. Although it was praised by critics, {{the band was}} <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> producer Todd Rundgren's sound for the album and had disagreements with him before choosing not to retain him. Songwriting and production partners Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were originally enlisted to produce their next album, while the band's guitarist Johnny Thunders wanted to produce it himself. However, Leiber and Stoller withdrew shortly before recording was to begin. The group held a single session with Mercury A executive Paul Nelson at Media Sound Recording Studios, where they recorded 14 songs, {{most of which were}} covers.|$|E
5|$|After the 1962 season, the Yankees sold Turley to the Los Angeles Angels for cash, in {{the first}} move made by new Yankees' general manager Roy Hamey, who sought to rebuild the Yankees {{pitching}} staff. The move was conditional; the Angels could return Turley if they were <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> him. The Angels chose to retain Turley {{at the start of}} the 1963 season. Turley struggled, winning two games while losing seven, and the Angels released him in July. A week later, he signed with the Boston Red Sox. Turley retired after the 1963 season, with a 101–85 win–loss record and a 3.64 ERA in 12 seasons.|$|E

5|$|Braham was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> {{his current}} score-rate {{and lack of}} action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of {{missions}} against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Cryptic Writings is {{the seventh}} studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth. Released on June 17, 1997 through Capitol Records, {{it was the}} band's last studio album to feature drummer Nick Menza. His {{departure}} would {{mark the end of}} the band's longest lasting lineup to date, having recorded four studio albums. Megadeth decided to produce the record with Dann Huff in Nashville, Tennessee, because they were <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> their previous producer Max Norman. The album features 12 tracks with accessible song structures, specifically aimed for radio airplay. The lyrics were also altered, {{in order to make the}} music more inclusive for wider audience. These changes were met with mixed opinions from music critics, who noted the band moving away from their thrash metal roots.|$|E
5|$|Daphne's {{marriage}} to Des Clarke (Paul Keane) {{was central to}} many of her storylines. After a brief relationship with Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) and two engagements, Daphne married Des in July 1986. She gave birth to their son, Jamie (S.J. Dey), in July 1987. That same year, Smith announced her departure from Neighbours. Not wanting to kill off a popular character, the producers sent Daphne {{to care for her}} dying father. However, viewers were <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> this ending and Smith returned to conclude Daphne's storyline. The actress asked for Daphne to be killed-off and the producers agreed. She made her final appearance on 25 March 1988, becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E

5|$|Early enemy designs {{included}} tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado, however, was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> {{the enemy}} movements; technical limitations {{made it difficult}} to simulate flying. Humans would have been easier to simulate, but Nishikado considered shooting them immoral. After seeing a magazine feature about Star Wars, he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds—he had watched the 1953 film adaptation as a child—and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. The game was originally titled Space Monsters, inspired by a popular song in Japan at the time ("Monster"), but was changed to Space Invaders by Nishikado's superiors.|$|E
5|$|Gautier was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> this story. It was {{basically}} a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|Giulio Cesare made port visits in the Levant in 1919 and 1920. Both Giulio Cesare and Conte di Cavour {{supported}} Italian {{operations on}} Corfu in 1923 after an Italian general {{and his staff}} were murdered on Corfu; Benito Mussolini was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the Greek government's response so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. Cesare became a gunnery training ship in 1928, after having been in reserve since 1926. She was reconstructed at Cantieri del Tirreno, Genoa, between 1933 and 1937. Both ships participated in a naval review by Adolf Hitler in the Bay of Naples in May 1938 and covered the invasion of Albania in May 1939.|$|E

5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Conte di Cavour {{sailed to}} North America and visited ports in the United States {{as well as}} Halifax, Canada. Giulio Cesare made port visits in the Levant in 1919 and 1920. Conte di Cavour was mostly {{inactive}} in 1921 because of personnel shortages and was refitted at La Spezia from November to March 1922. Both battleships supported Italian operations on Corfu in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff were murdered on the Greco-Albanian border; Benito Mussolini was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the Greek Government's response so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island. Conte di Cavour bombarded the town with her 76mm guns, killing 20 and wounding 32 civilians.|$|E

The producers also announced that the film would be released during the Diwali 2012 weekend. Chopra said the film was untitled at that time, similar to previous project Veer-Zaara (which was named {{on the day of}} its submission to the Central Board of Film Certification). The producers considered a number of titles but were <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> any of them. In September 2012, it was announced that the title of the film was Jab Tak Hai Jaan. It was inspired by a similarly titled song from the 1975 film, Sholay.|$|E

5|$|On 23 November, it was {{announced}} that the families of each victim of the fire would receive 960,000 yuan in compensation for the ordeal. The compensation would include 650,000 yuan for every death and 310,000 yuan in financial assistance from the government and charities. Zhang Renliang, the top official of Jing'an District, said that Shanghai residents and foreign workers would be compensated equally. Survivors of the blaze would be fully compensated for the loss of possessions and property. Some who lost relatives in the disaster, however, were <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> the announcement. They said that the compensation plan was not enough to pay for another apartment in the district, and that they would rather have a new apartment than the money.|$|E
5|$|Option C is {{a concept}} in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the {{championship}} {{in exchange for a}} World Heavyweight Championship match at that year's Destination X event. It began in June 2012 when then-champion Austin Aries said that he was <b>not</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> being just the X Division Champion, which led to then-General Manager Hulk Hogan offering him a match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but only if he first vacated the X Division Championship. Aries agreed to Hogan's terms, on the condition that the X Division Champion be given the same opportunity in future years. Aries would then relinquish the X Division Championship and successfully defeated Bobby Roode for the World title.|$|E
