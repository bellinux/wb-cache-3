5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E

25|$|Ranks are {{assigned}} based on subjective dissimilarity, {{and do not}} fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists. Furthermore, some groups have many described species <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> more diverse than other species, {{but because they are}} more easily sampled and studied than other group.|$|E

Piper asserts that Israel has rights from God to dwell in that land, but <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> merely Jewish, and Jews who reject Jesus as Messiah have no divine right of claim on those promises. Piper also believes that all Christians, Jew or Gentile, will inherit the earth, including the land of Israel, when Christ sets up the Millennial Kingdom in the Second Coming.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, women wearing hijab {{have been}} subject of verbal and {{physical}} attacks in Western countries, particularly following terrorist attacks. Louis A.

500|$|Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan {{states that}} the Upanishads have {{dominated}} Indian philosophy, religion and life ever since their appearance. The Upanishads are respected <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> considered revealed (Shruti), but because they present spiritual ideas that are inspiring. The Upanishads are treatises on Brahman-knowledge, that is knowledge of Ultimate Hidden Reality, and their presentation of philosophy presumes, [...] "it is by a strictly personal effort that one can reach the truth". In the Upanishads, states Radhakrishnan, knowledge is a means to freedom, and philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom by a way of life.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the central}} {{arguments}} of Wollstonecraft's Rights of Men is that rights should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> traditional. While Burke argued that civil society and government should rely on traditions which had accrued over centuries, Wollstonecraft contends that all civil agreements are subject to rational reassessment. Precedence, she maintains, {{is no reason to}} accept a law or a constitution. As one scholar puts it, [...] "Burke's belief in the antiquity of the British constitution and the impossibility of improvement upon a system that has been tried and tested through time is dismissed as nonsense. The past, for Wollstonecraft, is a scene of superstition, oppression, and ignorance." [...] Wollstonecraft believed powerfully in the Enlightenment notion of progress, and rejected the contention that ancient ideas could not be improved upon. Using Burke's own architectural language, she asks, [...] "why was it a duty to repair an ancient castle, built in barbarous ages, of Gothic materials?" [...] She also notes, pointedly, that Burke's philosophy condones slavery: ...|$|E

The two schools were once conference foes in the Southwest Conference and have {{maintained}} a rivalry {{despite the fact that}} Texas enjoys a sizable lead in the series. President John F. Kennedy alluded to the lopsidedness of the rivalry in his 1962 speech on America's space program: [...] "But why, some say, the moon? ... And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain. Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?... We choose to go to the moon... and do the other things, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> easy, but because they are hard." [...] In addition to continuing a traditional rivalry, playing Rice in a home and away series allows for Texas to play games in Houston, Texas, an important recruiting base for UT, which has a significant Texas Exes alumni population.|$|E

500|$|The season {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics. Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or <b>not,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Open Brethren meetings, each local {{assembly}} is independent and autonomous, so {{the characteristics of}} each may differ {{to a greater or}} lesser degree, which makes it difficult to generalize when describing distinctive characteristics.

This is <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> opposed to the central sentiments and doctrines expressed in such formulations, but rather because they hold the Bible as their sole authority in regard to matters of doctrine and practice. In the last two decades, however, some Brethren assemblies have adopted statements of faith, generally emphasizing fundamentalist doctrines.
