There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, ambulance services, midwives and medical doctors.

5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's <b>Nordic</b> <b>Mobile</b> <b>Telephone</b> equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Communication via <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> is {{widespread}} in East Asian metropolis such as Seoul, Taipei and Tokyo. In {{the last ten}} years, the number of <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> users has increased dramatically, with the younger generation in particular depending on the services available via <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones.</b> This paper explores {{the relationship between the}} voice and text messaging communications of these young consumers through their <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> and their interpersonal relations. It analyses how <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> usage affects relationships between respondents by comparing models of the cause-effect relationship of several latent factors in different environments, namely dependency on <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> communication, perception of friendships, individual factors and IT literacy. By applying a covariance structure analysis, the correlations between latent and observable variables can be successfully visualized. The results show that <b>mobile</b> <b>telephones</b> have little influence on the perception of relationships among the younger generation, although somewhat different structures of interdependency exist in these metropolitan areas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} respond to recent {{increases}} {{in the number of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> users, three frequency bands are currently used for <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> systems.

We first developed a two-band antenna called the Double Modified Transmission Line Antenna (DMTLA) that consists of two simplified MTLA of different lengths. By attaching a parasitic element to the DMTLA based on the multi-band technique using parallel transmission line loading, we realize the three-band Double Modified Transmission Line Antenna (3 -B DMTLA) for the base station antenna of a <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> system.
