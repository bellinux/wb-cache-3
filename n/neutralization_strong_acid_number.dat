We characterize here both experimentally and theoretically such buoyancy-driven instabilities induced by the <b>neutralization</b> of a <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> by a <b>strong</b> base in aqueous solutions. The diverse patterns obtained are shown {{to depend on the}} type of reactants used and on their relative concentrations. They have their origin in a combination of classical hydrodynamic instabilities including differential diffusion of the solutes involved while temperature effects only play a marginal role...|$|R
40|$|In acid- base titrations, {{indicators}} {{are used to}} show a sharp color changes at interval of pH. Natural pigments in plants are highly colored substances and may show color changes with variation of pH. An attempt {{has been made to}} investigate the indicator activity of root extract of golden beet root and to replace the synthetic indicators as they have certain disadvantages like chemical pollution, availability problems and high cost. A study has been done to investigate the indicator activity of aqueous extract of root pigments and compared with that of already existing synthetic indicators. Pigments were extracted using hot water and a definite volume was added which gave accurate and reliable results for all the four different types of <b>neutralization</b> titrations - <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> against <b>strong</b> base, <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> against a weak base, weak <b>acid</b> against <b>strong</b> base and weak acid against weak base.

40|$|Pd/MgO, Pd/MgF 2 and Pd/MgO-MgF 2 {{catalysts}} {{were investigated}} in {{the reaction of}} CCl 4 hydrodechlorination. All the catalysts deactivated in time on stream, but the degree of deactivation varied from catalyst to catalyst. The MgF 2 -supported palladium with relatively large metal particles appeared the best catalyst, characterized by good activity and selectivity to C 2 -C 5 hydrocarbons. Investigation of post-reaction catalyst samples allowed to find several details associated with the working state of hydrodechlorination catalysts. The role of support acidity was quite complex. On the one hand, a definite, although not very high Lewis acidity of MgF 2 is beneficial for shaping high activity of palladium catalysts. The MgO-MgF 2 support characterized by stronger Lewis acidity than MgF 2 contributes to very good catalytic activity for a relatively long reaction period (~ 5 h) but subsequent <b>neutralization</b> of <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> centers (by coking) eliminates them from the catalyst. On the other hand, the role of acidity evolution, which takes place when basic supports (like MgO) are chlorided during HdCl reactions, is difficult to assess because different events associated with distribution of chlorided support species, leading to partial or even full blocking of the surface of palladium, which {{plays the role of}} active component in HdCl reactions...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} phosphorus-zeolite H-ZSM- 5 interactions, {{a variety of}} phosphorus-modified zeolite H-ZSM- 5 materials were studied in a multi-spectroscopic manner. By deploying single pulse 27 Al, 31 P MAS NMR, 2 D heteronuclear 27 Al- 31 P correlation (HETCOR), 27 Al MQ MAS NMR spectroscopy, TPD of pyridine monitored by FT-IR spectroscopy, and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) the interplay and influence of acidity, thermal treatment and phosphorus on the structure and acidity of H-ZSM- 5 were established. It was found that while acid treatment {{did not affect the}} zeolite structure, thermal treatment leads to the breaking of Si-OH-Al bonds, a decrease in the <b>strong</b> <b>acid</b> site <b>number</b> and the formation of terminal Al-OH groups. No extra-framework aluminium species was observed. Phosphorus precursors interact with the zeolitic framework through hydrogen bonds and physical coordination, as phosphorus species can be simply washed out with hot water. After phosphatation and thermal treatment two effects occur simultaneously, namely (i) phosphorus species transform into water insoluble condensed poly-phosphoric acid and (ii) phosphoric acid binds irreversibly to the terminal Al-OH groups of partially dislodged four-coordinated framework aluminium, forming local silico-aluminophosphate interfaces. These interfaces are potentially the promoters of hydrothermal stability in phosphated zeolite H-ZSM- 5. © the Partner Organisations 2014...|$|R

40|$|The {{selective}} oxidation of o-xylene on catalysts {{based on}} mesoporous titanium phosphate-supported vanadium oxide has been studied. The catalysts {{were characterized by}} different physico-chemical techniques (XRD, XPS, N 2 isotherms, TPD of chemisorbed NH 3 and Raman spectroscopy). The conversion and yield to phthalic anhydride increased with vanadium oxide loading up to one theoretical monolayer. Beyond this point, no substantial improvement was achieved. Moreover, a significant improvement in the yield of phthalic anhydride, coinciding with {{a decrease in the}} formation of carbon oxides, was observed when potassium was incorporated to the vanadium catalysts. The enhancement of the phthalic anhydride yield was correlated with the <b>neutralization</b> of the <b>stronger</b> surface <b>acid</b> centers by the K+ ions, providing evidence for the hypothesis that <b>stronger</b> <b>acid</b> sites are involved in the formation of total oxidation products (carbon oxides). ...|$|R

The modified oils and their resultant <b>acid</b> <b>numbers</b> were: A (2.09 mg KOH/g), B (0.75 mg KOH/g), C (0.47 mg KOH/g), D (0.30 mg KOH/g), and E (0.18 mg KOH/g). Contact angles and improved Amott water indexes were measured to {{study the effects of}} temperature and <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> on the wettability of the acid volcanic reservoir rock. Experimental results indicated that the wettability was not sensitive to variation in temperature when using the same oil, but the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of the crude oil was a key factor in changing the wettability of the rock. The Amott water index, Iw was an exponential function of the <b>acid</b> <b>number,</b> and the Amott water index increased as the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> decreased (i.e. Amott water index exponentially decreased with the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> increase). The Iw value of the core saturated with oil A, with an <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of 2.09 mg KOH/g, ranged from 0.06 to 0.11, which indicated low water wetness. If the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of the oil decreased to 0.18 mg KOH/g, the Iw value increased to 0.95, which indicated strong water wetness. The contact angle decreased from 80 ° to 35 ° when the aid number decreased from 0.75 to 0.18 mg KOH/g, indicating a change towards more water wet conditions. The oil recovery by spontaneous imbibition of water also increased as the <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of the oil decreased. As an example, at 80 °C, the recovery of Oil A with an <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of 2.09 mg KOH/g was only 7.6 %, while Oil E with an <b>acid</b> <b>number</b> of 0.18 mg KOH/g produced 56.4 %, i.e. an increase of 48.8 %.|$|R
