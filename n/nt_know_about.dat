40|$|For various reasons, North American crop {{farmers are}} more likely to {{practice}} limited-duration no-till than continuous no-till (<b>NT).</b> Little is <b>known</b> <b>about</b> effects of short-term no-till (ST-NT) on organic C and total N relative to NT and conventional-till systems. A field experi-ment was initiated in 1980 to study the effects of NT, chisel plow (CP), and moldboard plow in continuous corn (CC; Zeamays L.) and soy-bean (Glycinemax. L.) –corn (SC) rotations on dark prairie soil. In 1996, the moldboard treatments were split into a ST-NT subplot and an intermittently chisel-plowed (STI-CP) subplot that was chiseled only before corn. In 2003, soil samples were taken incrementally to the 1. 0 -m depth from NT, CP, ST-NT, and STI-CP plots. Soil C and N accumu-lation was unaffected by rotation system at any depth interval. Tillage treatments significantly affected soil C and N concentrations only in the upper 50 cm. On an equivalent soil mass basis, C storage to 1. 0 m after 24 yr totaled 151 Mg ha 21 in continuous NT, but just 108 Mg ha 21 in continuous CP. Short-term no-till and STI-CP systems resulted in 26 and 21 Mg ha 21, respectively, more soil C than CP. Total N storage was similar for NT and ST-NT systems, but was significantly lower (4 Mg ha 21 less) with CP. Our results suggest that the combination of moldboard plowing (17 yr) followed by short-term (6 – 7 yr) no-till or in-termittent chisel was generally superior to continuous chisel plowing (24 yr) in soil C and N contents. BENEFITS ASSOCIATED with long-term NT for soil or-ganic C sequestration and total N accumulation can be substantial (Dick et al., 1989). Several studies have shown that conservation tillage (i. e., residue from pre-vious crops cover at least 30 % of the soil surface after planting) practiced for extended periods of time, in-creased soil organic C and N content of the surface soil (Allmaras et al., 2000; Eghball et al., 1994; Dick, 1983). However, the benefits of no-till vary with such factors as location (McConkey et al., 2003), landscape position (VandenBygaart et al., 2002), depth of sampling (Potter et al., 1998, 1997; Karlen et al., 1994; Balesdent et al., 1990), or cropping systems (Diekow et al., 2004; Duike...|$|R

To connect to that alignment, construction began in 1911 from Westgate (21 km south of Charleville) in a westerly direction. The First World War hampered construction, which ceased in April 1917, making Quilpie the effective terminus. Despite suggestions after the war that construction be recommended, the GWR project was never re-activated. Quilpie (population 560) became the loading point for significant numbers of cattle from western areas. The line is still known as the Great Western line by QR.|$|R
