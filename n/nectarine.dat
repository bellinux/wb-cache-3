25|$|Peacherine {{is claimed}} to be a cross between a peach and a <b>nectarine,</b> and are marketed in Australia and New Zealand. The fruit is {{intermediate}} in appearance between a peach and a <b>nectarine,</b> large and brightly colored like a red peach. The flesh of the fruit is usually yellow, but white varieties also exist. The Koanga Institute lists varieties that ripen in the Southern Hemisphere in February and March.|$|E

25|$|The peach (Prunus persica) is a {{deciduous}} tree {{native to}} the region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes of the Kunlun Shan mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated. It bears an edible juicy fruit called a peach or a <b>nectarine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Peach and <b>nectarines</b> are {{the same}} species, {{even though they are}} {{regarded}} commercially as different fruits. In contrast to peaches, whose fruits present the characteristic fuzz on the skin, <b>nectarines</b> are characterized by the absence of fruit-skin trichomes (fuzz-less fruit); genetic studies suggest <b>nectarines</b> are produced due to a recessive allele, whereas peaches are produced from a dominant allele for fuzzy skin.|$|R
40|$|Chemical-physical properties, colour parame ters, {{antioxidant}} activities (AA), carotenoid and polyphenol levels (CL) {{in seven}} cultivars of yellow flesh peaches, five cultivars of yellow flesh <b>nectarines</b> and one cultivar of white flesh <b>nectarines</b> at harvest time and after 7 days of cold storage were evaluated. Peaches had major variability in flesh firmness (FF) and titratable acidity (TA) and lower soluble solid concentration (SSC) than <b>nectarines.</b> Evaluation of ground colour parameters, a*, b* and L*, showed that <b>nectarines</b> had a yellow-orange hue with high lightness, while peaches were darker, tending to red-green. Hydrophilic, lipophilic antioxidant activities of extracts (W-AA and L-AA), carotenoids and polyphenols levels (CL and PL) were evaluated and their relation with commercial maturation. The average of W-AA at harvest time was 11. 0 TEAC, while the L-AA values at harvest time was on average higher in peaches (2. 0 TEAC) than in <b>nectarines</b> (1. 3 TEAC). 'The yellow flesh had higher amounts of total carotenoids (182. 45 ug/l 00 g fw for peaches and 117. 37 ug/ 100 g fw for yellow flesh <b>nectarines).</b> During cold storage, W-AA increased for <b>nectarines</b> (+ 22. 9 % in yellow flesh and + 19. 2 % in white flesh) and peaches {{as well as}} polyphenolic compounds (+ 13. 37 %) while, contents of carotenoids decreased (- 8. 7 %) ...|$|R

25|$|As with peaches, {{nectarines}} can {{be white}} or yellow, and clingstone or freestone. On average, nectarines are slightly smaller and sweeter than peaches, but with much overlap. The lack of skin fuzz can make <b>nectarine</b> skins appear more reddish {{than those of}} peaches, contributing to the fruit's plum-like appearance. The lack of down on nectarines' skin also means their skin is more easily bruised than peaches.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of {{peach and}} <b>nectarine</b> cultivars are known. These are {{classified}} into two categories—the freestones and the clingstones. Freestones are those whose flesh separates readily from the pit. Clingstones are those whose flesh clings tightly to the pit. Some cultivars are partially freestone and clingstone, so are called semifree. Freestone types are preferred for eating fresh, while clingstone types are for canning. The fruit flesh may be creamy white to deep yellow; the hue and {{shade of the}} color depends on the cultivar.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the <b>nectarine</b> is unclear; the first {{recorded}} mention in English is from 1616, but they had probably been grown much earlier within the native range of the peach {{in central and eastern}} Asia. Although one source states that nectarines were introduced into the United States by David Fairchild of the Department of Agriculture in 1906, a number of colonial-era newspaper articles make reference to nectarines being grown in the United States prior to the Revolutionary War. 28 March 1768 edition of the New York Gazette (p.3), for example, mentions a farm in Jamaica, Long Island, New York, where nectarines were grown.|$|E

6000|$|Hence it may {{be worth}} while to give all the {{evidence}} {{on the origin of}} the <b>nectarine.</b> The facts in themselves are curious, and will hereafter have to be referred to when the important subject of bud-variation is discussed. It is asserted (10/37. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 6 page 394.) that the Boston <b>nectarine</b> was produced from a peach-stone, and this <b>nectarine</b> reproduced itself by seed. (10/38. Downing's 'Fruit Trees' page 502.) Mr. Rivers states (10/39. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1195.) that from stones of three distinct varieties of the peach he raised three varieties of nectarine; and in one of these cases no <b>nectarine</b> grew near the parent peach-tree. In another instance Mr. Rivers raised a <b>nectarine</b> from a peach, and in the succeeding generation another <b>nectarine</b> from this <b>nectarine.</b> (10/40. 'Journal of Horticulture' February 5, 1866 page 102.) Other such instances have been communicated to me, but they need not be given. Of the converse case, namely, of nectarine-stones yielding peach-trees (both free and clingstones), we have six undoubted instances recorded by Mr. Rivers; and in two of these instances the parent nectarines had been seedlings from other nectarines. (10/41. Mr. Rivers in 'Gardener's 'Chronicle' 1859 page 774, 1862 page 1195; 1865 page 1059; and 'Journal of Hort.' 1866 page 102.) ...|$|E

60|$|Two {{explanations}} {{have been}} suggested to account for these conversions. First, that the parent trees have been in every case hybrids (10/53. Alph. De Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 886.) between the peach and <b>nectarine,</b> and have reverted by bud-variation or by seed {{to one of their}} pure parent forms. This view in itself is not very improbable; for the Mountaineer peach, which was raised by Knight from the red nutmeg-peach by pollen of the violette hative <b>nectarine</b> (10/54. Thompson in Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 911.), produces peaches, but these are said SOMETIMES to partake of the smoothness and flavour of the <b>nectarine.</b> But let it be observed that in the previous list no less than six well-known varieties and several unnamed varieties of the peach have once suddenly produced perfect nectarines by bud variation: and it would be an extremely rash supposition that all these varieties of the peach, which have been cultivated for years in many districts, and which show not a vestige of a mixed parentage, are, nevertheless, hybrids. A second explanation is, that the fruit of the peach has been directly affected by the pollen of the nectarine: although this certainly is possible, it cannot here apply; for we have not a shadow of evidence that a branch which has borne fruit directly affected by foreign pollen is so profoundly modified as afterwards to produce buds which continue to yield fruit of the new and modified form. Now it is known that when a bud on a peach-tree has once borne a <b>nectarine</b> the same branch has in several instances gone on during successive years producing nectarines. The Carclew <b>nectarine,</b> on the other hand, first produced half-and-half fruit, and subsequently pure peaches. Hence we may confidently accept the common view that the <b>nectarine</b> is a variety of the peach, which may be produced either by bud-variation or from seed. In the following chapter many analogous cases of bud-variation will he given.|$|E
