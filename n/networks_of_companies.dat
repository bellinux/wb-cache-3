Business intelligence (BI) platforms are aimed at serving individual companies, and they cannot operate over <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> characterized by an organizational, lexical, and semantic heterogeneity. In this chapter we propose a framework, called Business Intelligence Network (BIN), for sharing BI functionalities over complex <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> that are chasing mutual advantages through the sharing of strategic information. A BIN is based on a network of peers, one for each company participating in the consortium. Peers are equipped with independent BI platforms that expose some querying functionalities aimed at sharing business information for the decision-making process. After proposing an architecture for a BIN, we outline the main research issues involved in its building and operating, and we focus on the definition of an ad hoc language for expressing semantic mappings between the multidimensional schemata owned by the different peers, aimed at enabling query reformulation over the network...|$|E

30|$|Flexibility is a {{major issue}} in {{business}} today and one answer to that is to organize work in <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> rather than within a single business. Cooperation between organizations is more easily established and adapted than reorganization of internal company structures. But how do we manage flexibility in such a network without sacrificing the minimum stability that is required for economic success? We suggest a method for coordinating interaction in a business network that provides three levels of flexibility: local ad-hoc change, global negotiated change and planned change. This method is based on the negotiation and enactment of process-based interorganizational contracts.|$|E

40|$|Locational factors, {{like the}} {{quantity}} and quality of skilled labour, demanding customers, competitors, supporting industries, and research institutions, are assumed to have an influence on the competitiveness of a region and the performance of the regional actors.

Our study tries to close this gap: a sample of 128 German innovation <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> and research institutes in the energy sector is used to analyse the effects of locational factors on the performance (effectiveness) of innovation projects. Based on the distinctions in Porter’s Diamond Model, we find that two locational factors—the quality and quantity of the demand conditions and skilled labour—have positive effects. In contrast to the widespread assumption in the literature we could not find evidence for positive impacts on the quality and quantity of the competitive environment. In fact, the effect on performance was negative...|$|E
40|$|While {{the digital}} games {{industry}} {{has become increasingly}} marketised and professionalized in its forty years of commercial existence, {{at the same time}} it has maintained some of its DIY roots and is somewhat ahead of other media industries in its attempts to facilitate and appropriate amateur productions.

The digital game industry is used today in media and communication studies both as an example of "co-creative culture" (Jenkins, 2006; Raessens, 2005) and of "precarious labour" (Kline, Dyer-Witheford, & De Peuter, 2003; Kücklich, 2005; Postigo, 2003 and 2007; Terranova, 2004).

40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for certain social networks to divide into two opposing camps in response to stress. This happens, for example, in networks of political parties during winner-takes-all elections, in <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> competing to establish technical standards, and in networks of nations faced with mounting threats of war. A simple model for these two-sided separations is the dynamical system dX/dt = X^ 2 where X is a matrix of the friendliness or unfriendliness between pairs of nodes in the network. Previous simulations suggested that only two types of behavior were possible for this system: either all relationships become friendly, or two hostile factions emerge. Here we prove that for generic initial conditions, these are indeed the only possible outcomes. Our analysis yields a closed-form expression for faction membership {{as a function of the}} initial conditions, and implies that the initial amount of friendliness in large social networks (started from random initial conditions) determines whether they will end up in intractable conflict or global harmony.
