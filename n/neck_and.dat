5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} <b>neck</b> <b>and,</b> especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} (X) {{provides}} sensory and autonomic (parasympathetic) motor innervation to {{structures in the}} <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> also {{to most of the}} organs in the chest and abdomen.|$|E
50|$|The {{skin tone}} of the Twili is mostly black while their faces, <b>necks,</b> <b>and</b> chest tend to have gray and {{patterns}} in a marked contrast {{to the rest of}} their bodies.

40|$|In {{order to}} predict <b>necking</b> <b>and</b> {{fracture}} phenomena, a crystal plasticity model is {{introduced in the}} finite element analysis of tensile tests. Grains having different orientations are subjected to numerical tensile tests. A damage model is also proposed to predict the sudden drop of load carrying capacity after <b>necking</b> <b>and</b> to reflect the void nucleation and growth on the severely deformed region. From the analyses of tensile test, the <b>necking</b> <b>and</b> fracture phenomena are well predicted...|$|R

5|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus, Pearson planned {{to come out}} of {{retirement}} in 1989, replacing the injured Neil Bonnett in the Wood Brothers' No. 21 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Following testing for the event, however, he suffered severe <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> back pain, and chose instead to announce his retirement; Tommy Ellis replaced Pearson for the race.|$|E

5|$|Based on his {{research}} for the book and mini-series The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was not killed by a mortar, but by small arms fire that {{hit him in the}} right groin and the <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> nearly took off his left arm.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female adult red-backed fairywren may utilise the {{rodent-run}} display to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> tail are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E
5|$|Dark-plumaged {{immature}} birds may {{be confused}} with turkey vultures, but soar with flat wings, while the pale plumaged adults could feasibly {{be confused with}} the wood stork, although the latter's long <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> legs allow for easy recognition from afar.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{beyond this}} point a neck forms where the local {{cross-sectional}} area becomes significantly {{smaller than the}} original.
