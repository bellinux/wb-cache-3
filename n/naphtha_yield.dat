40|$|Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit is {{the pump}} house of any refinery. Distillation is the initial {{step in the}} {{processing}} of crude oil and the residue which is coming out from the distillation column enters as the feed in the FCC unit. Gasoline is the main product of the FCC unit and it also produces byproduct which is more olefinic and hence more valuable. Simulation of the fractional distillation {{has been done to}} find out the feed composition which is the feed to the riser reactor. The unit was further simulated under the desired specifications to get the <b>naphtha</b> <b>yield</b> and compared with the plant data. Different graphs were plotted by varying feed temperature, flow rate, catalyst to oil ratio and were successfully compared with the modeled data. Further simulation was done with two regenerators and production of SOx was studied. The simulation result concludes that the SOx emission is lesser in case of one regenerator. Two sets of catalyst were chosen and the final yields were compared. Based on the plant requirement different types of catalyst are used. Finally the effect of riser height was studied in one riser and dual riser by keeping the operating parameters to be same and concluded with the fact that <b>naphtha</b> <b>yield</b> increases in case of dual riser...|$|E
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ING+LGU:FLC:CMI:YSCInternational audienceCo-refining {{of biomass}} derived {{pyrolysis}} liquids (PL) in a Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit with crude oil fractions is a promising route to produce second generation biofuels. To improve the yield and ensure co-processed fuel quality, a hydrotreating step can be deployed prior to co-processing. In this paper the conversion, yields and naphtha or gasoline composition are analyzed during a 10 wt. % PL/ 90 wt. % vacuum gasoil (VGO) co-processing step {{as a function}} of the PL hydrotreating severity, expressed in terms of hydrogen consumption. The <b>naphtha</b> <b>yield</b> was not impacted by the hydrotreatment procedure and always slightly higher than that of pure VGO cracking. An optimum in the naphtha quality in terms of octane rating was found {{as a function of}} the PL upgrading severity. The optimum was achieved with mildly hydrotreated PL's, corresponding to a H- 2 consumption of 202 NL/kg(PL). These mildly hydrotreated PL's led to similar coke formation during co-refining as pure VGO cracking. These results indicate that the upgrading of PL's should be restricted to a hydrogen consumption of less than 200 NL/kg(PL). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|A {{discrete}} model utilizing three parameters {{has been developed}} to simulate the yields of an industrial hydrocracking unit. Refinery test runs spanning over two years of operation were gathered and used to validate the model and check the simulation results. The simulator predicts the yields of LPG, light naphtha, heavy naphtha, kerosene, diesel and residue. The heavy <b>naphtha</b> and diesel <b>yields</b> were maximized by minimal changes in the operating conditions. Small changes in the catalyst loading and recycle ratio can significantly improve yields of these important cuts...|$|R
40|$|Two direct coal liquids were {{evaluated}} by linear programming analysis to determine their value as petroleum refinery feedstock. The first liquid, DL 1, was produced from bitiuminous coal using the Hydrocarbon Technologies, Inc. (HTI) two-stage hydrogenation process in Proof of Concept Run No. 1, POC- 1. The second liquid, DL 2,was produced from sub-bituminous coal using a three-stage HTI process in Proof of Concept Run No. 2, POC- 2; the third stage being a severe hydrogenation process. A linear programming (LP) model was developed which simulates a generic 150, 000 barrel per day refinery in the Midwest U. S. Data from upgrading tests conducted on the coal liquids and related petroleum fractions in the pilot plant testing phase of the Refining and End Use Study was inputed into the model. The coal liquids were compared against a generic petroleum crude feedstock. under two scenarios. In the first scenario, {{it was assumed that}} the refinery capacity and product slate/volumes were fixed. The coal liquids would be used to replace a portion of the generic crude. The LP results showed that the DL 1 material had essentially the same value as the generic crude. Due to its higher quality, the DL 2 material had a value of approximately 0. 60 $/barrel higher than the petroleum crude. In the second scenario, it was assumed that a market opportunity exists to increase production by one-third. This requires a refinery expansion. The feedstock for this scenario could be either 100 % petroleum crude or a combination of petroleum crude and the direct coal liquids. Linear programming analysis showed that the capital cost of the refinery expansion was significantly less when coal liquids are utilized. In addition, the pilot plant testing showed that both of the direct coal liquids demonstrated superior catalytic cracking and <b>naphtha</b> reforming <b>yields.</b> Depending on the coal liquid flow rate, the value of the DL 1 material was 2. 5 - 4. 0 $/barrel greater than the base petroleum crude, while the DL 2 material was 3. 0 - 4. 0 /barrel higher than the crude. Co-processing the coal liquids with lower quality, less expensive petroleum crudes that have higher sulfur, resid and metals contents was also examined. The coal liquids have higher values under this scenario, but the values are dependent on the prices of the alternative crudes...|$|R
40|$|Biomass as {{a product}} of {{photosynthesis}} is a renewable resource {{that can be used for}} sustainable production of hydrogen. Direct production of hydrogen from biomass by gasification/water-gas shift technology is economically unfavorable, except for very low cost feedstocks and very large plants. An alternative strategy, with potentially better economics, results from the combined production of hydrogen with valuable co-products. The concept is based on a two-stage process: fast pyrolysis of biomass to generate bio-oil, followed by catalytic steam reforming of the oil or its fractions to produce hydrogen. The preferred option is to separate bio-oil into a lignin-derived fraction that could be used for producing phenolic resins or fuel additives, and a carbohydrate-derived material that would be steam reformed to produce hydrogen. In order to increase the hydrogen production in a biomass-based plant, co-reforming of the bio-oil fraction and natural gas has also been considered. The co-product strategy can also be applied to residual fractions derived from pulping operations and from ethanol production. Effluents from other biomass conversion technologies such as transesterification of vegetable oils and food processing residues (trap grease) can also be attractive low-cost feedstocks for the production of hydrogen. This work focused on catalytic steam co-reforming of (a) carbohydrate-derived fraction of bio-oil and natural gas and (b) trap grease. We employed a fluidized bed reactor configuration with commercial nickel catalysts developed for processing natural gas and <b>naphtha.</b> The hydrogen <b>yields</b> obtained were 80 - 90 % of the potential values for stoichiometric conversion of feed to CO 2 and H 2...|$|R
