5|$|To {{support the}} deployment, the UN leased {{a number of}} mine-protected {{vehicles}} from the SADF. Most were Buffels, but smaller numbers of Casspir and Wolf vehicles were also leased. These vehicles had excellent mobility, and were well-suited to operations in the harsh <b>Namibian</b> terrain. The contingent also trialled thermal-intensifier technologies, in what {{is thought to be}} the first operational use of this technology.|$|E
5|$|UNTAG was {{the first}} {{instance}} of a large-scale, multidimensional operation where the military element supported the work of other components concerned with border surveillance: monitoring the reduction and removal of the South African military presence; organising the return of <b>Namibian</b> exiles; supervising voter registration and preparing, observing, and certifying the results of national elections.|$|E

5|$|The {{next year}} the <b>Namibian</b> War of Independence began when the South-West Africa People's Organisation's (SWAPO) {{military}} wing – the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) – began guerrilla attacks on South African forces, infiltrating from bases in Zambia. The first attack was the battle at Omugulugwombashe on 26 August, and the war was a classic insurgent-counterinsurgent operation. PLAN initially established bases in northern Namibia; they were later {{forced out of the}} country by the South African Defence Force (SADF), subsequently operating from bases in southern Angola and Zambia. The intensity of cross-border conflict escalated, becoming known as the South African Border War and the Angolan Bush War.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the family}} Theraphosidae, which {{includes}} tarantulas and baboon spiders, have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers. These hairs are fine setae (bristles) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip. The barbs cause intense irritation {{but there is no}} evidence that they carry any kind of venom. A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs, giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles. The golden wheeling spider, Carparachne aureoflava, of the <b>Namibian</b> desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|Southwest Africa has a {{rich history}} {{encompassing}} colonisation, war and genocide. The first European {{to set foot}} on <b>Namibian</b> soil was the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão in 1485. Over the next 500 years, the country was colonised by the Dutch, English and Germans. Namibia was a German colony (German South-West Africa) from 1884 until its annexation by South Africa during World War I. After the war, it was mandated to South Africa by the League of Nations. After World War II the United Nations (UN) asked South Africa to place Namibia under UN trusteeship, but South Africa refused. Legal arguments continued until 1966 when the UN General Assembly resolved to end the mandate, declaring that henceforth South-West Africa was the direct responsibility of the UN.|$|E
5|$|The role of UNTAG was {{to assist}} the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG), Martti Ahtisaari, in {{overseeing}} {{free and fair elections}} in Namibia for a Constituent Assembly. The elections were to be carried out by the South African Administrator General, under UN supervision and control, and this Assembly would then draw up a constitution for an independent Namibia. UNTAG was tasked with assisting the SRSG in ensuring that all hostile acts ceased; South African troops were confined to base, and ultimately withdrawn; discriminatory laws were repealed, and political prisoners released; <b>Namibian</b> refugees were permitted to return (when they were known as returnees); intimidation was prevented, and law and order maintained.|$|E

5|$|Under dos Santos's leadership, Angolan troops {{crossed the}} border into Namibia {{for the first time}} on 31 October, going into Kavango. The next day, dos Santos signed a non-aggression pact with Zambia and Zaire. In the 1980s, {{fighting}} spread outward from southeastern Angola, where most of the fighting had taken place in the 1970s, as the National Congolese Army (ANC) and SWAPO increased their activity. The South African government responded by sending troops back into Angola, intervening in the war from 1981 to 1987, prompting the Soviet Union to deliver massive amounts of military aid from 1981 to 1986. The USSR gave the MPLA more than US$2billion in aid in 1984. In 1981, newly elected United States President Ronald Reagan's U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Chester Crocker, developed a linkage policy, tying <b>Namibian</b> independence to Cuban withdrawal and peace in Angola.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1962 that Australia voted for a UN {{resolution}} condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister Garfield Barwick. Initially in opposition, until he was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was a vocal advocate of independence for Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting <b>Namibian</b> independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, were active internationally in their support of independence for Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia {{was involved in the}} UN process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, and two years later it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia. Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978, and made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.|$|E
5|$|South African cheetah (A. j. jubatus) (Schreber, 1775): Also {{called the}} <b>Namibian</b> cheetah. The {{nominate}} subspecies {{and the most}} numerous of the cheetahs. Occurs in southern African countries such as Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique and Zambia. Went extinct from Lesotho and southern Congo-Kinshasa. Introduced in the Hlane Royal National Park of Swaziland and reintroduced in the Liwonde National Park of Malawi. Separated from the Asiatic cheetah nearly 0.32–0.67 million years ago. In 2007 the population was roughly estimated at less than 5,000 to maximum 6,500 adult individuals. The South African cheetah populations are increasing in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. Once thought to be extinct for 30 years, wild cheetahs were reported to persist Iona National Park in southwestern Angola {{for the first time}} in 2010. Since 1999, they suffered a massive decline in Zimbabwe, as well as in Mozambique following the civil wars during 1980-90s. Not listed by the IUCN.|$|E

50|$|A further {{request was}} made for states to re-examine {{bilateral}} treaties with South Africa {{in so far as}} these treaties applied to the territory. The Security Council also requested the Secretary-General to examine all multilateral treaties with South Africa in so far as they applied to the territory, that the United Nations Council for Namibia to make available to it the results of its studies and proposals with regard to the issuance of passports and visas for <b>Namibians,</b> and that the General Assembly set up a fund to provide assistance to <b>Namibians</b> who have suffered persecution and to finance a comprehensive educational and training program for <b>Namibians</b> in the territory.

5|$|Various {{species of}} tick {{commonly}} infest the ears, neck and groin regions of most lions. Adult forms of {{several species of}} the tapeworm genus Taenia have been isolated from intestines, the lions having ingested larval forms from antelope meat. Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) in 1962; this resulted in lions becoming covered in bloody bare patches and emaciated. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many perished or emigrated as the population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals. A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions. Lions, especially in captivity, are vulnerable to the canine distemper virus (CDV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). CDV is spread through domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis. FIV, {{which is similar to}} HIV while not known to adversely affect lions, is worrisome enough in its effect in domestic cats that the Species Survival Plan recommends systematic testing in captive lions. It occurs with high to endemic frequency in several wild lion populations, but is mostly absent from Asiatic and <b>Namibian</b> lions.|$|E
