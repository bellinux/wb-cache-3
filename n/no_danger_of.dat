Extreme care is still taken, as there only has to be single instance of this not being the case to have deadly consequences.|$|E
5|$|Once the British {{were aware}} of the leak, they were {{concerned}} that Cicero had leaked information that might help crack the British cipher, but that did not occur. Lastly, the intelligence might have made the Germans believe that there was <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> attack in the Balkans, which may have been the most potentially damaging information gleaned by Cicero for the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Edward left Britain for Austria, {{where he}} stayed at Schloss Enzesfeld, {{the home of}} Baron Eugen and Baroness Kitty de Rothschild. Edward had to remain apart from Wallis until there was <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> compromising the {{granting}} of a decree absolute in her divorce proceedings. Upon her divorce being made final in May 1937, she changed her name by deed poll to Wallis Warfield, resuming her maiden name. The couple were reunited at the Château de Candé, Monts, France, on 4 May 1937.|$|E

5|$|Knyaz Suvorov {{was badly}} damaged by {{repeated}} attacks after she {{separated from the}} main body although she was initially in <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> sinking. The Russian destroyer Buinyi came alongside around 17:30 and evacuated Rozhestvensky and other wounded officers. Torpedoes fired {{by a number of}} torpedo boats ultimately caused a magazine to explode around 19:20 and Knyaz Suvorov capsized at about 19:30. Other than the 20 officers taken off by Buinyi, there were no survivors of the 928 crew aboard.|$|E
5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as the International Society for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Mojave Desert, human {{settlement}} and land development {{have led to}} an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources {{of food and water}} for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Despite this, and there being <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> extinction, the US Congress added ravens to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in 1971. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller's eider (Polysticta stelleri).|$|E

25|$|In a vacuum, {{there is}} no medium for {{removing}} heat from the body by conduction or convection. Loss of heat is by radiation from the 310 K temperature of a person to the 3 K of outer space. This is a slow process, especially in a clothed person, so there is <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> immediately freezing. Rapid evaporative cooling of skin moisture in a vacuum may create frost, particularly in the mouth, {{but this is not}} a significant hazard.|$|E

25|$|Somerset had an {{indifferent}} 2014, as {{they failed}} to make much headway in the Championship and, {{for the first time}} since 2007, weren't able make the knockout stages of either one-day competition. Somerset again placed 6th in the Championship, although they were in <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> relegation unlike the previous season. The beginning of the season had seen the departure of crowd favourite Buttler to Lancashire, and towards the end was marred by what turned out to be a career-ending eye injury to Kieswetter.|$|E

25|$|The {{delivery}} of a No ball results in one run – two under some Regulations – {{to be added to}} the batting team's score, and an additional ball must be bowled. In addition, the number of ways in which the batsman can be given out is reduced to three. In shorter competition cricket, a batsman receives a 'free hit' on the ball after any kind of No ball (see below). This means the batsman can freely hit one ball with <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> being out in most ways.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is known as}} the Hajos-Parrish reaction (also known as the Hajos-Parrish-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction, referring to a contemporaneous report from Schering of the reaction under harsher conditions). Under the Hajos-Parrish conditions only a catalytic amount of proline is necessary (3mol%). There is <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> an achiral background reaction because the transient enamine intermediates are much more nucleophilic than their parent ketone enols. This strategy offers a simple way of generating enantioselectivity in reactions without using transition metals, which have the possible disadvantages of being toxic or expensive.|$|E

This left the ground controller {{with the assumption that}} Flight 954 was holding at the 32R run-up pad and in <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> conflicting with other traffic and the flight crew with the assumption that they were cleared to taxi to the 32L run-up pad and could cross Runway 27L without danger of a collision with aircraft using that runway. Moreover, Flight 954's flight crew had never received word that Runway 27L was an active runway, and had no reason to anticipate encountering other aircraft while taxiing across it.|$|E

25|$|Rutledge {{also argued}} that if either house of the {{legislature}} {{was to have the}} sole authority to introduce appropriation bills, it should be the Senate. He noted that the Senate, by nature of its lengthier terms of office, would tend to be more leisurely in its actions. Because of this, Rutledge felt that the Senate would be better able to think clearly about what the consequences of a bill would be. Also, since the bills could not become law without the consent of the House of Representatives, he concluded that there would be <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> the Senate ruling the country.|$|E
25|$|Urine strips are not {{recommended}} {{to be used}} as the sole factor for insulin adjustments as they are not accurate enough. Urine glucose testing strips have a negative result until the renal threshold of 10mmol/L or 180mg/dL is reached or exceeded for a period of time. The range of negative reading values is quite wide-covering normal or close to normal blood glucose values with <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> hypoglycemia (euglycemia) to low blood glucose values (hypoglycemia) where treatment would be necessary. Because urine is normally retained in the bladder for a number of hours, the results of urine testing are not an accurate measurement of the levels of glucose in the bloodstream at the time of testing.|$|E
25|$|Good Samaritan {{provisions}} are not universal in application. The legal principle of imminent peril may also apply. In {{the absence of}} imminent peril, {{the actions of a}} rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless and not worthy of protection. To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, but there is no fire, no immediate life threat from injuries and <b>no</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> a second collision. If someone, with good intentions, causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage, a court may rule that good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless.|$|E
