5|$|M-63 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of <b>Niles,</b> Scottdale and Miners roads southwest of St. Joseph in Royalton Township. M-139 runs on <b>Niles</b> Road northwest from Berrien Springs to this point and on Scottdale Road north of the intersection. M-63 follows Miners Road west and then <b>Niles</b> Road northwest of the junction, parallel to the St. Joseph River through residential areas {{on the outskirts of the}} twin cities. The highway meets Interstate 94 (I-94) at the latter's exit27 and continues through St. Joseph Township to the city of St. Joseph. In the city, after Washington Avenue, <b>Niles</b> Road becomes <b>Niles</b> Avenue and turns north. As part of its maintenance duties, the MDOT tracks traffic volumes on the state highways in a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic level for any day of a year. The roadway segment along <b>Niles</b> Avenue north of the Napier Avenue intersection in 2009 had the highest traffic levels along all of M-63 at 22,263vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The current {{designation}} of M-63 {{was created in}} 1986. Before the designation, US33 ran north into Michigan south of <b>Niles.</b> From there it followed US31 north to Scottdale and ran alone to St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. When US33 was truncated back to <b>Niles,</b> M-63 was commissioned in its place along the route it now follows.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, all of M-40 {{south of}} I-94 to <b>Niles</b> was reassigned the {{designation}} M-51 while M-40 was {{shifted to the}} east {{to take over the}} routing of the contemporary M-119 between Paw Paw and its intersection with US12 in Porter Township near Mottville. The routing of M-51 was extended down to the state line in April 1998 when US33 was decommissioned out of the state of Michigan; the extension formed a concurrency with Business US12 (Bus.

This agreement ensured that Egypt would maintain its historic right of the Niles water,and allocated all water from the <b>Nile</b> to Egypt with no diversion allowed by upstream riparians. In 1959, Egypt and Sudan renegotiated their <b>Nile</b> sharing agreement Sudan recognized historical rights over <b>nile</b> River for Egypt and maintain their monopoly over {{the waters of the}} <b>Nile,</b> the 1959 treaty does not include any of the remaining upstream riparian countries and it forbids them from using the water or constructing any obstructions in <b>Nile</b> River. In 1999 First Organisation <b>Nile</b> riparian Countries, <b>Nile</b> Basin Initiative (NBI) Was Formed By 9 <b>Nile</b> Riparian Coutries. The main objective of the NBI was formed a cooperative framework agreement the <b>Nile</b> riparians countries and replace 1929 and 1959 agreement. Unfortunenately Egypt and Sudan Refused to ratify CFA Agreement. The theory that applied in this research is Realism and Level analysis in this research is State Level Analysis, researcher also use theory from about National Interest. The study found that the reason Egypt refused to ratify CFA Agreement are first,Egypt is dowstream <b>nile</b> riparians and has hot desert climate so Egypt depend on <b>Nile</b> River. Egypt Worry that CFA Agreement will allow upstream <b>Nile</b> riparian to diversion and build construction <b>Nile</b> and will impact to <b>Nile</b> River in Egypt.

40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the content}} of Amharic songs on <b>Nile</b> river in Ethiopia. Lyrics of eight recent and eight previous songs were qualitatively analyzed using initial coding from which final categories are established through constant comparative method. Major themes the analysis revealed consist of call for unity and collaboration among Ethiopians, a representation  of <b>Nile</b> as untapped treasure and a natural beauty, regret about missed opportunities of not utilizing the <b>Nile</b> for national development, condemning <b>Nile</b> in personified terms, and optimism in recent progresses in utilizing <b>Nile.</b> A shift is noted in the themes of the songs with previous songs emphasizing the beauty and fertility of <b>Nile</b> and recent songs portraying <b>Nile</b> as an untapped wealth. The {{extent to which the}} songs discuss <b>Nile</b> vary. Previous songs raise <b>Nile</b> sparingly while recent songs have entire albums devoted to <b>Nile</b> signalling that attention to <b>Nile</b> is increasing.

5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{was first}} designated in 1956 {{as a business}} route of US112. At that time, US112 and M-60 were transferred to a bypass south of <b>Niles.</b> When US112 was decommissioned in January 1962, Bus. US112 was redesignated Bus. US12 to match the new US12 designation. In 1986, US33 was truncated in Michigan to end at US12. Bus. US12 was rerouted in <b>Niles</b> to replace US33 through town; Bus. US31 was added a year later when the signage was updated in the area. In 1998, US33 was removed from Michigan completely. At this time, M-51 was extended over former US33 and replaced part of the Bus. US31 designation in <b>Niles.</b> On March 5, 2010, the segment of Bus. US12 between Bus.

40|$|Owing to {{the very}} gently sloping nature of the flood plain in the lower White <b>Nile</b> valley, which is {{underlain}} by a former lake-bed, the depositional record in that area is unusually well preserved. In Egypt and along the Blue <b>Nile</b> phases of erosion have destroyed segments of the sedimentary record, but the White <b>Nile</b> sequence is a good proxy for both the main <b>Nile</b> and the Blue <b>Nile.</b> During the last 15 ka, at least, times of high flow in the Blue <b>Nile</b> and main <b>Nile</b> were synchronous {{with those in the}} White <b>Nile.</b> Not all the White <b>Nile</b> flood deposits have been preserved but calibrated radiocarbon dates obtained on fossil freshwater and amphibious Pila shells and fish bones indicate that White <b>Nile</b> levels were high around 14. 7 – 13. 1 ka, 9. 7 – 9. 0 ka, 7. 9 – 7. 6 ka, 6. 3 ka and 3. 2 – 2. 8 ka. The Blue <b>Nile</b> record is more fragmentary and that of the main <b>Nile</b> even more so except for the Holocene <b>Nile</b> delta. Calibrated radiocarbon ages for high Blue <b>Nile</b> flows indicate very high flood levels towards 13. 9 – 13. 2 ka, 8. 6 ka, 7. 7 ka and 6. 3 ka. Incision by the Blue <b>Nile</b> and main <b>Nile</b> has caused progressive incision in the White <b>Nile</b> amounting to at least 4 m since the terminal Pleistocene 15 ka ago and at least 2 m over the past 9 ka. The Blue <b>Nile</b> seems to have cut down at least 10 m since 15 ka and at least 4 m since 9 ka. The time-transgressive and relatively late inception of plant domestication in the <b>Nile</b> valley may partly reflect this history of incision. <b>Nile</b> incision would propagate upstream into the White <b>Nile</b> valley, draining previously swampy areas along the valley floor, which would then become accessible to cultivation.

50|$|The Blue <b>Nile,</b> which {{originates}} at Lake Tana in Ethiopia, provides {{on average}} some 58% of the <b>Nile's</b> Egyptian waters.

5|$|M-60 was {{originally}} designed in 1919 {{with the rest}} of the state highway system in Michigan. It ran roughly along its current route connecting downtown <b>Niles</b> to downtown Jackson. In the mid-1920s, the western end was extended to New Buffalo; since then several bypasses of the smaller towns along the highway were added. One of these bypasses resulted in the creation of an alternate route (Alternate M-60, Alt. M-60) through Concord; that route has since been decommissioned. When <b>Niles</b> was bypassed in the 1950s, a business loop (Business M-60, Bus. M-60) was created through town. After the western end was truncated to its current location, that business loop was converted to a business spur.|$|E
5|$|US12 {{enters the}} state of Michigan {{southwest}} of New Buffalo {{near the town of}} Michiana. The highway runs a bit inland and parallel to the Lake Michigan shore on Red Arrow Highway past the community of Grand Beach before turning eastward away from the lake {{on the north side of}} New Buffalo. US12 intersects I-94 less than a mile east of this turn and continues due east along Pulaski Highway through rural farmland. The highway is the main east–west street as it crosses through Three Oaks in southern Berrien County. East of Galien, the highway dips southward around Dayton Lake before passing south of Buchanan. The highway continues eastward, intersecting US31 (St. Joseph Valley Parkway) near <b>Niles.</b> East of that freeway, US12 expands into an expressway as the <b>Niles</b> Bypass. This bypass intersects M-139, crosses the St. Joseph River and intersects M-51 on the south side of <b>Niles.</b> US12 turns northeasterly along the bypass east of downtown and then departs to the southeast at an interchange with Main Street and M-60 just across the county line with Cass County.|$|E
5|$|When M-40 {{was created}} around by July 1, 1919, it {{originally}} ran from <b>Niles</b> to Dowagiac and Decatur roughly along the current path of M-51. Then it {{traveled to the}} northeast where it entered Paw Paw and continued north to Allegan. By 1921, M-40 is shown on maps extending south of <b>Niles</b> to the Indiana state line, but not extending to Allegan. The segment from <b>Niles</b> south {{was used for the}} routing of US31 in 1926. A section of the highway was realigned in the same time period near Paw Paw. After the change, M-40 followed the contemporary US12 instead of Paw Paw Road. A rerouting of M-89 in 1927 shifted it to run from Allegan southeast to Plainwell instead of east to Martin; M-40 replaced M-89 on the Allegan–Martin roadway. In 1929, the routing from Allegan to Martin was removed and renumbered M-118, and M-40 was extended to the north out of Allegan along M-89 and its modern routing to a new terminus in Holland ending at US31. The last segment of unpaved highway was paved in late 1945 or early 1946. This segment was near Dunningville in central Allegan County.|$|E
