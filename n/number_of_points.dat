5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} constructs a clustering in time {{proportional to}} {{the square of the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> to be clustered.

The algorithm uses an amount of memory proportional to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>points,</b> when it is used for clustering methods such as Ward's method that allow constant-time calculation of the distance between clusters. However, for some other clustering methods it uses a larger amount of memory in an auxiliary data structure with which it keeps track of the distances between pairs of clusters.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} {{surface roughness}} standards comprise only two dimensions. However, the real roughness {{of the surface}} is 3 D (three-dimensional). Roughness parameters of the 3 D surface are also important in analyzing the mechanics of contact surfaces. Problems of mechanics of contact surfaces are related to accuracy of 3 D surface roughness characteristic. One {{of the most important}} factors for 3 D characteristics determination is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>points</b> per* mdy axes. With <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>points</b> we understand its number in cut-off length. <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>points</b> have substantial influence on the accuracy of measurement results, measuring time and size of output data file (especially along they-axis direction, where <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>points</b> are <b>number</b> <b>of</b> parallel profiles). <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>points</b> must be optimal. Small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>points</b> lead to incorrect results and increase distribution amplitude, but too large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>points</b> do not enlarge range of fundamental information, but substantially increase measuring time. Therefore, we must find optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data <b>points</b> per each surface processing method...|$|R

The game finished 0–0, but a goal by Gerry Taggart for the Whites was mistakenly not given; the point swing in Bolton's favour would have kept them up. The following season they reached the 1999 Division One play-off Final but lost 2–0 to Watford.|$|E

By winning the second event in Almaty on 28 February, Prevc secured his first World Cup title, six events {{before the end of}} the season. At the end of the season, Prevc broke several statistical records. He won the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>points,</b> victories, and podium finishes in a single season (2303 points, 15 victories and 22 podiums in total, the previous records being 2083 points, 13 victories, and 20 podiums by Gregor Schlierenzauer from the 2008/09 season). Other records include the point difference between the first and the second in the overall standings (813), the best average of points per event (79.4), and the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> in the Four Hills Tournament (1139.4). By winning the ski flying title, Prevc became the first ski jumper to win the title for three years in a row.|$|E
5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with other developments in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed at a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} hailed as an {{important}} addition to the literature in both environmental ethics and process philosophy. Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims. First, he challenged her linking of process ethics with individualist consequentialism, arguing that it is instead somewhere between individualist consequentialism and deep ecology. Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends. Cobb and Menta, though both welcoming her consideration of process philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne on a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
