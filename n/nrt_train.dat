50|$|On 1 October 1986, Estocin officially {{became part}} of the Naval Reserve Force (NRF) {{reported}} to Naval Surface Warfare Group Four, homeported in Philadelphia, PA. Upon joining the NRF, Estocin operated primarily in the western Atlantic in support of Naval Reserve <b>Training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> and active fleet commitments. She logged frequent underway weekends devoted entirely to Selected Reserve crew training, as well as periodic underway periods of 2-week duration to enable reservists to complete their active duty training requirements. These operations took Estocin as far north as Nova Scotia and south to the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|On 1 October 1963, Willard Keith began a {{new phase}} of her career. Reporting to DesRon 34 for duty, the warship soon {{commenced}} operating as a Naval Reserve <b>training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> ship. For the next nine years, Willard Keith operated in that capacity, accomplishing reserve training with monthly drill weekend cruises for the reservists permanently assigned to the ship's reserve crew and undertaking two-week active duty training cruises for reservists getting their annual active sea duty training. She ranged from the eastern seaboard to Guantanamo Bay as an NRT destroyer, providing the platform for training necessary to maintain a skilled pool of reservists ready for any eventuality.|$|R
50|$|After the {{minesweeper}} {{shifted to}} the newly reorganized Mine Division 23 in April 1971, Dominant changed status again to become a U.S. Naval Reserve <b>Training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> ship on 1 July 1971, joining Mine Squadron 12 with three other minesweepers that same day. Her designation was later changed to a Naval Reserve Force (NRF) ship. The minesweeper also changed home port to St. Petersburg, Florida, on 20 August and began training her complement of reserve crews one weekend a month and for two-weeks of annual training. Although reserve training duties generally kept the minesweeper in Florida waters, Dominant occasionally sailed to South Carolina or Virginia for overhaul or for minesweeping exercises and periodically conducted search and rescue sweeps for crashed aircraft or lost helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Wiseman {{conducted}} four more WestPac deployments and spent the interludes between them in training out of San Diego and upkeep at Mare Island Naval Shipyard or the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. Upon occasion, she conducted Naval Reserve training cruises — one taking her to the Hawaiian Islands. During the overseas deployments, Wiseman operated with units of SEATO navies — Australian, New Zealand, British, Philippine, Pakistani, and Thai — and visited ports from Australia to Japan. Upon completion of her sixth deployment, Wiseman was designated as a Group I Naval Reserve <b>Training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> ship. Accordingly, on 16 May 1959, the ship was decommissioned and {{turned over to the}} 11th Naval District. Lt. W. V. Powell was the first officer-in-charge.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to examine how chronic resistance training influences corticospinal excitability (CE) of the Biceps Brachii in the non-dominant arm. Seven chronic resistance trained (RT) and six non-resistance <b>trained</b> (<b>NRT)</b> completed four sets of five s pseudo-randomized contractions at 100, 90, 75, 50 and 25 % of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). During the contractions, participants received transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transmastoid electrical stimulation (TMES) and peripheral nerve stimulation to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEP), cervicomedullary evoked potentials (CMEP) and maximal muscle compound action potentials (Mmax) respectively. All MEPs and CMEPs were normalized to M-max. CMEPs {{were found to be}} significantly higher at moderate contraction intensities in the RT group. Results indicate that spinal, but not supraspinal excitability is enhanced at moderate contraction intensities in chronic resistance trained individuals...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The aim {{of present}} study was to compare the effects of 12 weeks of {{nonlinear}} resistance <b>training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> and aerobic interval training (AIT), and also effects of 4 weeks of detraining after these training on interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and insulin resistance in young obese men. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, at first 38 obese men were matched by aerobic fitness, age and percentage of body fat. Then, they were randomly assigned to NRT (n= 14), AIT (n= 12) and control (Con, n= 12) groups. The training groups performed 3 weekly sessions for 12 weeks followed by a 4 weeks detraining period. NRT consisted of 40 - 65 minutes of weight training at different intensities with flexible periodization. AIT consisted of running on a treadmill (4 sets of 4 minutes at 80 - 90...|$|R

40|$|Ten {{resistance}} trained (RT) and 6 non-resistance <b>trained</b> (<b>NRT)</b> {{subjects were}} used to determine differences in quadriceps activation between isometric single and double knee extensions and squat contractions. Greater inactivation, as measured by the interpolated twitch technique, was recorded with single (RT: 16. 5 %, NRT: 17. 6 %) than double leg extensions (RT: 8. 4 %, NRT: 13. 4 %) or squats (RT: 4. 03 %, NRT: 1. 7 %). There {{was no significant difference between}} the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force of the dominant leg during single and double leg extensions. However, in NRT subjects, the contralateral or non-dominant leg during double leg extensions exhibited significantly less force than the dominant leg (715. 9 vs 566. 9  N). This deficit may be due to a lesser reliance on the non-dominant limb. The contractions of multiple lower body muscle groups enhanced the activation of the dominant quadriceps. Greater levels of activation may be necessary to cope with the stabilization necessary for bilateral and multi-articular contractions...|$|R
5000|$|After she {{had brought}} her fourth WestPac {{deployment}} to a close, Alvin C. Cockrell was assigned Naval Reserve <b>Training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> ship duties with Reserve Escort Squadron 1, on 1 July 1958, home-ported at San Francisco. Decommissioned on 17 January 1959, the ship was designated a Group II destroyer escort in the ASW surface component of the selected reserve and remained [...] "in service" [...] to provide underway training for her own selected reserve crew of inactive reserve officers and men. Two active duty officers and 36 enlisted men maintained the ship, and on the third weekend of each month, a reserve crew of 161 officers and men would embark to steam and train their own ship. For two weeks each year the reserve crew would embark, and, integrated with the active duty men, would carry out a two-week reserve training cruise. In May 1959, the ship moved to her new home port, the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve Training Center at Alameda, California.|$|R
40|$|Background: Legislation {{preventing}} {{smoking in}} public places was introduced in England in July 2007. Since then, smoke-free policies have been extended {{to the majority of}} hospitals including those providing cancer therapies. Whilst studies have been conducted on the impact and effectiveness of hospital smoke-free policy in the UK and other countries, there have not been any studies with a focus on cancer care providers. Cancer patients are a priority group for smoking cessation and support and this study aimed to examine implementation of the National Institute Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance (PH 48) in acute cancer care trusts in the UK. Methods: Participants were recruited from UK radiotherapy and chemotherapy departments (total 80 sites, 65 organisations) and asked to complete a 15 min online questionnaire exploring the implementation of NICE guidance at their hospital site. Results: Considerable variability in implementation of the NICE guidance was observed. A total of 79. 1 % trusts were smoke-free in theory; however, only 18. 6 % were described as smoke-free in practice. Areas of improvement were identified in information and support for patients and staff including in Nicotine Replacement Therapy (<b>NRT)</b> provision, staff <b>training</b> and clarity on e-cigarette policies. Conclusions: While some trusts have effective smoke-free policies and provide valuable cessation support services for patients, improvements are required to ensure that all sites fully adopt the NICE guidance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Our group {{recently}} completed a randomized controlled trial, evaluating the efficacy of providing 5  weeks of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT; {{in the form of}} the nicotine patch) by expedited postal mail without behavioral assistance to regular adult smokers interested in receiving it. The findings revealed that mailed provision of nicotine patches resulted in more than a doubling of quit rates at a six-month follow-up compared to a no intervention control group. While this trial provided evidence for the effectiveness of mailed nicotine patches in promoting cessation, the findings speak only to the short term effectiveness of this approach. As relapse to smoking is known to occur beyond the 6  month period, it is important to evaluate whether the net benefit of NRT in naturalistic settings can be maintained long-term. The present study aims to perform a 5 -year follow-up survey of participants in the original trial to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of mailed <b>NRT.</b> Methods/Design <b>Trained</b> interviewers will contact participants in the randomized controlled trial 5  years post-enrollment. A total of 924 participants will be eligible to be contacted. Interviewers will first assess participants’ smoking status and their level of nicotine dependence. Participants reporting not currently smoking will be asked whether they have smoked tobacco, even a puff, in the last 30  days (primary outcome measure: 30 -day point prevalence abstinence), past 6  months (secondary outcome measure: prolonged 6 -month abstinence), and since the 8 -week follow-up survey (secondary outcome measure: > 4  year continuous abstinence). Interviewers will be blind to experimental condition at the time the primary outcome measure will be assessed. It is hypothesized that participants who received nicotine patches at baseline will display significantly higher quit rates at the 5 -year follow-up as compared to participants who did not receive nicotine patches at baseline. Discussion If the study finds that the mailed distribution of free NRT is effective at promoting long-term cessation, it would provide further evidence to move forward with policies designed to make NRT treatment readily and freely available to smokers who request it.

40|$|Hypoxia is an {{important}} modulator of endurance exercise-induced oxidative adaptations in skeletal muscle. However, whether hypoxia affects resistance exercise-induced muscle adaptations remains unknown. Here, we determined the effect of resistance exercise training under systemic hypoxia on muscular adaptations known to occur following both resistance and endurance exercise training, including muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), one-repetition maximum (1 RM), muscular endurance, and makers of mitochondrial biogenesis and angiogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator- 1 α (PGC- 1 α), citrate synthase (CS) activity, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1), and capillary-to-fiber ratio. Sixteen healthy male subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} either a normoxic resistance <b>training</b> group (<b>NRT,</b> n = 7) or a hypoxic (14. 4 % oxygen) resistance training group (HRT, n = 9) and performed 8 weeks of resistance training. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were obtained before and after training. After training muscle CSA of the femoral region, 1 RM for bench-press and leg-press, muscular endurance, and skeletal muscle VEGF protein levels significantly increased in both groups. The increase in muscular endurance was significantly higher in the HRT group. Plasma VEGF concentration and skeletal muscle capillary-to-fiber ratio were significantly higher in the HRT group than the <b>NRT</b> group following <b>training.</b> Our results suggest that, in addition to increases in muscle size and strength, HRT may also lead to increased muscular endurance and the promotion of angiogenesis in skeletal muscle...|$|R
40|$|Background: Birth {{asphyxia}} kills 0. 7 to 1. 6 million newborns a year globally with 99 % {{of deaths}} in developing countries. Effective newborn resuscitation could reduce this {{burden of disease}} but the training of health-care providers in low income settings is often outdated. Our aim {{was to determine if}} a simple one day newborn resuscitation <b>training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> alters health worker resuscitation practices in a public hospital setting in Kenya. Methods/Principal Findings: We conducted a randomised, controlled trial with health workers receiving early <b>training</b> with <b>NRT</b> (n = 28) or late training (the control group, n = 55). The training was adapted locally from the approach of the UK Resuscitation Council. The primary outcome was the proportion of appropriate initial resuscitation steps with the frequency of inappropriate practices as a secondary outcome. Data were collected on 97 and 115 resuscitation episodes over 7 weeks after early training in the intervention and control groups respectively. Trained providers demonstrated a higher proportion of adequate initial resuscitation steps compared to the control group (trained 66 % vs control 27 %; risk ratio 2. 45, [95 % CI 1. 75 – 3. 42], p, 0. 001, adjusted for clustering). In addition, there was a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of inappropriate and potentially harmful practices per resuscitation in the trained group (trained 0. 53 vs control 0. 92; mean difference 0. 40, [95 % CI 0. 13 – 0. 66], p = 0. 004).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{variety of}} {{emergency}} care training courses based on developed country models are being promoted {{as a strategy}} {{to improve the quality}} of care of the seriously ill newborn or child in developing countries. Clear evidence of their effectiveness is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of in-service training of health professionals on their management and care of the seriously ill newborn or child in low and middle-income settings. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched The Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Specialised Register of the Cochrane EPOC group (both up to May 2009), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2009), EMBASE (1980 to May 2009), CINAHL (1982 to March 2008), ERIC / LILACS / WHOLIS (all up to October 2008), and ISI Science Citation Index Expanded and ISI Social Sciences Citation Index (both from 1975 to March 2009). We checked references of retrieved articles and reviews and contacted authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials (CRTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs) that reported objectively measured professional practice, patient outcomes, health resource /services utilization, or training costs in healthcare settings (not restricted to studies in low-income settings). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently selected studies for inclusion, abstracted data using a standardised form, and assessed study quality. Meta-analysis was not appropriate. Study results were summarised and appraised. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies of varied designs were included. In one RCT of moderate quality, Newborn Resuscitation <b>Training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> was associated with a significant improvement in performance of adequate initial resuscitation steps (risk ratio 2. 45, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 75 to 3. 42, P < 0. 001, adjusted for clustering) and a reduction in the frequency of inappropriate and potentially harmful practices (mean difference 0. 40, 95 % CI 0. 13 to 0. 66, P = 0. 004). In the second RCT, available limited data suggested that there was improvement in assessment of breathing and newborn care practices in the delivery room following implementation of Essential Newborn Care (ENC) training. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence that in-service neonatal emergency care courses improve health-workers' practices when caring for a seriously ill newborn although there is some evidence of benefit. Rigorous trials evaluating the impact of refresher emergency care training on long-term professional practices are needed. To optimise appropriate policy decisions, studies should aim to collect data on resource use and costs of training implementation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Apelin is an adipokine {{which may}} {{contribute}} to the link between obesity and metabolic diseases. Regular exercise training has been proposed as a strategy for reducing the risk of these diseases by positive adaptations in adipokines, but there is limited research directly comparing different types of training. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine and compare the effects of nonlinear resistance <b>training</b> (<b>NRT)</b> and aerobic interval training (AIT) on serum levels of apelin- 13 and insulin resistance in middle-aged obese men. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted from October to February 2012 in Ilam City, Iran. Eligible subjects (33 obese men) between aged 34 - 46 years participated in this study and were allocated to the following groups: NRT (n= 12), AIT (n= 10), and control (n= 11). The inclusion criteria were sedentary (less than 60 minutes physical activity per week), nonsmokers, no regular exercise for at least the past 6 months, no regular consumption of medication, no special diet, percentage body fat > 23 % and no history of medical conditions that would prevent them from participating in the exercise intervention. Only the subjects who performed more than 90 % of the training sessions were included in this study. The experimental groups performed 3 weekly sessions for 12 weeks, whereas the control group maintained a sedentary lifestyle. NRT consisted of 40 - 65 minutes of weight training at different intensities and with a flexible period. AIT consisted of running on a treadmill (4 × 4 min at 80 - 90 % maximal heart rate, 3 min recovery intervals). Results: Analysis of variance showed that there were no significant differences betwee n the groups for apelin- 13 and insulin resistance at baseline (P> 0. 05). Compared to control group, two exercise programs were equally effective at reducing insulin resistance, but apelin- 13 levels increased significantly only with the AIT (P= 0. 04). After the training, maximal oxygen uptake increased significantly in AIT and NRT compared with control group (both P= 0. 001) and in AIT more than NRT (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: The practical applications indicate that obese men can use both AIT and NRT exercise programs to reduce insulin resistance. However, the AIT may have better beneficial effects (as indicated by apelin- 13) compared to NRT...|$|R
