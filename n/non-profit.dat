40|$|In many {{markets in}} {{developing}} countries, especially in remote areas, middlemen {{are thought to}} earn excessive profits. <b>Non-profits</b> come in to counter what is seen as middlemen's market power, and rich country consumers pay a "fair-trade" premium for products marketed by such <b>non-profits.</b> This paper provides answers to the following five questions. How exactly do middlemen and <b>non-profits</b> divide up the market? How do the price mark up and price pass-through differ between middleman and <b>non-profits?</b> What {{is the impact of}} <b>non-profits</b> entry on the wellbeing of the poor? Should the government subsidize the entry of <b>non-profits,</b> or the entry of middlemen? Should wealthy consumers in the North pay a premium for fair trade products, or should they support fair trade <b>non-profits</b> directly?Middlemen, <b>Non-profits,</b> Poverty, Market Access, Food Security and Poverty, International Development, Productivity Analysis, F 15, I 32, L 3,...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how art <b>non-profits</b> process loaned objects for temporary and traveling exhibitions {{in the context}} of special or toxic materials. Safety guidelines, emergency planning, and proper registration procedures for exhibitions in both museums and art <b>non-profits</b> are examined through a literature review and a survey of content experts. The survey results indicate that a lack of implementation of safety guidelines and procedures exist in art <b>non-profits,</b> and that training to ensure staff safety is limited. It is concluded that art <b>non-profits</b> need to learn more about how to integrate museum safety practices and procedures into their practices; should make use of Safety Data Sheets (SDS); and must provide better training to ensure the protection of the health of staff involved in processing, unpacking, and installing exhibitions. Finally, recommendations on improving art <b>non-profits???</b> safety protocols and awareness of occupational health are presented...|$|R
