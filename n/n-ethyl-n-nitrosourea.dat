50|$|The Clock gene {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1994 by Dr. Joseph Takahashi and his colleagues. Takahashi used forward mutagenesis screening of mice treated with <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> {{to create and}} identify mutations in key genes that broadly affect circadian activity. The Clock mutants discovered through the screen displayed an abnormally long period of daily activity. This trait proved to be heritable. Mice bred to be heterozygous showed longer periods of 24.4 hours compared to the control 23.3 hour period. Mice homozygous for the mutation showed 27.3 hour periods, but eventually lost all circadian rhythmicity after several days in constant darkness. This showed that intact Clock genes are necessary for normal mammalian circadian function.|$|E
5000|$|Until the {{commercial}} development of mobile DNA technology in 2007 and zinc-finger nuclease technology in 2009, {{there were only}} two technologies {{that could be used to}} produce rat models of human disease: cloning and chemical mutagenesis using <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> (ENU). Although cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) could theoretically be used to create rats with specific mutations by mutating somatic cells, and then using these cells for SCNT, this approach has not been used successfully to create knockout rats. One problem with this strategy is that SCNT is extremely inefficient. The first published attempt had a success rate of less than 1%. Alternatively, ENU mutagenesis is a common random mutagenesis gene knockout strategy in the mouse that can also be used in the rat. ENU mutagenesis involves using a chemical, <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> (ENU), to create single base changes in the genome. ENU transfers its ethyl group to oxygen or nitrogen radicals in DNA, resulting in mis-pairing and base pair substitution. Mutant animals can be produced by injecting a male mouse with ENU, and breeding with a wild type female to produce mutant offspring. ENU mutagenesis creates a high frequency of random mutations, with approximately one base pair change in any given gene in every 200-700 gametes. Despite its high mutagenicity, the physical penetration of ENU is limited and only about 500 genes are mutated for each male and a very small number of the total mutations have an observable phenotype. Thousands of mutations typically need to be created in a single animal in order to generate one novel phenotype.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described that greatly increases {{the efficiency of}} recovering specific locus point mutations in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Founder individuals that were mosaic for point mutations were produced by mutagenizing postmeiotic gametes with the alkylating agent <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea.</b> Under optimal conditions, each founder carried an average of 10 mutations affecting genes required for embryogenesis. Moreover, approximately 2 % of these founders transmitted new mutations at any prespecified pigmentation locus. Analyses of new pigmentation mutations confirmed that most {{were likely to be}} point mutations. Thus, mutagenesis of postmeiotic gametes with <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> yielded frequencies of point mutations at specific loci that were 10 - to 15 -fold higher than previously achieved in zebrafish.

These studies have shown random mutagenesis is an attractive means of identifying key genes for male fertility. This technique has distinct, but complementary advantages compared to knockout technologies. Specifically, it allows the removal of researcher bias whereby only pre-conceived genes are tested for function; it produces mice with a guaran-teed phenotype and allows for the production of allelic series of mice to dissect all aspects of gene function.

In this study, we investigated the time course of cII genemutant induction in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow of Big Blue transgenic mice treated with <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> (ENU). Six-month-old female mice were treated with a single dose (120 mg/kg) of ENU, and the animals were sacrificed, and the cIImutant frequencies (MFs) were determined at 1, 3, 7, 15, 30, and 120 days after the treatment. TheMFs in the liver cII gene of ENU-treatedmice increasedwith timeafter the treatment,while the MFs for concurrent controls remained constant. The liver cIIMFs in ENU-treated mice were significantly increased at day 30 and 120 (p 5 0. 01), with the largest increase at day 120.

A mutagenesis using an alkylation agent, <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea,</b> was carried out to the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Cells were treated with 1. 0 mg mL− 1 <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> and were screened on agar plates containing 100 to 300 mg L− 1 5 -fluoroorotidic acid (5 -FOA). Two clones survived the selection and were designated as Requiring Uracil and Resistant to FOA (RURF) 1 and 2. The 50 % effective concentration of 5 -FOA on growth of RURF 1 was about 5 mm, whereas that in wild-type cells was 30 μm. The ability {{to grow in the}} absence of uracil was restored by a P. tricornutum gene that potentially encoded UMPS or the human umps gene, HUMPS. Because the P. tricornutum gene was able to restore growth in the absence of uracil, it was designated as ptumps, encoding a major functional UMPS in P. tricornutum. RNA interference to the ptumps targeting the 5 ′ region of ptumps resulted in the occurrence of a clear RURF phenotype in P. tricornutum. This RNA interference phenotype was reverted to the wild type by the insertion of HUMPS, confirming that the ptumps encodes UMPS.

40|$|PURPOSE: Although {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitors have improved survival in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), complete response is rare and most patients eventually fail the first-line treatment with imatinib. Sunitinib malate {{is the only}} approved second-line therapy for patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant GIST. The clinical benefit of sunitinib is genotype-dependent in regards to both primary and secondary mutations, with GIST patients harboring the KIT(AY 502 - 3 ins) exon 9 mutation being the most sensitive. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: As sunitinib resistance is now emerging, {{our goal was to}} investigate mechanisms of progression and to test the efficacy of novel {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor on these resistant mutants in vitro. <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> mutagenesis of Ba/F 3 cells expressing the KIT(AY 502 - 3 ins) mutant was used to investigate novel patterns of resistant mutations evolving in the presence of sunitinib. RESULTS: Tumors from patients who developed sunitinib resistance after at least 1 year of radiographic response were analyzed, showing similar findings of a primary KIT(AY 502 - 3 ins) mutation and a secondary mutation in the KIT activation loop. Ba/F 3 cells expressing these sunitinib-resistant double mutants showed sensitivity to both dasatinib and nilotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib resistance in GIST shares similar pathogenetic mechanisms identified in imatinib failure, with acquisition of secondary mutations in the activation domain after an extended initial response to the drug. Moreover, in vitro mutagenesis with or without <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> of Ba/F 3 cells expressing KIT(AY 502 - 3 ins) showed acquisition of secondary mutations restricted to the second kinase domain of KIT.

All 47 trigeminal schwannomas (and 12 extracranial neurinomas) investigated carried a T. A [...] A. T transversion mutation at nucleotide 2012 of the neu (erbB- 2) gene sequence encoding the transmembrane domain of pg 185 neu. This mutation was absent in all 18 tumors in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) isolated from the same animals. Identical observations were made in cell lines derived from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced rat schwannomas vs. brain tumors. By asymmetric PCR and mutant-specific Mnl I restriction fragment length analyses, cells carrying the mutant neu allele became detectable and could be localized within the trigeminal box as early as 7 days after the carcinogen pulse. The proliferation rate of the mutant cells strongly exceeded that of the wild-type cells up to the time of maturation of the trigeminal nerve around postnatal day 30 and thereafter to a lesser extent until the appearance of schwannomas. A specific mutation of the neu gene thus represents a very early, probably the first, step in the malignant conversion of immature rat Schwann cells exposed to <b>N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea</b> in vivo and is diagnostic for a subset of proliferative cells at high risk of progressing toward the expression of fully malignant phenotypes.
