The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>dioxide</b> is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form nitric acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s.

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. [198]. With the International Energy Agency (IEA) {{projecting}} {{that the}} global demand for natural gas to increase by 50 % from 2010 to 2035, the exploration of unconventional gas reserves (e. g. shale gas, tight gas and coal bed methane) will gain increasing importance as conventional gas reserves become more depleted. To enhance the production of unconventional gas and oil, water-based fracturing fluids are extensively used for the stimulation of North American shale plays because they are inexpensive and offer excellent proppant transport into the fracture when used with gelled polymers. However, in circumstances where water-based fracturing fluids are unsuitable due to concerns related to water sensitivity and clay swelling, alternative fracturing fluids are used such as <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>dioxide</b> treatments. <b>Nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>dioxide</b> fracturing fluids are particularly advantageous in depleted and shallow formations because they offer a non-damaging effect around the fracture, rapid cleanup of flowback fluid, and reduced water requirements compared to conventional water-based fracturing fluids. Much research has been published about water-based fracture treatments, therefore, this review paper considers the use of <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>dioxide</b> fracturing fluids used for the stimulation of unconventional shale plays, mainly in North America. By analysing selected literatures studies, this review paper summarises the utilization of {{the various types of}} <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>dioxide</b> treatments (i. e. straight gas, foam, energized, cryogenic liquids) across various shale plays such as the Montney play, the Devonian play, and the Marcellus play. The paper further identifies the major benefits and challenges of <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>dioxide</b> treatments documented by well operators, which will facilitate knowledge transfer about the applicability of <b>nitrogen</b> and carbon <b>dioxide</b> fracturing fluids.

5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dioxide</b> and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E

40|$|Objective To explore various {{contributors}} to people's reporting of self reported air pollution problems in area of living, including GIS-modeled air pollution, and {{to investigate whether}} those with respiratory or other chronic diseases tend to over-report air pollution problems, compared to healthy people. Methods Cross-sectional data from the Oslo Health Study (2000 – 2001) were linked with GIS-modeled air pollution data from the Norwegian Institute of Air Research. Multivariate regression analyses were performed. 14 294 persons aged 30, 40, 45, 60 or 75 years old with complete information on modeled and self reported air pollution were included. Results People who reported air pollution problems were exposed to significantly higher GIS-modeled air pollution levels {{than those who did}} not report such problems. People with chronic disease, reported significantly more air pollution problems after adjustment for modeled levels of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dioxides,</b> socio-demographic variables, smoking, depression, dwelling conditions and an area deprivation index, even if they had a non-respiratory disease. No diseases, however, were significantly associated with levels of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>dioxides.</b> Conclusion Self reported air pollution problems in area of living are strongly associated with increased levels of GIS-modeled air pollution. Over and above this, those who report to have a chronic disease tend to report more air pollution problems in area of living, despite no significant difference in air pollution exposure compared to healthy people, and no associations between these diseases and NO 2.
