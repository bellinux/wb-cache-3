Both RML- and 301 C-derived prions containing unglycosylated PrP(Sc) molecules were infectious to wild-type mice, and neuropathological analysis showed that mice inoculated with these samples maintained strain-specific patterns of PrP(Sc) deposition and neuronal vacuolation.

40|$|Mumps {{virus is}} highly {{neurotropic}} and, prior to widespread vaccination programs, {{was the major}} cause of viral meningitis in the United States. Nonetheless, the genetic basis of mumps virus <b>neurotropism</b> and neurovirulence was until recently not understood, {{largely due to the}} lack of an animal model. Here, nonneurovirulent (Jeryl Lynn vaccine) and highly neurovirulent (88 - 1961 wild type) mumps virus strains were passaged in human neural cells or in chicken fibroblast cells with the goal of neuroadapting or neuroattenuating the viruses, respectively. When tested in our rat neurovirulence assay against the respective parental strains, a Jeryl Lynn virus variant with an enhanced propensity for replication (<b>neurotropism)</b> and damage (neurovirulence) in the brain and an 88 - 1961 wild-type virus variant with decreased neurotropic and neurovirulent properties were recovered. To determine the molecular basis for the observed differences in neurovirulence and neuroattenuation, the complete genomes of the parental strains and their variants were fully sequenced. A comparison at the nucleotide level associated three amino acid changes with enhanced neurovirulence of the neuroadapted vaccine strain: one each in the nucleoprotein, matrix protein, and polymerase and three amino acid changes with reduced neurovirulence of the neuroattenuated wild-type strain: one each in the fusion protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein, and polymerase.

40|$|Melanocytic {{proliferation}} {{in young}} people may sometimes pose a diagnostic dilemma. This is particularly so when a desmoplastic component is present. Because the two main differential diagnoses, desmoplastic malignant melanoma and desmoplastic Spitz nevus, share some morphologic features, the diagnosis of desmoplastic malignant melanoma may be overlooked. Distinction {{between the two is}} important because they show completely different biological behavior. The age of patient, site of lesion, histologic findings of melanocytic atypia, <b>neurotropism,</b> mitosis, and maturation help to distinguish the two entities. We report a case of desmoplastic malignant melanoma occurring in the buttock of an 18 -year-old Chinese girl. Histologically, it had typical features of desmoplastic malignant melanoma with junctional melanocytic atypia and prominent <b>neurotropism.</b> Clinical and histologic differences between desmoplastic malignant melanoma and desmoplastic Spitz nevus are reviewed.

40|$|A point {{mutation}} from guanine (G) to adenine (A) at nucleotide position 1081 in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene {{has been associated}} with neurovirulence of Urabe AM 9 mumps virus vaccine. This mutation corresponds to a glutamic acid (E) to lysine (K) change at position 335 in the HN glycoprotein. We have experimentally demonstrated that two variants of Urabe AM 9 strain (HN-A 1081 and HN-G 1081) differ in <b>neurotropism,</b> sialic acidbinding affinity and neuraminidase activity. In the present study, we performed a structure-function analysis of that amino acid substitution; the structures of HN protein of both Urabe AM 9 strain variants were predicted. Based on our analysis, the E/K mutation changes the protein surface properties {{and to a lesser extent}} their conformations, which in turn reflects in activity changes. Our modeling results suggest that this E/K interchange does not affect the structure of the sialic acid binding motif; however, the electrostatic surface differs drastically due to an exposed short alpha helix. Consequently, this mutation may affect the accessibility of HN to substrates and membrane receptors of the host cells.

The virulence of two clinical isolates of SAFV type 3 (SAFV- 3) obtained from a patient with aseptic meningitis (AM strain) and acute upper respiratory inflammation (UR strain) was analyzed in neonatal and young mice utilizing virological, pathological, and immunological methods. The polyproteins of the strains differed in eight amino acids. Both clinical isolates were infective, exhibited <b>neurotropism,</b> and were mildly neurovirulent in neonatal ddY mice. Both strains pathologically infected neural progenitor cells and glial cells, but not large neurons, with the UR strain also infecting epithelial cells.

40|$|The viral {{determinants}} {{that underlie}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>neurotropism</b> are unknown, {{due in part to}} limited studies on viruses isolated from brain. Previous studies suggest that brain-derived viruses are macrophage tropic (M-tropic) and principally use CCR 5 for virus entry. To better understand HIV- 1 <b>neurotropism,</b> we isolated primary viruses from autopsy brain, cerebral spinal fluid, blood, spleen, and lymph node samples from AIDS patients with dementia and HIV- 1 encephalitis. Isolates were characterized to determine coreceptor usage and replication capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and microglia. Env V 1 /V 2 and V 3 heteroduplex tracking assay and sequence analyses were performed to characterize distinct variants in viral quasispecies. Viruses isolated from brain, which consisted of variants that were distinct from those in lymphoid tissues, used CCR 5 (R 5), CXCR 4 (X 4), or both coreceptors (R 5 X 4). Minor usage of CCR 2 b, CCR 3, CCR 8, and Apj was also observed. Primary brain and lymphoid isolates that replicated to high levels in MDM showed a similar capacity to replicate in microglia. Six of 11 R 5 isolates that replicated efficiently in PBMC could not replicate in MDM or microglia due to a block in virus entry. CD 4 overexpression in microglia transduced with retroviral vectors had no effect on the restricted replication of these virus strains. Furthermore, infection of transfected cells expressing different amounts of CD 4 or CCR 5 with M-tropic and non-M-tropic R 5 isolates revealed a similar dependence on CD 4 and CCR 5 levels for entry, suggesting that the entry block was not due to low levels of either receptor. Studies using TAK- 779 and AMD 3100 showed that two highly M-tropic isolates entered microglia primarily via CXCR 4. These results suggest that HIV- 1 tropism for macrophages and microglia is restricted at the entry level by a mechanism independent of coreceptor specificity. These findings provide evidence that M-tropism rather than CCR 5 usage predicts HIV- 1 <b>neurotropism.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

Four monkey brain and two mouse brain MRP escape (MRPR) variants of FNV were selected at pH 7. 6 and 6. 0. Three monkey brain MRPR variants selected at pH 7. 6 each had only one amino acid substitution in the envelope (E) protein in domain II (E- 237, E- 260, or E 274) and were significantly attenuated in mice following intracerebral inoculation. Two of the variants were tested in monkeys and retained parental <b>neurotropism</b> following intracerebral inoculation at the dose tested.

Human {{dorsal root}} ganglia (DRGs) xenografts in immunodeficient mice provide a model for evaluating VZV neuropathogenesis. Our investigation {{of the role of}} glycoprotein I (gI), which is dispensable in vitro, examines the functions of a VZV gene product during infection of human neural cells in vivo. Whereas intact recombinant Oka (rOka) initiated a short replicative phase followed by persistence in DRGs, the gI deletion mutant, rOkaΔgI, showed prolonged replication with no transition to persistence up to 70 days after infection. Only a few varicella-zoster nucleocapsids and cytoplasmic virions were observed in neurons, and the major VZV glycoprotein, gE, was retained in the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the absence of gI. VZV <b>neurotropism</b> was not disrupted when DRG xenografts were infected with rOka mutants lacking gI promoter elements that bind cellular transactivators, specificity factor 1 (Sp 1) and upstream stimulatory factor (USF). Because gI is essential and Sp 1 and USF contribute to VZV pathogenesis in skin and T cells in vivo, these DRG experiments indicate that the genetic requirements for VZV infection are less stringent in neural cells in vivo.
