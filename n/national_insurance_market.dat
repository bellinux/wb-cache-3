40|$|Objetivou-se neste estudo {{investigar}} sobre o funcionamento do seguro de riscos ambientais como mecanismo de redução ou eliminação de passivos ambientais, bem como a sua aplicabilidade mercadológica no Brasil. O mercado securitário nacional oferece uma gama de coberturas referentes aos riscos de poluição ambiental. As apólices possuem diferentes coberturas, tanto para atender à demanda quanto à poluição súbita, que gera segundo Durço (2001) desastres ambientais de larga repercussão e poluição gradual que persiste por um longo período de tempo. O método de pesquisa utilizado foi o empírico-analítico que privilegia abordagem de estudos práticos com a coleta de dados. Para esta pesquisa foram enviados questionários para 71 empresas de seguros que atuam no Brasil e que são filiadas à Federação Nacional das Empresas de Seguros Privados e de Capitalização (FENASEG). Os resultados encontrados indicam que o nível de oferta do seguro de riscos ambientais no Brasil, como mecanismo de ajuda na minimização de passivos ambientais, ainda é pequeno devido às diversas dificuldades que o mercado segurador enfrenta para operar com este tipo de seguro. Dessa forma, conclui-se, que existe a necessidade de se ampliar o conhecimento do mercado segurador brasileiro, em relação à subscrição de riscos ambientais e coberturas mais complexas, que apresentem soluções adequadas aos empresários e que passem a questionar a sua exposição a esse tipo de risco. The goal of {{this study}} is to investigate the functioning of the environmental risk insurance as a mechanism to reduce or eliminate environmental liabilities, as well as its application in the Brazilian market. The <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>market</b> offers a wide range of coverage for risks of environmental pollution. The policies have different coverage, both against recurring risks and risks of sudden pollution events, which according to Durço (2001, p. 4) generate environmental disasters with wide repercussion, which persist for a long period. The research method used was the empirical-analytical approach which emphasizes practical study with data collection. In order to conduct this research, questionnaires were sent to 71 Brazilian insurance companies, members of the National Insurance Industry Association (FENASEG). The results indicate that the level of insurance against environmental risks offered in Brazil, as a mechanism to help minimizing environmental liability, is still being small due to several difficulties faced by the insurance market to operate with this type of coverage. Thus, we conclude that there is a need for increased knowledge in the Brazilian insurance market regarding underwriting environmental risks and more complex coverage, to satisfy the needs of companies to reduce their exposure to this type of risk...|$|E
40|$|The {{rationale}} underlying {{competition is}} that market forces are best at allocating resources and enhancing consumer choice and value. Further, the evolution and internationalization of financial services markets could significantly promote economic development throughout the world. Thus, moves to render <b>national</b> and international <b>insurance</b> <b>markets</b> more competitive should be encouraged, {{taking into account}} the level of development of each market and recognizing the necessity for reasonable safeguards to protect the public. In this respect, the World Trade Organization (WTO) Financial Services Agreement marked an important milestone in the evolution toward competitive markets. However, market access alone does not ensure vigorous, fair competition. Regulatory reforms also are needed. The next step toward structuring <b>insurance</b> <b>markets</b> that better serve the interest of each country's citizens is regulatory reform built on a set of pro-competitive principles designed to ensure competitive, solvent, and fair markets. This article offers such a set of principles that are designed to permit <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>markets</b> to better serve the public interest. These principles are not an argument for elimination of regulation. In fact, pro-competitive regulation requires a greater – not lesser – emphasis on solvency oversight, disclosure and consumer information, and <b>market</b> monitoring. An <b>insurance</b> <b>market</b> structured around these principles will be one in which regulation is adequate, impartial, and minimally intrusive and, importantly, in which the regulatory process is transparent.

40|$|Purpose – Using a game-theoretic {{model of}} <b>insurance</b> <b>markets,</b> Powers and Shubik in 2001 derived a {{mathematical}} expression for the optimal number of reinsurers {{for a given}} number of primary insurers. Subsequently in 2005, Powers and Shubik showed analytically that, for large numbers of primary insurers, this expression is effectively a “square-root rule”, i. e. the optimal number of reinsurers in a market is given asymptotically by the square root {{of the total number}} of primary insurers. In this paper, we test the accuracy of the square-root rule empirically. Design/methodology/approach – The numbers of primary insurers and reinsurers existing in a range of 18 - 20 different <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>markets</b> over a period of 11 years are used. Findings – The empirical results are consistent with the square-root rule. In addition, we find that the number of reinsurers may also be associated with the market's willingness to pay for risk. When the market's perception of risk is high, there is a greater supply of reinsurance to provide capacity to primary insurers. Originality/value – An empirical model is presented that deals explicitly with the number of insurers and reinsurers in a market. This is of value to government policymakers and insurance regulators.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to {{identify}} the promising directions in reforming the agricultural <b>insurance</b> <b>market</b> {{on the basis of}} studying its current state and consideration of the major development problems.

40|$|With {{a series}} of {{directives}} completed in 1994 the European Commission tried to open and harmonize <b>national</b> European <b>insurance</b> <b>markets.</b> This has led to considerable deregulation in several countries. This paper surveys pre- 1994 regulation in Germany and the UK and the Commission's policy. It argues that {{it is unlikely that}} the policy will have a significant impact on direct international competition between European <b>insurance</b> <b>markets,</b> until there is standardization of insurance law. However, the tightly regulated markets will become more like the loosely regulated UK market. The paper evaluates this outcome and concludes that the European Commission's policy may thereby have improved the welfare of insurance buyers in the previously highly regulated countries such as Germany. The paper also uses efficiency-frontier estimation to compare the dispersion of firm efficiencies in the German and British life <b>insurance</b> <b>market.</b> The results support the hypothesis that tighter solvency regulation allows the survival of a larger proportion of higher-cost firms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to measure {{technical}} efficiency levels in 15 OECD insurance industries over the period 1983 - 1991 and to decompose productivity changes into technical progress and efficiency variations.

We then try to see whether some structural <b>national</b> characteristics of <b>insurance</b> <b>markets</b> can partly explain the differentials in efficiency levels across countries. Reinsurance rates and market shares in OECD both seem to favor efficiency levels.

The previous few years’ Latvian <b>insurance</b> <b>market</b> continued to develop, but within last two years a rapid decrease of signed premiums in as risk as life insurance types has been observed. In the Latvian <b>insurance</b> <b>market</b> the fast gain of the signed premiums both by risk insurance, and in life insurance for the previous few years is observed, but because of economic crisis development of the market stopped. At the same time, the insurance companies will be compelled to search for all new competitive advantages since it is necessary to improve profitability in the <b>insurance</b> <b>market.</b> It inevitably means increase of the prices for services according to their real cost price and economic processes in the country.

40|$|The first {{conference of}} UNCTAD in 1964 {{acknowledged}} {{the development of}} <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance <b>markets</b> as essential aspects of economic growth. Yet, evidence from cointegration analysis by Ward and Zurbruegg (2000) showed there was no long run relationship between growth in the insurance industry and economic growth for some OECD countries, including the UK and the US, by using {{the total value of}} written insurance premia. However, it is surprising that an industry which {{in the case of the}} UK is the largest in Europe, and the third largest in the world, had no effect on the economic activity. As Granger (1990) claimed, it is possible to have cointegration at the aggregate level and not at the disaggregate level and vice versa.
