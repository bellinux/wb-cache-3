The stability of nano-emulsions was determined by measuring the mean size, polydispersity index (PDI) and size distribution of droplets using dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique and monitoring them as a function of time. The nano-emulsions were also characterised using refractive index (RI), surface tension and pH measurements. The efficiency of reversibility test was also investigated on systems aged for various durations (i. e. 3, 4, 5, 9 and 470 days). Experimental results show that n-Dodecane system has higher conductivity values than <b>n-Decane</b> system and as a consequence the PIT values for n-Dodecane system were found to be higher than those for <b>n-Decane</b> system. All freshly produced nanoemulsions were found to be similar in appearance being opaque white with opal shine.

They were also found to have larger droplets and higher RI values but mostly lower pH compared to <b>n-Decane</b> systems. Surface tension values for the reversed <b>n-Decane</b> system were found to be lower when compared to those for fresh one.

40|$|A {{detailed}} chemical–kinetic {{mechanism is}} used to predict critical conditions of extinction and autoignition of condensed hydrocarbon fuels in non-premixed flows. The mechanism includes reactions that describe ‘‘low temperature chemistry’’ as well as ‘‘high temperature chemistry’’ for many high molecular weight fuels. The fuels considered here are n-heptane, <b>n-decane,</b> n-dodecane, n-hexadecane, and isooctane. The kinetic model is validated by comparing its predictions of critical conditions of extinction and autoignition for these fuels with experimental data obtained in a counterflow configuration where a steady laminar flow of an oxidizer is directed over the vaporizing surface of a condensed fuel. The residence time in this configuration is given by the strain rate. The kinetic model predicts that n-heptane is most difficult to extinguish followed by <b>n-decane,</b> n-dodecane, and n-hexadecane. This is in agreement with experimental data. Computations show that the influence of low temperature chemistry on critical conditions of extinction is small. The kinetic model predicts that at low strain rates n-hexadecane is most easy to ignite followed by n-dodecane, <b>n-decane,</b> and n-heptane. At high values of strain rate, n-heptane is more easy to ignite in comparison to <b>n-decane.</b> This is again in agreement with experimental data, including the ‘‘cross-over’’ in relative reactivities of n-heptane and <b>n-decane.</b> Sensitivity analysis shows that at low strain rates autoignition is promoted by low temperature chemistry for all fuels. At high strain rates, autoignition for n-heptane is promoted by high temperature chemistry, whilst low temperature chemistry continues to {{play a significant role}} in promoting autoignition for the other straight-chain hydrocarbon fuels. The ‘‘cross-over’’ in relative reactivities of n-heptane and <b>n-decane</b> is attributed to competition between the rates of low temperature chemistry, rates of high temperature chemistry, and rates of molecular transport for these fuels...|$|E
40|$|Developing an {{improved}} understanding of enhanced biodegradation {{is of great}} importance in remediation of contaminated soils and aquifers and in cleanup of oil spills. The effect of several nonionic and anionic surfactants and their mixtures on the biodegradation of <b>n-decane</b> was investigated. Microbial growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the solubilized hydrocarbon {{was found to be}} stimulated by all of the non-ionic surfactants tested, with varying degrees of enhancements in the rate of biodegradation compared to that found in the absence of surfactant. Three anionic surfactants, Linear Alkyl benzene Sulfonate (LAS), Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) and Neodol 25 - 3 S, an alcohol ethoxysulfate, were investigated. Both SDS and N 25 - 3 S stimulated the degradation of <b>n-decane.</b> LAS did not support the growth of P. aeruginosa with or without decane but its mixtures with the nonionic surfactant Neodol 25 - 7 did enhance the overall degradation except at very high LAS contents. A novel aspect of this study was the simultaneous measurements of surfactant concentration, cell mass, and <b>n-decane</b> concentration as a function of time when the surfactant was SDS. A modified Monod model was developed to simulate bacterial growth rate and substrate and surfactant degradation. Predictions of the model were in good agreement with experimental data. With the assumption that the cell mass generated by degradation of a given quantity of <b>n-decane</b> was the same when other surfactants were used, it was possible to apply the model successfully in other systems where it was not feasible to measure surfactant degradation. The half saturation constant K S for <b>n-decane</b> degradation was high both for highly degradable surfactants and for poorly degradable mixtures such as those with high contents of LAS.

This study employed stress relaxation technique to investigate the effects of three solvents, namely, decalin (cycloparaffin), <b>n-decane</b> (normal paraffin), and ShellSol T solvent (isoparaffins) on O-rings made from different materials. Results indicated that both fluorosilicone and fluorocarbon O-rings showed excellent compatibility with all 25 blends tested.

Effects of the three solvents presented in the tests indicated aromatics are not the only compounds that can swell nitrile O-ring. It is also important to notice that although decalin presents good O-ring swelling ability, it does not mean all cycloparaffins have the same property. <b>n-decane</b> also showed certain O-ring swelling ability but its main effect during the polymer-fuel interaction process is to extract materials out of nitrile O-ring.

Initially samples of known volumetric fractions of n-hexane, n-octane and <b>n-decane</b> were prepared. These were injected into the gas chromatograph and the respective peak areas were obtained. The known volumetric frations versus the peak areas obtained from the chromatograms were plotted for each component. These standard curve were later {{used to determine the}} volumetric fractions of the produced fluids from the miscible displacements. The reproducibility of the systems was checked four times and found very satisfactory. More than one hundred samples containing mixtures of n-hexane, n-octane and <b>n-decane</b> were analysed. The volume of samples range from 6. 0 mL to 12 mL. The volumetric fractions and hence the recovery efficiency of the miscible displacements were successfully obtained. ...|$|E

Nitroalkanes were proposed as the effective initiator because of the lower CN bond dissociation energy. In order to investigate the initiation mechanism of nitroalkanes on hydrocarbon pyrolysis, the pyrolysis of <b>n-decane,</b> nitromethane and their binary mixture were carried out at 30, 150 and 760  Torr in a flow reactor with synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS). The identified and quantified pyrolysis species include C 1 C 2 alkanes, C 2 C 10 alkenes, C 3 C 6 dialkenes, C 2 C 3 alkynes, nitrogen oxides such as NO and NO 2, benzene, and radicals including CH 3, C 3 H 3, and C 3 H 5, which {{shed light on the}} mechanism of <b>n-decane</b> and nitromethane pyrolysis, as well as the interactions of these two fuels. The experimental results indicate that the addition of nitromethane decreases the initial decomposition temperature of <b>n-decane,</b> and a stronger promotion effect could be obtained as the experimental pressure increases. The distributions of alkanes, alkenes, dialkenes, alkynes and benzene are also influenced by the addition of nitromethane. A detailed kinetic model with 266 species and 1648 reactions was developed and validated against the mole fraction profiles of reactants, major products and important intermediates during the pyrolysis of each fuel and their binary mixture. The satisfactory model prediction to the experimental measurements permits the analysis of the kinetic effect of nitromethane initiation on the pyrolysis of <b>n-decane.</b> So that, the increase of the conversion rate at a lower temperature, the selectivity of decomposition products, and reduction of benzene formation are better understood...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study we {{investigate}} the size and volume distribution of <b>n-decane</b> clusters in a brine saturated porous glass sample by means of micro-CT imaging with pore-scale resolution. Cluster size distribution functions and cluster volumes were obtained by image analysis {{for a range of}} injected pore volumes under both imbibition and drainage conditions, and with a field of view larger than the porosity-based representative elementary volume (REV). <b>n-decane</b> clusters were found to be distributed in sizes greater than that of the REV, with the largest one containing between 65 and 99 % of the entire non-wetting phase. The results indicate that the two-phase REV may be substantially larger than for single-phase flow and larger than the attainable field of view...|$|E
