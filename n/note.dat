5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest <b>note</b> of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest <b>note</b> of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest <b>note</b> of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest <b>note</b> of the oboe.|$|E

5000|$|Admission <b>notes</b> {{document}} {{the reasons why}} a patient is being admitted for inpatient care to a hospital or other facility, the patient's baseline status, and the initial instructions for that patient's care.

Medical students often develop their clinical reasoning skills by writing admission <b>notes.</b> The traditional, rational definition of being admitted usually involves spending an overnight in the hospital. This definition is sometimes stretched in the U.S. medical billing industry, where hospital corporations may blur the definitions of [...] "admission" [...] and [...] "observation" [...] because of reimbursement rules under which healthcare payors pay less for the care if an [...] "admission" [...] was involved.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the degree of}} contamination of taka <b>notes,</b> samples of the <b>notes</b> circulating in different local markets and people of different professions in Khulna region of Bangladesh were collected. Coliforms, the indicator organisms in taka <b>notes</b> were determined by multiple tube method and identified with differential media and data were analyzed. About 80 ± 5 % of old two-taka <b>notes</b> were contaminated with total coliforms and 16 ± 4 % of <b>notes</b> were found contaminated with fecal coliforms. But comparatively newer two-taka <b>notes</b> showed that 43 ± 3 % were contaminated with total coliforms and 5 ± 2 % were with fecal coliforms, suggesting the notion that more handled taka <b>notes</b> were contaminated more intensely even by fecal coliforms. Ten taka <b>notes</b> also represented {{the same pattern of}} results as two-taka <b>notes,</b> indicating that taka <b>notes</b> may carry enteric pathogens. This study also revealed that porsaline paper <b>notes</b> were easily vulnerable to coliforms contamination whereas polymer paper <b>notes</b> were almost free from coliforms suggesting that polymer paper <b>notes</b> are safer to use than porsaline paper <b>notes...</b>|$|R
