25|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{increased}} cross-border interaction created a rising <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> which {{was met by}} concise handwritten news-sheets. In 1556, the government of Venice first published the monthly notizie scritte, which cost one gazetta, a small coin. These avvisi were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers. However, none of these publications fully met the classical criteria for proper newspapers, as they were typically not intended {{for the general public}} and restricted to a certain range of topics.|$|E
25|$|Platforms like LinkedIn {{create an}} {{environment}} for companies and clients to connect online. Companies that recognize the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>information,</b> originality/ and accessibility employ blogs to make their products popular and unique/ and ultimately reach out to consumers who are privy to social media. Studies from 2009 show that consumers view coverage in the media or from bloggers as being more neutral and credible than print advertisements, which are not thought of as free or independent. Blogs allow a product or company to provide longer descriptions of products or services, can include testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages. Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping customers, and also for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social network pages. Online communities can enable a business to reach the clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure their standing in the corporate world, sites enable employees to place evaluations of their companies.|$|E

500|$|The {{completely}} revised {{second edition}} of Lemurs of Madagascar was reviewed {{in detail in}} the American Journal of Primatology by Stacey Tecot. [...] Each chapter, section, and appendix was thoroughly summarized, and as with the reviews of previous editions, the chapter on subfossil lemurs was noted {{as one of the}} more [...] "fascinating" [...] parts of the book, particularly due to its colorful and informative illustrations. [...] Although the book received only praise, Tecot did suggest two additions for the next edition: the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>information</b> about the processes of island biogeography and expansion on captive conservation programs aside from the Duke Lemur Center, particularly at the Lemur Conservation Foundation and St. Catherines Island. [...] A subject index was also recommended, along with better referencing of the figures and illustrations. [...] Otherwise, the book was praised as being better than other field guides due to its inclusion of seemingly obscure yet important details, such as how to get to lemur watching sites, travel time, where to stay, mentions of lesser-known sites, listings of species to be seen, best times to observe, and even, among other things, the number of habituated lemur groups in each area. [...] Tecot noted that the lemur checklist promoted competitive lemur watching, similar to birdwatching, and that the color-coded sections assisted in [...] "on-the-fly species identification." [...] Although very satisfied with the information provided for each species, Tecot commended the promise made in this edition to more extensively cover the published literature in the upcoming third edition. [...] Like its predecessor, the second edition was praised as an excellent tool for ecotourists and researchers. [...] It was also noted for its attempt to promote ecotourism as a conservation strategy.|$|E
