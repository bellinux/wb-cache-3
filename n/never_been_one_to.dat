2500|$|Ai Ogawa (October 21, 1947 – March 20, 2010), born as Florence Anthony, was an American {{poet and}} educator. She won the 1999 National Book Award for Poetry for Vice: New and Selected Poems. Ai {{is known for}} her mastery of the {{dramatic}} monologue as a poetic form, {{as well as for}} taking on dark, controversial topics in her work. [...] About writing in the dramatic monologue form, she’s said: “I want to take the narrative ‘persona’ poem as far as I can, and I've <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> do things in halves. All the way or nothing. I won't abandon that desire.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Red Sox {{pitching}} coach John Farrell stated that Buchholz {{would most likely}} be in line for 180–190 innings in the 2008 season. On May 15, Buchholz {{was placed on the}} 15-day disabled list {{as the result of a}} torn fingernail. He was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket following the injury, and remained there for several weeks to work on his fastball. On July 11, he was recalled to Boston and was part of their regular pitching rotation, though he did not record a single win after his return. On August 20, as the Red Sox were trying to sweep the Orioles, the team that Buchholz had no-hit the preceding year, he gave up a 4–0 lead by allowing three runs in the second inning and two more in the third. He was removed after only pitching [...] innings. In his previous start, he had only lasted three innings. In 2008, the Red Sox were 3–12 in Buchholz' fifteen starts. After the game, Buchholz was demoted to Double-A Portland. Buchholz stated [...] "I've never had a streak like this", and [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> say the pressure was too much for me, but I've felt like I've had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect and trying to do everything as well as I could to help this team win". Following the 2008 season, Buchholz pitched in the Arizona Fall League.|$|E

People do not have to agree with or believe in what they saw. The film was later awarded the grand jury prize.|$|R

[...] "It is no worse to starve <b>to</b> death in <b>one</b> place than another, and I <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> give up without trying. If you don't mind showing me the way, Brother Blacky, I {{would at least}} {{like to try to}} reach that place where the fat hens are. Of course I cannot keep up with you. In fact, I couldn't if I were feeling well and strong. Perhaps you can tell me just how to find that place, and then I needn't bother you at all." ...|$|R

"It {{was hard}} parting with old Miller, {{who had been}} like a father to me; it cost me, too, {{something}} of a struggle {{to give up the}} free, independent wild-wood life I had hitherto led; but I had marked out my course, and had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> flinch or turn back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but that}} don't comfort me any. I <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> feel good because another man felt bad. How {{would you have}} liked it if some one had taken comfort because his boy lived when ours died? No, I can't do it. And this is worse than death, someways. That comes and it goes; but this {{looks as if it}} <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of those things that had come to stay. The way I look at it, there ain't any hope for anybody. Suppose we don't want Pen to have him; will that help Irene any, if he don't want her? Suppose we don't want to let him have either; does that help either!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Back in the 1950s, Boston artist, {{sculptor}} {{and photographer}} Ernst Halberstadt and {{his good friend}} Harold Plotkin (poet and businessman) started the original [...] "Boston Arts Festival". It was an incredible success, {{so much so that}} politicians after several years had {{to get in on the}} action, with others wanting to be [...] "somebody important", and Harold and Ernst simply bowed out. Ernst <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> play politics and really detested giving galleries 40-50% of the price of a painting for just hanging it on a wall and selling it. That was why the whole thing started. He wanted a place where artists could sell their work and keep all or most of the money.|$|R

It 's {{not in my}} character to dandle one when I see two waiting to be caught; 'voyager, apprendre, c'est plus fort que moi'." [...] He paused; then, with a nervous goggle of the eyes and an ironic smile he said: [...] "Besides, 'mon cher monsieur', it is better that I go. I have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> hug illusions, and I see pretty clearly that my presence is hardly acceptable in this house." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bertie had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> bestow caresses, even on her parents, and {{her only}} sign of deep feeling now {{lay in the}} tremble of her voice. She drew her hand away, and putting her arm about her mother's neck patted her cheek. [...] "Cassie's doing well," [...] she said, abruptly, [...] "and the girls are fine. They brace {{right up to the}} situation, and--and everybody's nice to us. I reckon a dozen of the church ladies called {{yesterday}} to ask how you were--and Captain Haney came down to-day on purpose to find out how things were going." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} door that led {{out of the house}} by the billiard room, Honora remembered, and contrived, after luncheon, to slip away and reach it. She felt that she must be alone, and if she went to her room she was likely to be {{disturbed}} by Susan or Mrs. Joshua--or indeed Mrs. Holt herself. Honora meant to tell Susan the first of all. She crossed the great lawn quickly, keeping as much as possible the trees and masses of shrubbery between herself and the house, and reached the forest. With a really large fund of energy at her disposal, Honora had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> believe in the useless expenditure of it; nor did she feel the intense desire which a girl of another temperament might have had, under the same conditions, to keep in motion. So she sat down on a bench within the borders of the wood.|$|E
50|$|Proactive {{aggression}} is a behavior that expects a reward. With bullying each individual {{has a role}} to defend.

I had been {{informed}} that the government permits any one who will, to subscribe his name as a candidate to enter the fire--which is an act of liberality worthy of the magnificent Signoria--reserving of course the right to make a selection. And doubtless many believers will be eager to subscribe their names. For what is it to enter the fire, to one whose faith is firm? A man is afraid of the fire, because he believes it will burn him; but if he believes the contrary?"--here Tito lifted his shoulders and made an oratorical pause--"for which reason I have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> disbelieve the Frate, when he has said that he would enter the fire to prove his doctrine. For in his place, if you believed the fire would not burn you, which of you, my friends, would not enter it as readily as you would walk along the dry bed of the Mugnone?" ...|$|E

For several years she has made annual visits to New York and Paris, home of her Aunt Vera and cousin Tatiana.
