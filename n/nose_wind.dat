50|$|Wind Cloud (Feng-Yun or Fengyun, 风云) UAV is a VTOL UAV {{developed}} by NUAA, {{and it made}} its public debut at the AVIC Cup UAV Innovation Competition held in Beijing in September 2009. Wind Cloud is a tail-sitter, but unlike most propeller driven tail-sitter where the engine is mounted in the <b>nose,</b> <b>Wind</b> Cloud is similar to SNECMA Coléoptère in that the ducted fan of Wind Cloud is mounted at the rear section of the fuselage. However, Wind Cloud differs from SNECMA Coléoptère in that the {{it does not have}} closed wing, but instead, a pair of conventional wings. The vertical stabilizer is mounted after the ducted fan. Wind Cloud is mainly intended for research on tail-sitter aircraft technology.|$|E
50|$|Reimar Horten {{began work}} on the I.Ae. 37 around 1952, after his earlier flying wing {{projects}} were cancelled in 1951. This was a single-engined jet fighter that used a flying wing structure with lateral engine inlets {{on each side of}} the <b>nose.</b> <b>Wind</b> tunnel tests began in 1953 as did testing of scale models at speeds up to 200 km/h. A full scale glider was built and made its first flight on 1 October 1954. Most unusually the pilot lay prone and looked out through the clear nose. Flight performance was deemed excellent and manufacture of a prototype powered by a Rolls-Royce Derwent V began in 1955. This engine was selected as it was readily available, but lacked the thrust desired for the actual fighter. The glider was modified with a normal cockpit in 1956. Shortly afterwards the program was split with the current aircraft becoming a subsonic trainer and a new, more powerful fighter, designated as the I.Ae. 48, with two podded engines under the wings and intended to reach the speed of Mach 2.2 (2700 km/h). However, both projects were cancelled in 1960 as an economy measure, only a year before the I.Ae. 37 was to fly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Electronic nose (array of {{chemical}} sensors) {{are widely used}} in food industry and pollution control. Also {{it could be used}} to locate or detect the direction of the source of emission odors. Usually this task is performed by electronic nose (ENose) cooperated with mobile vehicles, but when a source is instantaneous or surrounding is hard for vehicles to reach, problem occurs. Thus a method for stationary ENose to detect the direction of the source and locate the source will be required. A novel method which uses the ratio between the responses of different sensors as a discriminant to determine the direction of source in natural wind surroundings is presented in this paper. The result shows that the method is accurate and easily to be implemented. This method could be also used in movably, as an optimized algorithm for robot tracking source location.

40|$|Context Bat {{conservation}} {{in the eastern}} United States faces threats from white <b>nose</b> syndrome, <b>wind</b> energy, and fragmentation of habitat. To mitigate population declines, the habitat requirements of species of concern must be established. Assessments that predict habitat quality based upon landscape features can aid species management over large areas. Roosts are critical habitat for many bat species including the endangered Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) and the threatened northern long-eared bat (M. septentrionalis). Objectives While much {{is known about the}} microhabitat requirements of roosts, translating such knowledge into landscape-level management is difficult. Our goal was to determine the landscape-scale environmental variables necessary to predict roost occupancy for both species. Methods Using MaxLike, a presence-only occupancy modeling approach, with known roost sites, we identified factors associated with roosting habitat. Spatially independent roost locations were particularly limited for northern long-eared bats resulting in differences in study areas and sample sizes between the two species.

50|$|Exposed to {{the drying}} and warming {{effects of the}} {{recurrent}} Chinook <b>winds,</b> <b>Nose</b> Hill provided favorable wintering grounds for bison herds which, in turn, attracted people to the hill's grassy slopes. The park today contains numerous tipi rings circles of stone once used to weigh down the conical-shaped skin dwellings of plains bison hunters. Also within the perimeters of today's park are ancient tool-making stations, a stone cairn, and evidence of bison kills conducted long ago.

While he watched and searched the lake and the shores not a deer stirred from his tracks. Some command was in the air which I myself seemed to feel in my hiding. Suddenly the big buck turned and glided away into the woods, and every deer on the shore followed instantly without question or hesitation. Even the little fawns, never so heedless as to miss a signal, felt something in the buck's attitude deeper than their play, something perhaps in the air that was not noticed before, and trotted after their mothers, fading away at last like shadows into the darkening woods.|$|R

Almost at the first cry of [...] "Man overboard!" [...] the captain's bell rang sharp and quick, as if by magic, with three peremptory little calls in the engine-room below. The Australasian was going at full speed, but in a marvellously short time, as it seemed to all on board, the great ship had slowed down to a perfect standstill, and then had reversed her engines, so that she lay, just <b>nose</b> to the <b>wind,</b> awaiting further orders. In the meantime, {{almost as soon as}} the words were out of the bo'sun's lips, a sailor amidships had rushed to the safety belts hung up by the companion ladder, and had flung half a dozen of them, one after another, with hasty but well-aimed throws, far, far astern, in the direction where Felix had disappeared into the black water. The belts were painted white, and they showed for a few seconds, as they fell, like bright specks {{on the surface of the}} darkling sea; then they sunk slowly behind as the big ship, still not quite stopped, ploughed her way ahead with gigantic force into the great abyss of darkness in front of her.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wakes {{are formed}} behind a blunt body over which fluid flows due to {{separation}} of boundary layer. This phenomenon {{is associated with}} the formation of vortices resulting in large losses of energy. Pressure distribution in wake is nearly uniform across the wake and its magnitude is less than the upstream pressure. In the present work, it is proposed to use a blunt body, such as a wing with truncated aerofoil cross section, as a flow deflector, behind which the wake will be formed due to wind flow. Primary objective of the present work is to correlate the wake pressure with the geometry of the deflector and the wind speed. A series of models of different length and nose angles have been fabricated and tested in the low speed airflow rig at varying upstream air velocities. Data obtained from these tests indicate that the pressure drop in the wake is strongly related to the geometry of the flow deflector and upstream air velocity. Higher-pressure drop can be obtained by increasing the chord, <b>nose</b> angle or <b>wind</b> speed. This pressure drop can be used for enhancing the air circulation to an enclosure, say kitchen or an air-conditioned room, from which stale/foul air is to be removed.

40|$|As {{identified}} in the CFD Vision 2030 Study commissioned by NASA, validation of advanced RANS models and scale-resolving methods for computing turbulent flow fields must be supported by continuous improvements in fundamental, high-fidelity experiments designed specifically for CFD implementation. In accordance with this effort, the underpinnings of a new test platform referred to herein as the NASA Axisymmetric Afterbody are presented. The devised body-of-revolution is a modular platform consisting of a forebody section and afterbody section, allowing {{for a range of}} flow behaviors to be studied on interchangeable afterbody geometries. A body-of-revolution offers advantages in shape definition and fabrication, in avoiding direct contact with wind tunnel sidewalls, and in tail-sting integration to facilitate access to higher Reynolds number tunnels. The current work is focused on validation of smooth-body turbulent flow separation, for which a six-parameter body has been developed. A priori RANS computations are reported for a risk-reduction test configuration in order to demonstrate critical variation among turbulence model results for a given afterbody, ranging from barely-attached to mild separated flow. RANS studies of the effects of forebody <b>nose</b> (with/without) and <b>wind</b> tunnel boundary (slip/no-slip) on the selected afterbody are presented. Representative modeling issues that can be explored with this configuration are the effect of higher Reynolds number on separation behavior, flow physics of the progression from attached to increasingly-separated afterbody flows, and the effect of embedded longitudinal vortices on turbulence structure...|$|R
40|$|In {{conjunction}} with the NASA-Gulfstream and Gulfstream-University of Florida wind tunnel testing of a generic nose landing gear model, Computational Aero-Acoustics research was conducted at Gulfstream using the commercial Navier-Stokes Finite Volume CFD solver STAR-CCM+. The simulation modeled the scale G 550 nose landing gear mounted in the NASA Basic Aerodynamics Research Tunnel (BART) wind tunnel test section. The model was run at the 0. 166 Mach Number condition on the simplified nose landing gear with the gear cavity closed. Prior to simulation execution, dynamic pressure probes were inserted {{onto the surface of}} the model at the exact locations of the dynamic pressure transducers on the <b>nose</b> landing gear <b>wind</b> tunnel model. Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) [1] was run with a 58 million cell unstructured grid on 47 3. 0 GHz quad-core processors for approximately two weeks to obtain a total of 0. 05 seconds of statistically limit-cycled pressure data was processed. Results of the simulation were compared to data from the NASA BART and University of Florida anechoic wind tunnel results at both surface mounted steady and unsteady pressure transducers. The simulation showed good agreement in comparisons of power spectral density up to 5 kHz at mesh/time step dependent frequencies at all locations captured.

40|$|The {{general lack}} of {{knowledge}} on basic aspects of the biology of temperate and tropical bats, their low reproductive rates, and threats such as white <b>nose</b> syndrome, <b>wind</b> farms, and habitat loss, make them very susceptible to population declines. My research uses an innovative technique, the analysis of stable isotopes, to study the ecology of bat migration with the main goals of contributing significantly {{to the understanding of}} bat biology and assessing the conservation status and susceptibility of bats. In the first chapter,I measured the content of hydrogen isotopes in fur samples of migratory bat species killed at a wind farm in northern Indiana to determine their geographic origin. North American tree bats (Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus,and Lasionycteris noctivagans) are considered long distance migrants. In North America, peaks in bat mortality at wind farms occur between mid-July and mid-September. This period is associated with fall migration of bats from their summer (breeding) grounds to their wintering grounds. Thus, wind turbines may have serious negative effects on a strategic event in the life of bats by interrupting migratory connectivity and thereby imperiling the long-term persistence of migratory bat species at large scales. The analysis accurately predicted the known origin of control samples and estimated that non-control bats killed at the wind farm originated from several populations in the United States as well as in Canada. My results highlighted the threat of wind farms to local bat populations as well as to bats originating far from those farms, and emphasized the need for conservation policies across borders. High variation in stable hydrogen isotopes in migrant individuals of all 3 species was observed, suggesting that individuals or populations from a variety of regions pass through the wind farm. In the second chapter,I evaluated the triple-isotopic (hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen) composition of the tissues of 7 bat species collected at 3 altitudes in the Central Andes of Peru,and the variation of these isotopes across an altitudinal gradient,the application of isotope analysis to migration studies, and trophic effect. Previous studies had demonstrated that iv hydrogen isotopes were a reliable tool to track altitudinal movements of birds, and there was evidence from soil and plant studies that nitrogen and carbon isotopes could serve the same purpose. However, studies focused on bats were lacking. Hydrogen and nitrogen isotopes in the sanguinivorous control were found to be enriched relative to those of the syntopic frugivores. Carbon isotopes in the sanguinivorous bat were depleted when compared to frugivores. Differences in hydrogen found between trophic groups are the first reported for the species studied and support results found elsewhere in the Neotropics. My results demonstrated that, in spite of the wide array of physiological and environmental factors producing temporal and spatial variation, the analysis of hydrogen isotopes is a promising tool to study altitudinal movements of bats when used over long distances. Neither stable isotopes of nitrogen or carbon appear to be reliable to track movements along short gradients such as those along mountains. The contrast of these findings with the results of previous studies suggests that isotopic gradients may be specific to given taxon and localities. My results contributed to the understanding of bat movement patterns and therefore to assessing their sensitivity to potential threats such as habitat loss and connectivity.
