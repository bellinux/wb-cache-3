5|$|The SSSI is a long, <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of coast {{that starts}} at the eastern {{boundary}} of The Wash between Old Hunstanton and Holme-next-the-Sea, and runs east for about 43km (27mi) to Kelling. The southern boundary runs roughly west to east except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the A149 coast road.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 the Israeli cabinet withdrew its {{military}} and settlements from the Gaza Strip including the Philadelphi Route, a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> {{adjacent to the}} border with Egypt, {{as part of its}} unilateral disengagement plan. Since the Palestinian organization, Hamas won a surprise victory in the Palestinian elections of 2006, it has been engaged in a violent power struggle with rival Palestinian organization Fatah.|$|E

5|$|McFetridge Drive is the {{boundary}} between Grant Park and Burnham Park. Beginning with Northerly Island and the 14th Street Beach, and enclosing Burnham Harbor and its public marina, the park runs in a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> past Soldier Field and McCormick Place, both of which disrupt Burnham's original plan, south to 56th street. The park, from North to South, runs through the communities of Near South, Douglas, Oakland, Kenwood and Hyde Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{superficial}} rock of Orkney {{is almost}} entirely Old Red Sandstone, mostly of Middle Devonian age. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series, as may {{be seen on the}} Mainland, where a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, and again in the small island of Graemsay; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.|$|E
5|$|Oscarsson in {{the late}} 1970s {{proposed}} that these cortical zones can be partitioned into smaller units called microzones. A microzone {{is defined as a}} group of Purkinje cells all having the same somatotopic receptive field. Microzones were found to contain on the order of 1000 Purkinje cells each, arranged in a long, <b>narrow</b> <b>strip,</b> oriented perpendicular to the cortical folds. Thus, as the adjoining diagram illustrates, Purkinje cell dendrites are flattened {{in the same direction as}} the microzones extend, while parallel fibers cross them at right angles.|$|E
50|$|Plants were {{carefully}} selected to produce strong, thin, <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> of fibre of suitable length for basket making.|$|R

5|$|Route22 {{continues}} heading northeast along a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of {{land between}} the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course {{than it had}} up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas {{of the town of}} Patterson, where two local state highways, NY312 and 164, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY311, and passing another strip plaza, NY22 crosses into Dutchess County.|$|E
5|$|SR11, named Chuckanut Drive for its whole route, {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-5 north of Burlington. From the interchange, the highway travels northwest through farmland, closely paralleling a BNSF Railway route from Mount Vernon to Bellingham, also {{used by the}} Amtrak Cascades service. The road turns north to intersect Bow Hill Road, formerly SR237 until 1991, east of Edison. SR11 continues north to Blanchard, where it begins to traverse a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of land between the Chuckanut Mountains and Samish Bay. Midway between Blanchard and the Skagit–Whatcom county line, the highway travels through a hairpin turn at Oyster Creek.|$|E
5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of land that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E
50|$|Sails {{started to}} be used from {{possibly}} the 8th century. The earliest had either plaited or chequered pattern, with <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> sewn together.|$|R

50|$|Elephant {{corridors}} are <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> of {{land that}} allow elephants {{to move from one}} habitat patch to another. There are 88 identified elephant corridors in India.|$|R
5|$|On the north, the Saw Mill {{watershed}} is {{bordered by}} the watersheds of Gedney Brook and the Kisco River, {{both of which}} drain into New Croton Reservoir on the Croton River, one of several large reservoirs in that watershed {{that are part of}} New York City's water supply system. On the northeast, the adjacent watersheds drain into Kensico Reservoir, another that supplies the city. Moving south, the next watersheds are tributaries of the Bronx River, then Yonkers' Grassy Sprain Reservoir and finally Tibbetts Brook. To its west in the <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> between the Saw Mill and the Hudson are the Pocantico River and Sheldon Brook watersheds {{at the north end of}} the watershed, and those of unnamed shorter streams at the south.|$|E
5|$|The North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is {{an internationally}} {{important}} protected area in Norfolk, England. The SSSI is a long, <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of coastal land that starts between Old Hunstanton and Holme-next-the-Sea, and runs east for about 43km (27mi) to Kelling. The southern boundary runs roughly {{west to east}} except where it detours around towns and villages, and never crosses the A149 coast road. It has an area of 7,700ha (19,027acres), and is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings; it {{is also part of}} the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Scolt Head Island and the coast from the Holkham National Nature Reserve to Salthouse are a Biosphere Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh lowland zone {{consists}} of the north coastal plain, the island of Anglesey, part of the Llŷn Peninsula, a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of coast along Cardigan Bay, much of Pembrokeshire and southern Carmarthenshire, the Gower Peninsula and the Vale of Glamorgan. The main rivers are the River Dee, part of which forms the boundary between Wales and England, the River Clwyd and the River Conwy, which all flow northwards into Liverpool Bay and the Irish Sea. Further round the coast, the Rivers Mawddach, Dovey, Rheidol, Ystwyth and Teifi flow westwards into Cardigan Bay, and the rivers Towy, Taff, Usk and Wye flow southwards into the Bristol Channel. Parts of the River Severn form the boundary between Wales and England.|$|E
50|$|In Hong Kong, pork {{barbecue}} is {{made with}} a marinade of honey and soy sauce, and cooked in long, <b>narrow</b> <b>strips.</b> This form of barbecue is known as char siu.|$|R
50|$|Belvedere Lagoon is an {{artificial}} lagoon on San Francisco Bay in Belvedere in Marin County, California. <b>Narrow</b> <b>strips</b> of land separate it from Richardson Bay (to the northwest) and Raccoon Strait.|$|R
50|$|While most districts {{produced}} by the method will be fairly compact and either roughly rectangular or triangular, some of the resulting districts can still be long and <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> (or triangles) of land.|$|R
5|$|The {{town centre}} {{contains}} three Grade I listed bridges. The Town Bridge is a 15th-century ashlar stone bridge {{composed of two}} portions separated by a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of land. The eastern portion crosses the narrower of two branches of the River Avon that pass through the town and features five low round-headed arches. The western bridge features two arches and crosses the millstream which runs adjacent to the Avon. To {{the east of the}} Town Bridge on the same route from the town centre the Waterloo Bridge spans the larger branch of the Avon. Built circa 1816–1817 in the mediaeval tradition with dressed Portland stone, its design incorporates five wide segmental arches, circular piers and capped cutwaters. On the northern side of the bridge a modern steel pedestrian footbridge is cantilevered to the older structure.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{playing fields}} to the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, a former street market that {{has evolved into}} a short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way – built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a {{programme}} of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb, and runs on an embankment due to a dip in the ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood – two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London.|$|E
5|$|From Lexington Avenue, where NY390 passes {{into the}} town of Greece, north to NY104, NY390 runs {{parallel}} to {{the western edge of}} Eastman Business Park, the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak. Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of land that lies within the Rochester city limits, a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North of the strip, NY390 curves to the northeast, passing along {{the west side of the}} industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY104. Heading northbound, it splits into two halves, with exit24A connecting to NY104 east and exit24B linking to NY104 west.|$|E
25|$|Situated {{south and}} west of the Cotabato Basin are a {{moderately}} high mountain range, the Tiruray Highlands, which block off the Basin from the southern coastline. South of the highlands are <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> of coastlines.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Pacific Cordillera {{mountain}} range encompasses the province. To {{the east of}} the range lie <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> of coastal areas, which feature several inlets and bays. The province encloses the Davao Gulf to the southwest.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is in the}} neotropical realm, in {{the tropical}} and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome.The forests have many endemic species {{of plants and animals}} found only locally on mountain ridges or <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> of land.|$|R
5|$|It also occurs {{throughout}} northern Colombia at low elevations {{and into}} western Venezuela west of Lake Maracaibo {{and at the}} foot of the western part of the Venezuelan Coastal Range east to Guatopo National Park. Hylaeamys megacephalus occurs further to the east in the eastern portion of the coastal range, separated by the coastal Eastern Caribbean Dry Zone. There is a record from the Orinoco Delta of northeastern Venezuela, well within the range of Hylaeamys megacephalus, but Musser and colleagues suggest that this is based on mislabeled specimens. The species has also been found on the <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> between the Llanos and the Andes (Cordillera Oriental and Cordillera de Mérida) in eastern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela. The unforested Llanos separate these areas from Hylaeamys populations. Hylaeamys perenensis does, however, occur further south along the eastern foothills of the Cordillera Oriental in Colombia and it is possible that the two overlap in this area.|$|E
5|$|South India is a {{peninsula}} in {{the shape}} of an inverted triangle bound by the Arabian Sea on the west, by the Bay of Bengal on the east and Vindhya and Satpura ranges on the north. The Narmada river flows westwards in the depression between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges which define the northern spur of the Deccan plateau. The Western Ghats run parallel along the western coast and the <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> of land between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea forms the Konkan region. The Western Ghats continue south until Kanyakumari. The Eastern Ghats run parallel along the eastern coast and the strip of land between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal forms the Coromandel region. Both the ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains. The Nilgiris run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, encompassing the Palakkad and Wayanad hills and the Sathyamangalam ranges, extending on to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu–Andhra Pradesh border forming the Tirupati and Annamalai hills.|$|E
5|$|The 5th century saw the {{withdrawal}} of Imperial Roman support from Britain, and the succeeding centuries, the Dark Ages, witnessed {{the emergence of a}} national identity and of kingdoms. The area which would become the Rhondda lay within Glywysing, an area that incorporated the modern area of Glamorgan, ruled by a dynasty founded by Glywys. This dynasty was later replaced by another founded by Meurig ap Tewdrig whose descendant Morgan ap Owain would give Glamorgan its Welsh name Morgannwg. With the coming of the Norman overlords after the 1066 Battle of Hastings, south-east Wales was divided into five cantrefi. The Rhondda lay within Penychen, a <b>narrow</b> <b>strip</b> running between modern day Glyn Neath and the coast between Cardiff and Aberthaw. Each cantref was further divided into commotes, with Penychen made up of five such commotes, one being Glynrhondda.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} type of nameri is of semi-evergreen, moist deciduous forests with cane and bamboo brakes and <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> of open grassland along rivers. The forests {{are rich in}} epiphytes, lianas, and creepers and clump-forming bamboo.|$|R
5000|$|These <b>narrow</b> <b>strips</b> {{of fabric}} are {{generally}} decorated with inspirational slogans, like [...] "日本一" [...] (Nippon Ichi, [...] "the best of Japan" [...] or [...] "Japan's the best"), but most typically {{with the rising}} sun motif.|$|R
50|$|Positive {{magnetic}} variations {{are found}} in <b>narrow</b> <b>strips,</b> west-southwest oriented of the west coast, and east-northeast off the northern coast, and south-north offshore from the Coastal Range heading south. These are {{of the order of}} 200 nT.|$|R
