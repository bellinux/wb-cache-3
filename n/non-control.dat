2500|$|Problems with {{spatial memory}} and {{navigation}} {{are thought to}} be one of the early indications of Alzheimer's Disease. Delpolyi and Rankin compared thirteen mild Alzheimer's patients and twenty-one mild-cognitive impairment patients, with twenty-four subjects with normal brain functioning through a series of spatially related tasks. The first task entailed route memory and the study found that the <b>non-control</b> group could not find their location on the map, or recall the order in which they had seen landmarks. The overall results showed that only 10% of the control group got lost on the route while 50% of the <b>non-control</b> group got lost. The demonstrated issues with spatial navigation among Alzheimer's and MCI patients indicates a malfunctioning with the firing of place cells and that abnormalities within the hippocampus may be an early indicatory of disease onset. [...] O'Keefe who originally found the existence of place cells said that, [...] "We suspect we'll begin to see signs of changes in the functions of cells before we see changes in behavioral tasks." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The primary aim of {{this paper}} is to {{illustrate}} how goodwill impairment loss should be accounted for when measuring <b>non-controlling</b> interest in subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses two scenarios to illustrate how <b>non-controlling</b> interest in subsidiaries should be measured in the presence of goodwill impairment loss. Findings – The way the management of a reporting entity values the <b>non-controlling</b> interest in a subsidiary will result in different amounts being disclosed in financial statements for <b>non-controlling</b> interest in earnings, <b>non-controlling</b> interest, retained earnings and total equity. Research limitations/implications – The paper uses two scenarios to illustrate a simple consolidation with a parent entity, a subsidiary and a sub-subsidiary. Practical implications – Practical guidance on how goodwill impairment losses under International Accounting Standard 36 Impairment of Assets when measuring <b>non-controlling</b> interest under International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business Combination, is provided. Originality/value – The paper corrects any misunderstanding that may exist on the impact goodwill impairment losses have on closing equity when <b>non-controlling</b> interest is calculated under the different methods of valuing <b>non-controlling</b> interest.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the identity of}} <b>non-controlling</b> large shareholders and investigates their effects on firm value in the Chinese market. We find that when the <b>non-controlling</b> large shareholders have prior relationship with the controlling shareholders, firm values are lower. As well, higher ownership stakes and board representation by relational <b>non-controlling</b> large shareholders are associated with lower firm value. Such an effect is more pronounced when agency conflicts between majority shareholders and minority shareholders are greater. Our findings {{suggest that it is}} important to consider the identities of <b>non-controlling</b> shareholders when studying the effects of multiple large shareholders on corporate governance or firm value. Furthermore, we find that the <b>non-controlling</b> large shareholders play a detrimental role in an emerging market...|$|R

For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, International Financial Reporting Standards require <b>non-controlling</b> interest to be presented within consolidated equity to distinguish it from the amount of equity attributable to the shareholders of the parent.

40|$|The region around Taiwan {{is known}} for active seismicity, and {{a few studies have}} {{reported}} a high seismic hazard in this region, including a deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) study. Essentially, DSHA is to estimate earthquake ground motions considering the worst-case earthquake size and location, but without considering the seismic hazards from <b>non-controlling</b> sources. Understandably, when many <b>non-controlling</b> sources are present, the original DSHA framework could be insufficient. Therefore, using the extreme probability theory, this study introduces a new DSHA framework taking <b>non-controlling</b> seismic sources into account during DSHA calculations. The new method was applied to a seismic hazard assessment for Taiwan, showing that near the conjunctions of seismic source zones, the increase in seismic hazard could be substantial after considering a total of 19 <b>non-controlling</b> sources. More importantly, like other seismic hazard assessments for Taiwan, this study conveys the same alarming message that a high level of seismic hazard should be present around the region...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to (a) analyze IFRS {{requirements}} for the recognition and presentation of <b>non-controlling</b> (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements in relation to theoretical concepts of consolidation of financial statements, and (b) assess the share and importance of <b>non-controlling</b> inter-ests in financial performance and the equity of the groups of companies in practice. For the purpose of the article, selected scientific methods have been used, including: descriptive and analytical ones (for analyzing the theoretical concepts and IFRS requirements), critical analysis, especial-ly used for the literature review, and for the assessment of practice: primary empirical research methods, and quantitative methods, including descriptive statistics, nonparametric tests and correlation analysis. The empirical material collected was used to verify several hypotheses related to <b>non-controlling</b> interests of the groups whose parents are registered in Poland and whose securities are traded on a regulated, Polish capital market (Warsaw Stock Exchange). The empirical evidence is that <b>non-controlling</b> interests represent a very small part of group’s equity (taking the mean of about 3. 5 %, but the median below 1 %) and obviously, they are significantly lower than the share of majority interests. Their deviation among the different classes of companies (big, small and banks) is negligible. Slightly higher is the share of minority interests in the group’s net profit and total comprehensive income. However, no significant difference is to be found between the shares of <b>non-controlling</b> interests in the group’s equity, net profit and total comprehensive income. Overall, shares of majority (minority) interests in a group’s income are in line with their shares in the group’s equity. The hypothesis on comparable returns on <b>non-controlling</b> and majority interests (in terms of ROE) cannot be rejected if both net profit and losses are considered. How-ever, if losses are skipped then there is evidence that <b>non-controlling</b> interests are more profitable than majority interests. Analysis of the impact of the number of subsidiaries in groups on <b>non-controlling</b> interests indicates the existence of such an effect only in relation to the equity (rather obvious but weak). No effect is observed for the impact on net profit for the entire sample...|$|R
