5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only <b>now</b> <b>are</b> scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiders {{are also}} found in small colonies in areas of New Zealand. They are {{frequently}} intercepted by quarantine authorities, often among steel or car shipments. They were introduced into New Zealand in the early 1980s and <b>now</b> <b>are</b> found around Central Otago (including Alexandra, Bannockburn and near Wanaka) in the South Island and New Plymouth in the North Island. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates warn residents and visitors of redback spiders, which have been present since 1990. Colonies have also been established in greenhouses in Belgium, and isolated observations indicate possible presence in New Guinea, the Philippines, and India. Some redbacks were found in Preston, Lancashire, England, after a container of parts arrived from Australia; some may have escaped into the countryside before pest controllers could destroy them. One redback {{was found in a}} back garden in Dartford in Kent. Two females were discovered in the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas in 2010.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{speculation}} that the Romans settled in the area before establishing Londinium, following analysis of the alignment of Roman roads. Whitaker's Almanack has suggested that Aulus Plautius set up a fort near the junction of Park Street and Oxford Street during the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 while waiting for Claudius; the theory was more fully developed in 1993, with a proposal that around the fort a Roman town formed, which was later abandoned as being {{too far from the}} Thames. The proposal has been disputed owing to lack of archaeological evidence. If there was a fort, it is believed the perimeter would have been where the modern Green Street, North Audley Street, Upper Grosvenor Street and Park Lane <b>now</b> <b>are,</b> and that Park Street would have been the main road through the centre. This area was known as the manor of Eia in the Domesday Book, and owned by Geoffrey de Mandeville following the Norman Conquest. It was subsequently given to the Abbey of Westminster, who owned it until 1536 when it was taken over by Henry VIII.|$|E
