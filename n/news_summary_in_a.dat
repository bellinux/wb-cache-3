40|$|Research has {{established}} that pre-trial publicity increases potential jurors’ awareness to {{factors that may}} or may not become evidence at trial. The purpose of the present study was to examine how variations in prior notification of a civil settlement would influence juror decision-making.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{generating}} <b>a</b> queryspecific extractive <b>summary</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> an efficient manner for a given set of documents. In many of the current solutions, the entire collection of documents is modeled as a single graph which is used for summary generation. Unlike these approaches, in this paper, we model each individual document as a graph and generate a query-specific summary for it. These individual summaries are then intelligently combined to produce the final summary. This approach greatly reduces the computational complexity.

Experimental results show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art extractive systems while maintaining similar grammatical quality. ...|$|R
