5|$|Skipsea Castle was a Norman motte and bailey castle {{near the}} village of Skipsea, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Built around 1086 by Drogo de la Beuvrière, {{apparently}} on the remains of an Iron Age mound, it was designed to secure the newly conquered region, defend against any potential Danish invasion and control the trade route across the region leading to the North Sea. The motte and the bailey were separated by Skipsea Mere, an artificial lake that was linked to the sea during the medieval period via a <b>navigable</b> <b>channel.</b> The village of Skipsea grew up beside the castle church, and the fortified town of Skipsea Brough was built alongside the castle around 1160 to capitalise on the potential trade.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the <b>navigable</b> <b>channel</b> between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E

5|$|Coalhouse Fort was manned {{during the}} First World War by No. 2 Company, Royal Garrison Artillery, which manned the guns, while the 2nd Company London Electrical Engineers {{operated}} the electric searchlights. A minefield {{was installed in}} the river between Shornemead and Coalhouse forts, with mechanically operated mines in the shallower parts {{of the river and}} remotely detonated mines in the <b>navigable</b> <b>channel.</b> Friendly ships could thus pass freely but the mines could be detonated by a shore-based observer if an enemy ship tried to use the main channel. Coalhouse Fort took on the role of an Examination Battery controlling the river traffic in conjunction with the River Examination Service. Incoming vessels were checked by tugs based alongside the old HMS Champion, moored in midriver, and if any vessel was deemed suspect or refused to stop, the fort was authorised to fire across its bows.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of canals and locks {{that would make the}} St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water {{in order to create a}} <b>navigable</b> <b>channel</b> through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a small island, after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a little further downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a little further up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the <b>navigable</b> <b>channel,</b> and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{infiltration}} of sediment through {{and along the}} peripheral breakwalls, the harbor requires regular dredging to maintain <b>navigable</b> <b>channels.</b> The dredging occurs approximately every 3 to 5 years, with excavated sediment deposited onto the beaches surrounding the breakwalls.|$|R

5|$|Downriver of the Hells Canyon is the Lower Snake River Project, {{authorized}} by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945, which {{was created by the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a <b>navigable</b> <b>channel</b> on the Snake River from its mouth to the beginning of Hells Canyon. These dams are, in downstream order: Lower Granite Lock and Dam, Little Goose Lock and Dam, Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Ice Harbor Lock and Dam. Dredging work was also done throughout the length of the navigation channel to facilitate ship passage. These dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free-flowing river in between. Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula, formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River. (McNary Dam {{is not part of the}} Lower Snake River Project.) Above Lower Granite Dam, the river channel from Lewiston to Johnson Bar, just below Hells Canyon, is also maintained for jet-boats as this section is too rugged for ships. These dams have been proposed for removal, and if they were to be removed, it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States. The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries. Idaho's Snake river once teemed with sockeye salmon. However, there are almost no wild sockeye salmon left in the river due to a number of factors.|$|E
25|$|At Upper Parting above Gloucester, {{the river}} divides into two, and flows {{either side of}} Alney Island to Lower Parting. The West Channel is no longer navigable. The East Channel is navigable as far as Gloucester Docks, from where the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal {{provides}} a <b>navigable</b> <b>channel</b> south. Between the docks and Lower Parting Llanthony Weir marks the Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the East Channel of the river.|$|E
25|$|Send is {{a lightly}} {{dispersed}} village centred 23 miles (37km) south-west from Charing Cross and 6 miles (10km) south-west of junction 10 of the M25 {{and has a}} developed clustered centre which was until the mid-20th century on the old course of the old Portsmouth Road which bisects the highest settled part of the village, Burntcommon {{which is on the}} start of rise of the London Clay, in turn, reaching almost as far as the North Downs through Clandon. Relieved by the construction of a six-lane bypass (which forms the very long south-east border), the A3 trunk road, this makes the parish approximately triangular. The parish is bounded to the west and part of its northern side by the River Wey, which is controlled by sluices and has been expanded in capacity by a <b>navigable</b> <b>channel</b> running alongside, the Wey Navigation.|$|E

40|$|When the {{maritime}} cultural heritage is being protected, little {{emphasis is placed}} on problems concerning erosion and destruction of remains at landing places and <b>navigable</b> <b>channels</b> on the Norwegian coast. In recent years, an extensive survey has been carried out along the coast of the county of Rogaland and many new cultural monuments and sites related to landing places and <b>navigable</b> <b>channels</b> have been found, many of them dating from the Iron Age and the Middle Ages. A new method has been developed to evaluate the quality of different landing places and <b>navigable</b> <b>channels</b> in combination with climate variables such as wind, topography and fetch - the fetch method. This method has been tested at several places in northern Rogaland, in the outer part of Boknafjord and in Karmsund (a strait), and the results are promising. In a convincing way, the method explains why cultural monuments and sites along the coast are rare in some areas, but numerous in others. The method {{can also be used to}} predict where new finds of maritime cultural monuments and sites can be expected. This is especially important because such features are difficult to recognise and can be mistaken for natural formations. The results indicate that there is cause for anxiety about the protection of landing places and <b>navigable</b> <b>channels</b> because they are vulnerable to destruction by anthropogenic climate changes. The sea is rising due to increased temperature on a global scale. The choice of protection strategies for maritime cultural monuments and sites and associated sediments on land and in the sea depends upon how much the sea will rise in the future, which will vary from area to area, least in southwest Norway and most further north and south. The choice of protection strategies will also vary depending on whether the cultural monuments and sites and the associated sediments are on land or in the sea. Notwithstanding, the coming years will see a change in the coastal environment. The rising sea level will inundate many sites and expose them to erosion and destruction, especially in the period when they are in the beach zone. Some will be in deeper water, which in some cases will give better protection, whereas others will suffer erosion and destruction, partly due to changing currents. If the predicted rise in sea level in the coming 50 years is realised, the problems concerning the protection of cultural monuments and sites along the coast, both on land and in the sea, will be critical and the Directorate for Cultural Heritage (RA) ought to base their protection on prognoses with a longer time perspective than today...|$|R
