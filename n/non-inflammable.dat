I buried him in the spring; and then I came down to a little place called Lumberville, and picked up what jobs I could get. I worked round at the saw-mills, and I was ostler a while at the hotel--I always DID like a good horse. Well, I WA'N'T exactly a college graduate, and I went to school odd times. I got to driving the stage after while, and by and by I BOUGHT the stage and run the {{business}} myself. Then I hired the tavern-stand, and--well {{to make a long}} story short, then I got married. Yes," [...] said Lapham, with pride, [...] "I married the school-teacher. We did pretty well with the hotel, and my wife she was always at me to paint up. Well, I put it off, and PUT it off, as a man will, till one day I give in, and says I, 'Well, let's paint up. Why, Pert,'--m'wife's name's Persis,--'I've got a whole paint-mine out on the farm. Let's go out and look at it.' So we drove out. I'd let the place for seventy-five dollars a year to a shif'less kind of a Kanuck that had come down that way; and I'd hated to see the house with him in it; but we drove out one Saturday afternoon, and we brought back about a bushel of the stuff in the buggy-seat, and I tried it crude, and I tried it burnt; and I liked it. M'wife she liked it too. There wa'n't any painter by trade in the village, and I mixed it myself. Well, sir, that tavern's got that coat of paint on it yet, and it hain't ever had any other, and I don't know's it ever will. Well, you know, I felt as if it was a kind of harumscarum experiment, all the while; and I presume I shouldn't have tried it but I kind of liked to do it because father'd always set so much store by his paint-mine. And when I'd got the first coat on,"--Lapham called it CUT,--"I presume I must have set as much as half an hour; looking at it and thinking how he would have enjoyed it. I've had my share of luck in this world, and I ain't a-going to complain on my OWN account, but I've noticed that most things get along too late for most people. It made me feel bad, and it took all the pride out my success with the paint, thinking of father. Seemed to me I might 'a taken more interest in it when he was by to see; but we've got to live and learn. Well, I called my wife out,--I'd tried it on the back of the house, you know,--and she left her dishes,--I can remember she came out with her sleeves rolled up and set down alongside of me on the trestle,--and says I, 'What do you think, Persis?' And says she, 'Well, you hain't got a paint-mine, Silas Lapham; you've got a GOLD-mine.' She always was just so enthusiastic about things. Well, it was just after two or three boats had burnt up out West, and a lot of lives lost, and there was a great cry about <b>non-inflammable</b> paint, and I guess that was what was in her mind. 'Well, I guess it ain't any gold-mine, Persis,' says I; 'but I guess it IS a paint-mine. I'm going to have it analysed, and if it turns out what I think it is, I'm going to work it. And if father hadn't had such a long name, I should call it the Nehemiah Lapham Mineral Paint. But, any rate, every barrel of it, and every keg, and every bottle, and every package, big or little, has got to have the initials and figures N.L.f. 1835, S.L.t. 1855, on it. Father found it in 1835, and I tried it in 1855.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Arthur Eichengrün (13 August 1867 - 23 December 1949) was a German Jewish chemist, {{materials}} scientist, and inventor. He {{is known}} for developing the highly successful anti-gonorrhea drug Protargol, the standard treatment for 50 years until the adoption of antibiotics, and for his pioneering contributions in plastics: co-developing (with Theodore Becker) the first soluble cellulose acetate materials in 1903, called [...] "Cellit", and creating processes for the manufacture of these materials which were influential {{in the development of}} injection moulding. During World War I his relatively <b>non-inflammable</b> synthetic cellulose acetate lacquers, marketed under the name [...] "Cellon", were important in the aircraft industry.

He went on to develop processes for the manufacture {{of cellulose acetate}} materials and devoted {{the rest of his}} life to the technical and economic development of plastics, lacquers, enamels, and artificial fibers based on cellulose acetate. During World War I his relatively <b>non-inflammable</b> synthetic cellulose acetate lacquers were important in the aircraft industry. He also pioneered the influential technique of injection moulding. In 1904, He created and patented the first safety film with Becker, (cellulose diacetate) from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. It was used to manufacture cellulose diacetate cinematographic film, which Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres began to use in 1909. Cellulose acetate film became the standard in the 1950s, preferred over the highly flammable and unstable nitrate film (better known as celluloid).|$|E

5000|$|When Curtiss-Wright {{offered an}} {{improved}} {{version of the}} Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone, Lockheed began developing an improved version of the L-049 Constellation airliner to be powered by this engine. The new project was designated L-049-84. In addition to the engine change, the wing and fuselage structure were strengthened to allow an increased gross weight. The cabin was redesigned and made more luxurious, incorporating changes such as retractable overhead sleeping berths, modernised air conditioning and retractable seats. Ten different cabin layouts were offered. Due to the loudness of the R-3350 engines, the insulation had been augmented {{through the use of}} multiple materials including <b>non-inflammable</b> cloth and fiberglass. The problem of overheating that plagued the original engines had been eliminated through the newer design of the R-3350 and the oil tanks being moved away from the engine nacelles. The oil tank capacity was also increased by 9 gallons. The payload was increased by 1,846 pounds. An extra removable cargo hold was designed to increase the payload of the aircraft. This was called a [...] "Speedpak", and was to be used for shorter flights. The result was a completely new design, causing Lockheed to redesignate the aircraft L-649 due to the significant changes.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the act of}} 1887, {{there have}} {{followed}} five minor acts, based {{on the recommendation of}} the officials acting under the acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus the Coal Mines (Checkweigher) Act 1894 rendered it illegal for an employer (" [...] owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent, or manager [...] ") to make the removal of a particular checkweigher a condition of employment, or to exercise improper influence in the appointment of a checkweigher. The need for this provision was demonstrated by a decision of the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which upheld an employer in his claim to the right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on condition that they would dismiss a particular checkweigher. In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference, modified the provision for plans of mines in working and abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection before commencing work, use of safety lamps and <b>non-inflammable</b> substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive likely to become dangerous. In 1900, another brief act raised the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to thirteen. In 1903, another amending act allowed as an alternative qualification for a manager's certificate a diploma in scientific and mining training after at least two years' study at a university mining school or other educational institution approved by the secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least three years in a mine. In the same year, the Employment of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905, a Coal Mines (Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties. In 1906, the Notice of Accidents Act provided for improved annual returns of accidents and for immediate reporting to the district inspector of accidents under newly defined conditions as they arise in coal and metalliferous mines.|$|E
50|$|As the {{quantity}} of film and filmmakers grew, the demand for standardization increased. Between 1900 and 1910, film formats gradually became standardized and film stocks improved. A number of film gauges were made. Eastman increased the length of rolls to 200 feet without major adjustments to the emulsion, retaining a large market share. Lumiere reformulated its stock to match the speed of Eastman film, naming it 'Etiquette Violette' (Violet Label). Blair sold his English company to Pathé in 1907 and retired to the US. Pathe began to supplement its operation in 1910 by purchasing film prints, stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it. 35mm film began to become the dominant gauge because of the popularity of Edison's and Lumière's cameras. Consumers usually purchased unperforated film and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise, causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format. In 1908, the perforators began {{to be made by}} Bell and Howell. Eastman Kodak used the Bell and Howell's machine to perforate its films. In 1909, Edison's organization of the Motion Picture Patents Trust agreed to what would become the standard: 35 mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.33 aspect ratio.Agfa began to produce motion picture film in 1913, but remained a largely local supplier until World War I boycotts of popular French, American and Italian film stocks allowed the UFA film studio to flourish, boosting Agfa's orders. All film stocks were manufactured on a nitrate film base, which is highly flammable. Nitrate film fires were difficult to extinguish. A significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths, where the heat of the projector lamp made ignition most likely. Amateur filmmaking (home movies) slowly developed during this period. Kodak developed a heat-resistant 'safety base' for home projection. In 1909, tests showed cellulose diacetate to be a viable replacement base, and Kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in 22 mm widths for Edison's work on the Home Kinetoscope, which was commercially released in 1912. Eastman Kodak introduced a <b>non-inflammable</b> 35 mm film stock in 1909. The plasticizers used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. In 1911 the major American film studios returned to using nitrate stock. More amateur formats began to use acetate based film, and several, including Kodak's own 16 mm format, were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base. Kodak released Cine Negative Film Type E in 1916 and Type F (later known as Negative Film Par Speed Type 1201) in 1917. As both of these orthochromatic films were no faster than previous offerings; the improvements were in granularity and sharpness.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: One of {{the methods}} of {{fighting}} the risk of coal dust's explosion is its neutralization through washing and misting of mining sediment which lays on the mining excavation and through misting on the organs of hewer machines or on the dumpings and inundations of mining product's output. Coal dust, especially its smallest fractions which create the biggest risk of explosion, is generally the substance which cannot be easily moistened by water. Water solutions of different wetting agents are applied in hard bituminous coal mines {{in order to enhance}} the effectiveness of coal dust's moistening during the washing and misting.

30|$|ORC generates {{power from}} low-grade heat sources by {{replacing}} water with organic working fluids such as refrigerants or hydrocarbons[11]. To investigate any improvement when using these fluids, {{the effects of}} the properties of nine different working fluids on the overall combined cycle efficiency have been considered. In this respect, the economic, environmental, and operating performances of an ORC depend on the properties of the working fluids as well as the design and operating characteristics of the cycle. A suitable fluid for an ORC must exhibit favorable physical, chemical, environmental, safety, and economic properties such as low specific volume, liquid specific heat, viscosity, toxicity, flammability, ozone depletion potential (ODP), global warming potential (GWP), and cost, as well as favorable process characteristics such as high efficiency, latent heat, density, molecular weight, Mollier diagram close to isentropic, suitable thermal stability limits, compatible with turbine materials and lubricating oil, non-corrosive, <b>non-inflammable,</b> and moderate pressure in the heat exchangers[11, 12, 13]. The saturated vapor specific volume gives an indication of condenser size, which is related to the system's initial cost. A super-atmospheric (> 100 kPa) saturation pressure eliminates infiltration of gases, which is important for operational reasons, since gas infiltration reduces system efficiency. The working fluid having high latent heat and high density is preferred. To achieve the maximum output power of the combined cycle, Rankine cycle efficiency must be increased. For this reason, {{the effects of the}} properties of several working fluids on the Rankine cycle efficiency have been studied.|$|E
40|$|Today three {{series of}} {{regulations}} {{have a direct}} impact on reducing the consumption of petrochemical solvents: these are directive 1999 / 13 /EC aimed at reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to industrial uses of solvents, and the directives on dangerous substances (67 / 548 /EEC) and on dangerous goods (1999 / 48 /EC) amended in 2002 that pertain mainly to chlorinated solvents (for example, trichloroethylene) and aromatics. The use of molecules derived from agriculture is an attractive alternative, both for agricultural production and in terms of environmental constraints. Companies in France are increasingly interested in biosolvents, with research programmes that receive funding from ADEME (via AGRICE) and are supported by several research laboratories and technical institutes. Three classes of biosolvents possess the technical characteristics that enable them to replace petrochemical solvents: vegetable oil esters (oilseed rape, sunflower, soy); esters of organic acids obtained by fermentation (acetic, citric, gluconic, lactic and succinic acid); ethanol and terpenes, in particular terpene alcohols that are not considered to be VOCs (steam pressure < 10 Pa at 293. 15 K). Overall, biosolvents have indubitable advantages. They possess high solvent capacity and low volatility, and are <b>non-inflammable,</b> biodegradable and non-toxic for the environment.

40|$|The use of aqueous {{dispersed}} media, such as emulsions, {{has many}} advantages over solution processes for chemical transformations and polymerization reactions, i. e. limited environmental impact, ease of products recovery and increased reaction rate. Emulsions are usually implemented from a water/organic solvent mixture {{in the presence}} of a surfactant. However, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) (Pc = 74 bars; Tc = 31 °C) constitutes an interesting alternative to the traditional organic solvents in these heterogeneous systems because it is inexpensive, non-toxic, <b>non-inflammable</b> and environmentally friendlier. In this context, we developed a novel class of surfactants for the stabilization of H 2 O/scCO 2 emulsions, i. e. fluorinated modified carbohydrates. The hydrophilic head of the surfactant consists in a sugar moiety whereas a fluorinated tail is specifically located in the scCO 2 phase. The strategies for the synthesis of these carbohydrates esters rely on selective lipase-catalyzed modifications of sugars and on the versatile thiol-Michael addition reaction. The ability of these molecules to decrease the H 2 O/scCO 2 interfacial tension and to stabilize such emulsions will be presented. Finally, high internal phase scCO 2 -in-water emulsion (HIPE) were prepared with these new surfactants and used as template for the acrylamide polymerization. The monomer is polymerized in the continuous aqueous phase before removing the CO 2 droplets (at least 70 % of the total volume).

40|$|Teflurane, a {{halogenated}} hydrocarbon anaesthetic, was compared with approximately equipotent concentrations of cyclopropane and halothane in studies made in cats. It induced spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias {{in a higher}} proportion of animals than halothane, these irregularities being abolished by the intravenous injection of pro-pranolol. Teflurane caused a profound lowering of arterial blood pressure in all the animals studied. As with halothane there was no significant increase in plasma cate-cholamine level when teflurane was inhaled. Respiratory and metabolic acidosis contributed to a lowering of plasma pH during teflurane anaesthesia. The inhalation of cyclopropane was accompanied by similar changes, whereas halothane caused some respiratory but only slight metabolic acidosis when high concentrations were given to the spontaneously breathing cat. Teflurane, 1, 1, 1, 2, tetrafluoro- 2 -bromethane, is a <b>non-inflammable</b> and non-explosive inhalational anaesthetic, the chemical structure of which bears a close resemblance to halothane (fig. 1). The compound has a low boiling point (8 °C) and since it is stored under pressure in liquefied form in metal cylinders, a vaporizer is not re-quired for its use. On this account and because the inhaled anaesthetic concentrations of the two agents are roughly comparable, teflurane has been referred to as "non-explosive cyclopropane". The new agent has a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0. 6 and produces rapid induction and allows rapid recovery from anaesthesia. In an early clinical study Artusio and Van Poznak (1961) found that a 50 per cent mixture of teflurane with oxygen was suitable for in-duction of anaesthesia, and a 25 per cent mixtur...|$|E

Dissections in fetlock joints were found at trotters, warm-blooded horses, thoroughbred horses and other races whereas in tarsocural joints they are found only in totters and warmblooded horses. 14 % of the fetlock dissections and 25 % of the tarsocrural joint dissections show sklerotic areas in the Fein-Fokus-Radiograph examination. There is a tendency, that sklerotic dissections of older horses have a higher grade of sklerotic but there is no connection with race and sex of horses with either joint and localisation in the joint. The trend of a higher sklerotic grade in older horses is described with exceptions for fetlockjoint as well as for tarsocrural joints, but there are not enough sklerotic dissec-tions (only 20) to do a statistical analysis. So only a trend is shown. The sklerotic dis-sections are bigger in size than the dissections with spongios character. There was no relation to race, sex, joint or localisation in the joint. The dissections with spongious character don´t show connections in all above given parameters. Neither in size nor in composition of the dissections there was a trend for references. Dissections that were free in the joint, ýFree bodysý, only were found in 6 of 95 joints, all 6 dissections are from fetlock joints. Even here there were nor references to above mentioned parameters. Refeing to the total size it is remarkable that these ýfree bodysý are smaler than the total size of all dissections from fetlock joints. The snovial samples showed, in the number of cells (white blood cells) as in totalpro-tein a <b>non-inflammable</b> character. <br...|$|E
