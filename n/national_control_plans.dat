40|$|The {{burden of}} Salmonella {{entering}} pig slaughterhouses across the European Union (EU) {{is considered a}} primary food safety concern. In order to assist EU Member States {{with the development of}} <b>National</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Plans,</b> we have developed a farm transmission model applicable to all Member States. It is an individual-based stochastic Susceptible-Infected model, that takes into account four different sources of infection of pigs (sows, feed, external contaminants such as rodents and new stock) and various management practices linked to Salmonella transmission/protection (housing, flooring, feed, All-In-All-Out production). A novel development within the model is the assessment of dynamic shedding rates. The results of the model, parameterized for two case study Member States (one high and one low prevalence) suggest that breeding herd prevalence is a strong indicator of slaughter pig prevalence. Until a Member States’ breeding herd prevalence is brought below 10 % then the sow will be the dominant source of infection to pigs raised for meat production; below this level of breeding herd prevalence, feed becomes the dominant force of infection...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{evidence}} base {{for the development of}} <b>National</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Plans</b> for Salmonella spp. in pigs for EU Member States, a Quantitative Microbiological Risk Assessment was funded to support the scientific opinion required by the EC from the European Food Safety Authority. The main aim of the risk assessment was to assess the effectiveness of interventions implemented on-farm and at the abattoir in reducing human cases of pig meat borne salmonellosis, and how the effects of these interventions may vary across EU Member States. Two case study Member States have been chosen to assess the effect of the interventions investigated. Reducing both breeding herd and slaughter pig prevalence were effective in achieving reductions in the number of expected human illnesses in both case study Member States. However, there is scarce evidence to suggest which specific on-farm interventions could achieve consistent reductions in either breeding herd or slaughter pig prevalence. Hypothetical reductions in feed contamination rates were important in reducing slaughter pig prevalence for the case study Member State where prevalence of infection was already low, but not for the high-prevalence case study. The most significant reductions were achieved by a 1 - or 2 -log decrease of Salmonella contamination of the carcass post- evisceration; a 1 -log decrease in average contamination produced a 90 % reduction in human illness. The intervention analyses suggest that abattoir intervention may be {{the most effective way to}} reduce human exposure to Salmonella spp. However, a combined farm/abattoir approach would likely have cumulative benefits. On-farm intervention is probably most effective at the breeding herd level for high-prevalence Member States; once infection in the breeding herd has been reduced to a low enough level, then feed and biosecurity measures would become increasingly more effective...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of hybrid}} mass spectrometric {{instruments}} {{is becoming a}} more widespread phenomenon {{in the world of}} veterinary drug residue analysis, even for targeted approaches. There, the noticeable shift towards high resolution accurate mass mass spectrometric instruments (HRMS) enables to retrospectively mine the data for allowing the identification of new unidentified designer drugs. For the detection of anabolic steroids (gestagens, androgens and estrognes) in meat, our goal was to evaluate the sensitivity of a TripleToF™ instrument, using the fast Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA), which combines a TOF-MS survey and MRM-like acquisitions at high acquisition speeds. In order to increase sensitivity of the analysis, different MRM-like experiments were compared, as well as the use of a state-of-the-art microLC system (Eskigent MicroLC 200). Afterwards, the analytical method was validated according to the performance criteria as set out in the 2002 / 657 /EC Commission Decision and acknowledged the confirmatory and quantitative strength of this newly developed method. On the other side, HRMS hybrid instruments are being more and more implemented in the field of metabolomics, where the MRM-like experiments aid in the structure elucidation of the discovered unknown metabolites. Our second goal was to use the TripleToF™ instrument for unravelling the prednisolone origin in the high frequency positive bovine urines samples gathered in light of the <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>plans.</b> Bovine urine samples collected from an in vivo study were used to characterize the metabolites that originated from exogenous prednisolone administration. By means of different software packages (i. e. MasterViewTM, MetabolitePiloteTM), several interesting potential biomarkers were detected, and tentative identification was performed. Basically, this presentation will cover the workflow and pitfalls encountered with the analysis of steroids in a targeted but also untargeted procedure on a TripleToF™ 4600...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the {{analysis}} of veterinary drugs and growth-promoting agents has shifted from target-oriented procedures, mainly based on liquid chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-QqQ-MS), towards an accurate mass full scan MS type of approach (such as time of flight (ToF) or Fourier Transform (FT) MS). The applicability of an HR-Orbitrap-MS for confirmatory analysis for growth-promoting agents in meat was compared, in a previous study, {{to that of a}} QqQ-MS but proved somewhat inferior with respect to the sensitivity. Therefore our goal was to evaluate the sensitivity of a TripleTOF™ (QqTOF) instrument for anabolic steroids in meat, using accurate mass MS data (> 25, 000 FWHM) in combination with MS/MS acquisition at high acquisition speeds. For the development of a sensitive detection method, the fast Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) combining a TOF-MS survey scan and dependent TOF-MS/MS scans was compared to a scheduled and a more time consuming dedicated MRM algorithm. As a final attempt to increase the sensitivity, the analytical flow UHPLC was switched to a state-of-the-art microflow UHPLC, operating at a flow rate of 25 μL/min. Additionally, a full fractional statistical design was performed to simplify as well as optimize the current extraction procedure for anabolic steroids in meat. A review of the literature resulted in a selection of a subset of relevant parameters including e. g. variables related to the homogenisation of the meat (e. g. ultraturrax), solvents (e. g. solvent type and volume), sample clean-up (e. g. solid phase extraction) for optimisation. Afterwards the optimised method was validated according to CD 2002 / 657 /EC. In this study the benefits of the TripleTOF™ instrument are compared to a QqQ-MS system including it’s ability to mine the data retrospectively for identifying non-targeted and emerging designer hormones, which serves as an additional advantage {{in the light of the}} <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>plans.</b> Compared to the single stage Orbitrap the TripleTOF™, operates at a lower resolution, however due to the acquired MS/MS data it is expected to provide an advantage especially for those compounds (i. e. some estrogens) for which the threshold of 20 % intra-laboratory reproducibility, correlated to an inferior precision, was exceeded with the single stage Orbitrap. The microLC might also provide an additional sensitivity increase...|$|E

40|$|A {{ranking system}} for {{veterinary}} medicinal products and medicated feed additives has been developed {{as a tool to}} be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the <b>National</b> Residue <b>Control</b> <b>Plan.</b> In the context of food sampling and residue testing for the <b>National</b> Residue <b>Control</b> <b>Plan,</b> there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the <b>National</b> Residue <b>Control</b> <b>Plan.</b> The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the {{veterinary medicinal products}} and medicated feed additives that might be prioritised for residue testing. However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the residue testing programme. Other factors which should be taken into account include issues such as evidence of misuse of veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed additives and changes to maximum residue limits in the specifications for particular veterinary medicinal products and medicated feed additives.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 2 years {{low levels of}} {{prednisolone}} {{have been reported in}} bovine urine by a number of laboratories in EU member states. Concentrations vary, but are reported to be below approximately 3 g/l. In 40 % of bovine urine samples from the Dutch <b>national</b> <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> had concentrations of prednisolone between 0. 112. 04 g/l. In this study the mechanism of formation of prednisolone was investigated. In-vitro conversion of cortisol by bacteria from faeces and soil, bovine liver enzymes and stability at elevated temperatures were studied. In-vitro bovine liver S 9 incubation experiments showed a significant 20 % decrease of cortisol within 6 hours, and formation of prednisolone was observed from 0. 2 g/l at t = 0 to 0. 5 g/l at t = 6. Under the influence of faeces, the stability of cortisol in urine is reduced and cortisol breaks down within 50 h. Prednisolone is formed up to 4 g/l at 70 C after 15 h. However, this decreases again to 0 after 50 h. With soil bacteria, a slower decrease of cortisol was observed, but slightly higher overall formation of prednisolone, up to 7 g/l at 20 C. As opposed to incurred urine, in fortified urine incubated with faeces or soil bacteria no prednisolone was detected. This difference may be explained by the presence of natural corticosteroids in the incurred sample. With UPLC-QToF-MS experiments, in urine and water samples incubated with faeces, metabolites known from the literature could be (tentatively) identified as 20 ß-hydroxy-prednisolone, cortisol- 21 -sulfate, oxydianiline, tetrahydrocortisone- 3 -glucuronide and cortexolone, but for all compounds except 20 ß-hydroxy-prednisolone no standards were available for confirmation. Based on {{the results of this study}} and literature data, for regulatory purposes a threshold of 5 g/l for prednisolone in bovine urine is proposed. Findings of prednisolone in concentrations up to 5 g/l in bovine urine can, most likely, originate from other sources than illegal treatment with growth promoters...|$|R

The method was used for preparing a proficiency test in order to get information on the quality of residue control in Germany. The proficiency test included five samples and the results were very satisfying. The reproducibility standard deviation of these five samples ranged from 17 to 24 %, the median concentrations lay between 0. 43 and 0. 51 µg/kg CAP. These values are clearly below the corresponding Horwitz standard deviation of about 50 %. From the study it can be concluded that there are – irrespective of the method applied - well established and properly working analytical procedures for the control of CAP around the MRPL of 0. 3 µg/kg...|$|R
40|$|Background: Syphilis is a {{major public}} health problem in many regions of China, with {{increases}} in congenital syphilis (CS) cases causing concern. The Chinese Ministry of Health recently announced a comprehensive 10 -y <b>national</b> syphilis <b>control</b> <b>plan</b> focusing on averting CS. The decision analytic model presented here quantifies {{the impact of the}} planned strategies to determine whether they are likely to meet the goals laid out in the <b>control</b> <b>plan.</b> Methods and Findings: Our model incorporated data on age-stratified fertility, female adult syphilis cases, and empirical syphilis transmission rates to estimate the number of CS cases associated with prenatal syphilis infection on a yearly basis. Guangdong Province was the focus of this analysis because of the availability of high-quality demographic and public health data. Each model outcome was simulated 1, 000 times to incorporate uncertainty in model inputs. The model was validated using data from a CS intervention program among 477, 656 women in China. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify which variables are likely to be most influential in achieving Chinese and international policy goals. Increasing prenatal screening coverage was the single most effective strategy for reducing CS cases. An incremental increase in prenatal screening from the base case of 57 % coverage to 95 % coverage was associated with 106 (95 % CI: 101, 111) CS cases averted per 100, 000 live births (58 % decrease). The policy strategies laid out in the national plan led to an outcome that fell short of the target, while a four-pronged comprehensive syphilis control strategy consisting of increased prenata...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of a rapid LC-HRMS method was studied {{in order to}} find a sensitive and accurate, simple, cheap, and rapid method for screening and quantitative determination of malachite green (MG), leucomalachite green (LMG), brilliant green (BG), crystal violet (CV), and leucocrystal violet (LCV) in fish muscle. All the analytes were extracted using a mixture of acetonitrile and citrate buffer, while the cleanup phase was carried out by Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) method. All the data analyzed were acquired using both full MS and dd-MS 2 modes. Good specificity, precision (relative standard deviation 0. 999). Best recoveries were obtained by the QuEChERS cleanup method for all the analytes examined, presenting values between 70 and 104 %. The application of 70, 000 FWHM mass resolution and narrow mass windows significantly improved the selectivity of the method, leading to simultaneous screening and quantification of dye residues in comparison to other methods proposed in literature. The optimized method proposed in this work enables a simple and fast preparation; it offers exceptional sensitivity and selectivity and maximizes efficiency and reproducibility with a low consumption of reagents. Finally, the present method was successfully employed to detect dye residues in 73 fish samples, as provided for the <b>national</b> residue <b>control</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R
