Equations for the calculation of wave reflection and transmission are derived as related to the interpretation of test results. An idealized pile with a <b>necking</b> <b>section</b> is analyzed using the theoretical equations to show typical wave reflections from the <b>necking</b> <b>section</b> and from the pile toe. The instrument used for pile integrity testing is briefly described. Original data from a field verification exercise of pile integrity testing in Beijing, China are presented and interpreted. Original data from a test performed on a precast prestressed concrete pile connected in four segments in Hong Kong are also presented and interpreted. The data measured from the field show that the measured velocity wave is, in general, more complicated than that described by the idealized stress wave equation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{uniaxial}} tension {{tests of}} 1500 MPa boron steel at strain rates of 0. 01 - 5. 0 s- 1 and temperatures of 550 - 850 °C were performed. Considering {{the difference between}} the deformation <b>necking</b> cross <b>section</b> and the centre measuring section of specimen, a correction method of measuring strain and temperature at <b>necking</b> cross <b>section</b> are developed. For the method, the deformation of <b>necking</b> cross <b>section</b> was obtained which approximate for the trapezoidal change law near the necking zone. The stress strain curves are corrected based on the correction method of the strain and by considering temperature correction. A set of unified constitutive equations has been developed and calibrated. Correlation between the corrected and predicted true stress data from the constitutive equation is presented. The correlation coefficient is 0. 969, and the absolute average relative error is 3. 73 % in the range of allowable experimental conditions...|$|R

Stress distribution at <b>necking</b> <b>section,</b> as well as load histories are analyzed for all three formulations. Two other test cases consider bending of the so-called ”Greco” beam and upsetting of a cylinder. Numerical results show that all approaches yield very similar results and thus are equally valid.

25|$|After {{crossing}} into New Jersey in Mercer County, US1 {{continues on}} the Trenton Freeway {{through the state}} capital city of Trenton and Lawrence as a four lane freeway. As the freeway ends, the four lane divided highway upgrades to six lanes after I-95/I-295 passing through the Penns <b>Neck</b> <b>section</b> of West Windsor Township. Through Penns Neck {{is a series of}} traffic signals. NJDOT is looking to revamp the highway through this area by replacing traffic signals with grade separations. The highway enters Middlesex County through Plainsboro and South Brunswick, where the highest point resides. By Forrestal Village, the highway downgrades from 6 to 4 lanes until after Finnegans Lane in North Brunswick. Northward, it continues through New Brunswick as a short jersey-freeway until the CR 529/Plainfield Avenue traffic signal in Edison. Through Edison and Woodbridge has a mix of boulevard and jersey freeway segments and continues to do so after the US9 juncture in the Avenel section of Woodbridge. The US1/9 concurrency continues {{through the rest of the}} state. The six lane divided highway remains through Rahway in Union County and Elizabeth, until it reaches the Newark Airport, where it becomes a dual carriageway freeway around downtown Newark in Essex County with a 2-2-2-2 configuration. The historic Pulaski Skyway takes US1/9 into Jersey City, and the route exits the freeway at Tonnele Circle to head north into Bergen County. US1/9 turns onto US46 as a jersey-freeway, and the three routes run northeast to the George Washington Bridge Plaza, where they merge into I-95. US46 ends in the middle of the bridge, which crosses the Hudson River into New York, and US9 exits just beyond onto Broadway in Manhattan, but US1 stays with I-95 onto the Cross Bronx Expressway, exiting in the Bronx onto Webster Avenue. Two turns take US1 via Fordham Road to Boston Road, which it follows northeast out of the city to the state line, never straying far from I-95. As it enters Greenwich, Connecticut, it continues as a two lane local road.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a necking model used for predicting creep lifetimes of Grade 91. Creep results {{from more than}} 15 tests at 500 - 600 °C on Grade 91 are used. One of them fractured after 160 × 103 h at 500 °C. Hart's necking model using the Norton power-law rule correctly predicts lifetimes up to 60 × 103 h at 500 °C. However, it overestimates lifetimes in all other loading conditions. The necking model including material creep softening, appearing during the tertiary stage, predicts lifetimes differing from the experimental results by less than 20 % for lifetimes up to 160 × 103 h at 500 °C and 50 % up to 94 × 103 h at 600 °C. These predictions are reasonable with respect to experimental scatter. The model predicts the time evolution of the <b>necking</b> <b>section</b> in agreement with an interrupted creep test at least up to 75 % of the experimental lifetime.

We studied cortical bone from the superior and inferior sectors of whole femoral <b>neck</b> <b>sections</b> from five female osteoporotic hip fracture cases (74 – 92  years) and five nonfractured controls (75 – 88  years). The typical calcium content (CaPeak) and the mineral particle thickness parameter (T) were mapped in large areas of the superior and inferior regions using quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI) and scanning small-angle X-ray scattering, respectively. Additionally, indentation modulus (E) and hardness (H) (determined by nanoindentation) were compared at the local level to the mineral content (CaInd) at the indent positions (obtained from qBEI). CaPeak (− 2. 2 %, P =  0. 002), CaInd (− 1. 8 %, P =  0. 048), E (− 5. 6 %, P =  0. 040), and H (− 6. 0 %, P =  0. 016) were significantly lower for the superior compared to the inferior region.

40|$|An {{interactive}} {{image analysis}} package {{was developed to}} examine whole cross-sections from the femoral neck. The package quantifies cortical width (Ct. Wi), cortical porosity (Ct. Po), and proportions of cortical, cancellous bone {{as a percentage of}} bone plus marrow area. Segmental analysis was used to quantify circumferential variations in bone distribution within the femoral cross-section. To evaluate reproducibility of data four independent operators analyzed previously prepared femoral <b>neck</b> <b>sections</b> from a 2000 BC population. Differences in total and circumferential distributions of cortical and cancellous bone with respect to gender and age of samples were demonstrated. Reproducibility was assessed using coefficients of variation (CV). Analysis of sections using a variable magnification, giving largest possible image size, rather than a set magnification reduced variation between operators for all measurements. Use of a calculated threshold significantly decreased variation between operators for the proportions of cortical and cancellous bone (p < or = 0. 026). Dividing the image into 8 rather than 16 segments also improved reproducibility. There was little agreement between operators in the determination of cortical porosity. The mean CV for the other quantitative indices such as cortical width and proportions of cortical and cancellous bone ranged from 4. 87 % to 13. 52 %. The genders showed similar patterns in circumferential distribution of bone. Cortical width was significantly greater in the inferior region compared to the other areas, whereas percent cortical bone was lowest at the superior region. The center of mass (COM) for the younger age group was located anteriorly, whereas in the older samples the COM was located posteriorly of the center of area (p = 0. 041).
