According {{to the old}} rules, the correct {{spelling}} of the word “fifty” in Belarusian was “пяцьдзесят,” (piaćdziesiat) but under the new rules, it should be spelled “пяцьдзясят,” (piaćdziasiat) the difference being that the seventh character was the Cyrillic letter IE but is now the Cyrillic letter YA. As {{a result of these}} new rules, the existing 50- and 50,000-ruble notes dated 2000 now technically contain errors where the denominations are spelled out on the notes. On 29 December 2010, the National Bank of Belarus introduced new 50- and 50,000-ruble banknotes to bring the inscriptions on the notes into compliance with the new rules of <b>Belarusian</b> <b>spelling</b> and punctuation. The images, colors, and sizes of the notes remain consistent with the preceding issues of the same denominations dated 2000.

5000|$|The Old East Slavic name of {{the town}} was Мѣньскъ (i.e. Měnsk < Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European Mēnĭskŭ), derived from a river name Měn (< Mēnŭ). The direct {{continuation}} of this <b>name</b> in <b>Belarusian</b> is Miensk (pronounced [...] ).The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either Минскъ or Мѣнскъ), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: Минск) and Polish (Mińsk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled Менск) as their preferred name for the city.|$|R
50|$|There are {{at least}} six {{narratives}} {{of the origin of}} the city’s <b>Belarusian</b> <b>name.</b> One of the more plausible is that the name is derived from the name of the stream Homeyuk, which flowed into river Sozh near the foot of the hill where the first settlement was founded. <b>Names</b> of other <b>Belarusian</b> cities are formed along these lines: for example, the name Minsk is derived from the river Menka, Polatsk from the river Palata, and Vitsebsk from the river Vitsba.In historical sources from 1142 to the 16th century, the city is mentioned as Hom', Homye, Homiy, Homey, or Homyi. These forms are tentatively explained as derivatives of an unattested *gomŭ of uncertain meaning.The modern name for the city has been in use only since the 16th-17th centuries.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{significant}} instance {{of this is}} in the representation of vowel reduction, and in particular akannye, the merger of unstressed /a/ and /o/, which exists in both Russian and <b>Belarusian.</b> <b>Belarusian</b> always <b>spells</b> this merged sound as , whereas Russian uses either [...] or , according to what the [...] "underlying" [...] phoneme is (determined by looking at related words where the vowel is stressed, or if no such words exist, either by etymology or by the pronunciation in dialects that lack the merger). This means that Belarusian noun and verb paradigms, as written, have large numbers of instances of alternations between written [...] and , whereas no such alternations exist in the corresponding written paradigms in Russian. This can significantly complicate the task of foreign speakers in learning these paradigms; but, on the other hand, it makes spelling easier for native speakers.|$|R

50|$|Lazanki {{arrived in}} the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the mid-16th century when Bona Sforza, Italian wife of King Sigismund I the Old, brought high Italian cuisine to the country.

Lazanki resembling mini versions of lasagne, their Polish and <b>Belarusian</b> <b>names</b> are correspondingly diminutive in form. Unlike most Italian dishes in these parts of Europe, lazanki have survived into the 21st century, although the long and cultural history of the dish has been largely forgotten.|$|R
