50|$|The R-box {{contains}} the <b>network</b> <b>router.</b> The <b>network</b> <b>router</b> connected the microprocessor to other microprocessors using four ports named North, South, East and West. Each port {{consisted of two}} 39-bit unidirectional links operating at 800 MHz. 32 bits were for data and 7 bits were for ECC. The <b>network</b> <b>router</b> also has a fifth port, used for I/O. This port connects to an IO7 {{application specific integrated circuit}} (ASIC), which was a bridge to an AGP 4x channel and two PCI-X buses. The I/O port consisted of two unidirectional 32-bit links operating at 200 MHz, yielding a peak bandwidth of 3.2 GB/s. The I/O port link operated at a quarter of the clock frequency to simplify the design of the I/O ASIC.|$|E

Major reason is that the progress of processor performance has increasingly outpaced that of the interconnection networks, thereby limiting the usefulness of multiprocessor systems. This work presents a comprehensive study and the development of optoelectronicbased <b>network</b> <b>routers.</b> Optoelectronic technology can potentially provide ample bandwidth required by multiprocessor systems {{but at the same time}} can raise some critical issues that are discussed here such as on-chip wiring and chip packaging.

50|$|Route {{analytics}} systems function {{by establishing}} a relationship (adjacency) with a single router in a Layer 3 network followed by passive listening of the control plane messages being exchanged by the routers. By {{becoming part of the}} control plane, route analytics systems effectively act as a passive router, having the same routing knowledge of other <b>network</b> <b>routers</b> but without the ability to forward actual data packets. Though the systems are actively participating in the control plane, they cannot affect how data is routed around the network. The systems must also support the various routing protocols to effectively analyze the updates announced by the <b>network</b> <b>routers.</b>|$|R

50|$|A typical <b>network</b> <b>router</b> simply sends {{incoming}} packets {{onto the}} appropriate IP address on its network.

40|$|<b>Network</b> <b>routers</b> {{occupy a}} unique role in modern {{distributed}} systems.

However, this illusion is shattered – as are implicit assumptions of availability, confidentiality or integrity – when <b>network</b> <b>routers</b> are subverted to act in a malicious fashion. By compromising a router, an attacker may drop, delay, reorder, corrupt, modify or divert any of the packets passing through. Such a capability can then be used to deny service to legitimate hosts, to implement ongoing network surveillance or to provide an efficient man-in-the-middle functionality for attacking end systems.
