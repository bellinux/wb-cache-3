5|$|In January 1942, the Germans {{estimated}} at the Wannsee Conference that Albania was inhabited by 200 Jews. That same month, Jews were interned by the Italians at a camp in Pristina. Though they feared {{they would be}} {{handed over to the}} Germans, the Italian commander of the camp promised them that this would <b>never</b> <b>happen.</b> On 14 March 1942, the Italians blockaded the camp and arrested the Jews that had been detained there. Some were handed over to the Germans and transported to the Sajmište concentration camp, near Belgrade, where they were killed. Others, together with Serbs, were taken to the camp in Berat, where they were detained until Italy's capitulation. It is estimated that as many as 500 Jews were interned in the camps in Berat, Krujë and Kavajë during the Italian occupation.|$|E

25|$|On 21 May 2009, WBC light middleweight {{champion}} Vernon Forrest {{was stripped}} of his title due to a rib injury that would leave him out of action indefinitely. Because of the injury and his inability to fight Sergio Martínez, Martínez's interim title was upgraded to full WBC title status. Although the organization also mandated that Martínez face Forrest, that bout would <b>never</b> <b>happen.</b> Less than a month later, Forrest was tragically murdered in Atlanta, GA.|$|E

25|$|The anime {{is based}} on the {{critically}} acclaimed manga. As the manga was ongoing during the anime's production, the animated series makes some changes to the story. Several events are combined; some events, such as Tohru's first meeting with Momiji and all references to Tohru's baseball cap, <b>never</b> <b>happen.</b> The anime makes no mention that Yuki and Kyo have met Tohru's mother or that Kyo blames himself for her death. Many of the events surrounding the revealing of Kyo's true form are greatly changed in the anime, including adding an extended chase sequence and Tohru meeting Akito in the woods, none of which happen in the manga.|$|E

25|$|On January 20, the NTSB {{declared}} that overvoltage {{was not the}} cause of the Boston incident, as voltage did not exceed the battery limit of 32 V, and the charging unit passed tests. The battery had signs of short circuiting and thermal runaway. Despite this, by January 24, the NTSB had not yet pinpointed the cause of the Boston fire; the FAA would not allow U.S.-based 787s to fly again until the problem was found and corrected. In a press briefing that day, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said that the NTSB had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems, and stated that fire must <b>never</b> <b>happen</b> on an airplane.|$|E

25|$|Around May 2016, another rumor {{started that}} a {{crossover}} fight between Mayweather and MMA star Conor McGregor {{was in the}} works. On May 7, 2016, Mayweather confirmed {{that he was the}} one who started the rumors regarding the potential clash. Mayweather followed it through with an Instagram post of an unofficial teaser poster showcasing both fighters. Mayweather reportedly talked to Freddie Roach to train McGregor for the fight in case it would happen. Dana White dismissed all the rumors and stated that Mayweather had yet to contact him in case he wanted the fight to push through, since McGregor was in contract with the UFC. On January 13, 2017, White continued his stance against a Mayweather-McGregor boxing matchup and insisted it would <b>never</b> <b>happen</b> due to McGregor's contract and even went as far as offering Mayweather to box McGregor in the UFC for $25 million.|$|E
25|$|The {{genesis of}} Zack and Miri {{has been in}} Kevin Smith's mind since the '90s. Two porn {{centered}} projects were in development. One was a film called Name. It {{was intended to be}} a follow up (not a sequel) to Chasing Amy and would've starred the trio from that movie, Jason Lee, Ben Affleck, and Joey Lauren Adams and to be set in the View Askewniverse. But the project wasn't made, and was replaced with Dogma. The second attempt was in 1997 as a failed 22 episode series titled Hiatus. The series would've starred Lee again, and was about a man returning home after being away in California and leading a double life as a porn star. When he pitched the series to tv networks, they all rejected the idea believing that the kind of material handed to them can <b>never</b> <b>happen</b> on television. But he kept the idea in mind and wrote a script following Clerks II that would be porn-bent.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{power was}} first used to {{supplement}} the fully developed hydropower sources in Lowell in the 1860s, and by the mid-1870s, it was the dominant energy source. Electricity allowed the mills to run on hydroelectricity, instead of direct-drive hydropower. These improvements allowed Lowell to continue increasing its industrial output with a lesser {{increase in the number}} of workers. However, the move away from pure hydropower was leading to Lowell being eclipsed by cities with better locations for the new power sources. For example, in the 50 years after the Civil War, Fall River, Massachusetts and New Bedford, Massachusetts both became larger factory towns than Lowell based on output. The reason was largely because their seaport locations made the importation and exportation of goods and materials, and particularly coal, more economical than the considerably inland, and therefore only accessible by train, Lowell. By 1920, it was being seriously suggested that the Merrimack be dredged from Newburyport to Lowell so that barges could access the city. However, the events of the 1920s ensured that would <b>never</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
