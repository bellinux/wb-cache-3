25|$|In November 1924, Davies {{was among}} those aboard Hearst's luxury yacht Oneida for a weekend party that {{resulted}} in the death of film producer Thomas Ince.

Certain sections of the press predicted (or even called for) Leeds's expulsion from the Football League, but this was considered a difficult matter for the League, since there had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> precedent for expelling a club outside of the bottom division.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} meteorological occurrence was {{the first}} snowfall, which occurred on 8 July 1994 in Pelotas from 11:00am to 1:30pm. Before this date, there had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> record of snow in the city. The phenomenon was weaker in the urban parts of the city, and did not cover the ground. However, the snowfall was more intense further inland, in districts such as Cascata and Quilombo, {{and was able to}} cover the vegetation in a white blanket. Snow grains were recorded in Pelotas on 4 September 2006, on 5 September 2008, and on 3 August 2010, and graupel was registered on 12 July 2012, and on 25 September 2012.|$|E

In December 2008, the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) withdrew Air Tanzania's Air Operator Certificate because the airline {{had failed to}} meet the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Two weeks later, the International Air Transport Association banned the air carrier from all aviation transactions and informed all travel agencies and other aviation companies to stop all transactions with Air Tanzania until further notice. The certificate was restored in January 2009, with both the TCAA and Air Tanzania claiming there had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> doubt about the airworthiness of its aircraft.

25|$|Macneil's work {{is often}} {{considered}} inaccessible {{and difficult to}} read. And Macneil himself has expressed some disappointment at the reception of the work among legal scholars: 'I have now had over a decade to accept that there had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> race to a relational theory of contract, nor have the succeeding years seen either widespread acceptance of (or indeed much challenge to) my particular theory or the development of other relational theories.' However, the Northwestern symposium and other more recent work goes some way to correcting that omission. In particular, David Campbell has published an edited collection of Macneil's relational contract theory work. Macneil's work in particular has also been discussed by Richard Austen-Baker, who relates Macneil's system of norms to English contract law doctrine, and used Macneil's theory to discuss the need or otherwise of further regulation of consumer contracts.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that there had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and {{executed}} as such had been innocent of the crime. At this time, two figures independently raised the prospect that the witch trials had been influenced by stereotypes and folk customs that had pre-Christian origins. In his 1749 work Del Congresso Notturno delle Lamie (On the Nocturnal Meeting of Witches), the Italian cleric Girolamo Tartarotti claimed that the stereotype of the witch in Early Modern Europe was influenced by pre-Christian folk beliefs. Similar ideas were echoed by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm in his Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology), first published in 1835. Here, he claimed that the witch stereotype reflected an blending of pre-Christian folk traditions with the later Medieval views of heresy. Both Tartarotti and Grimm would subsequently be erroneously cited as claiming that the witches had been members of a surviving pre-Christian cult.|$|E

25|$|Naturally {{the fight}} for the top spots means that the most {{significant}} rivalries are with the other Top 14 big guns, Toulouse and Biarritz Olympique. Stade Français {{has been seen as}} the rising threat by the all-powerful Toulousains who had won four consecutive titles (1994–97), before Paris won the next one. The clubs alternated for four years, winning two titles each until 2001, though they never met in the final. When they finally did, Stade Français walked over Toulouse for a victory (32–18) in 2003. Toulouse got their revenge in 2005, when they won a tight Heineken Cup final in overtime (18–12 a.e.t.) at Murrayfield. The clubs often fight it out in the press, but there have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> real tensions on the pitch, largely because many players have been playing together for France. Regular season games are rarely spectacular. In October 2005, Toulouse was the guest for the first ever regular season match at the Stade de France, but coach Guy Novès chose to leave key regular starters at home, so the Stade Français 29–15 victory was maybe not as significant.|$|E
25|$|In his From Myth to Myth: The Case of Yüeh Fei's Biography, noted Sinologist Hellmut Wilhelm {{concluded}} that Yue Fei purposely patterned his life after famous Chinese heroes from dynasties past {{and that this}} ultimately led to his martyrdom. Apart from studying literature under his father Yue He (岳和), Yue Fei loved to read military classics. He favored the Zuo Zhuan commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals and the strategies of Sun Tzu and Wu Qi. Although his literacy afforded him the chance to become a scholar, which was a position held in much higher regard than the common soldiery during the Song dynasty, Yue chose the military path because there had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> tradition of civil service in his family. Therefore he {{had no reason to}} study Confucian classics in order to surpass the accomplishments of his ancestors or to raise his family's social status to the next level. His fourth generation ancestor, Yue Huan (岳渙), had served as a lingshi (令使) (essentially a low-level functionary), but he was never a full-fledged member of the civil service rank. A second theory is that he joined the military in the hopes of emulating his favorite heroes.|$|E

500|$|Despite being literate, {{giving him}} a chance to become a scholar, young Yue Fei chose the {{military}} path because there had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> tradition of full-fledged Confucian civil service in his family history. He would stay up all night reading military strategy books and idolized such great historical heroes as Guan Yu. However, the Yue family was much too poor to afford military lessons for their son, so, Yao Dewang, the boy's maternal grandfather, hired Chen Guang (陈广) to teach the eleven-year-old how to wield the Chinese spear. Yao was very surprised when his grandson quickly mastered the spear by the age of thirteen. Zhou was then brought in to continue Yue's military training in archery. Dr. Kaplan describes Zhou as the [...] "most important" [...] of the two teachers.|$|E

She has expressed her opinion of the comparison in the lyrics to [...] "God Given Name": [...] "I'm not her and never will be" [...] – which was purposely set as the album's opening track to show their differences. In his review for the album, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone magazine referred to the lyrics as a declaration of independence. In {{an interview with the}} Daily Mail, Knowles commented: [...] "People think there should be this great rivalry between us, but there's <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> competition. There's a big age gap and we are two very different characters." [...] Beyoncé was unwilling to bring her sister into the recording industry, reasoning that it [...] "involves a lot of pressure". Knowles countered by saying, [...] "It's good to have her advice, but we really have different goals".|$|E
500|$|One {{objection}} to identifying {{the road as}} Roman was that, based on readings of the Iter Britanniarum—the section of the 4th-century Itinerary of Antoninus that lists major Roman Roads and stations within Britain—there had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>any</b> major Roman roads in the area. In 1817, Young attempted {{to address this problem}} by arguing that the course of one of the identified iters (iter 1) had been misinterpreted and ran between Malton and Dunsley, passing through Wheeldale. Such an argument was possible because the Iter Britanniarum was not a map, but rather a list or itinerary of roads and their distance between various settlements. Roman names for settlements were used in the document and, since many of these named sites had not been conclusively matched to contemporary settlements, identification of exact routes listed in the Iter was often difficult. There were few other objections at the time to the causeway's identification as a Roman road and by the twentieth century the causeway was commonly being referred to as the [...] "Wheeldale Roman Road", or [...] "Goathland Roman Road".|$|E
