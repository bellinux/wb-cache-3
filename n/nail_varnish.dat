40|$|Introduction and objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze theinfiltration of the sealers AH Plus®, Sealapex®, Sealer 26 ® and Endofill®,using {{clearing}} teeth technique. Material and methods: Fifty single-rooted teeth had its crowns removed and canals prepared by the Oregon modified technique. After the chemical-mechanical preparation, the root canals were filled with gutta-percha and four different sealers:group I: AH Plus®; group II: Sealapex®; group III: Sealer 26 ® and group IV: Endofill®. The others two groups of five teeth each served as positive and negative control groups. After filling, teeth remained for 60 days in saline solution 0. 9 %, simulating oral conditions. Following this stage,teeth were covered by three layers of nail polish, immersed in nankin ink and stored in a stove under 37 ºC for 48 hours. After this period of time, the samples were washed in current water for 24 hours, the <b>nail</b> <b>varnishes</b> were removed with bistoury blade and the clearing technique was applied to evaluate the results. Results and conclusion: The results showed insignificant differences between the materials tested and so a similar behavior in the apical marginal infiltration...|$|R

25|$|Doc Martens {{were dark}} shoes or boots with air-cushioned soles that were worn by both sexes in the 1980s. They were an {{essential}} fashion accessory for the skinhead and punk subcultures in the United Kingdom. Sometimes Doc Martens were paired with miniskirts or full, Laura Ashley- style dresses. They were an {{important feature of}} the post-punk 1980s Gothic look which featured long, back-combed hair, pale skin, dark eyeshadow, eyeliner, and lipstick, black <b>nail</b> <b>varnish,</b> spiked bracelets and dog-collars, black clothing (often made of gabardine), and leather or velvet trimmed in lace or fishnet material. Corsets were often worn by girls. British bands that inspired the gothic trend include The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Cult. This trend would return in the 1990s.|$|E

40|$|State of Problem: Patients {{suffering}} from hyposalivation are usally {{treated by the}} administration of saliva substitutes to alleviate oral complaints. Some saliva substitutes show a demineralising potential on dental hard tissue. This effect might be counteracted by the application of fluoridated gels or mouthwash solutions. Objectives: Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of various saliva substitutes on the mineral content and the lesion depth of demineral-ized bovine enamel. Materials and methods: Demineralized specimens were either stored in mineral water [W, (control), pH 7, 0], experimental CMC-based saliva substitute (saturation with respect to octcacalciumphosphate; SOCP: 0, 3; pH 6, 3) or in a modified saliva substitute (SN; SOCP: 1, 7; pH 5, 85) for five weeks at 37 °C. After two weeks half of the exposed surfaces were <b>nail</b> <b>varnished.</b> The following treatments were applied twice daily for ten minutes each time: 1 : no treatment, 2 : Meridol® mouthrinse, 3 : elmex sensitive® mouthrinse, 4 : elmex gelée®, 5 : ProSchmelz fluoride gelée®. Dif-ferences in mineral loss (ΔΔZ) and lesion depth (ΔLD) before and after storage were evaluated from microradiographs. Results: Specimens stored in C saliva showed significantly higher mineral loss compared to W and SN (p< 0, 05; ANOVA, Bonferroni). For C additional use of fluoride resulted in less demineralisation (p< 0, 05) compared to C alone. SN in combination with ProSchmelz® led to significantly higher remineralisation compared to all other groups (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Treatment with ProSchmelz® in combination with storage in a saliva substitute supersaturated with respect to OCP yield to the most pronounced remineralisation under the conditions chosen...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHand hygiene of {{healthcare}} personnel {{is one of}} the most important interventions for reducing transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Previous studies have demonstrated that the use of alcohol-based hand gel increases hand hygiene compliance, but that effective use of this product cannot be taken for granted. ObjectiveEvaluate factors associated with poor hand hygiene effectiveness of hospital workers using an alcohol-based hand gel and the effect of an education program. DesignA direct observational prospective study of hand hygiene effectiveness prior to training and immediately after training. Setting and subjects 3067 hospital workers of different professional categories in several hospital units in the University Hospital of Nancy (France). ResultsTime after program start (OR 0. 97, 95 %CI 0. 96 – 0. 97) and being female (OR 0. 37, 0. 24 – 0. 58) were highly associated with increased effectiveness of hand hygiene prior to training. Wearing rings other than a wedding ring (OR 1. 8, 1. 2 – 2. 7), a bracelet (OR 2. 0, 1. 1 – 3. 6), a watch (OR 1. 9, 1. 3 – 2. 9) and having long nails were associated with ineffective hand rub use. Professional background was also a strong predictor with nurses and especially senior nurses demonstrating much better effectiveness than all other professional groups. Wearing wedding rings or long sleeves, and having <b>varnished</b> <b>nails,</b> visibly dirty hands prior to washing and cutaneous lesions were not associated with effective gel use. ConclusionThese results demonstrate that an educational program can significantly improve the proper practices for using hand rub and hand washing compliance. This study has also demonstrated that wearing rings, bracelets, watches and long nails impair hand gel application but that wedding rings, long sleeves and <b>varnished</b> <b>nails</b> do not. The finding of that hand hygiene effectiveness increased with time even prior to training indicates that knowledge gained by staff trained early diffused into those who had not yet been trained...|$|R

The woman's companion, Miss Minnie Lawson, is the {{unexpected}} beneficiary of a substantial fortune and the house, according to the will written while Emily recovered from the earlier fall. Under the previous will, Miss Arundell's nephew Charles Arundell and nieces Theresa Arundell and Bella Tanios, would have inherited. This gives them all motive for the first possible attempted murder. While examining the house, under the pretense of buying it, Poirot discovers a <b>nail</b> covered with <b>varnish</b> and a small string tied to it {{at the top of}} the stairs. Before her death Miss Arundell had said something about 'Bob...dog...picture...ajar'. Poirot concludes that this means a jar with a picture of a dog on it and that Bob could not have put the ball on the staircase, because he had been out all night. Miss Arundell therefore fell over a tripwire tied to the nail.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare, in vitro, the {{effectiveness}} of the resin sealants ProSeal™, OrthoCoat™, SeLECT Defense™, and Biscover LV™ on the inhibition of enamel demineralization after being subjected to extensive mechanical toothbrush abrasion. Seventy-five extracted third molars were divided into five groups - control, ProSeal, SeLECT Defense, OrthoCoat, and Biscover LV. All of the teeth, with the exception of the control group, weretreated with one of the four sealant materials per the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s instructions. Teeth were mounted in an acrylic ring and stabilized with a vinyl polysiloxane impression material. The mounted teeth were placed in the Prototech Toothbrush Wear Simulator and a soft-bristled toothbrush was placed over the buccal surface of the tooth. Each tooth was subjected to 15, 000 horizontal strokes at a rate of 120 strokes/minute and each toothbrush received a constant force of 280 g to stimulate normal manual brushing, simulating about 2 years of manual toothbrushing. Teeth from all groups were painted with a thin layer of acid-resistant <b>varnish</b> (<b>nail</b> polish), leaving a 1 mm window of exposed enamel on the buccal surface. They were then placed into a constantly circulating, room-temperature standard tenCate Demineralizing Solution (pH= 4. 4) consisting of 2. 20 mM Ca 2 +, 2. 20 mMPO 4 3 -, 0. 05 mM Acetic acid and 0. 025 ppm F- for 96 hours. Three sections were made of each tooth and the sections were examined under a polarized light microscope. Descriptive statistics were conducted with the study data. The one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Ryan-Einot-Gabriel-Welsch multiple range test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in lesion depth between sealant materials. The following conclusions were made: All materials tested provided a significant reduction in enamel demineralization as compared to untreated controls.
