5000|$|The species {{discovery}} curve {{will necessarily}} be increasing, and will normally be negatively accelerated (that is, its {{rate of increase}} will slow down). Plotting the curve gives a way of estimating the number of additional species that will be discovered with further effort. This is usually done by fitting some kind of functional form to the curve, either by eye or by using non-linear regression techniques. Commonly used functional forms include the logarithmic function and the <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>function.</b> The advantage of the <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>function</b> is that it tends to an asymptote which equals {{the number of species}} that would be discovered if infinite effort is expended. However, some theoretical approaches imply that the logarithmic curve may be more appropriate, implying that though species discovery will slow down with increasing effort, it will never entirely cease, so there is no asymptote, and if infinite effort was expended, an infinite number of species would be discovered.|$|E

For each data set, the inverse cumulative proportion of individuals moving 100 in distance classes was fitted to the <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>function</b> and the inverse power function. In each case, the <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>function</b> provided a better fit than the inverse power function. Two dispersal kernels were generated using both negative exponential and inverse power functions. These dispersal kernels were used to predict movements between 14 suitable sites in a landscape of 220 km(2). The <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>function</b> generated a dispersal kernel predicting extremely low probabilities for movements exceeding I km. The inverse power function generated probabilities predicting that between site movements were possible, according to metapopulation size. CMR studies in the landscape revealed that long distance movements occurred at each generation, corresponding to predictions of the inverse power function dispersal kernel. A total of 26 movements between sites (up to 13 km) were detected, together with recolonisation of empty sites. The spatial scale of the metapopulation dynamics is larger than ever reported on butterflies and long distance movements clearly matter to the persistence of this species in a highly fragmented landscape...|$|E

30|$|Finally, we {{outline the}} {{computational}} {{complexity of the}} proposed method. To this end, we take as the reference the proposed αESM method and the H-EESM, since they represent {{the best and worst}} case, respectively, as apparent from Figs.  5, 6 and 7. The H-EESM method has a closed form and is based on the logarithm of a sum of <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>functions,</b> {{as can be seen in}} Eq. (15) of [20]. Also, the αESM method, for a given PR, has a closed form and is based on the logarithm of a sum of <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>functions,</b> as can be seen from Eq. (8), and the recursive Eq. (22). The complexity required by the recursive equation can be considered negligible when compared to the evaluation of the corresponding ESNR, in that the functions g(·,·) and f(·,·) defined in (24) can be properly calculated using a look-up table. Therefore, their computational complexity at each PR can be considered comparable. The only difference is that, while the H-EESM is evaluated only at the first PR, the αESM is re-evaluated PR by PR. Thus, its complexity increases linearly with the number of PRs. Since this number is limited (usually below 10), the increment of complexity w.r.t. the H-EESM is lower (or at most equal to) one order of magnitude, but with a great gain in performance, as previously shown.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo start with, an {{analytical}} layer-element (i. e., a symmetric stiffness matrix), which describes {{the relationship between}} the generalized displacements and the stress levels of a layer subjected to non-axisymmetric loading, is exactly derived in the transformed domain by the application of a Laplace–Hankel transform with respect to variables t and r, a Fourier expansion with respect to variable θ, and a Laplace transform and its inversion with respect to variable z, based on the governing equations of Biot’s consolidation of multi-layered saturated poroelastic materials with anisotropic permeability. The analytical layer-element experiences considerable improvement in computation efficiency and stability, since it only contains <b>negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>functions</b> in its elements. In addition, a global stiffness matrix for multi-layered saturated poroelastic media is obtained by assembling the interrelated layer-elements based on the continuity conditions between adjacent layers. By introducing the boundary conditions and solving the global stiffness matrix, the solutions in the Laplace–Hankel transformed domain are obtained, and the final solutions can be recovered by a numerical inversion of the Laplace–Hankel transform. Finally, numerical examples are presented to verify the theory and to study the effect of the property of anisotropic permeability on vertical displacements and excess pore pressure. The calculation results show that the property of anisotropic permeability has a great influence on the process of consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Epizoochorous {{dispersal}} of plant seeds {{is an important}} long-distance dispersal mechanism. Yet {{little is known about}} retention times of seeds in animal furs and hence about potential dispersal distances of the seeds. Here, we used marked seeds of 12 plant species to determine seed depletion curves on Galloway cattle and Haflinger horse in three vegetation types (forest, tall herbage vegetation and meadow), in both dry and rainy weather conditions. In the long fur of Galloway cattle, seeds were retained significantly longer than in the short fur of Haflinger horse. In general, seed retention times were not considerably affected by the structure of the surrounding vegetation. The impact of the weather was negligible, only affecting the retention of some plant species. <b>Negative</b> <b>exponential</b> <b>functions</b> were fitted to the seed depletion curves. Using the parameters of curve estimations in the different conditions of animal species and vegetation structure, half-life seed retention times of up to 13 h for Galloway cattle and up to more than 4 h for Haflinger horse could be calculated, with corresponding potential half-life dispersal distances in the order of magnitude of tens of metres to a few kilometres.

We did this by conducting response function analyses with ring-width chronologies developed from trees representing different growth conditions. Material and methods On five islands in Lake Hébécourt, a total of 41 white cedar trees were sampled, which represented the following three growth conditions: i) 12 shoreline trees that are inundated at least during periods of high water levels (shore), ii) 16 relatively small and twisted trees rooted within cracks in cliff faces and growing about 2 m above the maximum water level (cliffs), and iii) 13 trees located in the interior of the forest more than 2 m above the lake and growing on relatively deep soil (forest interior).
