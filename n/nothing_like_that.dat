25|$|The gamble {{to carry}} out the {{operation}} in daylight proved successful. Daylight not only helped the aircraft to navigate better, but also greatly reduced the time required for units to assemble on the drop zones. This was achieved with over 5,200 sorties by fighters and bombers devoted to warding off the Luftwaffe and suppressing German flak batteries. However, it did not eliminate the need for pathfinders. The recovery rate for airdropped supplies also improved but was still poor. The 101st Airborne Division retrieved less than 50% of its supplies, while the 82nd Airborne Division, greatly aided by Dutch civilians, still managed less than 70%. The beleaguered British 1st Airborne Division retrieved less than 15% of its supplies. Major General James M. Gavin of the 82nd Airborne Division estimated that collecting all of the airdropped supplies would have required a third of men. <b>Nothing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> was available in battle. In all, IX Tactical Air Command flew 4,242 aircraft and 1,899 glider sorties, losing 98 aircraft and 137 gliders. Nos 38 and 46 Groups RAF flew 1,340 aircraft and 627 glider sorties, losing 55 aircraft and two gliders.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

[...] But Patty's arm got caught in the narrow bars and broke. [...] It was a freak accident. [...] No one ever realized that those bars were narrow enough to catch that tiny arm.|$|E

Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. <b>Nothing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> ever happened to me in the studio in my whole life."

500|$|On May 1, 2013, West {{used the}} social {{networking}} site Twitter to post a single message reading [...] "June Eighteen", leading several media outlets to speculate that the post referred to the release date of West's upcoming album. On May 17, he began promotion of the album by unveiling the previously unreleased song [...] "New Slaves" [...] through video projections in 66 assorted locations. The following day, West appeared on the American late-night live television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live and performed the songs [...] "New Slaves" [...] and [...] "Black Skinhead". He subsequently revealed the album's cover and title, Yeezus, on his official website. The iTunes Store made Yeezus available for pre-order on May 20, but the listing was subsequently taken down for unknown reasons. On May 29, A.P.C. founder Jean Touitou unveiled an advertisement for Yeezus which stated that the album would not be available for pre-order. Speaking about the album's minimal promotion, West stated: [...] "With this album, we ain't drop no single to radio.

Ranaut said, [...] "In this script my character is such that you get to express you emotions, emotions that you have never delivered before in front of the camera. So when I heard the script, it was something new and much more challenging, more interesting and exciting." [...] Godse said that she accepted her role in the film because she identified with her character, Janet Sequira, whom she described [...] as [...] "outgoing, vibrant, bold and outspoken". Arjan Bajwa described his character, an aspiring fashion model, as uncompromising, achieving success in his own way. Samir Soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging, requiring research to flesh out the character and his personality. Soni's greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character, instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with the film's other characters.|$|E

He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> that's trash.

He acknowledged that this method would be used, but {{expressed an interest in}} shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of first-person shooter video games being rendered in 3D. Dunstan added that [...] "It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface {{to try to get a}} reaction out of you.

[...] Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an [...] "interesting experience".
