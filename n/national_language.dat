5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th century that a common, {{standardized}} <b>national</b> <b>language</b> became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, {{by the time of the}} spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today.

5|$|No {{official}} languages {{were recorded}} in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the <b>national</b> <b>language.</b> Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, {{on the grounds that}} the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional.

5|$|English {{remains an}} active second language, with its use allowed for some {{official}} purposes under the <b>National</b> <b>Language</b> Act of 1967. In Sarawak, English is an official state language alongside Malaysian. Historically, English was {{the de facto}} administrative language, with Malay becoming predominant after the 1969 race riots (13 May Incident). Malaysian English, also known as Malaysian Standard English, {{is a form of}} English derived from British English. Malaysian English is widely used in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of English with heavy Malay, Chinese, and Tamil influences.

5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the war, the Flemish Movement had become an increasing phenomenon in Belgian politics. Traditionally French had been the dominant language of the Belgian government and the upper class of Belgian society. After a period of marginalization, the Flemish Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, one of the movement's chief objectives, culminating in the legal recognition of Dutch as a <b>national</b> <b>language</b> in 1898. In 1914 new laws were passed giving further concessions to the movement, but the outbreak of war meant that their implementation had been postponed. Numerous grievances were left unaddressed. Among the outstanding grievances was the University of Ghent which, though situated in Flanders, taught exclusively in French.|$|E

5|$|The {{first modern}} Indonesian novels {{published}} by the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies Balai Pustaka were often written to show intergenerational conflict and conflict between traditional (adat) and modern culture. These novels, published beginning in the 1920s, spearheaded the use of Indonesian as a <b>national</b> <b>language.</b> This national awakening, which was also realised through political actions, was followed in July 1933 {{with the establishment of}} the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe (New Writer). The literary magazine, which Belenggus author Armijn Pane helped establish, was the first written mainly in Indonesian and with exclusively Indonesian editors.|$|E

5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} <b>national</b> <b>language</b> of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E
