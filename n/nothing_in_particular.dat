25|$|The {{most recent}} Pew Research Center {{finding was that}} in 2015 71% of the {{population}} of Russia declared itself Eastern Orthodox, 15% religiously unaffiliated—a category which includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”, 10% Muslim, and 2% other Christians, while 1% belonged to other faiths. The religiously unaffiliated divided between 4% as atheists, 1% as agnostics and 10% as <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular.</b> The study cited that during the communist era the government repression of religion was widespread, and due to the Soviet anti-religious legislation; in 1991 37% {{of the population of}} Russia was Eastern Orthodox. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union the affiliation to the Eastern Orthodox church have risen substantially and in 2015 about 71% of the population of Russia declared itself to be Eastern Orthodox, and the share of who identitied as religiously unaffiliated declined from a 61% in 1991 to 18% in 2008.|$|E

During a visit to Melbourne in 1955 to inspect the preparations, Brundage was less than impressed with the progress achieved under Kent Hughes's chairmanship and condemned Kent Hughes's apparent lack of concern at the looming deadline for the Games.

500|$|As a captain, Gilligan was not tactically {{sophisticated}} but was {{adept at}} inspiring his players. His Sussex teams were not consistent but became attractive to watch; under Gilligan's direction the team {{ranked among the}} best fielding sides in England. The off side fielders were nicknamed the [...] "ring of iron". His Wisden obituary stated: [...] "In two or three seasons by his insistence on fielding and on attacking cricket and by his own superb example he raised Sussex from being <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> {{to one of the}} biggest draws in England." [...] According to The Times, Gilligan's captaincy laid the foundations for the county's relative success in the 1930s. In the official history of Sussex, writer Christopher Lee suggests: [...] "The ten years from 1920 to the end of Gilligan's captaincy in 1930 saw the blooding {{of some of the most}} famous names in Sussex and England cricket. Gilligan himself was a mixture of amateur brilliance and professional thoroughness which inevitably brought about criticism." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleder {{also asked}} for stylistic {{touches on the}} episode which were {{inconsistent}} with the show's typical emphasis on documentary-style realism. For example, he arranged for red scrim lighting {{to reflect on the}} subway car to add an artistic visual touch, even though there was <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> in the subway station that reflected such a light. Upon hearing of the technique, Yoshimura was initially concerned, saying [...] "Oh, he's getting artsy fartsy with me." [...] Just before Lange's death, Fleder included a close-up with Braugher looking directly into the camera, breaking the fourth wall in a way typically forbidden on the show. During an outdoor dialogue scene between Johnson and Seda while the characters were driving in a car, Fleder filmed it by placing the camera outside the car's front windshield and panning {{back and forth between the}} two actors. Unbeknownst to Fleder, all car shots on Homicide: Life on the Street are only allowed to be filmed from inside the car to keep the scene more realistic. As a result of Fleder's car scene, a memo was circulated to the cast and crew reminding them of this policy and threatening to fire anybody who allowed a scene to be shot through the windshield again.|$|E

2500|$|Kenji {{resigned}} {{his post}} {{as a teacher}} in 1926 to become a farmer and help improve the {{lot of the other}} farmers in the impoverished north-eastern region of Japan by sharing his theoretical knowledge of agricultural science, by imparting to them improved, modern techniques of cultivation. He also taught his fellow farmers more general topics of cultural value, such as music, poetry, and whatever else he thought might improve their lives. He introduced them to classical music by playing to audiences compositions from Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner and Debussy on his gramophone. In August 1926 he established the [...] [...] When asked what [...] "Rasuchijin" [...] meant, he said it meant <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> but he was probably thinking of [...] and [...] He introduced new agricultural techniques and more resistant strains of rice. [...] At the detached house of his family, where he was staying at the time, he gathered a group of youths from nearby farming families and lectured on agronomy. The Rasuchijin Society also engaged in literary readings, plays, music and other cultural activities. It was disbanded after two years as Japan was being swept up by a militarist turn, in 1928, when the authorities closed it down.|$|E
2500|$|Tying {{artificial}} flies {{has always}} been about imitating some form of fish prey. Significant literature on the concepts of imitation exists especially for trout flies. A Book of Trout Flies – Jennings (1935), Streamside Guide to Naturals & Their Imitations – Art Flick (1947), Matching the Hatch – Schweibert (1955), Selective Trout - Swisher and Richards (1971), Nymphs - Schweibert (1973), Caddisflies - LaFontaine (1989), Prey - Richards (1995) are a few 20th-century titles that deal extensively with imitating natural prey. From a human perspective, many fly patterns do not exactly imitate fish prey found in nature, but they are nevertheless successful. A successful or [...] "killing" [...] fly pattern imitates something that the target species preys on. This has resulted in fly tyers and fishers devising additional terms to characterize those flies that obviously do not imitate anything in particular, yet are nevertheless successful at catching fish. These additional terms are inconsistently but commonly associated with trout-fly patterns because of their huge variety, both historical and contemporary. The term Attractor pattern {{has been applied to}} flies which resemble <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> but are successful in attracting strikes from fish (Trout Fishing, Brooks 1972). In Flies for Trout (1993) Dick Stewart characterizes these same patterns as General Purpose. Dave Hughes, in Trout Flies-The Tier’s Reference (1999), describes the same flies as Searching flies and characterizes three levels of imitation: Impressionistic, Suggestive and Imitative.|$|E
