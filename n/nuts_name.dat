5000|$|NUT Motorcycles was a British {{motorcycle}} manufacturer {{founded in}} Newcastle Upon Tyne in 1912 by Hugh Mason and Jock Hall, {{who had previously}} been making motorcycles since 1906 under a badge based on Mason's initials, HM, and later {{under the name of}} Jesmond and Bercley.

Following further racing success Mason and Hall moved to larger premises but the company could not survive the First World War and was declared bankrupt.

6000|$|While {{these are}} the general {{characteristics}} of Egyptian religion, there were inevitably many modifications {{in the course of}} five thousand years. If one might imagine a traveller endowed, like the Wandering Jew, with endless life, and visiting Egypt every thousand, or every five hundred years, we can fancy some of the changes in religion which he would observe. On the whole, from the first dynasty and the earliest monuments to the time when Hor came to wear a dress like that of a Roman centurion, the traveller would find the chief figures of the Pantheon recognisably the same. But there would be novelties in the manner of worshipping and of naming or representing them. [...] "In the oldest tombs, where the oldest writings are found, there are not many gods mentioned--there are Osiris, Horus, Thot, Seb, Nut, Hathor, Anubis, Apheru, and a couple more."* Here was a stock of gods who remained in credit till [...] "the dog Anubis" [...] fled from the Star of Bethlehem. Most of these deities bore birth-marks of the sky and of the tomb. If Osiris was [...] "the sun-god of Abydos," [...] he was also the murdered and mutilated culture-hero. If Hor or Horus was the sun at his height, he too had suffered despiteful usage from his enemies. Seb and <b>Nut</b> (<b>named</b> on the coffin of Mycerinus of the fourth dynasty in the British Museum) were our old friends the personal heaven and earth. Anubis, the jackal, was [...] "the lord of the grave," [...] and dead kings are worshipped no less than gods who were thought to have been dead kings. While certain gods, who retained permanent power, appear in the oldest monuments, sacred animals are also present from the first.|$|R

Shark decides to go to film school at UCLA and meets the sensitive and talented NEAL RIDGES, as well as sophisticated SIMONE GATANE. Shark moves into James Dean’s old house in the valley and he and Simone start hooking up {{as he makes his}} maiden film, [...] "PILLOW FUCK", a wry deconstruction of those insipid 1960s Rock Hudson/Doris Day romantic-comedies.

5000|$|The coco de mer palm has {{separate}} {{male and}} female trees, unlike the coconut palm. And, unlike the more familiar fruit of the coconut tree, the coco de mer fruit is not adapted to disperse naturally by floating on the ocean water. When a coco de mer fruit falls into the sea, it cannot float because of its great weight and density; instead it sinks to the bottom. However, after the fruit {{has been on the}} sea bed for a considerable period of time, the husk drops off, the internal parts of the nut decay, and the gases that form inside the nut cause the bare nut to rise up to the surface. At that time the nut can float, but is no longer fertile, thus when the ocean currents cause the nut to wash up on a distant beach, for example in the Maldives, a tree cannot, and does not, grow from the <b>nut.</b> The <b>name</b> coco de mer is French, and means [...] "coconut of the sea".|$|R
