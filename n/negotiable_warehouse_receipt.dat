50|$|Farmer {{self-help}} groups (SHGs) have designed business plans for post-harvest management {{and marketing of}} sorghum (Jowar). SHGs created awareness among member farmers about storage of their produce in the local warehouse. The sorghum commodity is graded by machine, and the groups are responsible for standardization in packaging. This small intervention adds value to the commodity, which eventually results in increased income for the farmer. When graded commodity is stored in the accredited warehouse, farmers become eligible {{to participate in the}} <b>Negotiable</b> <b>Warehouse</b> <b>Receipt</b> Scheme. Under this scheme, the farmer can take out a loan against their warehouse receipt, from nationalized Banks, for up to 70% valuation of their commodity. This helps farmers to avoid distress sales.|$|E

Reforms of agri-food policies typically occur without taking account of the structure of markets in which the policy reforms occur. It is usually assumed that markets are perfectly competitive, an assumption that is violated in the presence of parastatals. They often play multiple roles in meeting the objectives of government policy through their activities in procurement and distribution of food commodities. After presenting a general framework, we modify it to model the specifics of the Food Corporation of India and the functions that it fulfils in providing price support to farmers and food security to poor households. Keeping the government’s policy objectives unchanged, we then alter the functions that the FCI fulfils to be consistent with recommendations from the High Level Committee that recently investigated the role of the FCI. These recommendations included the substitution of <b>negotiable</b> <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipts</b> for the Minimum Support Price scheme for farmers, and the substitution of cash transfers in place of the Targeted Public Distribution System for poor households. We find that this re-instrumentation of the means of achieving policy objectives, together with a consequent greater role for the private sector, leads to substantial welfare gains as well as to greater food security when measured as food availability.

The concepts of the WRS system is based on <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipts</b> which can be used as collateral for accessing finance. The system is made more sophisticated by adopting measures such as grading of commodities according to their quality, rating warehouses according to their size, reputation and integrity etc. In India receipts issued by Central / State Warehouses are accepted as collateral by banks however those issued by private warehouses are not. Since farmers / traders will not deposit their goods with a <b>warehouse</b> whose <b>receipts</b> are not financed by banks viability of the private warehouse is at stake. Hence there is scope for expanding the warehousing infrastructure and also WRS system by making it mandatory for the banks to endorse private WRS...|$|R
40|$|Credit from stored grain Cue: Farmers {{are often}} {{forced to sell}} their crops when prices are low, because they need money quickly. One way to get better prices {{is known as the}} <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipt</b> system. Under this system, farmers are able to deposit their {{harvested}} maize in a warehouse and be given a receipt which states the amount {{and the quality of the}} grain they have stored. The farmer can then, if they wish, give this receipt to a bank in order to obtain a loan, enabling them to buy inputs for the new season or pay for other items. Later in the season when grain prices should have risen, the farmer can sell the stored maize, repay the loan and hopefully have some money left over. So in Zambia, a few years ago the Zambia Agricultural Commodity Agency tried to set up a <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipt</b> system. But it failed. So why did a system that sounded so good for commercial farmers not deliver better profits? To find out, Chris Kakunta spoke to Rob Munro, a marketing adviser for USAID, which helped to set up the pilot project. IN:	?Essentially it was a very donor-driven ? OUT:	?a commercial commodities market. ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Rob Munro of USAID in Zambia, on some of the challenges connected with the <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipt</b> system, in providing credit to smallholder farmers. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Munro	Essentially it was a very donor-driven entity, in that the commodity traders and the banks never really bought into the concept of <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipts.</b> Kakunta	And that led to it failing? Munro	Essentially yes. But I think one of the key problems here, and this will bring us on to lessons which we?ve learnt from that experience, is that a <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipt</b> system depends on the existence of a functioning, high volume commodities market. If you look at this year in particular, there is very little maize stored in warehouses. There is very little maize in total, from this particular harvest and there is no incentive for farmers to be depositing crop into a warehouse, looking for higher prices further into the year. Kakunta	If we have to really look at the system itself, does it really work? Munro	I think the answer to that is yes. It requires the presence of a very strong commodities market where there is plenty of supply, ample demand, multiple buyers and also, critically, a credible pricing system. Kakunta	What is the way forward in terms of <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipt</b> system here in Zambia? Munro	I think it?s important to realise that from a smallholder?s point of view, a <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipt</b> is not the answer to all his or her marketing problems. I think where the primary value of it lies is that by putting commodity into a secure storage at grades and standards in terms of quality and quantity which are recognised by the industry, that <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipt</b> becomes a very valuable trading tool. So I think that?s its primary use as a trading tool, allowing small, relatively small parcels of crop to be aggregated into a large parcel which is then accessible by commercial markets. Secondary to that is a financing option. And I think it?s important to realise that the cost of finance is very high. You need to be very sure, if you are looking for finance from a <b>warehouse</b> <b>receipt,</b> you need to be very sure that the gains in price which you are hoping to take advantage of later on in the season are significantly more than your costs of finance. There have been examples in Zambia, one in particular I?m thinking of, where a crop was deposited at the beginning of the marketing season, held onto until later on in the year, and by the time that crop was released from the warehouse it was actually worth less than the combination of its underlying price and the price of storage and finance. So it?s a risky? like any financing, like any market speculation, it?s a risky business. And therefore it?s not the answer for all smallholders. But I think, like I said, more importantly it?s a valuable tool for bringing your crop into a commercial commodities market. End of track.
