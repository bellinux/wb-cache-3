40|$|Like many {{countries}} around the world experiencing economic problems, Venezuela is suffering from structural reforms. These reforms affect all Government institutions, including the National Armed Force of Venezuela. The Venezuelan structural reforms are based on the restructuring of the public sector, the changing in social, economical and political laws, and the structuring of a new political system according to the new Bolivarian Venezuelan National Constitution The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the military contracting process for goods and services in Venezuela as well as to identify policies, procedures, and methodologies, contributing to the implementation of the respective contracting process. Once these indicators were identified, this thesis proposes a model procurement system as a more appropriate system in the new Venezuelan legal environment. The model procurement process is explained starting with the initial request for materiel through delivery to the end user.
