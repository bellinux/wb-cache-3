25|$|After departing, Donna's {{human mind}} becomes {{overwhelmed}} by the Time Lord knowledge and starts to deteriorate. To save her life, the Doctor is forced to wipe her mind against her wishes, and explains to her mother, Sylvia (Jacqueline King), and grandfather Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) that Donna must <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> him or anything that they did otherwise she will die. As the Doctor leaves, Wilfred promises that he {{will never forget the}} Doctor on his granddaughter's behalf.|$|E
25|$|Simpson now {{announced}} that his target {{would be a}} run a minute, an ordinary rate maybe in days gone, but a breakneck almost in the sixties, what with slow over-rates and so much accent on defence. Yet Australia, {{give or take a}} few minutes, achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E

50|$|The more Jessi {{thinks about}} her life, {{the more she}} realizes she likes strawberries, yet <b>never</b> <b>remembered</b> {{actually}} tasting them, liked Avril Lavigne, but <b>never</b> <b>remembers</b> hearing the artist. All of her memories seem to be facts more than actually experiences, which her older sister Emily describes {{as part of her}} illness. Though Jessi half-heartedly accepts this, she begins to question her sister and what her fixation is with the Tragers.|$|R

25|$|One Christmas was so {{much like}} another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant {{speaking}} of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, and my hands burned so, with {{the heat and the}} cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E

He takes a suggestion from Marge and sends Mr. Burns {{a box of chocolates}} with a family picture underneath the candy; however, Mr. Burns and Smithers are not interested in the one candy covering Homer's face and discard the box. As a result, Burns writes a [...] "thank you" [...] card only to Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, further angering Homer.|$|E
500|$|The {{play was}} first {{produced}} at the StJames's Theatre on Valentine's Day 1895. It was freezing cold but Wilde arrived dressed in [...] "florid sobriety", wearing a green carnation. The audience, {{according to one}} report, [...] "included {{many members of the}} great and good, former cabinet ministers and privy councillors, as well as actors, writers, academics, and enthusiasts". Allan Aynesworth, who played Algernon Moncrieff, recalled to Hesketh Pearson that [...] "In my fifty-three years of acting, I <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> a greater triumph than [...] first night". Aynesworth was himself [...] "debonair and stylish", and Alexander, who played Jack Worthing, [...] "demure".|$|E

500|$|The Popular Science Review {{began by}} writing that [...] "We <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> {{to have taken}} up a book which gave us more pleasure". It was quite unlike the dull journey logs of most travel books; it was [...] "a romance, which is, nevertheless, plain matter of fact". The review {{especially}} admires the way that Wallace [...] "has generalised on the facts" [...] rather than just shooting [...] "a multitude of birds" [...] and interminably describing them. The account notes that Wallace was the joint originator {{of the theory of}} natural selection, and summarises the discovery of the Wallace line in some detail. The review ends by placing the Malay Archipelago between Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology and Darwin's Origin of Species.|$|E
500|$|The play, now {{considered}} Wilde's masterpiece, was rapidly written in Wilde's artistic maturity in late 1894. It was first performed on 14 February 1895, at St James's Theatre in London, Wilde's second collaboration with George Alexander, the actor-manager. Both author and producer assiduously revised, prepared and rehearsed every line, scene and {{setting in the}} months before the premiere, creating a carefully constructed representation of late-Victorian society, yet simultaneously mocking it. During rehearsal Alexander requested that Wilde shorten the play from four acts to three, which the author did. Premieres at St James's seemed like [...] "brilliant parties", and the opening of The Importance of Being Earnest was no exception. Allan Aynesworth (who played Algernon) recalled to Hesketh Pearson, [...] "In my fifty-three years of acting, I <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> a greater triumph than [...] first night." [...] Earnest's immediate reception as Wilde's best work to date finally crystallised his fame into a solid artistic reputation. The Importance of Being Earnest remains his most popular play.|$|E

Nevertheless, throughout the journey he starts bonding with Sakura again as well as with his companions Fai D. Flowright, Kurogane and Mokona. He is voiced by Miyu Irino in Japanese, and by Jason Liebrecht in English.|$|E
2500|$|The film pokes fun at revolutionary {{groups and}} 1970s British left-wing politics. [...] "What the film does do is place modern {{stereotypes}} {{in a historical}} setting, which enables it to indulge {{in a number of}} sharp digs, particularly at trade unionists and guerilla organisations". The groups in the film all oppose the Roman occupation of Judea, but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears, to an outsider, to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible, thus portraying the phenomenon of the narcissism of small differences. Michael Palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on [...] "modern resistance groups, all with obscure acronyms which they can <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> and their conflicting agendas".|$|E
2500|$|The first {{prototype}} appeared {{early in}} 1918, {{but it was}} overweight and handled poorly. It was quickly rebuilt with much larger two-bay wings, which improved the handling, but the prototype's performance remained disappointing, not even matching that of the aircraft {{it was intended to}} replace. The poor performance was in part due to the Clerget engine's failure to provide the expected power, producing only 200hp (149kW) instead of the expected 260hp (194kW). [...] The second prototype was fitted with a 360hp (267kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine, becoming the Bulldog Mk.II, with the first prototype becoming the Bulldog Mk.I. [...] However, although the Dragonfly gave much more power than the Clerget, it was hopelessly unreliable, with one test pilot stating that [...] "... I <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> being able to get all cylinders to fire at the same time" [...] and [...] "I don't remember that we got a single successful performance with the engine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Hook {{comes to}} see Gold about the chaos {{going on around}} Storybrooke, and Gold says {{that as long as}} he has his heart, he is immune to the curse. As Gold prepares to pack up and leave town, he tells Hook to grab Henry and meet him and Belle at the town line, since he will not use his magic to bring Henry to him. When he reached New York City, Gold would make sure they would <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> any what {{happened}} in Storybrooke but explain that the town was destroyed. Hook heads to the Mayor’s office to see Henry and tells him to come with him. Henry, affected by the curse, calls Hook a dirty pirate and says he did not like him before and likes him less now that he’s with his mother, Emma, and asks him to leave. Hook uses the potion that Gold gave him to break the spell and he heads in, but Henry has spread marbles all around and Hook goes down, allowing Henry to flee for his safety. [...] Hook chases him but is confronted by Will, who initiates a fist-fight. Hook knocks out Will, but the delay allows Henry to escape.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could <b>never</b> <b>remember</b> ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E
