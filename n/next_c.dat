It is easier for very high coloratura sopranos to sing in this octave, but some people who are capable of singing in the bass range (like singers Adam Lopez or Nicola Sedda) can do it. While notes in the sixth octave, between soprano high C and C7, can have enough color to sound flutey or canary-like, the squeaky, whistly tones in the seventh octave help give the whistle register its name, as do the piercing qualities of notes in this octave.|$|E

Markers of obesity and type 2 diabetes were measured in C 57 Bl/ 6 J, Keap 1 -KD, Lepob/ob, and Lepob/ob-Keap 1 -KD mice. Lepob/ob-Keap 1 -KD mice exhibited less lipid accumulation, smaller adipocytes, decreased food intake, and reduced lipogenic gene expression. Enhanced Nrf 2 activity impaired insulin signaling, prolonged hyperglycemia in response to glucose challenge, and induced insulin resistance in Lepob/ob background.

The magnetic properties of these structures are highly dependent upon atomic level structural and compositional variations. Thus. structural characterization with extremely high spatial resolution, especially at the interfaces, is very important in order to optimize the performance of these devices with respect to processing and operating conditions. Field-ion microscopy and three-dimensional atom probe microanalysis have been used to characterize the interfaces and grain boundaries in a structure containing 100 repetitions of a (Cu- 2 (nm) /Co- 2 (nm)) bilayer. Analyses show layer alloying, a high degree of layer curvature (particularly close to grain boundaries) and regions where cobalt layers are in contact. In addition, atomic scale analysis of the interface bt tween copper and cobalt layers indicates that atomic planes are coherent from one layer to the <b>next.</b> (<b>C)</b> 1999 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) are conserved evolutionary {{components of}} the innate immune system that are being tested as alternatives to antibiotics. Slow release of AMPs using biodegradable polymers can be advantageous in maintaining high peptide levels for topical treatment, especially in the oral environment in which dosage retention is challenged by drug dilution with saliva flow and by drug inactivation by salivary enzymatic activity. Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant nosocomial pathogen and a persistent pathogen in root canal infections. In this study, four ultra-short lipopeptides (C 16 -KGGK, C 16 -KLLK, C 16 -KAAK and C 16 -KKK) and an amphipathic a-helical antimicrobial peptide (Amp- 1 D) were tested against E. faecalis.

40|$|The {{structures}} for the TRI mu P facility {{have been completed}} and commissioned. At the facility radioactive nuclides are produced to study fundamental interactions and symmetries. An important feature is the possibility to trap radioactive atoms {{in order to obtain}} and hold a pure substrate-free sample for precision measurements. In the TRI mu P facility a production target is followed by a magnetic separator, where radioactive isotopes are produced in inverse reaction kinematics. Separation up to 99. 95 % could be achieved for Na- 21. A novel transmitting thermal ionizing device was developed to stop the energetic isotopes. Some 50 % of stopped Na- 21 could be extracted and transported as low energy singly charged ions into a radio frequency quadrupole cooler and buncher with 35 % transmission efficiency. The ions are transported lossless via a drift tube and a low energy electrostatic beam line into the experimental setup. Such ions can be neutralized on hot metal foils and the resulting atoms can be stored in a magneto-optical trap. The functioning of that principle was demonstrated with stable Na extracted from the thermal ionizer, radioactive beams will follow <b>next.</b> (<b>c)</b> 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Synchronized, slowly growing (TD = 70 to 80 min) {{cultures}} {{were used}} to study several wall-associated parameters during the cell cycle: rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and cellular autolytic activity. The rate of peptidoglycan synthesis per cell declined {{during most of the}} period of chromosome replication (C), but increased during the latter part of C and into the period between chromosome termination and cell division (D). An increase in cellular septation was correlated with the increased rate of peptidoglycan synthesis. Cellular autolytic capacity increased during the early portion of C, reached a maximum late in C or early in D, and declined during D. Inhibition of DNA synthesis during C prevented the decline in autolytic capacity {{at the end of the}} cell cycle, caused a slight reduction in the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, delayed but did not prevent septation, and prevented the impending cell division by inhibiting cell separation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis during D did not prevent the increase in autolytic capacity during the <b>next</b> <b>C</b> phase, but, once again, prevented the decline at the end of the subsequent cycle. Thus, increased autolytic capacity at the beginning of the cell cycle did not seem to be related to chromosome initiation, whereas decreased autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle seemed to be related to chromosome termination. The data presented are consistent with the role of autolytic enzyme activity in the previously proposed model for cell division of S. faecium (G. D. Shockman et al., Ann. N. Y Acad.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis: Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) {{is produced in}} skeletal muscle, but its functional significance is unknown. We aimed to determine the signalling processes and metabolic actions of BDNF. Methods: We first examined whether exercise induced BDNF expression in humans. <b>Next,</b> <b>C</b> 2 C 12 skeletal muscle cells were electrically stimulated to mimic contraction. L 6 myotubes and isolated rat extensor digitorum longus muscles were treated with BDNF and phosphorylation of the proteins AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Thr 172) and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase ß (ACCß) (Ser 79) were analysed, as was fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Finally, we electroporated a Bdnf vector into the tibialis cranialis muscle of mice. Results: BDNF mRNA and protein expression were increased in human skeletal muscle after exercise, but muscle-derived BDNF appeared not to be released into the circulation. Bdnf mRNA and protein expression was increased in muscle cells that were electrically stimulated. BDNF increased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACCß and enhanced FAO both in vitro and ex vivo. The effect of BDNF on FAO was AMPK-dependent, since the increase in FAO was abrogated in cells infected with an AMPK dominant negative adenovirus or treated with Compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK. Electroporation of a Bdnf expression vector into the tibialis cranialis muscle resulted in increased BDNF protein production and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkBTyr 706 / 707) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (p 44 / 42 Thr 202 /Tyr 204) phosphorylation in these muscles. In addition, phosphorylation of ACCß was markedly elevated in the Bdnf electroporated muscles. Conclusions/ interpretation: These data identify BDNF as a contraction-inducible protein in skeletal muscle {{that is capable of}} enhancing lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle via activation of AMPK...|$|E
