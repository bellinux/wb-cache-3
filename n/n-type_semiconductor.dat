5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
25|$|A {{point-contact}} diode works {{the same as}} the junction diodes described below, but its construction is simpler. A pointed metal wire is placed in contact with an <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Some metal migrates into the semiconductor to make a small p-type region around the contact. The 1N34 germanium version is still used in radio receivers as a detector and occasionally in specialized analog electronics.|$|E
25|$|A p–n {{junction}} diode {{is made of}} a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor,</b> and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E
25|$|In trace amounts, {{phosphorus}} {{is used as}} a dopant for <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The more {{abundant}} charge carriers are called majority carriers, which are {{primarily responsible for}} current transport {{in a piece of}} <b>semiconductor.</b> In <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> they are electrons, while in p-type semiconductors they are holes. The less abundant charge carriers are called minority carriers; in <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductors</b> they are holes, while in p-type semiconductors they are electrons.|$|R
50|$|Sulfur or {{tellurium}} {{are used}} as dopants to produce <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductors.</b> Zinc {{is used as a}} dopant for the p-type semiconductor.|$|R
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor.</b> Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{channel of}} a FET is doped to produce either an <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> or a p-type semiconductor. The drain and source may be doped of {{opposite}} type to the channel, {{in the case}} of enhancement mode FETs, or doped of similar type to the channel as in depletion mode FETs. Field-effect transistors are also distinguished by the method of insulation between channel and gate. Types of FETs include: ...|$|E
2500|$|When a {{bias voltage}} [...] is applied across the {{interface}} of an <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> and a metal, the Fermi {{level in the}} semiconductor is shifted {{with respect to the}} metal's and the band bending decreases. [...] In effect, the capacitance across the depletion layer in the semiconductor is bias voltage dependent and goes as [...] [...] This makes the metal/semiconductor junction useful in varactor devices used frequently in electronics.|$|E

2500|$|... forms a {{brownish}} solid with {{an optical}} absorption threshold at ≈1.6eV. It is an <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> {{with a low}} activation energy of 0.1–0.3eV; this conductivity is attributed to intrinsic or oxygen-related defects. Fcc C60 contains voids at its octahedral and tetrahedral sites which are sufficient large (0.6 and 0.2nm respectively) to accommodate impurity atoms. When alkali metals are doped into these voids, C60 converts from a semiconductor into a conductor or even superconductor.|$|E
2500|$|Many NTC {{thermistors}} {{are made}} from a pressed disc, rod, plate, bead or cast chip of semiconducting material such as sintered metal oxides. [...] They work because raising the temperature of a semiconductor increases the number of active charge carriers - it promotes them into the conduction band. The more charge carriers that are available, the more current a material can conduct. In certain materials like ferric oxide (Fe2O3) with titanium (Ti) doping an <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor</b> is formed and the charge carriers are electrons. In materials such as nickel oxide (NiO) with lithium (Li) doping a p-type semiconductor is created where holes are the charge carriers.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{traditional}} solid-state semiconductor, a solar cell {{is made from}} two doped crystals, one doped with n-type impurities (<b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductor),</b> which add additional free conduction band electrons, and the other doped with p-type impurities (p-type semiconductor), which add additional electron holes. When placed in contact, some of the electrons in the n-type portion flow into the p-type to [...] "fill in" [...] the missing electrons, also known as electron holes. Eventually enough electrons will flow across the boundary to equalize the Fermi levels of the two materials. The result is a region at the interface, the p-n junction, where charge carriers are depleted and/or accumulated {{on each side of}} the interface. In silicon, this transfer of electrons produces a potential barrier of about 0.6 to 0.7 V.|$|E
5000|$|In ATEGs, {{thermoelectric}} {{materials are}} packed between the hot-side and the cold-side heat exchangers. The thermoelectric materials {{are made up}} of p-type and <b>n-type</b> <b>semiconductors,</b> while the heat exchangers are metal plates with high thermal conductivity.|$|R
