40|$|A {{total of}} 190 holoepiphytic and 5 hemiepiphytic {{vascular}} plant species {{were collected from}} the canopy and the trunk of an emergent Ficus L. species host that is common to a Peruvian cloud forest. One hundred and fourteen of the vascular epiphyte species were orchids. A large majority of the vascular species were rare in occurrence. Vascular epiphyte diversity and density was highest in the outer canopy zone of the host crown. In the inner canopy zone there was a dearth of epiphytes, attributed to {{a high rate of}} epiphyte slumping on the smooth-barked branches. The trunk had a different suit of species to those found in the canopy. During the wet season, the thickening of epiphytic matter in the outer canopy zone appeared to contribute to a large amelioration of daytime and <b>nocturnal</b> <b>temperatures</b> through evaporation and heat retention respectively. <b>Nocturnal</b> <b>temperatures</b> were highest in the outer canopy zone, and were lowest on the forest floor. The latter was attributed to the downward flow of the product of radiative cooling {{as a result of the}} heterogeneous canopy on the steep slope. Epiphyte clumps appear to slump before competition causes the loss of early successional species. Some species showed a preference for more shaded epiphyte clumps and many were more frequent on smaller branch diameters. Most species showed a moderately high niche overlap with a large number of other species, which suggested a high degree of species coexistence. Epiphyte slumping is suggested to be the major driving mechanism for the maintenance of non-equilibrium in the community. Aspects of the phenologies of epiphytes, age-structure of the community and high environmental variation could be other mechanisms for the maintenance of a high degree of species coexistence...|$|R

40|$|A sudden {{increase}} in temperature during the nighttime hours accompanies the passages of some cold fronts. In some cold front–associated warming events, the temperature can rise {{by as much}} as 108 C and can last from a few minutes to several hours. Previous studies suggest that these events are due to the downward transport of warmer air by the strong and gusty winds associated with the cold-frontal passages. In this study, a cli-matology of nocturnal warming events associated with cold fronts was created using 6 yr of Oklahoma Mesonetwork (Mesonet) data from 2003 to 2008. Nocturnal warming events associated with cold-frontal passages occurred surprisingly frequently across Oklahoma. Of the cold fronts observed in this study, 91. 5 % produced at least one warming event at an OklahomaMesonet station. The winter months accounted for the most events (37. 9 %), and the summer months accounted for the fewest (3. 8 %). When normalized by the monthly number of cold-frontal passages, the wintermonths still had themost number of warming events. The number of warming events increased rapidly from 2300 to 0200 UTC; thereafter, the number of events gradually decreased. A spatial analysis revealed that the frequency of warming events decreased markedly from west to east across the state. In contrast, the average magnitude of the warming increased from west to east. In contrast to control periods (associated with cold-frontal passages without nocturnal warming events), warming events were associated with weaker initial winds and stronger initial temperature inversions. Moreover, the <b>nocturnal</b> <b>temperature</b> inversion weakened more during warming events than during control periods and the surface wind speeds increased more during warming events than during control periods.

If blow flies oviposit during nocturnal hours, there could possibly be up to 12 -hour discrepancies for estimates of PMI. Two blow fly species, Phaenicia eximia (Wiedemann) and Cochliomyia macellaria (F.), oviposited nocturnally on ground beef baits in 2003, during the onset of low-atmospheric pressure (an air mass with lower atmospheric pressure {{than that of the}} air surrounding it) at rural study sites near Snook (Burleson County), Texas, under artificial lighting of at least 1500 footcandles when temperatures were at 26 ?C or higher. Trials conducted under similar conditions during the same year without a low-pressure system moving into the area resulted in no nocturnal blow fly oviposition. Nocturnal blow fly oviposition went undetected once low-atmospheric pressure systems settled into the study area, irrespective of temperature and lighting conditions. Thus, this study illustrates that there is a connection between the onset of low-atmospheric pressure and nocturnal blow fly oviposition on baits under artificial lighting of 1500 footcandles or more when temperatures are 26 ?C or above. After concluding 2003 experiments, statistical analyses supplied evidence that woodland habitat was more favorable for blow fly oviposition than prairieland habitat throughout the 2003 study, irrespective of species or time of year.
