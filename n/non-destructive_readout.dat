In 1955 Bell Telephone Laboratories was experimenting with ferroelectric-crystal memories.Development of FeRAM {{began in the}} late 1980s. Work was done in 1991 at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on improving methods of read out, including a novel method of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>readout</b> using pulses of UV radiation. Much of the current FeRAM technology was developed by Ramtron, a fabless semiconductor company. One major licensee is Fujitsu, who operates what is probably the largest semiconductor foundry production line with FeRAM capability. Since 1999 they have been using this line to produce standalone FeRAMs, as well as specialized chips (e.g. chips for smart cards) with embedded FeRAMs. Fujitsu produced devices for Ramtron until 2010. Since 2010 Ramtron's fabricators have been TI (Texas Instruments) and IBM. Since at least 2001 Texas Instruments has collaborated with Ramtron to develop FeRAM test chips in a modified 130 nm process. In the fall of 2005, Ramtron reported that they were evaluating prototype samples of an 8-megabit FeRAM manufactured using Texas Instruments' FeRAM process. Fujitsu and Seiko-Epson were in 2005 collaborating {{in the development of a}} 180 nm FeRAM process. In 2012 Ramtron was acquired by Cypress Semiconductor.FeRAM research projects have also been reported at Samsung, Matsushita, Oki, Toshiba, Infineon, Hynix, Symetrix, Cambridge University, University of Toronto, and the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC, Belgium).|$|E

In the DRO FRAM device, reading operation is carried out destructively i. e. reversing the original polarization state, and reading the switching current. Therefore, reset procedures are required to restore the switched polarization state to the original position. On the other hand, the NDRO FRAM devices read the stored data by sensing the modulation of the surface conductivity of the silicon rather than switching the polarization state. This reading method provides a privilege of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>readout</b> and eliminates the reset procedure. The NDR...|$|E

40|$|Multiferroic materials, {{in which}} {{ferroelectric}} and magnetic ordering coexist, are of fundamental {{interest for the}} development of novel memory devices that allow for electrical writing and <b>non-destructive</b> magnetic <b>readout</b> operation. The great challenge is to create room temperature multiferroic materials with strongly coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) orderings. BiFeO 3 has been the most heavily investigated single-phase multiferroic to date due to the coexistence of its magnetic order and ferroelectric order at room temperature. However, there is no net magnetic moment in the cycloidal (antiferromagnetic-like) magnetic state of bulk BiFeO 3, which severely limits its realistic applications in electric field controlled spintronic devices. Here, we predict that double perovskite Zn 2 FeOsO 6 is a new multiferroic with properties superior to BiFeO 3. First, there are strong ferroelectricity and strong ferrimagnetism at room temperature in Zn 2 FeOsO 6. Second, the easy-plane of the spontaneous magnetization can be switched by an external electric field, evidencing the strong magnetoelectric coupling existing in this system. Our results suggest that ferrimagnetic 3 d- 5 d double perovskite may therefore be used to achieve voltage control of magnetism in future spintronic devices...|$|R

This reporter, dJUN-FRET, {{was composed of}} monomeric CFP (mCFP) and monomeric YFP (mYFP) flanking a JNK substrate sequence tethered by a flexible linker to a FHA 2 phosphothreonine-binding domain from the yeast checkpoint protein Rad 53 p. Phosphorylation of the substrate sequence triggers an intramolecular clamp with the FHA 2 module causing a conformational change that alters the amount of FRET from CFP to YFP. Thus dJUN-FRET provides continuous <b>non-destructive</b> fluorometric <b>readout</b> for JNK activity. In designing these constructs, we used FHA 2 as it is monomeric and has a modest affinity for phospho-threonine making the sensor reversible and thereby enabling monitoring of the ongoing balance between kinases and phosphatases.

40|$|The {{parametric}} phase-locked oscillator (PPLO), {{also known}} as a parametron, is a resonant circuit in which one of the reactances is periodically modulated. It can detect, amplify, and store binary digital signals in the form of two distinct phases of self-oscillation. Indeed, digital computers using PPLOs based on a magnetic ferrite ring or a varactor diode as its fundamental logic element were successfully operated in 1950 s and 1960 s. More recently, basic bit operations have been demonstrated in an electromechanical resonator, and an Ising machine based on optical PPLOs has been proposed. Here, using a PPLO realized with Josephson-junction circuitry, we demonstrate the demodulation of a microwave signal digitally modulated by binary phase-shift keying. Moreover, we apply this demodulation capability to the dispersive readout of a superconducting qubit.

Although wavelength, polarization and spatial dimensions have all been exploited for multiplexing, these approaches have never been integrated into a single technique that could ultimately increase the information capacity by orders of magnitude.

The processor implements therefore all basic building blocks of a universal two-qubit quantum processor. Using it, we implement the universal square root of iSWAP two-qubit gate, characterizing the gate operation by quantum process tomography and obtaining a gate fidelity of 90 %. We use this gate to create entangled two-qubit Bell states and perform a test of the CHSH Bell inequality, observing a violation of the classical boundary by 22 standard eviations after correcting for readout errors. Using the implemented two-qubit gate, we run the so-called Grover search algorithm: For two-qubits, this algorithm finds among four elements { 00, 01, 10, 11 } the one element y that solves a search problem encoded by a function f for which f(y) = 1 and f(x != y) = 0. Our implementation retrieves the correct answer to the search problem after a single evaluation of the search function f(x), with a success probability between 52 % and 67 %, therefore outperforming classical algorithms that are bound to a success probability of 25 %. This constitutes therefore a proof-of-concept of the quantum speed-up for superconducting quantum processors. Finally, we propose a scalable architecture for a superconducting quantum processor that can potentially overcome the scalability issues faced by today's superconducting qubit architectures...|$|R

Using a semiconductor electrode has been proven effective to enhance the tunnelling electroresistance in ferroelectric tunnel junctions. Here we report a systematic investigation on electroresistance of Pt/BaTiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 metal/ferroelectric/semiconductor tunnel junctions by engineering the Schottky barrier on Nb:SrTiO 3 surface via varying BaTiO 3 thickness and Nb doping concentration. The optimum ON/OFF ratio as great as 6. 0 x 10 (6), {{comparable to that of}} commercial Flash memories, is achieved in a device with 0. 1 wt% Nb concentration and a 4 -unit-cell-thick BaTiO 3 barrier. With this thinnest BaTiO 3 barrier, which shows a negligible resistance to the tunnelling current but is still ferroelectric, the device is reduced to a polarization-modulated metal/semiconductor Schottky junction that exhibits a more efficient control on the tunnelling resistance to produce the giant electroresistance observed. These results may facilitate the design of high performance non-volatile resistive memories.

A {{multiple}} format telemetry {{system is}} described which is {{flexible enough to}} be adaptable to many applications. The system incorporates a flexible programmer that utilizes a <b>non-destructive</b> <b>readout</b> memory which operates in conjunction with an external index counter. Subcommutator addresses stored in memory are addressed partially by the index counter and partially by the format instruction. Multiple formats can be generated, limited only by the requirement that the sampling rates in a given format be binary multiples of the slowest sampling rate in that format. The advantage of this programmer lies in the flexibility accommodated, typically, {{with one or two}} read-only memory cycles. The remote acquisition units used in the system are flexible in that they can be configured to provide various combinations of low-level, high-level, and bi-level inputs. These units are designed primarily from two large scale integrated (LSI) metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) building blocks. One LSI circuit is a sequential multiplexer, which also functions as an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter; the other circuit is a 16 - channel random access multiplexer...|$|E
