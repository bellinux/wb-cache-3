5|$|The {{three species}} {{described}} by Peck were distinguished {{on the basis}} of physical features that were later found to be somewhat overlapping. In terms of microscopic characters, spore sizes were <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> different between them to be used as discriminating taxonomic characters. Subsequent investigators of North American mushroom flora had difficulties in interpreting Peck's concepts of these three taxa and in confirming their presence in their regional investigations. For example, McIlvaine (1902), Hard (1908), and McDougall (1925) reported (as variety or species) only C.ebulbosus. Bisby (1938), Christensen (1946), Smith (1958), and Groves (1962) mentioned only C.quadrifidus. Both Kauffman (1918) and Graham (1944) described C.ebulbosus and C.quadrifidus; Graham, however, only included C.quadrifidus in his key to his descriptions of Coprinus species. In 1979, W.Patrick published a comparative analysis of the three taxa from material collected by Peck, and, after concluding that the three were <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> distinct to be considered separate species, reduced them to synonymy with Coprinopsis variegata, the earliest name.|$|E
5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|All {{those with}} a risk of {{exposure}} to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already.

In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among {{those with a}} normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.|$|E

5|$|Bank Street, {{known for}} a time as Bank Lane, was a {{multi-purpose}} stadium in Clayton, Manchester, England. It was mostly used for football matches and was the second home ground of Manchester United Football Club (then known as Newton Heath Football Club), after North Road, which they left in 1893. The stadium had a capacity of around 50,000, but the club moved to Old Trafford in 1910 because club owner John Henry Davies believed he could <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> expand the ground.|$|E
5|$|Before {{becoming}} a draper, Pick's father {{had had an}} ambition to become a lawyer and he encouraged his son to follow this career. Pick attended St Peter's School in York on a scholarship, but failed to get a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford. Instead, he was articled to a York solicitor, George Crombie, in March 1897. He qualified in January 1902 and completed a law degree at the University of London in the same year, but he was <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> interested in a legal career to apply to practice.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain and {{the entire}} {{subsequent}} government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> prepared. Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that it was merely constraining itself, but that strategy is a mistake. It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E

5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have no symptoms. Signs and symptoms alone are <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Despite this setback, Longton and Stoke {{submitted}} {{their proposal}} to the Local Government Board in early 1907. A local inquiry was held soon afterwards in Stoke, which reported back quickly and in April 1907 informed both Stoke and Longton councils that the proposed scheme was <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> comprehensive and suggested holding another conference between the six towns to discuss a more complete proposal. The meeting took place in July and was addressed by John Burns, president of the Local Government Board, who called {{for a number of}} local conferences to agree a scheme for federation of all six towns.|$|E

When he proposed to Ellqvist, Bauer did so without the approval of his parents, who thought that he should be more established in a career and self-supporting before marriage.|$|E

5|$|Harper's {{relationship}} with Manning became strained in 1992, because of conflicting strategies over the Charlottetown Accord. Harper opposed the Accord on principle for ideological reasons, while Manning was initially {{more open to}} compromise. Harper also criticized Manning's decision to hire Rick Anderson as an adviser, believing that Anderson was <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> committed to the Reform Party's principles. He resigned as policy chief in October 1992.|$|E
5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, {{water and electricity}} infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused of}} corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues, and suggested that he had <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E
5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E

5|$|The total {{populations of}} the bohor reedbuck are {{estimated}} to be above 100,000. Though the populations are decreasing, it is <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> low to meet the Near Threatened criterion. Thus, the IUCN rates the bohor reedbuck as of Least Concern. Around three-fourth of the populations survive in protected areas. Populations of the reedbuck are either declining or uncertain in Boucle du BaoulÃ© National Park (Mali); ComoÃ© National Park (Ivory Coast); Mole and Digya National Parks (Ghana). Numbers in the Akagera National Park, where its last-known populations in Rwanda exist, have seen a steep fall.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{construction}} {{used for the}} water channels. Clay channels date from the Middle Preclassic while stone-lined channels date from the Late Preclassic through to the Classic, with stone-lined channels from the Late Classic being the largest channels built at the site. It is presumed that the clay channels were <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> effective, thus leading to the switch in construction materials and the implementation of stone-lined channels. In the Late Classic pieces of broken stone monuments were reused {{in the construction of}} the water channels.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{definitely}} {{prove to}} the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour. However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at {{the order of the}} High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch. The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was <b>not</b> <b>sufficiently</b> conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt.|$|E
