As a prodigy member of the clans's factions specializing in forging anti-demon equipment and in combating the evil yokai spirits, Taki became a very serious and stern fighter, regarded as most skilled in the entire clan, {{as well as an}} accomplished spy and blacksmith, known for not showing her personal feelings and carrying out her mission cool-headed and being able of making ruthless decisions.

2500|$|Lloyd kept {{copyright}} {{control of}} most of his films and re-released them infrequently after his retirement. Lloyd did not grant cinematic release because most theaters could not accommodate an organist, and Lloyd did not wish his work {{to be accompanied by}} a pianist: [...] "I just don't like pictures played with pianos. We never intended them to be played with pianos." [...] Similarly, his features were never shown on television as Lloyd's price was high: [...] "I want $300,000 per picture for two showings. That's a high price, but if I don't get it, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it. They've come close to it, but they haven't come all the way up". As a consequence, his reputation and public recognition suffered in comparison with Chaplin and Keaton, whose work has generally been more available. Lloyd's film character was so intimately associated with the 1920s era that attempts at revivals in 1940s and 1950s were poorly received, when audiences viewed the 1920s (and silent film in particular) as old-fashioned.|$|E

50|$|Home Alive {{was created}} to {{demonstrate}} a sense of political activism, <b>not</b> just about <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shows</b> and creating music. The bands supported each other and demonstrate a sense of collaboration and support {{through the use of}} music.|$|R
5000|$|Although Paramount did say {{publicly}} {{that the show}} was not in imminent danger of cancellation, Hall announced on April 18, 1994, that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue the <b>show,</b> simply saying [...] "it's time". The final episode aired on May 27, 1994.|$|R

60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} Dick's heart beat loudly {{as he took}} his seat in the flying machine. It {{was one thing to}} talk about going up and quite another to really fly. He {{realized}} the danger far more than did merry-hearted Tom, or even Sam. But he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the white feather.|$|E

5000|$|Brook says Levy did not {{understand}} the script but [...] "was convinced that if Brook, Moreau and Duras saw something in it, something must be there." [...] Levy decided not <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the script <b>to</b> potential financiers. Instead he went to them and said, [...] "Look here, you turned down The 400 Blows because you couldn't understand the script, you turned down Hiroshima Mon Amor; well, I can't make head nor tail of this script and what's more I'm <b>not</b> even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it <b>to</b> you - but I want 30 million francs."

6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] said Mrs. Lapham, deeply pleased inwardly, but <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> it, as {{she would}} have said. [...] "I guess you want to build there yourself." [...] She insensibly got a little nearer to her husband. They liked {{to talk to each}} other in that blunt way; it is the New England way of expressing perfect {{confidence}} and tenderness.|$|E
50|$|Initially, King was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do the <b>show</b> {{as he did}} {{not know}} who Vaughan was. He did not realize that Vaughan was {{actually}} 'little Stevie', the 'skinny kid' that he let sit in when King played in Texas. King talks about this on one of the conversation tracks.

Neil Campbell, who was Highland Scotch and lived down at Berwick, was courting Nancy Sherman, too; and, what was far worse, Nancy's father favoured him, because he was a richer man than Donald Fraser. But Donald was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> all he thought--Scotch people never do--and he pretended to be very glad to see Neil and made him heartily welcome.|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} one day that, {{being to}} go to Versailles to wait upon the Prince of ----, he came up into my chamber in the morning, and laid out his jewel-case, because he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> any jewels, but to get a foreign bill accepted, which he had received from Amsterdam; so, when {{he gave me the}} case, he said, [...] "My dear, I think I need not carry this with me, because it may be I may not come back till night, and it is too much to venture." [...] I returned, [...] "Then, my dear, you shan't go." [...] "Why?" [...] says he.

6000|$|... "Well, I {{heard as}} I went along that {{elephants}} were very plentiful {{in the dense}} forests which lie upon the slopes and {{at the foot of}} the mountains that border Wambe's territory. Also I heard a very ill report of that worthy himself, who lived in a kraal upon the side of the mountain, which was so strongly fortified as to be practically impregnable. It was said that he was the most cruel chief in this part of Africa, and that he had murdered in cold blood an entire party of English gentlemen, who, some seven years before, had gone into his country to hunt elephants. They took an old friend of mine with them as guide, John Every by name, and often had I mourned over his untimely death. All the same, Wambe or no Wambe, I determined to hunt elephants in his country. I never was afraid of natives, and I was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the white feather now. I am a bit of a fatalist, as you fellows know, so I came to the conclusion that if it was fated that Wambe should send me to join my old friend John Every, I should have to go, and there was an end of it. Meanwhile, I meant to hunt elephants with a peaceful heart.|$|E
60|$|Somerset {{retired to}} the {{chambers}} of antique lumber, {{keeping an eye}} upon the windows {{to see if she}} re-entered the carriage and resumed her journey to Markton. But when the horses had been standing a long time the carriage was driven round to the stables. Then she was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the vegetable <b>show.</b> That was rather curious, seeing that she had only come back for something forgotten.|$|R
5000|$|When I {{started the}} show I said, [...] "If it gets {{me away from}} my actual skateboarding fans and gets me away from skateboarding, then I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do the <b>show</b> anymore." [...] That's why our third season was only six episodes; we cut it in half. I was, like, [...] "I can't do it anymore! It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be more {{detrimental}} to my career than positive." [...] We just quit. We stopped it.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the series, Bill Mustos, founder of co-production company Avamar Entertainment, commented that [...] "you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see a <b>show</b> that is {{screaming}} 'Canada.' It's a show in a big sophisticated urban city where crises take place. The stories we're trying to tell are universal stories." [...] CTV's press release regarding the series did identify Toronto and noted that the SRU is based on Toronto's Emergency Task Force.|$|R
6000|$|The second son, {{stepping}} into his shoes, {{was such an}} improvement {{that it was impossible}} there should be much simulation of mourning. You have seen him, you know what he is; there is very little mystery about him. As I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> this composition to you, there is no harm in my writing here that he is--or at any rate he was--a remarkably attractive man. I don't say this because he made love to me, but precisely because he did n't. He was always in love with some one else,--generally with Lady Vandeleur. You may say that in England that usually does n't prevent; but Mr. Tester, though he had almost no intermissions, did n't, as a general thing, have duplicates. He was not provided with a second loved object, [...] "under-studying," [...] as they say, the part. It was his practice to keep me accurately informed of the state of his affections,--a matter about which he was never in the least vague. When he was in love he knew it and rejoiced in it, and when by a miracle he was not he greatly regretted it. He expatiated to me on the charms of other persons, and this interested me much more than if he had attempted to direct the conversation to my own, as regards which I had no illusions. He has told me some singular things, and I think I may say that for a considerable period my most valued knowledge of English society was extracted from this genial youth. I suppose he usually found me a woman of good counsel, for certain it is that he has appealed to me for the light of wisdom in very extraordinary predicaments. In his earlier years he was perpetually in hot water; he tumbled into scrapes as children tumble into puddles. He invited them, he invented them; and when he came to tell you how his trouble had come about (and he always told the whole truth), it was difficult to believe that a man should have been so idiotic.|$|E

5000|$|Braun {{is known}} for outspoken and flippant remarks in defense of his clients, such as calling the heavy boot an officer wore while kicking King a [...] "ballet slipper." [...] "Any {{high-profile}} client {{is going to be}} tried in the press," [...] Braun says. [...] "You can only neutralize the prosecution in the press. To say you're not going to try it in the press is like saying you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> up the first day of trial, because the trial starts the first day the prosecution starts leaking evidence." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bowie, who was 55 at {{the time}} of the record's release, said, [...] "I'm pretty much a realist. There's a certain age you get to when you're <b>not</b> really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shown</b> TV anymore. The young have to kill the old. ... That's how life works. ... It's how culture works." [...] For this reason there were no music videos {{released}} for any of the songs from this album.|$|R
50|$|While none of {{the shorts}} {{included}} on the discs {{are part of the}} Censored Eleven, many of the cartoons that were included were routinely censored on television, but were included uncut on DVD. Furthermore, each DVD from the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 opens with a foreword by Whoopi Goldberg, where she warns the audience about some of these shorts, stating that although the behavior was and is not acceptable, the cartoons depicting this are a vital part of history and should not be forgotten. The Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4 collection includes a similar disclaimer, written on a gold card and merely summarized the point that while the cartoons are considered offensive today for what they depict, they are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>shown</b> censored because editing out the racist depictions—and therefore effectively denying that the racism of the era ever happened—is worse than actually showing them.|$|R
500|$|Small {{knew before}} writing the episode {{that it would}} be the last. Mike Lazzo, {{executive}} vice president of Adult Swim, had never [...] "responded to the show" [...] as Small had noted, which was in stark contrast to Vice President of Original Series Khaki Jones, whose enthusiasm over the series was what Small admitted to keeping it alive. During the production run for the fourth season, Lazzo had informed the crew bluntly that the season would conclude the series, explaining, [...] "No matter what the numbers are, no matter what happens – we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bring the <b>show</b> back." ...|$|R

[...] "This {{is a collection of}} the kinds of things that's happening in my head, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> any remorse for putting all these genres together and just really hurting the world.

[...] "We all turned up as 10-year-olds, and they said: 'Right, boys and girls, we've got a special surprise for you—we're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> you a film!' So everyone was: 'Booooo.' 'No. we've got a special surprise—we have Sandie Shaw!' And Sandie Shaw came on, {{and she was going}} on about not having any shoes.

Universal Creative's Thierry Coup was the Creative Director of the ride, having worked on previous Universal attractions including Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, and Shrek 4-D. Michael Bay, director of the Transformers film franchise, collaborated with Universal Creative on the ride, despite an earlier blog post that suggested otherwise: [...] "I don't support it yet – I'm not involved and [...] not sure the story of the ride works, and I know Optimus is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> just <b>show</b> up <b>to</b> be directed by some new people that have never worked with him," [...] he wrote. Bay's involvement in the attraction's development was revealed by Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative, in an NBC documentary on Islands of Adventure's Wizarding World of Harry Potter.

5000|$|The {{cast and}} crew were very {{emotional}} during filming, as they were concerned {{that this might be}} the last episode ever filmed and the series cancelled if the strike was a lengthy one. Olmos helped to work up the cast's emotions for the shoot by telling everyone that the show was ending. According to co-writer Weddle, Olmos repeatedly told the cast, [...] "This is the end, I think we all feel that. They're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bring the <b>show</b> back.

A few weeks later, Godfrey {{announced that he had}} seen numerous cuts of the film and called it [...] "incredibly powerful already. ...It definitely captures what the book captures." [...] Concerning the subject of the MPAA rating, Godfrey {{said that the}} studio does not [...] "have any word yet on the rating", but insisted that it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be rated PG-13.
