5|$|The {{novel was}} {{initially}} published as a serial in Kwee's magazine Panorama; {{it proved to}} be his most popular work. By 1930 there had been a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> adaptations, not all of which were authorised, leading Kwee to ask readers to help him enforce his copyright. The work was filmed in 1931 by The Teng Chun and then in 1975 by Fred Young and Rempo Urip. Though not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon, the book ranks amongst the most reprinted works of Chinese Malay literature. It has been translated into Dutch and English.|$|E

30|$|There is {{a strong}} {{relationship}} between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> a voltage multiplier and its sensitivity and efficiency. As the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> increase, there is more loss across each added stage. However, the tradeoff is higher voltage multiplication and small threshold voltage at the first stage. On the other hand, a voltage multiplier with a few stages has less voltage drop between its stages but requires higher threshold voltage for all stages to work simultaneously. For this reason, a voltage multiplier becomes more sensitive when a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> are present and becomes more efficient at fewer stages. This tradeoff feature was analyzed in several researches [53, 58]. Therefore, the optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> should be considered depending upon the application targets.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the fundamental parameters of non-ideal phase flow and the extraction parameters on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> equilibrium <b>stages</b> - ND, theoretical stages - NT, {{as well as the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> (ND - NT), the existence of which is a consequence of the backflow in extractors, was investigated. The calculated <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> (ND - NT) served as a measure of the {{influence of}} the denoted parameters on the extraction efficiency. The results of the investigation indicate that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> (ND - NT) considerably increased with increasing backmixing coefficients and that the dependence was linear. It was established that the increase of the ratio of the flow rate of the heavy and light phase and the decrease of the equilibrium distribution coefficient, as well as the increase of the total separation factor, led to an exponential increase <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> in the extractor, which consequently caused a decrease in the extraction efficiency...|$|R

He became obsessed with getting to know her. She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial status.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a new simulation-based technique for the optimum {{design of a}} multi-stage forging process aiming at reduction <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> press-forming <b>stages.</b> This iterative design technique involves response-surface-based numerical optimization and a finite element analysis of the process. The design procedure starts with an initial process design that is deemed too conservative, i. e. allows {{to arrive at the}} desired product but involves an excessive <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages.</b> To obtain a better process design, one <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the existing multistage process is eliminated using numerical optimization in conjunction with an FE simulation. This is repeated by reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> one by one until the minimum possible <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stages</b> is reached. This design technique is applied to <b>stage</b> reduction <b>of</b> a three-stage forging process of an axisymmetric aluminum billet. It is confirmed that a new two-stage process design is obtained successfully and the developed design optimization technique showed its effectiveness in reduction <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> press-forming <b>stages</b> in a multi-stage forming process...|$|R

[...] The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010.

2500|$|The kabuki stage {{features}} a projection called a hanamichi ( [...] , [...] "flower path"), a walkway which extends {{into the audience}} and via which dramatic entrances and exits are made. Okuni also performed on a hanamichi stage with her entourage. The stage is used {{not only as a}} walkway or path to get to and from the main stage, but important scenes are also played on the stage. Kabuki stages and theaters have steadily become more technologically sophisticated, and innovations including revolving stages and trap doors were introduced during the 18th century. A driving force has been the desire to manifest one frequent theme of kabuki theater, that of the sudden, dramatic revelation or transformation. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> tricks, including actors' rapid appearance and disappearance, employ these innovations. The term keren (...) , often translated playing to the gallery, is sometimes used as a catch-all for these tricks. Hanamichi and several innovations including revolving stage, seri and chunori have all contributed to kabuki play. Hanamichi creates depth and both seri and chunori provide a vertical dimension.|$|E
2500|$|The second Blackfriars was {{an indoor}} theatre built {{elsewhere}} on the property at the instigation of James Burbage, father of Richard Burbage, and impresario of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. [...] In 1596, Burbage purchased, for £600, the frater of the former priory and rooms below. This large space, perhaps [...] long and 50 wide (15 metres), with high ceilings allowed Burbage to construct two galleries, substantially increasing potential attendance. The nature of Burbage's modifications to his purchase is not clear, and the many contemporary references to the theatre do not offer a precise picture of its design. Once fitted for playing, the space may have been about [...] long and [...] wide (20 by 14 metres), including tiring areas. There were at least two and possibly three galleries, and perhaps a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> boxes adjacent to the stage. Estimates of its capacity have varied from below 600 to almost 1000, depending {{on the number of}} galleries and boxes. Perhaps as many as ten spectators would have encumbered the stage.|$|E
