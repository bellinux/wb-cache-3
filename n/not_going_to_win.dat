Throw his bike {{down in front of}} everybody because Boyer is such a good buddy of everyone?...Hell no—he's going to start sprinting because it's less than 200 meters to go and the sprint's already been going for a couple hundred meters. LeMond made a good move and a good sprint...Boyer was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> that race. The best he could have got was fifth or sixth place." ...|$|E

At the end, the Syrians held Tel al-Qasr, which was part of the British Mandate of Palestine and the Jewish state according to the UN partition of 1947. Despite the above, the offensive was considered a decisive Syrian defeat by both sides.

As reasons for their defeat, they gave their low level of preparedness and the strength of the Israeli defenses, as well as their lack of coordination with the Iraqis (according to one Syrian historian, the Iraqis were supposed to assist them in the Deganias). After the battle, British observers became convinced that the Arabs were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the war, and compared the battle to the Luftwaffe's failure in the Battle of Britain in 1940, which showed that Germany was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the air war. The observers said that [...] "A greater edge than the [...] enjoyed at Degania they won't have again".|$|E
