The CFS verified that the petition was valid in early 2017. However, no referendum was scheduled by the Canadian Federation of Students at Selkirk College. The Students' Union asserts that its members followed the process, {{and that there is}} <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> move forward with a referendum. The CFS asserts that its ongoing dispute with the British Columbia Federation of Students means that students at Selkirk College cannot have a vote on continued membership.|$|E
25|$|Pliny {{says that}} Timaeus (born about 350 BC) {{believed}} Pytheas' {{story of the}} discovery of amber. Strabo says that Dicaearchus (died about 285BC) did not trust the stories of Pytheas. That is all the information that survives concerning the date of Pytheas' voyage. Presuming that Timaeus would not have written until after he was 20 years old in about 330BC and Dicaearchus would have needed time to write his most mature work, after 300BC, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> accept Henry Fanshawe Tozer's window of 330–300BC for the voyage. Some would give Timaeus an extra 5years, bringing the voyage down to 325BC at earliest. There is no further evidence.|$|E

In the supplemental filing, his attorneys argued that the joke of the Eiland-Hall website was not obvious; therefore, the website's domain name was misleading. The filing asserted: [...] "While there is absolutely nothing humorous or amusing about the statement made by Respondent in his domain name that 'Glenn Beck Raped and Murdered a Young Girl in 1990,' the average Internet user finding the domain name GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlin1990.com ("Disputed Domain Name") in a search would have <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> believe {{that they will be}} directed to a website providing factual information (as opposed to protected criticism or similar protected speech) about Mr. Beck." ...|$|E

[...] When Halleck mentioned Willkie's name, there were initially boos from some delegates, but they were quickly drowned out by those in the public balconies, who thunderously chanted, [...] "We want Willkie!". Pryor had cut ticket allocations to delegations that were not for Willkie, and distributed thousands of standing room passes to Willkie partisans. The vocal support for Willkie among spectators led to complaints that other campaigns had been shorted in the distribution of tickets, but provided one of the convention's most dramatic moments.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{and critics}} are divided in their {{views about the}} value of the {{recovered}} excerpts. On the one hand, Josephson is convinced that sufficient material exists for a reconstruction of the entire symphony and eagerly awaits the undertaking of this task. This view is echoed by Stearns: [...] "here's absolutely <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> attempt a completion". Others, however, are more circumspect: Virtanen, in particular, emphasises that although the music is irrefutably late Sibelius, it has not been established beyond doubt that any of it belongs to the Eighth Symphony. Sirén, who {{played a major role in}} organising the performance of the fragments, believes that completion is impossible on the basis of existing sketches, and would be dependent on further discoveries. He also surmises that Sibelius, having rejected the work, would not have relished hearing the fragments played, a viewpoint which McKenna endorses: [...] "Watching the performance on YouTube, I could not help but think how disappointed the composer would have been to hear his unfinished music performed." [...] Reviewing the recorded excerpts in Gramophone, Andrew Mellor remarks that even if further manuscripts should come to light, the Sibelius Rights Holders would have full control over the material and would decide whether performance was appropriate. Mellor concludes: [...] "We've had to wait some 80 years to hear less than three minutes of music, and the mystery of the Eighth isn't set to unfold any more rapidly from here".|$|E
40|$|A recent Ninth Circuit decision, prohibiting {{peremptory}} {{challenges on}} the basis of sexual orientation, reveals the continuing evolution of the Batson doctrine. Meanwhile, contrary judicial voices demand the abolition of the peremptory challenge. This article uncovers two phenomena that militate against abolition of the peremptory challenge, and in favor of allowing Batson’s evolution. First, the justifications for abolition apply asymmetrically to prosecution and defense, suggesting that an asymmetrical approach is more apt. Second, the states historically adopted an asymmetrical approach — unequal allocation of peremptory challenges to prosecution and defense — and yet many state legislatures have recently abandoned asymmetry, with some declaring that there are <b>no</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>not</b> <b>to.</b> This article supplies those reasons, demonstrating that asymmetrical allocation of peremptory challenges not only brings benefits in the jury selection context, but also may help resist tendencies elsewhere {{in the criminal justice system}} to equate asymmetry with unfairness, and thus to erode foundational protections...|$|R

40|$|A {{solution}} {{has been}} proposed that ensures oil drain from the discharge chamber to the pump inlet. The piston of a relief valve is controlled by a differential pressure resulting from Bernouilli effect. The start value of oil draining is {{to be controlled by}} the spring initial deflection and modification of the flow section in the outlet channel of the pump. By diminishing the spring force, 30 % reduction of the flow rate has been achieved. It is difficult to get more because of stability reasons. A more effective method is to decrease the local flow section where a static pressure probe is placed. This way 36 % reduction has been achieved and there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go further...|$|R
500|$|In {{previous}} films, Starfleet's {{range of}} capital ships had been predominantly {{represented by the}} Constitution class Enterprise and just five other ship classes: the Miranda class from [...] (represented by the USS Reliant), the Excelsior and the Oberth class Grissom from , and the Galaxy and Nebula classes from The Next Generation. ILM supervisor John Knoll insisted that First Contacts space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet's ship configurations. [...] "Starfleet would probably throw everything it could at the Borg, including ships we've never seen before", he reasoned. [...] "And since we figured {{a lot of the}} background action in the space battle would need to be done with computer-generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway, I realized there was <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do some new designs." [...] Alex Jaeger was appointed visual effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating four new starships. Paramount wanted ships that would look different from a distance, so the director devised multiple hull profiles. Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain Star Trek ship precedents, with a saucer-like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs. The Akira class featured the traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran-style double hull; the Norway class was based on the USS Voyager; the Saber class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer section; and the Steamrunner class featured twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear. Each design was modeled as a three-dimensional digital wire-frame model for use in the film.|$|E

40|$|The fiscal policy, {{stimulating}} the producers towards reduction of environmental pollution, includes subsidies, tax relieves, fees, charges, environmental taxes ets. instruments.

The restructuring of indirect taxes has to be combined with the elasticity of the demand of commodities. The introduction of tradeable permits can create some distortions in the newly established market mechanisms of the transition economy, especially if the shares are already distributed and can limit the including of some new enterprises and lower the competition quality. Despite of the difficulties of the market transition the fiscal instrument for environmental protection regulation in their unity and interrelation can bring to a positive effect in the process of economy ecologization. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{concept of}} vacant niche is not {{accepted}} by all. The reason given {{is that a}} niche is a property of a species; therefore a niche does not exist if no species is present.

If a niche is defined as the interrelationship of a species with all the biotic and abiotic factors affecting it, there is <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> admit the possibility of additional potential interrelationships.
