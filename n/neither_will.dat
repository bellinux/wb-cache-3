25|$|Many {{trivalent}} metals {{are capable}} of forming alums. The general form of an alum is AMIII(SO4)2·nH2O, where A is an alkali metal or ammonium, MIII is a trivalent metal, and n often is 12. In general, alums are easier formed when the alkali metal atom is larger. This rule was first stated by Locke in 1902, who found that if a trivalent metal does not form a caesium alum, it <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> form an alum with any other alkali metal or with ammonium.|$|E
25|$|Don Alhambra {{brings in}} the nurse who had tended the infant prince of Barataria twenty years ago. She reveals {{that when the}} Grand Inquisitor came to steal the prince, she had loyally hidden him away, and given Don Alhambra her own young son instead. Thus, the king is neither Marco nor Giuseppe, but her own son, Luiz. This {{resolves}} the romantic entanglements to everyone's satisfaction. Casilda finds that she is already married to the man she loves, Luiz. The two gondoliers surrender their crown to Luiz and, though a bit disappointed that <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> be a king, they can return happily to Venice with their wives. There is a final dance for the full company, reprising the gondoliers' Act I duet and the cachucha.|$|E

25|$|Murder {{will make}} the killer a {{constructive}} trustee of whatever property they acquire as a result. This applies to murder, as in In the Estate of Crippen, inciting someone to murder, as in Evans v Evans, and causing death by reckless driving, as in R v Seymour (Edward). In Re K, {{it was confirmed that}} involuntary manslaughter will not require constructive trusts, and <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> situations where there is a successful plea of insanity, as in found in Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. Curiously, there is no requirement that the defendant be found guilty in criminal proceedings; in Re Sigsworth, it was decided that claims can be brought without criminal proceedings having taken place providing the defendant is held up to the criminal standards of guilt in the equity case.|$|E

However that {{is due to}} change soon as 80135 will return to service in 2017 following completion of its current ongoing overhaul and will be returning to the mainline for use between Grosmont and Whitby with runs down to Battersby during galas. While talk had previously been considered, 80080 will not be returning for mainline use again and <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> 80098. 80002 is currently based at the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway but is awaiting an overhaul after her boiler ticket expired in August 2013, she isn't planned {{to return to the}} national network either. 80079 was rumored to be from its new owner Jeremy Hosking but nothing has been officially confirmed yet as like 80002 the engine requires a heavy overhaul first and then the fitment of TPWS, GSM-R & OTMR which is not cheap to fit.|$|E

25|$|The {{marriage}} was tumultuous, and Buckley quickly moved out, but Mary soon became pregnant. After several months, Buckley found himself <b>neither</b> <b>willing</b> nor {{able to cope}} with marriage and impending fatherhood. From then on, he and Mary saw each other only sporadically. They divorced in October 1966, about a month before their son Jeffrey Scott was born.|$|R
500|$|It is {{not wrong}} {{for a public}} {{authority}} to develop policies to guide its decision-making. <b>Neither</b> <b>will</b> it necessarily be considered to have fettered its discretion by adhering to such policies, {{as long as it}} approaches decisions with an open mind and is willing to give genuine consideration to each case at hand. It has been noted that by endorsing its application in this manner, the High Court has given legal effect to informal rules or policies, which therefore amount to [...] "soft law".|$|E
500|$|Gerðr {{asks the}} {{stranger}} {{if he is}} of the elves, Æsir, or the Vanir, and why he comes alone [...] "over the wild fire" [...] to seek their company. Skírnir responds that he is of none of these groups, yet that he has indeed sought her out. Skírnir offers Gerðr 11 golden apples (or apples of eternal life, in a common emendation) to gain her favor. Gerðr rejects the apples—no matter who offers them—and adds that <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> she and Freyr be together {{as long as they}} live. Skírnir offers Gerðr a ring, here unnamed, that produces eight more gold rings every ninth night and [...] "was burned with Odin's young son". Gerðr responds that she is not interested in the ring, for she shares her father's property, and Gymir has no lack of gold.|$|E
500|$|Elliott {{was also}} the one who hired Hayden Fry as Iowa's {{football}} coach in 1979. [...] Fry later said that Elliott {{was one of the}} principal reasons he chose to coach at Iowa. [...] In his autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "Iowa had one thing in its favor as far as I was concerned: Bump Elliott was its athletic director. [...] Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator." [...] Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired. [...] Fry was puzzled and asked Elliott what he meant. [...] Elliott said, [...] "Simple, I don’t think they’ll {{give me a chance to}} hire another coach, so if you don’t make it, <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> I." [...] He is the only person to have been with Rose Bowl teams in five capacities – player, assistant coach, head coach, assistant athletic director, and athletic director.|$|E

500|$|The Puritan {{leaders of}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's {{suffering}} and also that of Mary Dyer, a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women's misfortunes as the judgement of God. [...] Winthrop wrote, [...] "She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts", then continued, [...] "see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look—as she had vented misshapen opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters." [...] Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson's followers who stayed in the Boston area. Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors; she shouted at them, [...] "the Church at Boston? I know no such church, <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> I own it. Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Stay Together for the Kids" [...] {{is written}} about divorce {{from the point}} of view of a {{helpless}} child. Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused. Primarily written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, the song is biographical in nature. He and bassist Mark Hoppus were growing up when their parents divorced. For Hoppus, he was eight years old when he was sent to live with his father. [...] "The thing you realize as you get older is that parents don’t know what the hell they’re doing and <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> you when you get to be a parent. You’ve just got to understand that people are human and they make mistakes," [...] he said. DeLonge remembered learning of his parents' divorce when he discovered scrape marks on the driveway of their home.

25|$|The {{change of}} {{directors}} was stressful for Dandridge who, {{according to her}} manager, had ended an affair with Preminger when she became pregnant and he insisted she have an abortion. According to the director, he had ended {{his relationship with the}} actress because he was <b>neither</b> <b>willing</b> to marry her nor deal with her unstable emotions. In any event, Dandridge was unhappy and lacked self-assurance, especially when the director began to criticize her performance.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{say that}} the feud between the two {{managers}} have added to the rivalry between the two teams. [...] "Both managers are fiercely protective of their players.

Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves commented on the issue, saying that [...] "Estonia has never condemned, and will not condemn foreign affairs decisions of another EU country. It <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> assess psychiatric state of other EU countries".

2500|$|The Gemara {{cited the}} {{language}} of [...] "The Lord shall reign for ever and ever," [...] as a premier example of how Scripture indicates permanence.

The Gemara cited these proofs: Using , nezach, [...] says, [...] "For I will not contend for ever, <b>neither</b> <b>will</b> I be always ( [...] , nezach) angry."

[...] Finally cornered, he admits that the room belongs to both of them, but he says that he will have his little back second floor room ready later the same day. Both lodgers say they will take it, which Bouncer quickly points out makes no sense whatsoever. He leaves them to decide which will vacate the current room.
