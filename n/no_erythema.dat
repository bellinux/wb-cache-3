40|$|Metabolic {{inactivation}} of all-trans {{retinoic acid}} to 4 -hydroxy retinoic acid occurs via a cytochrome P- 450 enzyme. We investigated {{the effects of}} liarozole on the retinoic acid 4 -hydroxylase activity of human epidermis {{and its ability to}} modify in vivo human skin responses to retinoic acid and all-trans retinol. Retinoic acid 4 -hydroxylase activity induced in vivo by 4 d treatment with retinoic acid (0. 1 %) was inhibited in vitro by liarozole in a concentration-dependent manner. Comparable micromolar concentrations of liarozole were extracted from stratum corneum-free epidermis treated with 3 % liarozole. Retinoic acid levels in liarozole-treated skin increased to 19 ± 5 ng/g wet wt (mean ± SEM, p< 0. 002,n= 17) at 18 h and to 6 ± 2 ng/g wet wt (p= 0. 38, n= 17) at 48 h as compared to vehicle (not detectable). At 48 h, retinoic acid 4 -hydroxylase activity was induced 9 -fold over vehicle (p< 0. 03, n= 8). At 96 h, no significant erythema or increased epidermal thickness was found when either retinoic acid (0. 001 %), all-trans retinol (0. 025 %), or liarozole (3 %) was applied individually, but when 0. 001 % retinoic acid and 3 % liarozole were applied together, both erythema and increased epidermal thickness occurred. In contrast, 0. 025 % all-trans retinol and 3 % liarozole together caused increased epidermal thickness but <b>no</b> <b>erythema.</b> These data demonstrate that, at doses used here, liarozole, although an effective inhibitor of retinoic acid 4 -hydiroxylase, cannot function alone like a retinoid in vivo, probably because of retinoic acid 4 -hydroxylase induction. In the presence of a low dose retinoic acid or all-trans retinol, however, liarozole can amplify human skin responses to each retinoid in a manner characteristic of the retinoid at a higher dose (erythema and hyperplasia with retinoic acid; <b>no</b> <b>erythema</b> but hyperplasia with all-trans retinol) ...|$|E

A skin reaction score was obtained at each site before the application of each patch, 80 minutes after patch removal, and 7 days after patch removal. Skin swabs were obtained for bacteriologic cultures immediately before patch application and immediately after patch removal. Twenty-seven women were enrolled and completed the study; 270 skin observations were made with the estradiol patch and 162 with placebo. Skin reactions 30 minutes after patch removal included erythema (23. 7 %), erythema with induration (4. 1 %), and erythema with induration and vesicles (1. 1 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Esophageal {{ulceration}} and fistula are {{complications of}} pulmonary vein isolation using thermal energy sources. Irreversible electroporation is a novel, nonthermal ablation modality for pulmonary vein isolation. A single 200 J application can create deep myocardial lesions. Acute and chronic {{effects of this}} new energy source on the esophagus are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 8 pigs (± 70 kg), the suprasternal esophagus was surgically exposed. A linear suction device with a single 35 -mm long and 6 -mm wide protruding linear electrode inside a plastic suction cup was used for ablation. Single, nonarcing, nonbarotraumatic, cathodal 100 and 200 J applications were delivered at 2 different sites on the anterior esophageal adventitia. No proton-pump inhibitors were administered during follow-up. Esophagoscopy was performed at days 2 and 7. After euthanasia at day 60, the esophagus was evaluated visually and histologically. All ablations were uneventful. Esophagoscopy at day 2 showed small white densities in the ablated areas, which appeared to be small intraepithelial vesicles. <b>No</b> epithelial <b>erythema,</b> erosions, or ulcerations were seen. At day 7, all densities had disappeared, and all esophaguses appeared completely normalized. After euthanasia, there were no macroscopically visible lesions on the adventitia or epithelium. Histologically, a small scar was observed at the outer part of the muscular layer, whereas the mucosa and submucosa were normal. CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal architecture remains unaffected 2 months after irreversible electroporation, purposely targeting the adventitia.

The optimized microemulsion was characterized for its morphology and particle size distribution. The optimized microemulsion was incorporated into polymeric gels of Lutrol F 127, Xanthan gum, and Carbopol 934 for convenient application and evaluated for pH, drug content, viscosity, and spreadability. In vitro drug permeation of ME gels was determined across excised rat skins. Furthermore, in vitro antimycotic inhibitory activity of the gels was conducted using agar-cup method and Candida albicans as a test organism. The droplet size of the optimized microemulsion was found to be < 100 nm. The optimized Lutrol F 127 ME gel showed pH in the range of 5. 68 ΁ 0. 02 and spreadability of 5. 75 ΁ 1. 396 gcm/s.

Treating of latex rubber stents were carried out by adding the norfloxacin-metronidazole with the fresh latex during polymerization (polymerization method). Polymerization was facilitated by adding water and formic acid to the latexantibacterialagents solution mixture. The numbers of adhered bacteria on treated and untreated stents were calculated. Difference in the number of viable bacteria adhered on the surface of treated and untreated stentswere statistically calculated using chi square testing procedure with P < 0. 05 considered significant. Tests for persistence were carried out using serial plate transfer method to determine withstanding ability of antibacterial agentss in the stents.

Intravenous injection of 500 micrograms of soluble native type II collagen 3 d before immunization with native type II collagen emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant resulted in animals with decreased in vitro cellular and humoral immune response to native and denatured type II collagen compared with control groups. Control groups were composed of animals preinoculated with saline and type I collagen and established the antigen-specific nature of the observed suppression. Mice with reduced immune responses to type II collagen also were observed to portray little or <b>no</b> <b>erythema</b> and edema associated with collagen-induced arthritis. Adoptive transfer experiments established the requirement of T cells for the suppression of collagen-induced arthritis. Analysis of the phenotype of responding splenic cells in chronic immunotherapeutically suppressed mice in vitro revealed that responding cells were Ly 1 - 2 + (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cells. On the other hand, the cellular phenotype of T cells responding to type II collagen in nonsuppressed collagen-induced arthritic mice was Ly 1 + 2 - (helper/inducer T cells). The data indicate that type II collagen-specific T cells are generated on intravenous inoculation of soluble native type II collagen. These cells are observed in type II collagen-immune animals, which are nonarthritic and portray reduced humoral and in vitro cellular immune response to type II collagen. This study suggests that specific suppression of immune responses to type II collagen by T-suppressor cells can be immunotherapeutic in certain forms of arthritis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate novel particulate carrier system such as solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) for topical application of vitamin A palmitate and to study its beneficial effects on skin. Topical gels enriched with SLN of vitamin A were prepared. The solid lipid nanoparticulate dispersion was prepared using high-pressure homogenization technique and was incorporated into polymeric gels of Carbopol, Pemulen, Lutrol, and Xanthan gum for convenient application. The nanoparticulate dispersion and its gels were evaluated for various parameters such as particle size, in vitro drug release, in vitro penetration, in vivo skin hydration, and skin irritation. The solid lipid nanoparticulate dispersion showed mean particle size of 350 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry studies revealed no drugexcipient incompatibility. In vitro release profile of vitamin A palmitate from nanoparticulate dispersion and its gel showed prolonged drug release up to 24 hours, which could be owing to embedment of drug in the solid lipid core. In vitro penetration studies showed almost 2 times higher drug concentration in the skin with lipid nanoparticle-enriched gel as compared with conventional gel, thus indicating better localization of the drug in the skin. In vivo skin hydration studies in albino rats revealed increase in the thickness of the stratum corneum with improved skin hydration. The developed formulation was nonirritant to the skin with <b>no</b> <b>erythema</b> or edema and had primary irritation index of 0. 00. Thus it can be concluded that SLN represents a promising particulate carrier having controlled drug release, improved skin hydration, and potential to localize the drug in the skin with no skin irritation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Preventing relapses of atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) through the regular use of topical products {{to repair the}} skin barrier defect is an emerging concept. It is still unclear if some commonly used emollients exert {{a positive effect on}} the skin barrier. OBJECTIVES: To determine the skin barrier effects of emollients commonly prescribed in the UK. METHODS: Two cohorts of volunteers with quiescent AD undertook observer-blind forearm-controlled studies. The first (18 volunteers) treated the volar side of one forearm with 2 fingertip units of Doublebase(™) gel twice daily for 4 weeks. The second cohort (19 volunteers) undertook the same regimen using Diprobase(®) cream. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum integrity and hydration, skin-surface-pH and redness were determined at the test sites before and after treatment. RESULTS: Neither Diprobase(®) cream nor Doublebase(™) gel significantly affected the underlying skin barrier function. Both emollients were associated with significantly increased skin-surface-pH immediately after application (by 0. 8 ± 0. 19 and 1. 0 ± 0. 18 units respectively), and <b>no</b> <b>erythema.</b> Diprobase(®) cream artificially and transiently (6 hours) improved permeability barrier function by 2. 9 - 3. 1 g/m(2) /h TEWL and increased skin hydration by 6. 0 - 6. 2 units. Doublebase(™) gel, containing humectants, was associated with a greater (between 10. 1 and 13. 0 units during the first 6 hours) and more sustained increase in hydration, lasting more than 12 hours following repeated use. CONCLUSION: Diprobase(®) cream and Doublebase(™) gel are not associated with skin barrier harm and appear to be appropriate for AD treatment. Whilst displaying emollient properties, neither formulation displayed an ability to actively improve sustained skin barrier function. This article is protected by copyright.

40|$|A 2 -week-old term female {{presents}} {{to the emergency}} de-partment {{with a history of}} an abrupt, generalized red rash with peeling of the skin. Her mother reports that she first noticed the skin peeling around her daughter’s umbilicus 3 days ago, about the same time the umbilical cord stump fell off. She also noted some brownish discharge from the umbilicus at that time. Twenty-four hours earlier, the in-fant had developed irritability and a generalized red rash over her body, with areas of peeling skin. There is no his-tory of fever, cold, hypothermia, cough, or eye discharge. Up to this point, the infant has been feeding and stooling well. The infant was born term via a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications. Birthweight was 2, 700 g, and Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. However, the maternal group B Streptococcus status was unknown; the mother received two doses of intravenous penicillin 4 hours before delivery. On physical examination, the patient’s vital signs are appropriate for age, and there is no fever. The infant re-acts to touch as if it hurts. Examination of the skin reveals erythroderma (scaling erythematous dermatitis) and large, thin sheets of peeling skin with underlying shallow, bright red erosions around the face (Fig 1), lower abdo-men, axillae and antecubital fossae (Fig 2), and both an-kles and feet (Fig 3). There are no vesicles or bullae. There is <b>no</b> increased <b>erythema</b> around, or oozing or crusting from, the periumbilical area. The mucous mem-branes of the mouth and anus are unaffected. The rest of the physical examination is normal for age. A clinical di-agnosis is made. Figure 1. Bright red face with thin sheets of peeling skin and underlying shallow erosions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} and quantify {{the adverse effects}} associated with the recombinant human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) vaccine in adolescents. Data source: Systematic review of randomized clinical trials from PubMed, SciELO and Lilacs databases. Articles investigating {{the safety of the}} vaccine in subjects under 18 years and comparing the recombinant human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16 and 18 vaccine with a control group were included. Meta-analyses were performed for the outcomes of pain, erythema, swelling and fever, using clinical trials with maximum Jadad score. Data synthesis: Fourteen studies were included. The most common adverse effects related to the human papillomavirus vaccine were effects with <b>no</b> severity (pain, <b>erythema,</b> edema, and fever). Five studies were used for the meta-analyses: pain-risk difference (RD) = 11 % (p< 0. 001); edema-RD= 8 % (p< 0. 001); erythema-RD= 5 % (p< 0. 001); fever-RD= 2 % (p< 0. 003). Conclusions: The recombinant human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16 and 18 vaccine was safe and well tolerated. The main adverse effects related to vaccination were pain, erythema, edema and fever. The low frequency of severe adverse effects encourages the administration of the vaccine in the population at risk...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Actinic keratoses (AKs), a premalignant skin lesion, are {{a common}} lesion in fair skin. Although {{destructive}} treatment remains {{the gold standard for}} AKs, medical therapies may be preferable due to the comfort and reliability. This study aims to compare the effects of topical 1 % colchicine gel and 3 % diclofenac sodium gel in AKs. Materials and Methods. In this randomized double-blind study, 70 lesions were selected. Patients were randomized before receiving either 1 % colchicine gel or 3 % diclofenac sodium cream twice a day for 6 weeks. Patients were evaluated in terms of their lesion size, treatment complications, and recurrence at 7, 30, 60, and 120 days after treatment. Results. The mean of changes in the size was significant in both groups both before and after treatment (0. 05). <b>No</b> case of <b>erythema</b> was seen in the colchicine group, while erythema was seen in 22. 9 % (eight cases) of patients in the diclofenac sodium group (p = 0. 005). Conclusions. 1 % colchicine gel was a safe and effective medication with fewer side effects and lack of recurrence of the lesion...|$|R
