To circumvent the Italian censors Donizetti agreed to plot modifications; La favorite is about a medieval King of Castile.|$|E

5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince of Wales, and took little {{interest}} in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. <b>Now</b> <b>more</b> interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E
5|$|A two-day long {{bombardment}} of Flushing forced its capitulation on 15 August. Ratified the following day, {{it left the}} British in control of Walcheren which they garrisoned with 10,000 troops. Schouwen and Duiveland on the Eastern branch of the Scheldt, were occupied peacefully on 17 August. The French fleet had already withdrawn to Antwerp however, having been informed on 29 July when the British were still at sea. Between the British and their objective were <b>now</b> <b>more</b> than 35,000 French soldiers, garrisoned in heavily armed forts at Lillo, Liefkenshoech, and Antwerp. The deliberate destruction of dykes by the French had led to widespread flooding, and with disease spreading through the British army, {{it was decided to}} abandon the expedition in early September.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} <b>now</b> <b>more</b> used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of Māori culture, the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are <b>now</b> <b>more</b> widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence. Most Māori carvings feature human figures, generally with three fingers and either a natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head. Surface patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate most carvings. The pre-eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses (wharenui) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different whims or needs.|$|E
5|$|Cherry Springs State Park and the {{surrounding}} Susquehannock State Forest have recovered from the clearcutting of the lumber era. However, {{the composition of the}} forests has changed, so that there are <b>now</b> <b>more</b> hardwoods, including sugar maple and black cherry, and fewer eastern white pine and eastern hemlock. The park also has apple trees from the CCC orchard. Over 400species of birds have been found in Pennsylvania, including 186that breed in the state. Birds such as ospreys, hawks, owls, nightjars, and bald eagles have returned to the park and state forest, and saw-whet owls have been studied in the park.|$|E

5|$|Crex {{is a small}} genus {{of birds}} in the rail family. It {{contains}} two species, the corn crake, C. crex, which breeds across Europe and Asia and winters in southern Africa, and the African crake, C. egregia, which migrates within Africa. Both are short-billed rails with blackish-brown upperparts, mainly blue-grey underparts, and barring on the flanks. The corn crake is significantly larger than its relative, and has a distinctive chestnut patch on its wings. Unusually for their family, these are birds of dry habitats rather than wetlands; the Eurasian species mainly breeds in hay meadows, and the African crake in dry grassland. The African crake is sometimes given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is <b>now</b> <b>more</b> usually placed in Crex.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a series}} of {{commercial}} failures, Grant was <b>now</b> <b>more</b> popular than ever and in high demand. According to Vermilye, in 1939, Grant played roles that were more dramatic, albeit with comical undertones. He played a British army sergeant opposite Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in the George Stevens-directed adventure film Gunga Din, set at a military station in India. Roles as a pilot opposite Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth in Hawks's Only Angels Have Wings, and a wealthy landowner alongside Carole Lombard in In Name Only followed.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{domination}} of the print industry, other businesses were also established on Fleet Street. The Automobile Association was established at No.18 Fleet Street in 1905. Since the post-Wapping migration, Fleet Street is <b>now</b> <b>more</b> associated with the investment banking, legal and accountancy professions. For example, The Inns of Court and barristers' chambers are down alleys and around courtyards off Fleet Street itself {{and many of the}} old newspaper offices have become the London headquarters for various companies; e.g. Goldman Sachs is in the old Daily Telegraph and Liverpool Echo buildings of Peterborough Court and Mersey House.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the wreck in 1971, the project became known to the general public and received increasing media attention. This helped bring in more donations and equipment, primarily from private sources. By 1974 the Committee had representatives from the National Maritime Museum, the Royal Navy, the BBC and local organisations. In 1974 the project received royal patronage from Prince Charles, who participated in dives on the site. This attracted yet more publicity, and also more funding and assistance. The initial aims of the Mary Rose Committee were <b>now</b> <b>more</b> officially and definitely confirmed. The Committee had become a registered charity in 1974, which made it easier to raise funds, and the application for excavation and raising of the ship had been officially approved by the UK government.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} hundred years the Grimaldi defended their {{territory}} from attacks by other states which included Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and Provence. The fortress was frequently bombarded, damaged, and restored. Gradually the Grimaldi {{began to make}} an alliance with France which strengthened their position. <b>Now</b> <b>more</b> secure, the Grimaldi lords of Monaco now began to recognise the need not only to defend their territory, but also to have a home reflecting their power and prestige.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the clergy}} who served under him in Armagh {{recommended}} that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently. Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland. The British government also objected, favoring Patrick Curtis instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests. The Vatican agreed, and Pope Pius VII appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the sees of Philadelphia or Madras; Conwell chose Philadelphia. <b>Now</b> <b>more</b> than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop William Poynter, the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, assisted by Fathers James Bramston and Joseph Francis Carpue.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people with}} TS {{may not realize}} they have tics; because tics are more {{commonly}} expressed in private, TS may go unrecognized or undetected. It {{is not uncommon for}} the parents of affected children to be unaware that they, too, may have had tics as children. Because Tourette's tends to subside with maturity, and because milder cases of Tourette's are <b>now</b> <b>more</b> likely to be recognized, the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed. It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together, as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they, too, had tics as a child.|$|E
5|$|The Blues and the Greens were <b>now</b> <b>more</b> {{than simply}} sports teams. They gained {{influence}} in military, political, and theological matters, although {{the hypothesis that}} the Greens tended towards Monophysitism and the Blues represented Orthodoxy is disputed. It is now widely believed that neither of the factions had any consistent religious bias or allegiance, {{in spite of the fact}} that they operated in an environment fraught with religious controversy. According to some scholars, the Blue-Green rivalry contributed to the conditions that underlay the rise of Islam, while factional enmities were exploited by the Sassanid Empire in its conflicts with the Byzantines during the century preceding Islam's advent.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{continued}} to prosper {{during the reign}} of James I (1603–1625) and the beginning of that of Charles I, when over 100 students per year were recorded as joining. The outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 {{during the reign of}} Charles I disrupted the systems of legal education and governance at the Inns of Court, shutting down all calls to the Bar and new admissions, and Gray's Inn never fully recovered. Fortunes {{continued to}} decline after the English Restoration, which saw the end of the traditional method of legal education. Although <b>now</b> <b>more</b> prosperous, Gray's Inn is today the smallest of the Inns of Court.|$|E
