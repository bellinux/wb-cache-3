5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Britain intervened and {{returned}} {{control of the}} Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and {{the revival of the}} Hebrew language and culture. The movement was publicly supported by Great Britain during World War I with the Balfour Declaration of 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall.|$|E

25|$|He came to {{the throne}} aged ten in 1524 and came {{under the control of}} the Qizilbash who formed the {{backbone}} of the Safavid Empire. The Qizilbash leaders fought among themselves for the right to be regents over Tahmasp, and by doing so held most of the effective power in hands in the empire. Upon adulthood, however, Tahmasp was able to reassert the power of the Shah and control the tribesmen with the start of the introduction of large amounts of Caucasian elements, effectively and purposefully creating a <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> in Iranian society, solely composed of ethnic Caucasians. This <b>new</b> <b>layer,</b> also called the third force in some of the modern day sources, would be solely composed of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Circassians, Georgians and Armenians, and they would continue to play a crucial role in Persia's royal household, harems, civil and military administration, as well as in all other thinkable and available positions for centuries after Tahmasp, and they would eventually fully eliminate the effective power of the Qizilbash in most of the functioning posts of the empire, by which they would also become the most dominant class in the meritocratic Safavid kingdom as well. One of his most notable successors, the greatest Safavid emperor, Abbas I (also known as Abbas the Great) would fully implement and finalize this policy and the creation of this <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> in Iranian society.|$|E

25|$|In 1878/1879 Edmund Knoblauch {{completely}} restructured Jerusalem Church, only {{keeping its}} curtain walls, which {{were covered with}} a <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> of yellow bricks and decorated with terracotta forms. Inside the prayer hall were 1,400 seats, illuminated by stained glass windows and covered by a structured wooden ceiling. In the following years the congregation lost many of its parishioners because its parish became commercialised and huge edifices of publishing houses and insurances gradually superseded the prior residential buildings. The number of parishioners shrunk to 10,000 (1933), then considered a small number for an urban congregation. Thus in July 1933 the congregation reunited {{with that of the}} New Church, reducing the number of pastors at Jerusalem Church from two to one.1997, (Schriftenreihe über den Widerstand in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945; No. 10), p. 203.

25|$|During Tahmasp' reign, {{he carried}} out {{multiple}} invasions in the Caucasus {{which had been}} incorporated in the Safavid empire since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterwards, and started with the trend of deporting and moving {{hundreds of thousands of}} Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians to Iran's heartlands. Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and minor other sections of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> in Iranian society. As Encyclopædia Iranica states, for Tahmãsp, the problem circled around the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qezelbāš, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement. With this new Caucasian layer in Iranian society, the indisputed might of the Qizilbash (who functioned much like the ghazis of the neighboring Ottoman Empire) would be questioned and fully diminished as society would become fully meritocratic.|$|E

25|$|Thin layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) is {{a widely}} employed laboratory technique used to separate different biochemicals {{on the basis of}} their size and is similar to paper chromatography. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat, inert substrate. TLC is very versatile; multiple samples can be separated simultaneously on the same layer, making it very useful for screening applications such as testing drug levels and water purity. Possibility of cross-contamination is low since each separation is performed on a <b>new</b> <b>layer.</b> Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, better quantitative analysis, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and faster separation that utilizes less solvent, high-performance TLC can be used. An older popular use had been to differentiate chromosomes by observing distance in gel (separation of was a separate step).|$|E
25|$|Shedding. Reptiles {{shed their}} skin {{through a process}} called ecdysis which occurs {{continuously}} throughout their lifetime. In particular, younger reptiles tend to shed once every 5–6 weeks while adults shed 3-4 times a year. O Younger reptiles shed more because of their rapid growth rate. Once full size, the frequency of shedding drastically decreases. The process of ecdysis involves forming a <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> of skin under the old one. Proteolytic enzymes and lymphatic fluid is secreted between {{the old and new}} layers of skin. Consequently, this lifts the old skin from the new one allowing for shedding to occur. Snakes will shed from the head to the tail while lizards shed in a “patchy pattern”. Dysecdysis, a common skin disease in snakes and lizards will occur when ecdysis, or shedding, fails. There are numerous reasons why shedding fails and can be related to inadequate humidity and temperature, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and traumatic injuries. Nutritional deficiencies decreases proteolytic enzymes while dehydration reduces lymphatic fluids to separate the skin layers. Traumatic injuries on the other hand, forms scars that will not allow new scales to form and disrupt the process of ecdysis.|$|E
25|$|When P. exigua catch prey, {{they return}} to the nest with a solid, usually glossy mass, held in their mouthparts. If the size of prey is {{relatively}} large, the wasp may hold the crop with its anterior legs. Wasps were reported to share this food with other adults and offer the protein in a macerated form to larvae. The water gathered by workers is placed directly onto {{the walls of the}} nest cells, usually without any contact with other wasps. Wood pulp and fibers are collected primarily for nest building. Wasps return to the nest with a solid mass taken in the mouthparts; they are usually smaller and darker than the prey crop. P. exigua has the habit of building white or light brown nests, so the item taken to the nest for colony growth was white and larger than the prey. This item is chewed, mixed with saliva and incorporated in the cell walls. Resin is gathered in order to build layers within the nest. Workers carrying resin to the nest travel to substrate sheets and proceed to lay their foraged material on top of the structure. This <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> remains there until the sheets stuck together and formed a stronger partition.|$|E
30|$|From 2007 through 2013 we applied {{prescribed}} {{fires in}} the late dormant season on grazed pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa.

500|$|In {{the second}} chapter, [...] "Taking Root", the {{embryonic}} root emerges {{through a small}} opening in the seed coat and through cell division, aided by plant hormones, it grows downward. Water and nutrients enter the root by osmosis and are transported to the seedling. A symbiotic relationship develops between the roots and the truffles. The roots give its extra sugars to the truffles, which it uses for energy, and the truffles assist the roots' uptake of water and nutrients. From excess starches and nutrients gathered by the root, a stem similar to the root but surrounded with thin, grayish bark, grows upwards. As the starch reserves are exhausted, its first needles sprout and photosynthesis begins. The tree anchors itself with a deep taproot and a web of roots begin to grow laterally. Some roots develop symbiotic relationships with near-by red alders which excel at nitrogen-fixation but lack the storage capacity that the Douglas-fir can offer. In early April of every year, a <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> grows between the bark and wood. As this <b>new</b> <b>layer</b> takes over transportation of fluids throughout the tree, last year's layer of cells die and form a ring in the wood.|$|E
