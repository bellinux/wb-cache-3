40|$|The {{computations}} {{performed by}} GPUs {{are suitable for}} a streaming computational model [3], and GPU architec-tures {{are similar to those}} of stream processors. However, SIMD GPUs do not efficiently implement data-dependent control flow. We are attempting to build an efficient, portable, and transparent multipass programming framework that sup-ports the entire palette of data-dependent control con-structs. For our prototype we restricted our work to GPU fragment units. Streams are stored in textures for read-ing operations and target frame buffers for writing oper-ations. However, on current GPUs fragments are written to an array, not sequentially to a stream. In particular, <b>null</b> <b>records</b> (killed fragments) resulting from conditional out-puts are not removed from the output stream resulting in wasted bandwidth and computation on later passes. Ka-pasi et al [1] use special hardware to pack the stream into a compact representation with no <b>null</b> <b>records.</b> The com-pacted stream can then be processed in later passes with maximum efficiency. We are attempting to apply this ap-proach to GPUs. SCHEDULER The control flow of a program can be schematically rep-resented as a directed graph where the nodes have only linear control flow and the arcs represent data dependent branches. In a multipass streaming computation frame-work, the control graph can be interpreted as a streaming graph. Nodes are independent kernels and arcs are data paths from one kernel to the next. For example, the fol-lowing figure shows the streaming graph of a Julia set test program. This streaming graph consists of three kernels, representing initialization code, the body of the loop and the evaluation of the final colour. Its data flow graph is illustrated in the following figure. We execute the stream-ing graph in multiple passes, packing data into different buffers to eliminate garbage computations. In each pass, a kernel will be selected by the scheduler based on heuris-tics to maximize throughput...|$|R
5000|$|For example, a {{database}} table that has information about people, with one record per person, {{might have a}} [...] "gender" [...] column. This gender column might be declared as a string data type, and allowed {{to have one of}} two known code values: [...] "M" [...] for male, [...] "F" [...] for female—and <b>NULL</b> for <b>records</b> where gender is unknown or not applicable (or arguably [...] "U" [...] for unknown as a sentinel value). The data domain for the gender column is: [...] "M", [...] "F".|$|R

40|$|Human heart Na+ {{channels}} {{were expressed}} transiently in both mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes, and Na+ currents measured using 150 mM intracellular Na+. The kinetics of decaying outward Na+ current {{in response to}} 1 -s depolarizations in the F 1485 Q mutant depends on the predominant cation in the extracellular solution, suggesting an effect on slow inactivation. The decay rate is lower for the alkali metal cations Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ than for the organic cations Tris, tetramethylammonium, N-methylglucamine, and choline. In whole cell recordings, raising [Na+]o from 10 to 150 mM increases the rate of recovery from slow inactivation at − 140 mV, decreases the rate of slow inactivation at relatively depolarized voltages, and shifts steady-state slow inactivation in a depolarized direction. Single channel recordings of F 1485 Q show {{a decrease in the}} number of blank (i. e., <b>null)</b> <b>records</b> when [Na+]o is increased. Significant clustering of blank records when depolarizing at a frequency of 0. 5 Hz suggests that periods of inactivity represent the sojourn of a channel in a slow-inactivated state. Examination of the single channel kinetics at + 60 mV during 90 -ms depolarizations shows that neither open time, closed time, nor first latency is significantly affected by [Na+]o. However raising [Na+]o decreases the duration of the last closed interval terminated by the end of the depolarization, leading to an increased number of openings at the depolarized voltage. Analysis of single channel data indicates that at a depolarized voltage a single rate constant for entry into a slow-inactivated state is reduced in high [Na+]o, suggesting that the binding of an alkali metal cation, perhaps in the ion-conducting pore, inhibits the closing of the slow inactivation gate...|$|R
40|$|PSR B 0540 - 69 is the Crab twin in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Age, {{energetic}} and overall behaviour {{of the two}} pulsars are very similar. The {{same is true for}} the general appearance of their pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images spanning 10 years unveiled significant variability in the PWN surrounding PSR B 0540 - 69, with a hot spot moving at ~ 0. 04 c. Such behaviour, reminiscent of the variability observed in the Crab nebula along the counter-jet direction, may suggest an alternative scenario for the geometry of the system. The same data were used to assess the pulsar proper motion. The <b>null</b> displacement <b>recorded</b> over 10 y allowed us to set a 3 sigma upper limit of 290 km/s to the pulsar velocity.

50|$|Varèse Sarabande's roots trace back to 1972, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of a predecessor imprint called Varèse International. The first LP release was Lumiere by Dub Taylor. Varèse International Records was originally conceived as an avant garde classical label. In the years that followed, under the management of the founder-owners, Dub Taylor and Chris Kuchler, the label expanded its catalogue to include jazz, classical and other genres of recordings. In 1977, Tom <b>Null's</b> Sarabande <b>Records</b> merged with Varèse International to form Varèse Sarabande Records. The early LP issues of the label were reissues of classical recordings from the American Decca, Remington and JVC labels. The first film soundtrack LP album was released in 1978. Initially, the new label was located at 6404 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. During its early years, it issued classical music and film score LPs, and in the 1980s and 1990s, became the world's largest producer of original motion picture scores on compact disc. In 2003, Varèse celebrated its 25th anniversary by releasing two 4-CD compilation sets. Additional 4-CD sets were released in 2008 and 2013 to commemorate the label's 30th and 35th anniversaries.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1996, now {{consisting}} of Trevor Paglen, Nicolas Lampert, and Sean Thomas, Noisegate embarked on their first major tour of the United States, with filmmaker Laura Klein. Upon their return, Chris Fitzpatrick was enlisted to run sampler. This new lineup began reworking the music which became the Towers Are Burning LP, produced by Lars Savage and released in 1998 by the One Hundred Years of Solitude label. After several tours supporting the LP across the US and in Canada, {{it was decided to}} record two more tracks, and release all four on Tumult Records and Legion Records as the Towers Are Burning CD. One of these tracks, [...] "Alamogordo", featured Dave Edwardson of Neurosis on bass guitar and vocals. Noisegate also recorded As We Were Walking, a split-release with KK <b>Null</b> on Wagenhault <b>Records.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{is divided into two}} parts: Firstly, null models where used to test whether plant {{communities}} in a New Zealand forest were assembled deterministically or stochastically. Secondly, a relationship between a plant trait; Leaf Mass per Area (LMA) and environmental conditions was investigated in a New Zealand forest. For the first study abundance of adult species was recorded in thirty 30 m x 30 m plots at Otari Wilton's Bush. In a subsample of six plots, the abundance of seedling species was also <b>recorded.</b> <b>Null</b> models for species co-occurrence, species richness, species abundance and niche overlap were used in order to establish how plant communities assemble at Otari Wilton's Bush. There was evidence of both determinist and stochasticity in some aspects of the plant community, it appears that seedlings are mainly randomly assembled whereas, determinism appears to be the main driver of community composition for mature trees. Results therefore suggest a pluralistic approach should be used in order to explain plant community patterns at Otari Wilton's Bush. For the second study, of all species observed in the first study only those species found in five or more of the plots were examined. For those species, the height of the two highest individuals was measured. From each individual, six fully exposed leaves were collected and measured. Measurements of environmental conditions were also collected for all plots. Principal component analysis and multiple regression was used to analyse the data. Height related (vertical) trends were observed for three surveyed species such that LMA significantly increased with plant height. Horizontal patterns were observed for two species, and for three species {{it was not possible to}} distinguish the association of tree height (vertical) and position along the forest (horizontal) with LMA. Potentially, by including more species in future studies a clearer pattern will be observed. It could also be that different species display different strategies regarding LMA and if so, a study more focused on individual species in isolation may be able to provide more informative explanations...|$|R
5000|$|Former President Carlos Menem {{was arrested}} and placed under house arrest on June 8, as the alleged head of a {{conspiracy}} {{that would have made}} an illegal sale of 6,500 tons of weapons and ammunition to Ecuador and Croatia, and for falsifying the contents of three presidential decrees. This, rather than signifying a success for the government, was a major problem. Justicialism took up Congress to reject the ex-president's arrest, who then was released by the Supreme Court Decision, by six votes to two, on November 21 of the same year. The Court then ruled that there was no conspiracy and forgery decretos. En ideological in June 2013 the trial was reviewed and Menem sentenced to eight years in prison. The sentence is under appeal.The political situation was generally unfavorable. In the Senate most it was the Justicialista Party. In the Chamber of Deputies he had the majority but this was minimal. Unionism made seven general strikes during the delaruista government and most provinces had their own governors PJ. Also lacked a clear partisan support, and various sectors of radicalism and the Frepaso began to distance themselves from the resignation of Carlos Alvarez, the appointment of Domingo Cavallo and sustained economic policy.
