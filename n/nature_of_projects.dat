40|$|We {{study how}} {{co-creation}} practices influence explorative and exploitative learning in five collaborative construction projects with partnering arrangements. Drawing on a longitudinal case study, our findings reveal {{two different types}} of explorative learning processes (i. e., adaptation and radical development) and three different exploitative learning processes (i. e., incremental development, knowledge sharing, and innovation diffusion). Furthermore, co-creation practices enhance adaptation, radical development, and incremental development, which are typical intra-project learning processes. Co-creation practices do not, however, enhance knowledge sharing and innovation diffusion across projects. These findings concur with previous insights that the temporary and one-off <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>projects</b> makes inter-project learning problematic. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
