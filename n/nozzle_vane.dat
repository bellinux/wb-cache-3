40|$|This paper investigates a {{variable}} geometry (VG) mixed flow turbine with a novel, purposely designed pivoting <b>nozzle</b> <b>vane</b> ring. The <b>nozzle</b> <b>vane</b> ring was matched to the 3 -dimensional {{aspect of the}} mixed flow rotor leading edge with lean stacking. It was found that for a <b>nozzle</b> <b>vane</b> ring in a volute, the vane surface pressure is highly affected by the flow in the volute rather than the adjacent vane surface interactions, especially at closer nozzle positions. The performance of the VG mixed flow turbine has been evaluated experimentally in steady and unsteady flow conditions. The VG mixed flow turbine shows higher peak efficiency and swallowing capacity at various vane angle settings compared to an equivalent nozzleless turbine. Comparison with an equivalent straight vane arrangement shows a higher swallowing capacity but similar efficiencies. The VG turbine unsteady performance was found to deviate substantially from the quasi-steady assumption compared to a nozzleless turbine. This is more evident in the higher vane angle settings (smaller nozzle passage), where there are high possibility of choking during a pulse cycle.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed that a turbocharger turbine behaves differently between steady and pulsating flow operations. This {{is due in}} no small part to the flow field distribution within the turbine stage. The use of <b>nozzle</b> <b>vanes</b> has significantly increased the three-dimensional complexity of the flow field, although some argue that the use of such stator could lead to improved overall turbine performance. This research investigates the drawbacks on the circumferential flow angle distributions due to existence of <b>nozzle</b> <b>vanes</b> particularly during pulsating flow conditions. In achieving this objective, a validated full stage unsteady CFD model was built to gain insight of the flow field behaviour. The results indicate that application of <b>nozzle</b> <b>vanes</b> has favourable effect on flow angle distribution at the rotor inlet during steady state operations for both design and off-design conditions. This is achieved {{in such a way that}} the existence of <b>nozzle</b> <b>vanes</b> has reduced the fluctuation of flow angle as compared to the flow upstream the vanes. On the other hand, during pulsating flow turbine operation, the fluctuation amplitude has spiked almost 400 % the level of its counterpart under steady state operation at the rotor inlet. This behaviour could potentially have adverse effect on flow field distribution within the turbine passage and as such, reducing unsteady turbine efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{requirements}} {{for a modern}} industrial gas turbine consist of a continuous trend of an increasing efficiency combined with very low emissions in a robust, cost-effective manner. To fulfil these tasks a high turbine inlet temperature together with advanced dry low NOX combustion chambers are employed. These dry low NOX combustion chambers generate a rather flat temperature profile compared to previous generation gas turbines, which have a rather parabolic temperature profile before the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane.</b> This means that the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> endwall heat load for modern gas turbines is much higher compared to previous generation gas turbines. Therefore the prediction of the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> flow field and endwall heat transfer is crucial for the engineering task of the design layout of the vane endwall cooling system. The present study is directed towards establishing new in-depth aerodynamic and endwall heat transfer knowledge for an advanced <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> of a modern industrial gas turbine. To reach this objective the physical processes and effects which cause the different flow fields and the endwall heat transfer pattern in a baseline configuration, a combustion chamber variant, a heat shield variant without and with additional cooling air and a cavity variant without and with additional cooling air have been investigated. The variants, which differ from the simplified baseline configuration, apply design elements which are commonly used in real modern gas turbines. This research area is crucial for the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> endwall heat transfer, especially for the advanced design of the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> of a modern industrial gas turbine and has so far hardly been investigated in the open literature. For the experimental aerodynamic and endwall heat transfer research of the baseline configuration of the advanced <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> geometry a new low pressure, low temperature test facility has been developed, designed and constructed, since no experimental heat transfer data exist in the open literature {{for this type of}} vane configuration. The new test rig consists of a linear cascade with the baseline configuration of the advanced <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> geometry with four upscaled airfoils and three flow passages. For the aerodynamic tests the two middle airfoils and the hub and the tip endwall are instrumented with pressure taps to monitor the Mach number distribution. For the heat transfer tests the temperature distribution on the hub endwall is measured via thermography. The analysis of these measurements, including comparisons to research in the open literature shows that the new test rig generates accurate and reproducible results which give confidence that it is a reliable tool for the experimental aerodynamic and heat transfer research on the advanced <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> of a modern industrial gas turbine. Previous own research work together with the numerical analysis performed {{in another part of the}} project as well as conclusions from a detailed literature study lead to the conclusion that advanced Navier-Stokes CFD tools with the v 2 -f turbulence model are most suitable for the calculation of the flow field and the endwall heat transfer of turbine vanes and blades. Therefore this numerical tool, validated against different vane and blade geometries and for different flow conditions, has been chosen for the numerical aerodynamic and endwall heat transfer research of the advanced <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> of a modern industrial gas turbine. The evaluation of the numerical and experimental investigations of the baseline configuration of the advanced design of a <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> shows the flow field of an advanced mid-loaded airfoil design with the features to reduce total airfoil losses. For the hub endwall of the baseline configuration of the advanced design of a <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> the flow characteristics and heat transfer features of the classical vane endwall secondary flow model can be detected with a very weak intensity and geometric extension compared to the studies of less advanced vane geometries in the open literature. A detailed analysis of the numerical simulations and the experimental data showed very good qualitative and quantitative agreement for the three-dimensional flow field and the endwall heat transfer. These findings, together with the evaluations obtained from the open literature, lead to the conclusions that selected CFD software Fluent together with the applied v 2 -f turbulence model exhibits a high level of general applicability and is not tuned to a special vane or blade geometry. Therefore the CFD code Fluent with the v 2 -f turbulence model has been selected for the research of the influence of the several geometric variants of the baseline configuration on the flow field and the hub endwall heat transfer of the advanced <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> of a modern industrial gas turbine. Most of the vane endwall heat transfer research in the open literature has been carried out only for baseline configurations of the flow path between combustion chamber and <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane.</b> Such a simplified geometry consists of a long, planar undisturbed approach length upstream of the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane.</b> The design of real modern industrial gas turbines however requires often significant variations from this baseline configuration consisting of air-cooled heat shields and purged cavities between the combustion chamber and the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane.</b> A detailed evaluation of the flow field and the endwall heat transfer shows major differences between the baseline and the heat shield configuration. The heat shield in front of the airfoil of the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> influences the secondary flow field and the endwall heat transfer pattern strongly. Additional cooling air, released under the heat shield has a distinctive influence as well. Also the cavity between the combustion chamber and the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> affects the secondary flow field and the endwall heat transfer pattern. Here the influence of additional cavity cooling air is more decisive. The results of the detailed studies of the geometric variants are applied to formulate guidelines for an optimized design of the flow path between the combustion chamber and the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> and the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> endwall cooling configuration of next-generation industrial gas turbines.

VGT has proven to provide air boost for wide engine speed range as well as reduce turbo-lag. This thesis presents the design and experimental evaluation of a variable geometry mixed flow turbocharger turbine. The mixed flow rotor {{used in this study}} consists of 12 blades with a constant inlet blade angle of + 20 °, a cone angle of 50 ° and a tip diameter of 95. 2 mm. A variable geometry stator has been designed within this work, consists of 15 vanes fitted into a ring mechanism with a pivoting range between 40 ° and 80 °. A novel <b>nozzle</b> <b>vane</b> was designed to have 40 ° lean stacking (from the axial direction). This geometrically achieves 3 -dimensional match with the mixed flow rotor and aims to improve the turbine stage performance. A conventional straight <b>nozzle</b> <b>vane</b> was also constructed {{in order to have a}} comparative design to assess the benefits of the new lean vane. The steady flow performance results are presented for vane angle settings of 40 °, 50 °, 60 °, 65 ° and 70 ° over a non-dimensional speed range of 0. 833 - 1. 667. The tests have been carried out with a permanent magnet eddy current dynamometer within a velocity ratio range of 0. 47 to 1. 09. The optimum efficiency of the variable geometry turbine was found to be approximately 5 percentage points higher than the baseline nozzleless unit. The peak efficiency of the variable geometry turbine corresponds to vane angle settings between 60 ° and 65 °, for both the lean and straight vanes. The maximum total-to-static efficiency of the turbine with lean vanes configuration was measured to be 79. 8 % at a velocity ratio of 0. 675. The equivalent value with straight vanes configuration is 80. 4 % at a velocity ratio of 0. 673. The swallowing capacity of the turbine was shown to increase with the lean vanes, as much as 17 % at 70 ° vane angle and pressure ratio of 1. 7. The turbine pulsating flow performance is presented for 50 % and 80 % equivalent speed conditions and a pulse frequency range of 20 - 80 Hz, these frequencies correspond to an engine speed range of 800 - 3200 RPM respectively. The turbine was observed to go through a period of choking within a pulse for vane angle settings between 60 ° - 70 °. The unsteady efficiency of a nozzled turbine was found to exhibit larger deviation from the quasi-steady curve compared to a nozzlesless turbine, by as much as - 19. 4 percentage points. This behaviour was found to be more pronounced towards the close nozzle settings, where the blockage effect is dominant. The nozzle ring was also shown to act as a “restrictor” which shields the turbine rotor from being completely exposed to the unsteadiness of the flow. This coupled with the phase shifting ambiguity was shown to result in the inaccuracy of the point-by-point instantaneous efficiency; where as much as 25 % of a cycle exhibits instantaneous efficiency above unity. Finally the turbine was tested by adapting to the pulsating flow (20 - 60 Hz) by cyclic variation in the opening and closing of the nozzle vanes, called Active Control Turbocharger (A. C. T.). The <b>nozzle</b> <b>vane</b> operating schedules for each pulse period were evaluated experimentally in two general modes; natural oscillating opening/closing of the nozzle vanes due to the pulsating flow and the forced sinusoidal oscillation of the vanes to match the incoming pulsating flow. The spring stiffness was found to be a dominant factor in the effectiveness of the natural oscillation mode. In the best setting, the turbine energy extraction was shown to improve by 6. 1 % over a cycle for the 20 Hz flow condition. In overall it was demonstrated an optimum A. C. T. operating condition could be achieved by allowing the nozzle ring to oscillate naturally in pulsating flow, against an external spring pre-load, which eliminates the use of complex mechanism and external drive.

The region of the minimum cooling effectiveness (44. 8 %) was positioned at the leading edge. And the results show that the TBC layer increases the average cooling effectiveness up to 18 %. ? ??? ??????? ????????????(???? : KA 000157) ? &# 39;??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ?????? ?? ? ?????? ??&# 39; ????(?????????) ? ??? ???????...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of a combustor located just upstream 13; of a <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> cascade on the heat flux distribution to the <b>nozzle</b> guide <b>vane</b> was experimentally investigated. The surface temperature distribution around the connectivity cooled vane of the cascade was obtained by local the cascade firstly, in a low turbulence uniform hot gas stream, secondly in a high turbulence, uniform hot gas stream and thirdly in a high turbulence, non-uniform hot gas stream present just downstream of the combustor can {{be accounted for by}} the prevailing turbulence level measured at cascade inlet in cold-flow conditions and the average gas temperature at the cascade inlet...|$|R
