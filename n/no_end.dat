5|$|Eichmann stated at {{his later}} interrogations that Heydrich told him in mid-September that Hitler had ordered that all Jews in German-controlled Europe {{were to be}} killed. The initial plan was to {{implement}} Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union. However, with the entry of the United States into the war in December and the German failure in the Battle of Moscow, Hitler decided that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight. Around this time, Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel), the highest rank he achieved.|$|E
5|$|In the {{resulting}} Cabinet meeting on naval deployments on 7 September, Thorneycroft and Mountbatten argued {{the case for}} the forcing of the Strait with the task force, acknowledging that though the carrier would be at risk of severe damage or loss, preventing Sukarno from achieving a victory of brinkmanship was worth the peril. Though Foreign Secretary R.A. Butler strongly represented Begg's argument that the Victorious was too valuable an asset to lose, Thorneycroft's arguments won out. The Cabinet concurred that the ship should not be diverted, as a blockage of the carrier would increase Sukarno's prestige to <b>no</b> <b>end,</b> and approved preparations for Operation Althorpe, a plan to wipe out the Indonesian air force in retaliation for an attack. Although no precipitous decision was made, and though the Cabinet had agreed to examine the matter further.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler {{to draft}} a new plan for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
5|$|Land {{was also}} {{an issue in the}} coming of the war. While the French colonists—most of whom were farmers who {{seasonally}} engaged in fur trade—had always been relatively few, there seemed to be <b>no</b> <b>end</b> of settlers in the British colonies, who wanted to clear the land of trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east, and this motivated their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement, although they were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers, and that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.|$|E

5|$|The {{third factor}} {{which led to}} the quick {{disintegration}} of II Corps was the poor state of morale amongst the soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. By 1975, the morale of South Vietnamese soldiers and their commanding officers had reached its lowest point as the war continued to drag on with <b>no</b> <b>end</b> in sight. The determination of the ARVN officer corps had taken a serious blow when South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam returned from the United States in February 1975, and reported that no additional military or economic aid had been offered. When the order was given to abandon the Central Highlands, the primary concern of South Vietnamese military personnel was not battlefield victories, but the welfare of their families. Consequently, when the North Vietnamese attacked South Vietnamese forces on Route 7, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers left the battlefield to search for their families amidst the chaos. During the final days of South Vietnam’s existence, the average South Vietnamese soldier showed more loyalty to his family than to his commanding officer, which {{had a significant impact on}} his willingness to fight on.|$|E

25|$|The Raëlian Movement, {{who believe}} that extraterrestrials {{originally}} created all life on earth, use a symbol that is often the source of considerable controversy: an interlaced star of David and a swastika.
