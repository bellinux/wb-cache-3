40|$|ABSTRACT: One of the {{principal}} components of the contaminant load in urban stormwater runoff is oil and grease (O&G) pollution, resulting from vehicle emissions. A mulch layer {{was used as a}} contaminant trap to remove O&G (dissolved and particulate-associated naphthalene, dissolved toluene, and dissolved motor oil hydrocarbons) from a synthetic runoff during a bench-scale infiltration study. Approximately 80 to 95 % removal of all contaminants from synthetic runoff was found via sorption and filtration. Subsequently, approximately 90 % of the sorbed <b>naphthalene,</b> toluene, <b>oil,</b> and particulate-associated <b>naphthalene</b> was biodegraded within approximately 3, 4, 8, and 2 days after the event, respectively, based on decreases in contaminant concentrations coupled with increases of microbial populations. These results indicate the effectiveness and sustainability of placing a thin layer of mulch on the surface of a bioretention facility for reducing O&G pollution from urban stormwater runoff.

Wastewater treatment plant of coking plant in Bao Gang applied A/O process in biological treatment, used special treatment agent-M 180 by coagulation and sedimentation process. Through treatment, the parameters reached the first grade of GB 13456 - 92. It is of great reference significance for process debug and operation of the coking wastewater treatment system. Foreword Coking Wastewater are discharged from coking, gasification and refining process of chemical products. From the generated source separation, there are water in the coal(surface water and combined water), water from process of recovery and refining of chemical products. Coking wastewater contains but ammonia, cyanide, thiocyanate, fluoride and other inorganic pollutants, also phenol, <b>oil,</b> <b>naphthalene,</b> pyridine, quinoline, anthracene and other poly-cyclic aromatics, {{all of which are}} difficult to treat biologically. Coking wastewater treatment plant of coking plant in Bao Gang is responsible for the treatment of wastewater from production of the new system of coking plant. Due to the increase of coke production in recent years, waste production has been rising, followed by constantly tightening emissions standards. The original conventional activated sludge system can no longer meet the requirements. According to actual situation, 2007 construction of 350...|$|R
40|$|Biodegradation {{requires}} {{identification of}} hydrocarbon degrading microbes {{and the investigation}} of psychrotolerant hydrocarbon degrading microbes is essential for successful biodegradation in cold seawater. In the present study, a total of 597 Bacillus isolates were screened to select psychrotolerant strains and 134 isolates were established as psychrotolerant {{on the basis of}} their ability to grow at 7 °C. Hydrocarbon degradation capacities of these 134 psychrotolerant isolate were initially investigated on agar medium containing different hydrocarbons (<b>naphthalene,</b> n-hexadecane, mineral <b>oil)</b> and 47 positive isolates were grown in broth medium containing hydrocarbons at 20 °C under static culture. Bacterial growth was estimated in terms of viable cell count (cfu ml – 1). Isolates showing the best growth in static culture were further grown in presence of crude oil under shaking culture and viable cell count was observed between 8. 3 × 10 5 – 7. 4 × 10 8 cfu ml – 1. In the final step, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) (chrysene and naphthalene) degradation yield of two most potent isolates was determined by GC-MS along with the measurement of pH, biomass and emulsification activities. Results showed that isolates Ege B. 6. 2 i and Ege B. 1. 4 Ka have shown 60 % and 36 % chrysene degradation yield, respectively, while 33 % and 55 % naphthalene degradation yield, respectively, with emulsification activities ranges between 33 – 50 %.

30|$|Coal, being {{primary source}} of energy is {{essential}} for living and sustainable advancement of any nation. Besides this, it is utilized as an important and imperious reserve for the manufacture of products like creosote <b>oil,</b> <b>naphthalene,</b> phenol and benzene. Materials like activated carbon, carbon blacks and electrodes, have been synthesized from coal (Zhou et al. 2012). Compared with crystalline carbon allotropes, so-called lattice solids, such as graphite and diamond that have found applications {{in areas such as}} microelectronics, optoelectronics and biomedicine. The crystalline carbon within the coal structure consists of abundant irregular, polymerized aromatic hydrocarbon units, such as angstrom- or nanometer-sized crystalline carbon domains that are joined by weak cross-links. As coals possess many poly-aromatic structures similar to sp 2 bonding character of graphene, they are used as precursors for the production of nanomaterials. With the advent of carbon nano-structures, scientific research on coal based products have recently received ever-increasing attention (Geim 2009; Li et al. 2006; Zhou et al. 2012; Binoy et al. 2009; Das et al. 2016; Manoj and Kunjomana 2014). Zhou et al. (2012) derived graphene and graphene-noble metal composites with anthracite coal as precursor by catalytic graphitization. Dong et al. (2014) synthesized graphene quantum dots, carbon dots and graphite nanocrystals from different coals with chemical oxidation and series of centrifugation. A facile method to synthesis tunable graphene quantum dots from coal by chemical oxidation and sonication was reported by Ye et al. (2013). They also investigated the presence of nano structure in high rank coals like bituminous coal, anthracite and coke.|$|R
40|$|While {{the role}} of trefoil factors (TFF) in the {{maintenance}} of epithelial integrity in the gastrointestinal tract is well known, their involvement in wound healing in the conducting airway is less well understood. We defined the pattern of expression of TFF 1, TFF 2, and TFF 3 in the airways of mice during repair of both severe (300 mg/kg) and moderate (200 mg/kg) naphthalene-induced Clara cell injury. Quantitative real-time PCR for tff messenger RNA expression and immunohistochemistry for protein expression were applied to airway samples obtained by microdissection of airway trees or to fixed lung tissue from mice at 6 and 24 h and 4 and 7 days after exposure to either <b>naphthalene</b> or an <b>oil</b> (vehicle) control. All three TFF were expressed in normal whole lung and airways. TFF 2 was the most abundant and was enriched in airways. Injury of the airway epithelium by 300 mg/kg naphthalene caused a significant induction of tff 1 gene expression at 24 h, 4 days, and 7 days. In contrast, tff 2 was decreased in the high-dose group at 24 h and 4 days but returned to baseline levels by 7 days. tff 3 gene expression was not significantly changed at any time point. Protein localization via immunohistochemistry did not directly correlate with the gene expression measurements. TFF 1 and TFF 2 expression was most intense in the degenerating Clara cells in the injury target zone at 6 and 24 h. Following the acute injury phase, TFF 1 and TFF 2 were localized to the luminal apices of repairing epithelial cells and to the adjacent mesenchyme in focal regions that correlated with bifurcations and the bronchoalveolar duct junction. The temporal pattern of increases in TFF 1, TFF 2, and TFF 3 indicate a role in cell death as well as proliferation, migration, and differentiation phases of airway epithelial repair...|$|R
40|$|The gradual {{decline in}} {{conventional}} oil production {{combined with an}} increasing world energy demand has made the production and upgrading of heavy and extra heavy oil feedstocks crucial {{for the future of}} the global energy market. Properties of heavy oil such as high viscosity and high specific gravity as well as the high percentage of asphaltenes, heteroatoms and metals cause severe problems during extraction and refining processes. As a result, traditional upgrading technologies are not suitable as a standalone method to process these feedstocks. This makes necessary the development of alternative or complementary technologies to process heavy oil feedstocks in a more efficient and environmentally friendly way. This work is aimed to study an alternative heavy oil upgrading process that takes advantage of the unique properties of water at near-critical and supercritical conditions as reaction medium to perform the oxidative cracking of heavy oil feedstocks. The process consists of three main stages including the partial oxidation, cracking of the molecule, and removal of part of the oxygen incorporated from the final product. The process was studied using phenanthrene and methyl <b>naphthalene</b> as heavy <b>oil</b> model compounds and also Maya oil vacuum residue as real feedstock. This was performed in a purposely built microbomb batch reactor and an oxidative cracking flow reactor. The effect of the main process variables and the potential reaction pathways were studied with model compounds. Then the process was tested with real feedstock and the inclusion of a zeolite based catalyst to enhance yields to light oil was considered. It was found that process conditions have an important influence in the yield and selectivity to different product fractions. Optimum conditions to maximize the production of organic soluble products were determined. It was observed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were not reactive in the absence or at low concentration of reactive oxygen species. However, oxygenated intermediates continued to react in water alone. In addition, it was observed that intermediate products were mainly oxygenated compounds and that the oxygenation proceeded preferentially through central rings. A hydrogen rich gas product was obtained. Experiments with vacuum residue showed that high yields to liquid products with low boiling point are obtained keeping low yields to coke at most conditions studied. The addition of a zeolite based catalyst showed improvement in the process, increasing the yield to light oil and reducing the average molecular weight of the product. Heteroatoms and metals present were mainly removed as coke and showed to be relatively stable. Open Acces...|$|R
