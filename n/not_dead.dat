5|$|During {{the years}} of legal proceedings, {{disability}} rights groups and activists closely monitored and involved themselves in the case. In March 2003, twelve disability rights groups, led by <b>Not</b> <b>Dead</b> Yet, along with four other amici, filed an amicus curiae brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo's feeding tube.

5|$|There was {{considerable}} confusion following Shout's death. Army Headquarters in Melbourne cabled Rose Shout on 15 August to inform her that Alfred had been wounded. Confirmation {{of his death}} was conveyed to her, but was contradicted by a later cable on 23 August. This communication stated that Shout was <b>not</b> <b>dead,</b> but alive and returning to Australia aboard the Thermistocles. The press in Australia published news of his pending return, adding that he would arrive in Sydney in mid-September. This {{proved to be a}} case of mistaken identity. Shout's death was confirmed by 26 August; a Lieutenant A.J. Shirt, also of the 1st Battalion, was the officer aboard the Thermistocles. Rose Shout received a ministerial apology for the clerical errors and distress caused.|$|E

Soon, Rory {{falls into the}} ocean, and the Doctor rationalises that the Siren has shown intelligence and will likely get to Rory before he drowns and convinces her to save him. Believing the victims are <b>not</b> <b>dead,</b> the Doctor convinces Avery and Amy to prick themselves to get the Siren to take them. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed when the Siren's touch actually teleports them to an alien spaceship, invisible {{in the same spot}} the pirate ship is located.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} {{solstice}} meeting, the gods are finally convinced by Artemis {{to take action against}} the Titans. Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and her acceptance {{is the only thing that}} prevents the onset of the Great Prophecy. Percy is told by his father that Luke is somehow <b>not</b> <b>dead,</b> and he and Annabeth return to Camp Half-Blood worried about the future. Before he can relax, however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico blames Percy, and when a group of spartoi arrive to attack the son of Poseidon, Nico banishes them to the realm of Hades, and Percy realizes that he must be a son of Hades. Nico runs away, and the only people Percy tells the truth are Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide this fact from everyone else, especially the Titan's army.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is <b>not</b> <b>dead,</b> as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E

5|$|Though the Qing under Dorgon's {{leadership}} {{had successfully}} pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China, Ming loyalism was <b>not</b> <b>dead</b> yet. In early August 1652, Li Dingguo, {{who had served}} as general in Sichuan under bandit king Zhang Xianzhong (d. 1647) and was now protecting the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming, retook Guilin (Guangxi province) from the Qing. Within a month, most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side. Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in Huguang and Guangdong {{in the next two}} years, Li failed to retake important cities. In 1653, the Qing court put Hong Chengchou in charge of retaking the southwest. Headquartered in Changsha (in what is now Hunan province), he patiently built up his forces; only in late 1658 did well-fed and well-supplied Qing troops mount a multipronged campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan. In late January 1659, a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan, sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby Burma, which was then ruled by King Pindale Min of the Toungoo dynasty. The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662, when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui, the former Ming general whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the Qing conquest of China.|$|E
