5|$|On May 22, 1998, Tech Tower {{was officially}} renamed the Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans Administration Building in a {{ceremony}} presided over by Tech president G. Wayne Clough. Although <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> her husbands attended Georgia Tech as a student, Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans was a longtime benefactor of the Institute, contributing over $340million through her philanthropic organization, the Lettie Pate Evans Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Sherwood also adopted {{neglected}} or orphaned {{children from}} the camp. In 1807 she adopted Annie Child, a three-year-old who had been given too much medicinal gin and in 1808 a malnourished two-year-old Sally Pownal. She found homes for those she could not adopt and founded an orphanage. In 1816, {{on the advice of}} doctors, she and her family returned to Britain; in her autobiography Sherwood relates that she was continually ill in India and it was believed at the time that <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> any of her children could survive in a tropical climate.|$|E
5|$|White {{retired in}} 1965 after 48 years of {{teaching}} and administration. In her retirement, White {{was appointed to the}} university's Institute for Research in the Humanities. She suffered a heart attack in 1966, whereupon her health declined, though she continued to work at the university's Memorial Library. In the next spring, White became sick and died on June 7, 1967. <b>Neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> her three siblings had married. A memorial service was held in Madison's St. Paul's University Chapel on May 19, 1968.|$|E

5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sue Ellen {{goes into}} {{business}} by buying a partnership {{interest in a}} lingerie company.

5|$|The novel centres on the {{character}} of Katinka Bai, a quiet, sensitive young woman married to a boisterous and somewhat vulgar station master, Bai. The marriage is barren, and she remains isolated. Almost subconsciously, she passionately longs after something undefinable. Even after the arrival of Huus, a neighbour with whom she begins to establish a promising relationship, she is unable to fulfill her passion, although {{for the first time in}} her life she falls in love. In the small provincial community where they live, <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> Huus dares to break the conventions they know, sad as it all may be. When they realize they cannot take their attachment any further, they decide to separate and Huus leaves the country. At the end of the novel, as at the beginning, Katinka stands by the wayside, observing life glide by.|$|E

50|$|Like {{her husband}} she always {{followed}} {{the path of}} simplicity and impeccable integrity and insisted others to follow the same course in public life. She suffered a lot and had very tough times but she never compromised with her principles. <b>Neither</b> <b>she</b> demanded <b>nor</b> accepted any favours from anyone throughout her life.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>neither</b> consented <b>nor</b> refused, {{being taken}} by surprise, but O'Gorman sat down without {{requiring}} an answer.|$|R
25|$|It {{seems that}} Morris played {{a large part}} in {{converting}} Besant to Marxism, but {{it was to the}} SDF, not his Socialist League, that she turned in 1888. She remained a member {{for a number of years}} and became one of its best speakers. She was still a member of the Fabian Society; <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> anyone else seemed to think the two movements incompatible at the time.|$|E
25|$|On 24 December Hero wrecked off the Texel {{in a storm}} {{with the}} loss of all but 12 men of her 600 man crew. Grasshopper {{observed}} Hero ground, but too late to avoid also grounding. Grasshopper was able to get over the sandbank into deeper water, where she anchored, though striking ground repeatedly. She was unable to go to the assistance of Hero and within 15 minutes the distress signals from Hero ceased. Next morning Grasshopper observed Hero completely wrecked. <b>Neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> the Dutch schuyts could get to Hero.|$|E
25|$|By mid-2010, Clinton and Obama {{had clearly}} forged a good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside, and was careful to make sure that <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> her husband would upstage him. He in turn was accommodating to her viewpoints and in some cases adopted some of her more hawkish approaches. She met with him weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents, such as Condoleezza Rice with George W. Bush, James Baker with George H. W. Bush, or Henry Kissinger with Richard Nixon. Nevertheless, he had trust in her actions.|$|E

25|$|Documents {{filed with}} Wade's plea {{say that he}} took Harris to dinner in March 2005, {{a year after the}} illegal contributions, where they {{discussed}} the possibility of another fundraiser and the possibility of getting funding for a Navy counterintelligence program placed in Harris's district. Harris sent a letter on April 26, 2005 to defense appropriations subcommittee Chairman C. W. Bill Young, in which Harris sought $10million for a Navy project backed by Wade. In the letter, Harris emphasized the importance of the project, asking that it be added to her list of five priorities and identifying it as her new No. 3. Harris later released the April 26, 2005 letter for legal scrutiny, but <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> Young would turn over the request form (RFP) used for the proposal.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Momota {{appeared}} in Mika Ninagawa's cosplay photoshoot {{series in the}} fashion magazine Zipper dressed as a bee and a ladybug. She continued to appear as a model in Ninagawa's works in Mgirl magazine from Fall/Winter 2011/2012 {{and again in the}} issue from Spring/Summer 2013. On April 14, 2012, Momota succeeded famous child actress Mana Ashida as subhost of the Nippon Television show Meringue no Kimochi. At that time, <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> Momoiro Clover Z was widely known. But when in 2013 it was announced that she would leave the program after almost a year and a half, there were worries that it would affect the popularity of the show. In August 2013, Momota became the first person to appear on both the front and back covers of an issue of QuickJapan magazine, which also published a lengthy interview with her.|$|E
25|$|Capitalism is decried in Petals of Blood, {{with the}} new Kenyan elite portrayed as {{controlled}} by the 'faceless system of capitalism'. The everyman loses out to capitalist endeavours, and is essentially exploited by the new Kenyan elite. Farmers are forced to mark out their lands and mortgage them with loans linked {{to the success of}} their harvest; as the quality of the harvests waver, many are forced to sell their land, unable to match their loan repayments. Thang'eta is another symbol of capitalism. Taken from a drink that Nyakinyua brews in a traditional ceremony, it is soon marketed, and becomes extremely popular. Wanja, who introduces the drink to Abdulla's bar, is then exploited by big business who forces her to stop her Thang'eta operation. <b>Neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> Munira, who creates the slogan, receive the fruits of their labour. Originally a drink used to help people relax and escape their current problems, it becomes 'a drink of strife'.|$|E

25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{may be used}} where a {{woman who}} has eggs but no uterus and wants to have a biological baby; she would require the help of a gestational carrier or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, {{a woman who has}} no eggs but a uterus may utilize egg donor IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called embryo donation). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational surrogacy arrangements must make sense of an entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations. Surrogates have the experience of carrying a baby that they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new conceptualizations of body and self.|$|E
500|$|As {{a part of}} the 4th Flotilla, U-69 sank 31 {{ships with}} a {{combined}} gross register tonnage of 102,875 in five war patrols. U-69 left Emden on her sixth patrol on 9 July 1917 for operations off Ireland. On 11 July, U-69 reported her position off Norway but <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> any of her crew were ever heard from again. British records say that U-69 was sunk by destroyer [...] on 12 July, but a German postwar study cast doubt on this. U-69s fate is officially unknown.|$|E
500|$|A chillwave midtempo {{song with}} {{elements}} of R, hip hop and trap music, [...] "No Angel" [...] features a minimalistic production and instrumentation consisting mostly of bass. BeyoncÃ© uses a high vocal register, singing in falsetto with breathy vocals. Lyrically, the song features the protagonist declaring that <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> her love interest are perfect. [...] "No Angel" [...] received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics who praised its composition and the singer's vocal performance; however {{some of them}} criticized its placement on the album.|$|E

500|$|Ono {{was pleased}} that Jackson had {{acquired}} Northern Songs and called it a [...] "blessing". Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, [...] "Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael has. He loves the songs. He's very caring." [...] She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> McCartney needed that. [...] "If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Henry Tippett's bride was Isabel Kemp, {{from a large}} {{upper-middle class}} family based in Kent. Among her mother's cousins was Charlotte Despard, a {{well-known}} campaigner for women's rights, suffragism, and Irish home rule. Despard was a powerful influence on the young Isabel, who was herself briefly imprisoned after participating in an illegal [...] suffragette protest in Trafalgar Square. Although <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> Henry was musical, she had inherited an artistic talent from her mother, who had exhibited at the Royal Academy. After their marriage the couple settled outside London in Eastcote [...] where two sons were born, the second, Michael, on 2 January 1905.|$|E
500|$|As {{a part of}} the Baltic and 4th Flotillas, U-66 sank 24 {{ships with}} a {{combined}} gross register tonnage of 69,967 in six war patrols. The U-boat also torpedoed and damaged the British cruiser [...] in August 1916. U-66 left Emden on her seventh patrol on 2 September 1917 for operations in the North Channel. The following day the U-boat reported her position in the North Sea but <b>neither</b> <b>she</b> <b>nor</b> any of her 40-man crew were ever heard from again. A postwar German study offered no explanation for U-66s loss, although British records suggest that she may have struck a mine in the Dogger Bank area.|$|E
