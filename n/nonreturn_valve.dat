50|$|Unlike other bagpipes, the koza {{has three}} drones: {{one in the}} {{separate}} drone-pipe, and two in the chanter, which has three channels.This wind instrument consists of a single reed pipe, often made of a cane blade lapped onto copper tubing set into motion when wind is fed by arm pressure on a goat-skin bag. The pipe is held in a wooden socket tied into the bag, which is inflated by the mouth (through a blowpipe with a leather <b>nonreturn</b> <b>valve).</b> The finger holes of the pipe, or chanter, play melodies while the remaining pipes, or drones, sound single notes tuned against the chanter by means of extendable joints.|$|E
40|$|The HDR-SRV 350 {{blowdown}} experiments {{reported here}} were to determine by measurement and calculation the structural dynamic {{reaction of the}} feedwater line {{in response to the}} pressure waves induced by pipe rupture or closing of the <b>nonreturn</b> <b>valve.</b> The two subreports present the evaluation of the maximum and the minimum of all measured and calculated structural displacements and of tangential stresses. (orig.) In den HDR-SRV 350 -Blowdown-Versuchen wurden strukturdynamische Reaktionen der Speisewasserleitung infolge Rohrbruch oder Absperren des Rueckschlagventils entstehender Druckwellen gemessen und berechnet. Die beiden Teilberichte enthalten die Auswertung des Maximum und Minimum aller gemessenen und berechneten Verschiebungen sowie der Tangentialspannungen. (orig.)

40|$|Safe {{conveyance}} of high-temperature molten {{materials is}} an essential facter for some advanced industries. The authors developed a new prototype pump for such applications. The pump utilized the pumping effect of a vibrating pipe system and featured a simple and novel configuration. Its structural and hydrodynamic features {{are different from those}} of previous conventional pumps. The pump structure constitutes a short vibrating pipe with a <b>nonreturn</b> <b>valve,</b> a long connecting rod and a cylindrical casing. It was driven by an air actuator. Tests were carried out with this prototype pump using high-temperature molten salt of 473 K to 673 K as a test fluid. Test results indicated that the air actuator was suitable to drive the pump and the pump performance was stable even at such high temperatures...|$|E
50|$|At Pickering, {{the vacuum}} duct was closed by <b>nonreturn</b> <b>valves,</b> to prevent {{flow of the}} steam/air mixture from the duct to a non-accident reactor unit {{following}} a LOCA. In the Bruce concept, {{there is no such}} non-return valve; the reactor buildings are all interconnected during normal operation.|$|R
