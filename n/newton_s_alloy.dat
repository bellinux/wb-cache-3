40|$|A recent {{paper by}} Erik Verlinde [1] argues that gravity {{should be viewed}} not as a {{fundamental}} force, but as an emergent thermodynamic phenomenon due to some yet undetermined microscopic theory. Using well-established thermodynamic principles along with the holographic principle, Verlinde proposes that gravity {{can be seen as}} an entropic force as opposed to a fundamental one. Using this idea, Verlinde claims to be able to derive <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> 2 nd law, <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> law of universal gravitation, and Einstein gravity. We present a challenge to this reformulation of gravity. Our contention is that a detailed examination of Verlinde s argument shows that such a theory cannot correctly give <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> laws or Einstein gravity. We find that the Poisson equation for Newtonian gravity is not uniquely determined using Verlinde s theory. We are also able to show that Verlinde s theory does not uniquely determine Einstein s field equations. Specific calculations can also be done in the Reissner-Nordstrom and Schwarzschild metrics to show that the entropy of these black holes do not agree with accepted values of these entropies. _x 000 D_We will begin by introducing results by Hawking, Unruh, and Bekenstein that motivate the relationship between gravity and thermodynamics. We then summarize Verlinde s proposal of gravity being a thermodynamic phenomenon. From this new theory, we can make calculations using the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom metrics to determine if Verlinde s theory is compatible with well-known calculations for the temperature and entropy of black holes with these metrics. Finally, we will present a detailed explanation as to why we believe Verlinde s derivation of the Poisson equation and Einstein s field equations is flawed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Beta- 21 <b>S</b> {{titanium}} <b>alloy</b> {{is ranked}} {{among the most important}} advanced materials for a variety of technological applications, due to its combination of a high strength/weight ratio, good corrosion behavior and oxidation resistance. However, in many of these technological applications, this alloy is exposed to environments which can act as sources of hydrogen, and consequently, severe problems may arise. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the influence of high fugacity hydrogen on Beta- 21 <b>S</b> <b>alloy</b> in as-received (mill-annealed and hot-rolled) condition. Hydrogen effects on the microstructure are studied using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, while the absorption and desorption characteristics are determined respectively by means of a hydrogen determinator and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Preliminary results at room temperature revealed hydrogen-induced straining and expansion of the lattice parameters. However, neither second phases formation (hydrides), nor hydrogen-induced cracking, were observed after hydrogenation. The main characteristics of hydrogen absorption/desorption behavior, as well as hydrogen-induced microstructural changes in both microstructures are discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} entropic forces has risen considerably since E. Verlinde proposed to interpret the force in <b>Newton</b> <b>s</b> second law and Gravity as entropic forces [1]. Brownian motion, the motion of a small particle (pollen) driven by random impulses from the surrounding molecules, may be the first example of a stochastic process in which such forces are expected to emerge. In this note it is shown that at least two types of entropic force can be identified in the case of 3 D Brownian motion (or random walk). This yields simple derivations of known results of Brownian motion, Hook s law and, applying an external (non-radial) force, Curie s law and the Langevin-Debye equation.

The ash concentration in chars ranged between 9. 04 to 12. 61 wt %, with alumina and silica as predominant ash components. The contact angles of these chars with liquid Fe- 2 % C- 0. 01 % <b>S</b> <b>alloy</b> showed lesser variations with time as compared to corresponding angles with electrolytic iron. While the initial contact angles ranged between 106 ° and 137 °, the contact angles for all coal-chars were quite similar after 60 minutes of contact (105 - 110 °). While no well defined correlations could be observed between the initial char structure (Lc values) and ash concentration / composition and contact angles {{in the initial stages}} of contact, the contact angles over extended periods were significantly affected by the presence of reaction products and impurity deposits in the interfacial region. With coal-chars generally showing a non-wetting behavior with liquid iron, these results are discussed in terms of the transfer of carbon and sulphur by mass transport across the interface, the formation of an enriched interfacial layer containing calcium, sulphur and alumina, reduction of reducible oxides such as silica and iron oxides, and possible transfer of these elements into the liquid iron...|$|R
