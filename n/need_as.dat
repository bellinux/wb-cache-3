5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is {{because they believe that}} taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at <b>need</b> <b>as</b> well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Macdonald {{plunged into}} {{his role as}} a leading {{champion}} for the provinces. He argued that in order to maintain their independence, provinces needed exclusive jurisdiction over such sources of revenue as gasoline, electricity and amusement taxes. He lobbied for constitutional amendments designed to guarantee provincial rights. Macdonald urged the federal government to accept the 1940 recommendations of the Rowell-Sirois Commission and redistribute national wealth based on need. Such a policy, he maintained, would enable poorer provinces to sustain government services available {{in other parts of the}} country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation. In the end, Macdonald won only small victories such as gaining exclusive provincial access to gasoline taxes. The federal government refused to recognize financial <b>need</b> <b>as</b> the basis for provincial subsidies.|$|E

5|$|Scholarships at McGill are {{relatively}} difficult to attain, {{compared to other}} Canadian universities. For out-of-province first year undergraduate students, a high school average of 95% is required to receive a guaranteed one-year entrance scholarship. To be considered for the same scholarships, Quebec CEGEP students need a minimum R-score of 35.5, United States high school students need a minimum A average {{as well as at}} least 700 in each SAT or 33 in the ACT, and French Baccalaureate students need an average of 15.5 plus a minimum score of 14 in each course; similarly, students in the British education system <b>need</b> <b>As</b> in both GCSE Level and predicted Advanced Level results, and International Baccalaureate students need to attain a minimum overall average of 6.9 on predicted grades or a score of 42 on exam results. In general, entrance scholarship recipients rank in the top 1â€“2% of their class.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the Educational Testing Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical <b>need</b> <b>as</b> well, since the number of students enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year. Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E

Eventually, on May 26, 1927, Ford Motor Company ceased US production and began the changeovers required to produce the Model A.

25|$|By mid-1984, it {{was evident}} that another drought and {{resulting}} famine of major proportions had begun to affect large parts of northern Ethiopia. Just as evident was the government's inability to provide relief. The almost total failure of crops in the north was compounded by fighting in and around Eritrea, which hindered the passage of relief supplies. Although international relief organizations made a major effort to provide food to the affected areas, the persistence of drought and poor security conditions in the north resulted in continuing <b>need</b> <b>as</b> well as hazards for famine relief workers. In late 1985, another year of drought was forecast, and by early 1986 the famine had spread to parts of the southern highlands, with an estimated 5.8million people dependent on relief food. In 1986, locust plagues exacerbated the problem.|$|E
25|$|In the 90's the U.S. {{initially}} {{started using}} more natural gas because new technology {{was able to}} lower its generation costs and pipeline expansion was able to increase its availability. Then under the Presidency of George W. Bush (2000-2008), {{a combination of factors}} led to a growth in the natural gas industry. Bush passed the Energy Policy Act in 2005, that exempted chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Water Drinking Act, which means more places were being fracked. Starting around the same time hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling became more widely used since they made shale energy reserves more accessible. The industry pushed to drill more natural gas in more places, because they believed that they had the technology, expertise, and <b>need</b> <b>as</b> well as the fact that tremendous energy and profit could be made from more sites. However, until this day 94% of the countryâ€™s offshore acreage has not been made available to energy development, despite requests from the natural gas industry.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{throughout}} most {{of the first half of}} the 17th century had a substantial wolf population of not less than 400 and may be as high as 1000 wolves at any one time. Although the Irish hunted wolves, it is evident from documentary data that they did not see the same <b>need</b> <b>as</b> the English to exterminate the wolves. Although wolves were perceived as threats, they were nonetheless seen as natural parts of the Irish landscapes. The level of rewards and bounties established by Oliver Cromwell's regime after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland attracted a few professional wolf hunters to Ireland, mostly from England. Politically, the prospect of numbers of armed Irish roaming around the country hunting wolves was not acceptable, given the ongoing conflict between the Irish and the new English settlers, so it was seen as much safer for the English authorities to encourage men from their own country to deal with the wolf problem. Wolves were exterminated from Ireland in the late 18th century, most likely 1786.|$|E
