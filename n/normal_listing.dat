In 1527 Dürer published Etliche Unterricht, zur Befestigung der Städte, Schlösser und Flecken (Instruction on the Fortification of Cities, Castles and Towns). The book goes beyond being an instruction manual on the design of a fortified city. His plan was functional, pragmatic, socially responsible and the purpose of its design was to improve the status and lifestyle of German artisans. Dürer¿s ideal city was not an isolated work it was compatible with his other writings which were to improve the artisans skills and conditions...|$|R

50|$|In {{the worst}} case, the element {{to be located}} {{is at the very}} end of the list be it a <b>normal</b> <b>list</b> or a self-organized one and thus n {{comparisons}} must be made to reach it. Therefore, the worst case running time of a linear search on the list is O(n) independent of the type of list used.Note that the expression for the average search time in the previous section is a probabilistic one. Keeping the commonly accessed elements at the head of the list simply reduces the probability of the worst case occurring but does not eliminate it completely. Even in a self-organizing list, if a lowest access probability element (obviously located at the end of the list) is to be accessed, the entire list must be traversed completely to retrieve it. This is the worst case search.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{determine}} whether patients with no alarm signs who ask the endoscopist to shorten their waiting time due to test result anxiety, represent a risk category {{for a major}} organic pathology. Methods At our open-access endoscopy service, we set up an expedite list for six months for outpatients who complained that the waiting time for gastroscopy was too long. Over this period we studied 373 gastroscopy patients. In addition to personal details, we collected information {{on the presence of}} Hp infection and compliance with dyspepsia guideline indications for gastroscopy. Results Average waiting time was 38. 2 days (SD 12. 7). The 66 patients who considered the waiting time too long underwent gastroscopy within 15 days. We made 5 diagnoses of esophageal and gastric tumour and gastric ulcer (7. 6 %) among the expedite list patients and 14 (4. 6 %) among those on the <b>normal</b> <b>list</b> (p= 0. 31). On including duodenal peptic disease in the analysis, the total prevalence rate rose to 19. 7 % in the short-wait group and to 10. 4 % (p= 0. 036) in the longer-wait group. Discussion and conclusions Our data suggests that asking to be fast-tracked does not have prognostic impact on the diagnosis of a major (gastric ulcer and cancer) pathology. </p...|$|R
