As {{there had been}} no previous separatist feeling amongst the conservative population, there was little enthusiasm for the new order. The situation in the canton of Léman was quite different.

[...] "I <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> 'Oh fuck I have to finish this record, I have to do one more song, I have to do {{something}} to this song to make it better,'" [...] Moore said. He described the process of making the album as feeling [...] "more like I was playing with this film and I was playing against it so it felt easy somehow".|$|E

In his spare time Babcock went on leave to Scotland, where he met his first girlfriend, a woman from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. He was also introduced to the pleasures of beer and the horrors of war {{that some of the}} older veterans had come across. Babcock asserts that he would have fought in the conflict, given the chance, but the war ended before he could be brought to the front lines. For this reason, Babcock claims that he <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a real soldier" [...] and rarely talked of his experiences until his centenary. He also never joined any veterans associations.|$|E

500|$|Other {{criticism}} {{focuses on}} the potential confusion of sexuality with gender in the novel. As Jay Prosser argues, “rightly tracing Hall’s debt to nineteenth-century sexologists, critics have wrongly reduced sexual inversion to homosexuality.” What many refer to as Stephen’s ‘butch lesbianism’, Prosser suggests, is actually a transgender identity. As a child, Stephen insists that s/he is male - “Yes, of course I’m a boy…I must be a boy ‘cause I feel exactly like one,” – and, when talking to her/his mother, Stephen claims that, “All my life I’ve <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a woman, and you know it.” Through Stephen’s final rejection of Mary, ostensibly so that Mary can participate in a heterosexual relationship with Martin and therefore have a more secure life, Prosser surmises that “Stephen affirms her identification with the heterosexual man”, thus rejecting lesbianism and instead aligning her/himself with the male.|$|E
500|$|Kate Elizabeth Winslet {{was born}} on 5 October 1975 in Reading, Berkshire, England, to Sally Anne (née Bridges) and Roger John Winslet. Her mother worked as a nanny and waitress, and her father, a {{struggling}} actor, took labouring jobs to support the family. Her maternal grandparents were both actors and ran the Reading Repertory Theatre Company. Winslet has two sisters, Anna and Beth, {{both of whom are}} actresses, and a younger brother, Joss. The family had limited financial means; they lived on free meal benefits and were supported by a charity named the Actor's Charitable Trust. When Winslet was 10, her father nearly lost his foot in a boating accident and found it harder to find work, leading to more financial hardships for the family. Even so, Winslet has said, [...] "We <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the poor kids, which is absolutely a credit to my parents. We lived in a lovely terrace house and we all had each other." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Till the World Ends" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop and electropop song, with an electro {{beat and}} {{elements}} of trance and Eurodance. The song opens with sirens and a [...] "sizzling" [...] bassline. Spears delivers confident and breathy vocals, in lyrics such as [...] "If {{you want this}} good shit / Sicker than the remix / Baby let me blow your mind tonight." [...] In the chorus, the song slows down while Spears sings [...] "I can't take it take it take no more / <b>Never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> felt like this before / Come on get me get me on the floor / DJ what you what you waiting for?". The melody's 4:3 cross-rhythm continues into a chant-like segment, in which [...] "whoa-oh-oh-oh" [...] is repeated. The bit was compared by Scott Shettler of AOL to the [...] "rapid word repetition" [...] of Kesha. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said the chorus [...] "comes on hard like it's the sexy spawn" [...] of American recording artist Usher's [...] "OMG" [...] (2010) and Italian band Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E

500|$|There {{was also}} {{considerable}} {{mention of the}} evolution of Underwood's relationship with Claire. [...] "heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise, with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds," [...] wrote Brian Lowry of Variety. The Atlantics Spencer Kornhaber remarked, however, that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a [...] "jump the shark" [...] moment for the series: The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist, and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities. Now, though, they've set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties. Netflix hasn't said how many seasons are to come, but it's hard to imagine the show being watchable for all that much longer now that this rubicon of despicability has been crossed.Some compared Underwood's story line in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Brian Moyland of The Guardian wrote: House of Cards has <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the real presidency: Frank Underwood is evil incarnate, bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains. But now that, in real life, we're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race, his machinations are starting to look almost viable. There are several parallels between Underwood's re-election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.|$|E
