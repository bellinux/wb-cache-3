50|$|One {{member of}} the genus Gadus is also {{commonly}} referred to as Pollock, the Alaska pollock or walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) including the form known as the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>pollock.</b> While related (they are also members of the family Gadidae) to the above pollock species, they are not members of the genus Pollachius. Alaska pollock generally spawn in late winter and early spring in the southeastern Bering Sea. The Alaska pollock is {{a significant part of the}} commercial fishery in the Gulf of Alaska.|$|E
50|$|While {{belonging}} to the same family as the Atlantic pollock, the Alaska pollock is {{not a member of}} the same Pollachius genus. Alaska pollock was long put in its own genus Theragra and classified Theragra chalcogramma, but more recent research has shown it is rather closely related to the Atlantic cod and should be moved back to genus Gadus in which it was originally described. Furthermore, <b>Norwegian</b> <b>pollock</b> (Theragra finnmarchica), a rare fish of Norwegian waters, is likely the same species as the Alaska pollock.|$|E
5000|$|Egede-Nissen was {{a member}} of the Vardø city council from 1903 to 1911. With Vardø being the easternmost town in Norway [...] - [...] and indeed in all of Western Europe [...] - [...] it formed a {{thriving}} duty-free centre for the Pomor trade of <b>Norwegian</b> <b>pollock</b> for Russian rye grain and other goods brought by merchants from Arkhangelsk. Making use of his contacts with Russian merchants and officials, Egede-Nissen was among the first Norwegians to establish working links with anti-Tsarist Russian groups. As early as 1902 he had begun printing and smuggling literature across the border into Russia promoting democracy and socialism. In 1906 he was a co-founder of Nordens Klippe, a decidedly socialist Norwegian mineworkers union.|$|E
500|$|Reaching [...] {{long and}} {{weighing}} {{as much as}} , the sei whale consumes an average of [...] of food every day; its diet consists primarily of copepods, [...] krill, and other zooplankton. [...] It is among the fastest of all cetaceans, and can reach speeds of up to [...] (27knots) over short distances. [...] The whale's name comes from the <b>Norwegian</b> word for <b>pollock,</b> a fish that appears {{off the coast of}} Norway at the same time of the year as the sei whale.|$|R
5000|$|Sei is the <b>Norwegian</b> {{word for}} <b>pollock,</b> also {{referred}} to as coalfish, a close relative of codfish. Sei whales appeared off the coast of Norway {{at the same time as}} the pollock, both coming to feed on the abundant plankton. The specific name is the Latin word borealis, meaning northern. In the Pacific, the whale has been called the Japan finner; [...] "finner" [...] was a common term used to refer to rorquals. In Japanese, the whale was called iwashi kujira, or sardine whale, a name originally applied to Bryde's whales by early Japanese whalers. Later, as modern whaling shifted to Sanriku — where both species occur — it was confused for the sei whale. Now the term only applies to the latter species. It has also been referred to as the lesser fin whale because it somewhat resembles the fin whale. The American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews compared the sei whale to the cheetah, because it can swim at great speeds [...] "for a few hundred yards", but it [...] "soon tires if the chase is long" [...] and [...] "does not have the strength and staying power of its larger relatives".|$|R

A total number of 204 variable positions were identified among the 12 pollock specimens, but no specific substitution pattern could be identified between the walleye and Norwegian pollocks. Phylogenetic analysis using 16. 500 homologous mtDNA nucleotide positions clearly identify the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>pollock</b> within the walleye pollock species cluster.
