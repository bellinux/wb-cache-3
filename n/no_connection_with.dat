5|$|In 1913, {{his father}} was {{elevated}} to the nobility for his service to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by Emperor Franz Joseph. The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation Margittai, meaning of Marghita. The family had <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> the town; the appellation was chosen in reference to Margaret, as was those chosen coat of arms depicting three marguerites. Neumann János became Margittai Neumann János (John Neumann of Marghita), which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger {{was allowed to}} sit in the jump seat in the cockpit. The passenger had <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued {{to sit in the}} cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E

5|$|Little {{information}} was revealed about Armada of the Damned plot. Sterling had <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> the film series' characters and story arcs. The {{game and the}} films shared the same universe, but the former was to take place before {{the events of the}} latter. Sterling, raised in a poor family, was a young adventurer with dreams of fame and fortune who decided to become a pirate. Although he was killed on his first voyage, Sterling was revived by supernatural forces which gave him a second chance. After these events, the player had the option to follow two paths: become either a Legendary or a Dreaded pirate. On the Legendary path, the player would be a well-respected pirate who acted in good faith. On the Dreaded path, the player would be mysterious and feared.|$|E

Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and {{had told him to}} have his men ready for work south of the river within a month.

He made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} families of MacAulays from both Ireland and Scotland which are not related and are considered to have no historical connection with Clan MacAulay. These include the Scottish Macaulays from the Western Isles (the Macaulays of Lewis and possibly the MacAulays of Uist).

5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers refer to by name. The {{language}} of composition {{is thought to be}} Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt in {{the first decades of the}} 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, conservative Christians who followed the teaching of the primitive Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating their understanding of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded as essential to salvation. Despite this, the gospel displays <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, it seems to be taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of the fragments suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support close ties to traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.|$|E

5|$|Livingstone {{agreed to}} meet Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin President and IRA-supporter, after Adams was invited to London by Labour members of the Troops Out {{campaign}} in December 1982. The same day as the invitation was made, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) bombed The Droppin Well bar in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, killing 11 soldiers and 6 civilians; in the aftermath, Livingstone was pressured to cancel the meeting. Expressing his horror at the bombing, Livingstone insisted that the meeting proceed, for Adams had <b>no</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> the INLA, but Conservative Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw banned Adams' entry to Britain with the 1976 Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. In February 1983, Livingstone visited Adams in his constituency of West Belfast, receiving a hero's welcome from local republicans. In July 1983, Adams finally came to London on the invite of Livingstone and MP Jeremy Corbyn, allowing him to present his views to a mainstream British audience through televised interviews. In August, Livingstone was interviewed on Irish state radio, proclaiming that Britain's 800-year occupation of Ireland was more destructive than the Holocaust; he was publicly criticised by Labour members and the press. He also controversially expressed solidarity with the Marxist–Leninist government of Fidel Castro in Cuba against the U.S. economic embargo, in turn receiving an annual Christmas gift of Cuban rum from the Cuban embassy.|$|E
