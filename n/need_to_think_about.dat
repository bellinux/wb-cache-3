What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E

And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

Although Lee and Michael repeatedly voiced concerns early in the task about the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> profit margins, both Ian and Kevin paid little heed to this. Michael was later heavily criticised for deciding on the prices without any knowledge of the team's costs, but defended himself against this by pointing out that Ian had consistently refused to give him this information, and that the team would have otherwise missed the deadline for printing their menus.|$|E

500|$|As Thakkar {{explained}} in a 2016 interview to The Times of India, the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System was developed {{in an era of}} 56K modems: [...] "They wanted any artist to view any number of shots, back-to-back, from part of the film, in high resolution, at 24 fps, with high quality audio, with speed-change control, from any phase of production from any department (story, editing, animation, modeling, layout, lighting, vfx, etc.)..." [...] As per Thakkar, it was a technology that allowed technicians and artists in multiple locations to simultaneously work on films in real time; one of the main provisions was useful transparency, enabling artists and technicians to seamlessly do their work without any <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the technology. Apart from the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System, Thakkar says he additionally headed DreamWorks' [...] "high performance particle system rendering software" [...] and [...] "colour management system and software".|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "Incredible" [...] {{starts off}} like a love song but reveals itself to be a plea to someone to start over, while {{changing}} its composition from the interlude. According to MTV, the shift in the structure reflected Madonna's own confusion about how she felt about her lover in the song. [...] "Can't get my head around it", she sang. [...] "I, I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featuring West, has a 70s R meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West. Williams has commented that Madonna's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before. That is reflected in songs like [...] "Spanish Lesson" [...] where she sings the line [...] "If you do your homework/ Baby I will give you more". It also has influences of Spanish music.

50|$|When {{learning}} psychomotor skills, individuals {{progress through}} the cognitive stages, the associative stage, and the autonomic stage. The cognitive stage is marked by awkward slow and choppy movements that the learner tries to control. The learner has <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> each movement before attempting it. In the associative stage, the learner spends less time thinking about every detail, however, the movements are still not a permanent part of the brain.

2500|$|Researcher, Andrew Tutt, {{argues that}} {{algorithms}} should be overseen by a specialist regulatory agency, similar to FDA. His academic work {{emphasizes that the}} rise of increasingly complex algorithms calls for the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the effects of algorithms today. Due to the nature and complexity of algorithms, it {{will prove to be}} difficult to hold algorithms accountable under criminal law. Tutt recognizes that while some algorithms will be beneficial to help meet technological demand, others should not be used or sold if they fail to meet safety requirements. Thus, for Tutt, algorithms will require [...] "closer forms of federal uniformity, expert judgment, political independence, and pre-market review to prevent the introduction of unacceptably dangerous algorithms into the market". The issue of algorithmic accountability (the responsibility of algorithm designers to provide evidence of potential or realised harms) is of particular relevance in the field of dynamic and non-linearly programmed systems, e.g. artificial neural networks, deep learning, and genetic algorithms (see Explainable AI).|$|E
2500|$|During {{the court}} case {{a number of}} emails between Woolas and his {{campaign}} team emerged. In one, Woolas' agent, Joe Fitzpatrick, emailed Woolas and campaign adviser Steven Green, to say: [...] "Things are not going as well as I had hoped... we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> our first attack leaflet." [...] A reply from Fitzpatrick said: [...] "If we don't get the white vote angry he's gone." [...] Some have criticised these tactics in light of significant existing racial tensions in the area. The court hearing finished on 17 September 2010, with the judges reserving their judgement until 5 November 2010. On that day Woolas {{was found to have}} breached section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 in relation to three of the four statements complained about, and the judges ruled that his election was void. Phil Woolas applied for a judicial review into the ruling, stating that [...] "this election petition raised fundamental issues about the freedom to question and criticise politicians." [...] and that it [...] "will inevitably chill political speech". He succeeded in overturning the finding in respect of one of the three statements but the main findings of the election court judgment were upheld. A by-election on 13 January 2011 resulted in the election of Debbie Abrahams (Labour).|$|E
40|$|For a dynamic, {{evolving}} multiagent auction, we {{have developed}} an adaptive agent bidding strategy (called the p-strategy) based on stochastic modeling. The p-strategy {{takes into account the}} dynamics and resulting uncertainties of the auction process using stochastic modeling, and avoids the shortcomings of stochastic modeling by adaptively deciding when to use the model and when not to. Our experiments show that the p-strategy outperforms other candidate bidding strategies in a continuous double auction regardless of the status of the auction and the demography of the agent population. 1. INTRODUCTION In multiagent auctions, an agent <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the participants it interacts with. A seller who tries to sell as many items with the highest markups possible, for example, <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> not only <b>about</b> the protocol of the auction but also about potential buyers and other competing sellers when submitting its bid to the auction. One reasonable strategy of a seller would be to buil [...] ...|$|R

Further work-up by the pulmonologist may confirm and classify the ILD by a detailled patient history, lung function tests, CT scans and bronchoscopy, or even surgical lung biospies, if needed. A multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) is becoming the gold standard in diagnosing ILD and deciding about appropriate treatment, in particular regarding the novel antifibrotic therapies for IPF...|$|R

2500|$|In September 2006, Timberlake {{released}} his second studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Critically and commercially acclaimed, the album spawned six singles, including the worldwide hits [...] "SexyBack", [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". After wrapping up a worldwide concert tour {{in support of}} the album in 2007, Timberlake took a break from his music career to focus on acting. In 2010, Timberlake's manager, Johnny Wright, began conversations with the singer about working on new music.

Wright proposed a promotion based on an application or releasing a new song every month. Timberlake, however, was not interested in going back into music and instead continued to focus on his film career. Around the [...] "late part of May/first week in June" [...] 2012, Timberlake asked Wright to dinner and revealed to him that he had spent the last couple of nights in studio with Timbaland working on new material. Wright was shocked at the revelation, telling Billboard magazine that he [...] "wasn't prepared for that." [...] The two immediately began marketing plans for how the album should be promoted and when it should be released. Ultimately, they agreed [...] "to do this in a shorter period of time, so let's put the single out and [...] seven or eight weeks after that– make it a short window, and because we have such a short window, we have to make a big impact." ...|$|E
