40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{formation of}} single silver needles from aqueous silver sulfate was studied under both potentiostatic and galvanostatic conditions utilizing different quasi- 2 D cells. Under potentiostatic conditions, four (I–IV) stages of growth were distinguished. Stage III involved single needle growth under a quasi-steady-state (q-ss) regime in which, at the millimeter scale, the tip profile remained almost unchanged. Fast growing needles exhibited a truncated quasi-conical tip, and slow growing ones approached prolate hemispheroids. At stage III, the almost constant q-ss silver deposition rate was evaluated {{from the tip}} front displacement (dLz/dt) perpendicularly to the tangential plane of the tip. For the cathode to anode potential difference in the range - 1. 00 ≤ Ec-a ≤ - 0. 22 V, values of (dLz/dt) in the range 0. 08 – 2. 0 μm s- 1 were obtained. At the <b>needle</b> <b>stem,</b> the q-ss radial silver deposition rate (dLx/dt) was about two orders of magnitude lower than (dLz/dt). The transition from stage III to IV was characterized by tip thickening, i. e. {{a change in the}} tip q-conical profile to that of a prolate hemispheroid, and eventual tip splitting. Scanning electron micrographs at the micrometer scale of single silver needle tips from potentiostatic runs showed either a defined crystallography or an irregular topography covered by a large number of tiny crystals. In contrast, stems were always faceted. This difference indicated that surface relaxation processes following silver ion mass transport and discharge played a relevant role in the needle growth mode. At stage III, the growth regime is described utilizing a dual diffusion (D) and migration (M) model consisting of a DM direct contribution that becomes dominant at the <b>needle</b> <b>stem,</b> and a space charge (SC) -assisted DM contribution that operates at the tip apex. This explanation is consistent with the local cathodic current density values, the concentration ratio of silver clusters at the stem and tip apex surface, and the distinct kinetic behavior of needles produced from potentiostatic and galvanostatic runs. The complex link between mass transport phenomena of silver ions from the binary solution side, the silver ion discharge at the interface and the surface relaxation of silver adatoms and clusters at the metal lattice shed new light on the aspects of single silver needle formation.

Franco) from Oregon. Cold injury to <b>needle,</b> <b>stem,</b> and bud tissues was evaluated in fall 1996 and spring 1997 following artificial freeze testing of detached shoots collected from 4 -year-old ramets (rooted cuttings). Variation among clones in cold-injury scores was significant (p < 0. 01) for all shoot tissues in both fall and spring and averaged about three times the magnitude previously observed among open-pollinated families of this species. Thus, improving cold hardiness by within-family selection appears to hold much promise. Striking similarities in relative magnitudes of heritability estimates and genetic correlations in the full-sib family, compared with breeding populations, support the following hypotheses about the quantitative genetics of cold hardiness in this species: (i) heritability of cold hardiness (both broad-and-narrow-sense) is stronger in the spring than in the fall; (ii) cold hardiness of different shoot tissues in the same season is controlled {{by many of the}} same genes; and (iii) genetic control of fall cold hardi-ness is largely independent of cold hardiness in the spring.

40|$|Summary Individual {{ponderosa pine}} (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) {{seedlings}} were grown in mesocosms with three densities of blue wild-rye grass (Elymus glaucus Buckl.) (equivalent to 0, 32 or 88 plants m– 2) {{to determine if}} the pres-ence of a natural competitor alters the response of ponderosa pine seedlings to ozone. After 3 years of ozone exposure, grass presence reduced total ponderosa pine dry mass by nearly 50 %, whereas ozone alone had no significant effect on ponder-osa pine growth. The combination of ozone and grass further reduced <b>needle,</b> <b>stem</b> and branch dry mass significantly below that induced by grass competition alone. Root:shoot ratios in-creased in response to the combined grass and ozone treat-ments. Grass competition significantly reduced soluble sugar concentrations in all ponderosa pine tissue components exam-ined. Starch concentrations were highly variable but did not differ significantly between treatments. Ozone significantly reduced soluble sugar concentrations in fine roots and stems. In the absence of grass, ozone-treated seedlings tended to have higher tissue N concentrations than controls. In the presence of grass, ozone-treated seedlings had lower N concentrations than controls, resulting in a significant interaction between these two stresses in 1 - and 2 -year-old needles. Needle C:N ratios de-creased in response to grass competition, as a result of in-creased N concentration and no change in C concentration. The opposite response was observed in ozone-treated seedlings as a result of decreased N concentrations, indicating that ozone-treated seedlings were unable to take up or retain as much ni-trogen when grown in the presence of grass. We conclude that ponderosa pine seedlings are more susceptible to ozone when grown in competition with blue wild-rye grass...|$|E

Seedlings receiving no extra N (ON) were the controls. The temporal patterns of seedling growth, nutrient concentrations, and sugar-metabolizing enzyme activities were determined during that {{fall and winter}} to assess the dynamics of seedling vigor. The 40 N-treated seedlings had significantly fewer culls and greater first-order lateral root numbers, root collar diameter, DW of <b>needle,</b> <b>stem,</b> and root, and N concentration (percentage of DW) and content (milligrams per seedling) than controls and the lON-treated seedlings. However, the temporal patterns of DW allocation, sugar metabolism, or the concentrations of P, K, Mg, and Ca were not affected by fall N fertilization. These results fit the hypothesis that basic plant morphological and biochemical processes, e. g., periodicity in stem and root DW growth or in stem and root sucrolysis and glycolysis, were not altered by human-made changes such as fall N fertilization. Fall N fertilization near 40 kg N. ha & is a beneficial treatment because it decreased the number of culls and increased seedling N concentrations and DW without causing nutrient imbalance or detectably disturbing seedling development.

40|$|Future climate {{scenarios}} predict increased air {{temperatures and}} precipitation, particularly at high latitudes, and especially so during winter. Soil temperatures, however, {{are more difficult}} to predict, since they depend strongly on the fate of the insulating snow cover. ‘Rain-on-snow’ events and warm spells during winter can lead to thaw–freeze cycles, compacted snow and ice encasement, as well as local flooding. These adverse conditions could counteract the otherwise positive effects of climatic changes on forest seedling growth. In order to study the effects of different winter and snow conditions on young Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which 80 1 -year-old Scots pine seedlings were distributed between four winter treatments in dasotrons: ambient snow cover (SNOW), compressed snow and ice encasement (ICE), flooded and frozen soil (FLOOD) and no snow (NO SNOW). During the winter treatment period and a 1. 5 -month simulated spring/early summer phase, we monitored the <b>needle,</b> <b>stem</b> and root biomass of the seedlings, and determined their starch and soluble sugar concentrations. In addition, we assessed the stress experienced by the seedlings by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence, electric impedance and photosynthesis of the previous-year needles. Compared with the SNOW treatment, carbohydrate concentrations were lower in the FLOOD and NO SNOW treatments where the seedlings had almost died {{before the end of the}} experiment, presumably due to frost desiccation of aboveground parts during the winter treatments. The seedlings of the ICE treatment showed dead needles and stems only above the snow and ice cover. The results emphasize the importance of an insulating and protecting snow cover for small forest tree seedlings, and that future winters with changed snow patterns might affect the survival of tree seedlings and thus forest productivity...|$|E
40|$|Pinus radiata is an {{important}} forest species in New Zealand. Over 89 % of the country’s plantation forestry area is planted with P. radiata. The species makes a major contribution to New Zealand’s $ 3. 1 billion to GDP and the plantation area is projected to increase to 2. 5 million hectares by 2025. Research work to date has recognised that soil B deficiency is {{a major issue in}} many forestry plantation areas. Edaphic and environmental conditions such as the coarse texture pumacious soils planted with radiata in the Central North Island, and summer drought condition in some areas, further aggravate B deficiency in New Zealand soils. Boron deficiencies in P. radiata lead to growth defects in afflicted plants and a deterioration in wood quality and market value. The primary objective of this thesis was {{to assess the impact of}} ulexite, a slow-release B fertiliser, on the bioavailability of soil B, plant B uptake, and the relative effect of B application rate on plant growth and soil microbial activity. A further objective was to compare the rate of B adsorption to seven benchmark soils collected from the North Island of New Zealand. The purpose of the work was to propose a long-term slow-release fertiliser management solution for radiata pine forestry that may mitigate the economic damage caused by B deficiency in this important primary production sector. Soil was collected from Taupo, the major P. radiata planting district in the Central North Island of New Zealand, and used to establish glasshouse studies with P. radiata at Massey University in Palmerston North. Plants for this research were obtained from the Forest Research Institute (SCION) in Rotorua, New Zealand. Two growth experiments were conducted. The second of these compared the B dynamics of a fast-growing and slow-growing clone of P. radiata. The background concentration of B in this soil (less than 0. 5 mg/kg calcium chloride extractable B) is low, and B fertiliser application induced a soil response. Results showed that the concentration of plant-available B (extracted using hot 0. 02 M CaCl 2) significantly increased with B application. Boron application at the highest level (32 kg/ha) led to a build-up of soil B to a critical toxicity level with the subsequent appearance of toxicity symptoms in plants. Application of B resulted in rapid B uptake as shown by an increase in B concentration in all plant parts (<b>needle,</b> <b>stem</b> and roots), but with the greatest rate of increase in needles. The percentage distribution of B throughout the plant showed that B distribution was influenced by B application treatments. The root to needle B ratio is used in this work as an index of B transfer from source to sink parts of a plant. Results showed that under deficient and toxic soil B concentrations (defined through the CaCl 2 extractable B concentration), B was restricted to source tissues. However, B application at the rate of 4 kg/ha enabled B to move to sink parts including the new emerging needles. Regardless of clone and B treatment, needles, particularly older needles, were the main site of B accumulation followed by roots and stem. The B concentration in needles of Clone 37 was higher than in Clone 18 and this result reflects a higher demand of B for the faster growing Clone 37 relative to Clone 18. Application of B affected P. radiata growth in terms of height, diameter and plant dry weight. Plants responded positively to B application over a range of fertiliser treatments (8 - 16 kg/ha) leading to sufficiency in soil as quantified through increases in the plant growth parameters plant height and dry weight. Boron application improved plant physiology as quantified by photosynthesis in this study. Results showed that photosynthesis positively responded to B application up to 8 kg/ha, however a further increase in B application resulted in a decline in photosynthetic activity. Results from a B fractionation study showed that the plant unavailable residual-B fraction was the major form of B in the Taupo soil. With B fertiliser application the concentration of readily-available B increased proportionally to the B application rate. This increase in readily-available B demonstrates the importance of using B fertiliser to provide for a long-term increase in plant-available soil B for P. radiata plantations on the Taupo soil. Soil microbial and microbiological properties also responded to B application. Soil dehydrogenase activity, an index of microbiological activity in soil, showed a concentration gradient from the bulk to rhizosphere soil. Regardless of clone there was approximately a three-fold higher dehydrogenase activity in the rhizosphere soil compared to the bulk soil. Maximum dehydrogenase activity was recorded by a B application at 4 - 8 kg/ha in both clones with a decrease in activity at higher rates. Regardless of the radiata clone used, mycorrhizal colonisation increased with B application. However, for both clones the maximum mycorrhizal infection on roots was recorded for a B application rate of 2 - 4 kg/ha. A B adsorption study performed using seven benchmark soils collected from around the North Island showed that B adsorption increased in all soils with the concentration of B in equilibrium solution. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms modelled B adsorption in all seven soils. Further studies showed that B adsorption corresponded to pH in solution and linearly increased up to pH 9 and reduced thereafter. The results from this study demonstrate the importance of B fertiliser to P. radiata plantation forestry. Both plant and microbiological parameters are affected by both low and excess levels of soil B. Therefore, it is suggested that a B application rate in the range of 4 - 8 kg/ha is optimal for plant growth and will have no harmful effect on soil microbiological parameters. In contrast, B application at the rate of 16 kg/ha is toxic to both plants and soil microbes and will lead to inhibitory effects on activity and growth...|$|E

Sydowia japonica is an ascomycetous fungus that grows exclusively on the male strobili of Japanese cedar, suggesting a possible mechanism for controlling pollen dispersal.

The treatment demonstrated that the fungus infected only the pollen and prevented pollen dispersal. The fungus did not cause any additional symptoms to other parts of Japanese cedar, such as <b>needles,</b> <b>stems,</b> and buds. All S. japonica isolates collected around Japan could serve to control pollen dispersal. Periodic observation of the fungal pathogenesis with stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope showed that hyphal fragments and conidia of S. japonica germinated on the surface of male strobili, and the germ tube entered pollen sacs through opening microsporophylls. Within the pollen sacs, the hyphae penetrated pollen gradually, such that all pollen was infected by the fungus by approximately one month before the pollen dispersal season. The infected pollen was destroyed due to the fungal infection and was never released. Our data suggests a novel approach of preventing pollen dispersa...|$|R

40|$|Understory {{management}} in forest ecosystems {{has been applied}} to improve the wood production for hundreds of years worldwide. The carbon-physiological mechanisms underlying these positive effects of understory management on the growth of overstory trees have received less attention.

The concentrations of N, NSC (= soluble sugars + starch) in overstory trees varied significantly with understory treatments during the dry season rather than the wet season. Trees grown without understory shrubs had higher levels of N and NSC compared to trees grown with understories. The present study provides insight to explain the functional mechanisms for understory effects on growth of overstory trees, and indicates that the nitrogen and carbon status in overstory trees may be more strongly negatively affected by understory in stressful conditions rather than in optimal growth conditions.

In separate treatments we removed 100, and 50 % of needles of whole trees and defoliated single branches in naturally grown, 2 – 3 -m-tall Pinus pinaster trees in Italy. Shoot and stem growth (lateral shoot length and basal area increment, respectively) were substantially reduced after 100 % defoliation (− 45 % for shoots, − 84 % for stems). In 50 % defoliated trees only stem growth was reduced (− 37 %), and in trees with a single branch defoliated, growth remained unaffected. Although substantial carbon and nitrogen reserves were removed from defoliated trees prior to bud break, non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) concentrations in branches and needles fell below control values only {{during the first half of}} the growing season, and considerable amounts of NSC persisted throughout the year. By the end of the dry and hot Mediterranean summer, NSC concentrations in branch xylem, branch phloem, previous year <b>needles,</b> <b>stem</b> sapwood and root xylem were similar among all treatments. Reduced growth and high late season NSC after defoliation can be explained by (1) a critical loss of reserves other than C (e. g.

Concentrations of resin, polyphenols and carbohydrates were higher in low nitrogen treatments as predicted by resource-availability models of defence and the changes were similar {{in all parts of}} the trees including roots and in tissues formed prior to experimental treatments.

The size of needle resin ducts was positively correlated with tree growth but no evidence for ‘structural’ limitation of resin concentration in needles was found. 3. Changes in concentration of quantitative defences did not appear to be the result of a direct trade-off with growth but reflected treatment-induced variation in the root/shoot ratio. Production of quantitative secondary chemicals may therefore be part of an integrated response of the trees to environmental stress. 4. Bioassays with Elatobium abietinum, Gilpinia hercyniae and the fungus Phacidium coniferarum showed that changes in needle size, the nutritional and water content of tissues and the balance between nutrients and secondary chemicals influenced performance of one or more of the organisms.

To assess the {{temporal and spatial}} variation in respiration rates of these components in a heterogeneous ponderosa pine forest canopy, and the processes that control these fluxes, we conducted an intensive field study {{during the summer of}} 2000. We employed a combination of biological and micrometeorological measurements to assess carbon respiratory fluxes at the soil surface, within and above a 4 -m-tall ponderosa pine forest. We also conducted manipulation studies to examine the carbon fluxes from the roots and heteorotrophs. Spatial variation in Soil CO 2 efflux was large, averaging 40 % of the mean, which varied by nearly a factor of two between minima for bare soil to maxima beneath dense patches of understorey vegetation. The estimated vertical profile of respiration from chamber data, and the profile of nocturnal fluxes measured by the three eddy flux systems suggested that > 70 % of the ecosystem respiration was coming from below the 1. 75 -m measurement height of one of the flux systems, and 71 % of photosynthetic carbon uptake in July was released by soil processes, thus there was a strong vertical gradient in respiration relatively close to the soil surface in this young forest.

40|$|Changes in soil boron fractions, dry weights {{of biomass}} {{components}} (<b>needles,</b> branches, <b>stem</b> bark, stem wood) and uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron, copper, and zinc were studied in a 4 -year-old Pinus radiata D. Don stand in Ashley Forest, North Canterbury, 1 year after application of urea at 0 and 400 kg N/ha and/or ulexite at 0 and 7. 4 kg B/ha. Significant responses {{to both the}} applied nitrogen and boron were measured in total above-ground tree biomass. The <b>needle,</b> branch, and <b>stem</b> components were significantly heavier in the trees fertilised with boron alone, but only the needle component was significantly heavier where nitrogen fertiliser had been added alone. Increased tree growth was associated with increased total uptake of all nutrients except phosphorus and potassium which increased only in trees treated with ulexite. Increased nutrient uptake was measured mainly in needles of trees treated with urea, but in needles and branches of those to which ulexite was applied. Nutrient concentrations of non-fertiliser elements remained similar or declined in trees to which fertiliser was applied. This was attributed to dilution effects and/or internal translocation between biomass components. Boron application significantly increased boron concentrations in the current and 1 -year-old needles whereas nitrogen application {{had no effect on}} nitrogen concentrations...|$|R
40|$|One-year old, nursery-grown {{longleaf}} pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) seedlings {{were grown}} in 45 -L pots containing a coarse sandy medium and {{were exposed to}} two concentrations of atmospheric CO 2 (365 or 720 mol− 1) and two levels of nitrogen (N) fertility (40 or 400 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) within open top chambers for 20 months. At harvest, <b>needles,</b> <b>stems,</b> coarse roots, and fine roots were separated and weighed. Subsamples of each tissue were frozen in liquid N, lyophilized at − 50 C, and ground to pass a 0. 2 mm sieve. Tissue samples were analyzed for carbon (C), N, nonpolar extractives (fats, waxes, and oils = FWO), nonstructural carbohydrates (total sugars and starch), and structural carbohydrates (cellulose, lignin, and tannins). Increased dry weights of each tissue were observed under elevated CO 2 and with high N; however, main effects of CO 2 were significant only on belowground tissues. The high N fertility tended to result in increased partitioning of biomass aboveground, resulting in significantly lower root to shoot ratios. Elevated CO 2 did not affect biomass allocation among tissues. Both atmospheric CO 2 and N fertility tended to affect concentration of C compounds in belowground, more than aboveground, tissues. Elevated CO 2 resulted in lower concentrations of starch, cellulose, and lignin, but increased concentrations of FWO in root tissues. High N fertility increased the concentration of starch, cellulose, and tannins, but resulted in lower concentrations of lignin and FWO in roots. Differences between CO 2 concentrations tended to occur onl...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco) {{seedlings}} at {{a nursery}} in western Oregon were fertilized with nitrogen in October. Free amino acid (FAA) and total nitrogen concentrations in <b>needles,</b> <b>stems</b> and fine roots were followed from before fertilization until {{just prior to}} budbreak the following spring. Before budbreak in mid-March, the FAA and total nitrogen concentrations in the fertilized seedlings {{were significantly higher than}} the unfertilized seedlings. Fertilized seedlings showed significant depletion of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) relative to the unfertilized seedlings. The reduction in carbohydrate reserves following fertilization probably reflects increased respiration associated with the synthesis and maintenance of higher levels of enzymes. The seedlings were lifted from the nursery bed and planted in a split plot design. The main treatment was the presence or lack of grass competition. Within each main plot, the previously fertilized and unfertilized seedlings were planted. Sucrose was applied to the soil around each seedling to limit the availability of nitrogen to tree roots. On the average, the fertilized seedlings broke bud ten days earlier than the unfertilized seedlings and produced more growth aboveground. The earlier budbreak was responsible for initial differences in growth response. Later harvests showed that fertilized seedlings also exhibited higher relative growth rates. Seedlings growing in the grass plots had predawn water potentials of - 1. 5 MPa by early August. By September 3, the unfertilized seedlings growing with grass showed significantly more predawn water stress {{than any of the other}} three treatments. Although the fertilized seedlings had higher FAA and total nitrogen concentrations than unfertilized seedlings when they were planted, by the end of one growing season the FAA arid total nitrogen concentrations had equalized. However, the fertilized seedlings contained more FAA and nitrogen because of their greater size. Grass competition affected both seedling nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrate chemistry. After one growing season, the fertilized seedlings showed a 3 cm increase in height increment; a 29...|$|R
40|$|Temperate forest 15 N isotope trace {{experiments}} find nitrogen (N) addition-driven carbon (C) uptake {{is modest}} as little additional N is acquired by trees; however, several correlations of ambient N deposition against forest productivity imply a greater effect of atmospheric nitrogen deposition than these studies. We asked whether N deposition experiments adequately represent all processes found in ambient conditions. In particular, experiments typically apply 15 N to directly to forest floors, assuming uptake of nitrogen intercepted by canopies (CNU) is minimal. Additionally, conventional 15 N additions typically trace mineral 15 N additions rather than litter N recycling and may increase total N inputs above ambient levels. To test {{the importance of}} CNU and recycled N to tree nutrition, we conducted a mesocosm experiment, applying 54 g N/ 15 N ha− 1 yr− 1 to Sitka spruce saplings. We compared tree and soil 15 N recovery among treatments where enrichment was due to either (1) a 15 N-enriched litter layer, or mineral 15 N additions to (2) the soil or (3) the canopy. We found that 60 % of 15 N applied to the canopy was recovered above ground (in <b>needles,</b> <b>stem</b> and branches) while only 21 % of 15 N applied to the soil was found in these pools. 15 N recovery from litter was low and highly variable. 15 N partitioning among biomass pools and age classes also differed among treatments, with twice as much 15 N found in woody biomass when deposited on the canopy than soil. Stoichiometrically calculated N effect on C uptake from 15 N applied to the soil, scaled to real-world conditions, was 43 kg C kg N− 1, similar to manipulation studies. The effect from the canopy treatment was 114 kg C kg N− 1. Canopy treatments may be critical to accurately represent N deposition {{in the field and}} may address the discrepancy between manipulative and correlative studies...|$|R
40|$|Summary We studied {{effects of}} tree age, size and competi-tive status on foliage and stem {{production}} of 43 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees in southern Finland. The tree attrib-utes related to competition included foliage density, crown ra-tio and height/diameter ratio. Needle mass {{was considered to}} be the primary cause of growth through photosynthesis. Both stem growth and foliage growth were strongly correlated with foliage mass. Consequently, differences in growth allocation between <b>needles</b> and <b>stem</b> wood in trees of different age, size, or position were small. However, increasing relative height in-creased the sum of stem growth and foliage growth per unit foliage mass, indicating an effect of available light. Sup-pressed trees seemed to allocate more growth to stem wood than dominant trees, and their stem growth per unit foliage mass was larger. Similarly, trees in dense stands allocated more growth to stem wood than trees in sparse stands. The re-sults conformed to the pipe model theory but seemed to contra-dict the priority principle of allocation...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{carbonaceous}} aerosols in the atmos-phere {{is critical to}} understand the role of aerosols in human health and climate. Using standardized ther-mal optical transmittance methods, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and water soluble or-ganic carbon (WSOC) were determined using a com-bustion sampling system for four types of agricul-tural crop residues (rice straw, red pepper stems, soybean stems, and green perilla stems) and eight types of forest trees (pine <b>stems,</b> pine <b>needles,</b> gink-go <b>stems,</b> ginkgo leaves, maple stems, maple leaves, cherry stems, and cherry leaves). The aerosol parti-cles between 0. 056 and 5. 6 μm in size were analyz-ed using a Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (MOUDI). In the current study, the Carbonaceous Thermal Distribution (CTD) by carbon analyzer was discussed {{in order to understand}} the carbon frac-tions from the twelve types of biomass burning. Also, the concentration of OC, EC, WSOC, and water insol-uble organic carbon (WIOC) detected in the emis-sions were described...|$|R
30|$|All process models require {{assumptions}} about the geometry of the plant system and dimensionality of the mathematical models. One possible approach to the geometry is to approximate roots, <b>stems,</b> <b>needles</b> and branches as cylinders; buds, seed pods, and cones as spheres; and leaves as disks. Because the most accurate approach would simulate energy and mass transfer in three dimensions, reduced dimensionality is more practical and desirable from a computing perspective. Cylindrical components representing roots, stems, and branches are typically sectioned into concentric zones approximating the bark, cambium, and sapwood. Each zone may be defined by unique physical, thermal, and biological properties.|$|R
