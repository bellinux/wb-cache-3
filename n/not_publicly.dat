He refused to employ retaliatory tactics and did <b>not</b> <b>publicly</b> complain {{even though he}} and his men were repeatedly hit— according to Ken Piesse, 34 times in all. Once the issue was resolved, and practice stopped, Woodfull refused to discuss the matter, fearing that it would disturb the peace.|$|E

5|$|Although The Wrestlers was {{probably}} exhibited {{as part of}} a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a private collection and was <b>not</b> <b>publicly</b> exhibited again for almost a century.

The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.|$|E

5|$|Ataxia {{released}} its second and final studio album, AW II in 2007. Following the Stadium Arcadium tour (early May 2006 to late August 2007), the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{agreed to a}} hiatus of indefinite length.

Frusciante quit the group on July 29, 2009, but did <b>not</b> <b>publicly</b> announce his departure until December 2009, {{two months after the}} band ended their hiatus in October 2009 and began work on their next album with Josh Klinghoffer as their new guitarist.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. Even so, three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had <b>not</b> <b>publicly</b> declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{officials}} {{gave the}} Americans an unsubtle warning not to interfere.

It was later revealed in secret proceedings that he pinpointed two Americans: George Carver, an employee of the United States Operations Mission (an economic mission) who was later revealed to be a CIA agent, and Howard C.

5|$|Fleming and {{the judge}} {{who presided over the}} trial each spoke with her; both argued that they did not deserve blame for the lynching. A schoolteacher who had known Washington told Freeman that Washington was illiterate, and that all {{attempts}} to teach him to read had been futile. Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching, although many disliked that his body was mutilated. She determined that the mob was led by a bricklayer, a saloonkeeper, and several employees of an ice company. The NAACP did <b>not</b> <b>publicly</b> identify them. Freeman concluded that Washington killed Fryer, and that he was motivated by her domineering attitude towards him.|$|E
5|$|His {{plays and}} songs {{achieved}} new {{popularity in the}} 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. Coward did <b>not</b> <b>publicly</b> acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including Graham Payn, his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the Noël Coward Theatre in his honour in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Ferrari exited FOTA, the Formula One Teams Association, {{following}} prolonged {{debate over}} {{the implementation of the}} controversial Resource Restriction Agreement, though Red Bull team principal Christian Horner reaffirmed his team's commitment to cost-cutting measures and highlighting the team's concerns over certain loopholes in the Resource Restriction Agreement that they felt teams and manufacturers would willingly exploit. One week later, Sauber also left the organisation, though the Swiss team did <b>not</b> <b>publicly</b> give a reason for ending their membership.

5|$|Many {{commentators}} and cricketers deplored {{the use of}} Bodyline bowling. Some felt {{frustration that}} Woodfull had <b>not</b> <b>publicly</b> condemned the tactics, believing that his silence was interpreted as approval. Once his opinions were revealed by the leak, opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely. It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view. The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers, both for and against Bodyline tactics.|$|E
