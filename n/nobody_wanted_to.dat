25|$|The {{concept of}} atheism re-emerged {{initially}} {{as a reaction}} to the intellectual and religious turmoil of the Age of Enlightenment and the Reformation, as a charge used by those who saw the denial of god and godlessness in the controversial positions being put forward by others. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was used exclusively as an insult; <b>nobody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be regarded as an atheist. Although one overtly atheistic compendium known as the Theophrastus redivivus was published by an anonymous author in the seventeenth century, atheism was an epithet implying a lack of moral restraint.|$|E

When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.|$|E
500|$|The Land of Gorch had a {{significant}} impact on later Muppet works, including both the 1982 feature film The Dark Crystal and the 1991 television show Dinosaurs. Commentators agreed the reception for The Land of Gorch was universally negative; The A.V. Club said it was an in-joke that <b>nobody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> keep the sketches on Saturday Night Live. San Francisco Chronicle called the characters the opposite of Kermit the Frog and compared them to trolls. DVD Talk called the feature the worst mistake in the first season of Saturday Night Live. Academic Michael J. Bernsten wrote in his essay [...] "The Muppetry of Nightmares" [...] that the idea failed because the characters were irredeemable and unfunny.|$|E

Nevertheless, Pfeiffer received some positive attention for her performance, notably from The New York Times, which said [...] "although she is a relative screen newcomer, Miss Pfeiffer manages to look much more insouciant and comfortable {{than anyone else in}} the cast". Despite escaping the critical mauling, Pfeiffer's agent later admitted that her association with the film meant that [...] "she couldn't get any jobs. <b>Nobody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hire her".|$|E

500|$|LeMond {{broke his}} {{collarbone}} on April 11, 1982, while racing the cycling classic Liège–Bastogne–Liège. The injury forced LeMond {{to ride a}} reduced schedule before entering the World Championships, which were in Goodwood, England that year. In the men's road race competition LeMond broke for the line but was out-sprinted by Italian Giuseppe Saronni. Following the race LeMond's American teammate Jacques Boyer accused LeMond of chasing him down in the final 800 meters. Saronni was very strong {{at the end of}} the race and flew past Boyer and LeMond, winning by 5 seconds over LeMond, with another 5 seconds back to Kelly. Boyer placed tenth. Bronze medalist Sean Kelly, a favorite to win the race, was with Saronni when he caught LeMond with about 200 meters to go, but he could not hold his wheel. Said Kelly: [...] "I don't think that Boyer was fading...He got quite a good gap. <b>Nobody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go after him...Yes, LeMond chased down Boyer. Boyer was the only man up the road." ...|$|E
500|$|William's actions at the Siege of Antioch {{are known}} from the Gesta Francorum, an {{anonymous}} chronicle written by an Italo-Norman eyewitness. The Gesta was very popular in Europe after the crusade, but was considered crudely written by more refined readers. It was later rewritten and expanded by more educated writers, including the French monks Robert and Guibert, {{both of whom were}} eager to add information about French crusaders like William. According to Robert, William [...] "acquired the name of 'Carpenter' because <b>nobody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take him on in battle—-there was no breastplate, helmet or shield which could withstand the shattering impact of his lance or sword." [...] Guibert says that he [...] "was called the Carpenter, not because he was a craftsman in wood, but because he prevailed in battle like a carpenter, by cutting men down", and has Bohemond ask: [...] "what kind of Carpenter did we have, who, like a construction-worker with a pick-axe, hacked away, with lances and swords, at the backs of the Gentiles?" [...] Christopher Tyerman interprets this as William's [...] "skills as a battlefield butcher". Edward Gibbon, apparently misunderstanding Guibert, thought the nickname came [...] "from the weighty strokes of his axe".|$|E

500|$|According to Baley, on July 29 Savedra {{informed}} the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, {{that the next}} reliable drinking water was seventy or [...] away, and {{there would not be}} a closer source until the coming rainy season. This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found. Udell disagreed, [...] "I contended that we had better travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, we could get the stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, and we should parish with starvation." [...] Despite his pleas, <b>nobody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go on until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found [...] west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not {{meet the needs of the}} entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Che {{was going}} to be made in English and was met with a strong {{interest}} in financing; however, when {{the decision was made to}} make it in Spanish and break it up into two films, the studios' pay-TV deals, which were for English-language product only, [...] "disappeared", according to Bickford, [...] "and, at that point, <b>nobody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> step up". The director defended his decision to shoot almost all of the film in Spanish in an interview: [...] "You can't make a film with any level of credibility in this case unless it's in Spanish. I hope we're reaching a time where you go make a movie in another culture, that you shoot in the language of that culture. I'm hoping the days of that sort of specific brand of cultural imperialism have ended". Both films were financed without any American money or distribution deal; [...] Soderbergh remarked, [...] "It was very frustrating to know that this is a zeitgeist movie and that some of the very people who told me how much they now regret passing on Traffic passed on this one too". Foreign pre-sales covered $54 million of the $58 million budget. Wild Bunch, a French production, distribution and foreign sales company put up 75% of the budget for the two films, tapping into a production and acquisition fund from financing and investment company Continental Entertainment Capitol, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based Citigroup. Spain's Telecinco/Moreno Films supplied the rest of the budget.|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet <b>nobody</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E
