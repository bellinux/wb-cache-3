50|$|The European, British and Australian {{versions}} {{came with}} two interior color choices of blue or gray. European upholstery fabric selections of tweed, tricot or textile cloth were particular {{to the individual}} trim level; tweed for the GX, tricot for the GL and textile for the DL. The British GL was offered with either the tricot or textile upholstery based on the exterior paint color chosen. Velour upholstery was offered instead of tweed on the Australian GX. The European and Australian versions were also available as a limited, premium editions, called GX Gala in Europe, and GX Heritage in Australia offering gray leather on the Euro-spec sedans and extended roof wagons, and only on the sedan for the Australian-spec Liberty Heritage. The European DL, which was {{very similar to the}} Japanese-spec Ei model, was very basic; items that weren't offered were a tachometer, power windows and central locking, a radio, individual 60:40 rear folding seatbacks on the sedan, and AWD was not available on the DL. The Euro-spec DL also didn't have plastic wheel covers, and instead was identical to the Japanese-spec Ei, with silver painted steel wheels and a silver plastic lug <b>nut</b> <b>cover.</b> The European DL also didn't have paint on the front or rear bumper covers, and remained in their natural state of black plastic.|$|E

30|$|In 1999, {{the direct}} {{internal}} use of steel bracing system in concrete frame was studied in laboratory. Experiments {{were carried out}} on five one span, one story frame samples with a scale of 1 : 2.5. Two of them had no bracing system but the other three samples strengthened by x-bracing system with different connector’s component including bolt and <b>nut,</b> <b>cover</b> of RC column, and gusset plates placed in concrete. Results showed, depending upon various connectors’ component, the bracing system considerably increases the equivalent stiffness of the frame and notably changes its behavior. When the bracing system’s connector is implanted inside concrete, the performance of frame gets even better and further energy is absorbed. Generally, experiments demonstrated that the bracing system tolerates {{a major part of}} lateral load in reinforced concrete frame (Tasnimi and Masoumi 1999).|$|E

60|$|Few {{cultivated}} plants are {{more beautiful than}} nutmeg-trees. They are handsomely shaped and glossy-leaved, growing to the height of twenty or thirty feet, and bearing small yellowish flowers. The fruit is the size and colour of a peach, but rather oval. It is of a tough fleshy consistence, but when ripe splits open, and shows the dark-brown <b>nut</b> within, <b>covered</b> with the crimson mace, and is then a most beautiful object. Within the thin, hard shell of the nut is the seed, which is the nutmeg of commerce.

40|$|The {{life history}} of the Mediterranean fruit fly under Hawaiian {{conditions}} was worked out in the tropical almonds (Tenninalia cat-tapa). The tropical almond is a very common deciduous shade tree of the Hawaiian Islands and bears clusters of compressed nut-like fruits, each fruit being one to two inches long and resembling an almond (Plate 9, figure 1). The fibrous shell of the <b>nut</b> is <b>covered</b> with a thin pulp (Plate 9, figure 6) {{and it is this}} pulp that is seriously infested by the pest. The pulp of the fruit is sweet and resembles somewhat the taste of an apple. DEPOSITION OF EGGs. -In ovipositing the Mediterranean fruit fly "stings " the fruit with its needle-like ovipositor, forming a small receptacle within which the eggs are deposited. A secretion is then poured over the eggs by the fly and this acts on the surrounding tissue, changing it into a brown gelatinous substance. This gelatinous sub-stance often exudes out of the mouth of the receptacle and hardens...|$|R
50|$|The AKM’s barrel is {{installed}} in the forward trunnion and pinned (as opposed to the AK-47, which has a one piece receiver with integral trunnions and a barrel that is screwed-in). Additionally the barrel has horizontal guide slots that help align and secure the handguards in place. To increase the weapon’s accuracy during automatic fire, the AKM was fitted with a slant cut muzzle brake that helps redirect expanding propellant gases upward {{and to the right}} during firing, which mitigates the rise of the muzzle during an automatic burst when held by a right-handed firer. The muzzle brake is threaded on {{to the end of the}} barrel with a left-hand thread. Not all AKMs had slant muzzle brakes; some were also fitted with the older muzzle nut which came from the AK-47. Most AKMs with muzzle nuts were older production weapons. The AKM's slant brake can also be used on the AK-47, which had a simple <b>nut</b> to <b>cover</b> the threads.|$|R

The investigated soil showed an unusual behavior: the hydraulic conductivty was high close to and at saturation as it is commonly found in sady soils; however, at high soil water suction, it can retain large amounts of water which is a typical characteristics for clayey soils. This phenomenon may explained to the particle size distribuition (predominatly clay) and its strong aggregation.

60|$|Even among plants which {{trust to}} the {{involuntary}} services {{of animals in}} dispersing their seeds, a great many varieties of detail may be observed on close inspection. For example, in hound's-tongue and goose-grass, two of the best-known instances among our common English weeds, each little <b>nut</b> is <b>covered</b> with many small hooks, which make it catch on firmly by several points of attachment to passing animals. These are the kinds we human beings of either sex oftenest find clinging to our skirts or trousers after a walk in a rabbit-warren. But in herb-bennet and avens each nut has a single long awn, crooked near the middle with a very peculiar S-shaped joint, which effectually catches on to the wool or hair, but drops at the elbow after {{a short period of}} withering. Sometimes, too, the whole fruit is provided with prehensile hooks, while sometimes it is rather the individual seeds themselves that are so accommodated. Oddest of all is the plan followed by the common burdock. Here, an involucre or common cup-shaped receptacle of hooked bracts surrounds an entire head of purple tubular flowers, and each of these flowers produces in time a distinct fruit; but the hooked involucre contains the whole compound mass, and, being pulled off bodily by a stray sheep or dog, effects the transference of the composite lot at once to some fitting place for their germination.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} a modern and {{economic}} method for the strength {{calculation of the}} piston rod unit and its components of reciprocating compressors under different operating conditions will be presented.

50|$|As well {{as being}} {{consumed}} fresh, chestnuts can also be canned, pureed, or preserved in sugar or syrup (marrons glacés). Shelled and cooked <b>nuts</b> should be <b>covered,</b> refrigerated, and used within three to four days. Cooked chestnuts, either whole, chopped, or pureed, may be frozen {{in an airtight container}} and held up to 9 months. Because of their high water content, transpiration rates and consequent loss weight, the nuts react as fresh fruits (not as nuts). They should be kept cool at all times, including in shops when on display for sale. To preserve their freshness for a few months with no artificial refrigeration, the chestnuts can be soaked in cold water for about 20 hours immediately after harvest, after which they are dried in the shade, then layered in dry sand. Chestnuts behave similarly to seeds in that they produce very little ethylene, and their respiration rate is low, varying between 5 and 20 mg/(kg·h) depending on the temperature.|$|R
60|$|The nuts thus {{left on the}} surface, or buried {{just beneath}} it, are placed in the most {{favorable}} circumstances for germinating. I have sometimes wondered how those which merely fell {{on the surface of}} the earth got planted; but, by the end of December, I find the chestnut of the same year partially mixed with the mould, as it were, under the decaying and mouldy leaves, where there is all the moisture and manure they want, for the nuts fall first. In a plentiful year, a large proportion of the <b>nuts</b> are thus <b>covered</b> loosely an inch deep, and are, of course, somewhat concealed from squirrels. One winter, when the crop had been abundant, I got, with the aid of a rake, many quarts of these nuts as late as the tenth of January, and though some bought at the store the same day were more than half of them mouldy, I did not find a single mouldy one among these which I picked from under the wet and mouldy leaves, where they had been snowed on once or twice. Nature knows how to pack them best. They were still plump and tender. Apparently, they do not heat there, though wet. In the spring they were all sprouting.|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} shows {{results of a}} {{calculation}} of carbon footprint (CFP) resulting from the production of nuts added value products for a large consumer market. Nuts consumption is increasing {{in the world and}} so is the consumer awareness of the environmental impact of goods, hence the calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of food production is of growing importance for producers. Calculation of CO 2 eq emissions was performed for all stages of the production chain to the final retail point for flour, grains, paste, chocolate <b>covered</b> <b>nuts</b> and spreadable cream produced from almonds, pistachios and hazelnuts grown and transformed in Italy and for peanuts grown in Argentina and transformed in Italy. Data from literature was used to evaluate CFP of raw materials, emissions from transport and packing were calculated using existing models, while emissions deriving from transformation were calculated empirically by multiplying the power of production lines (electrical and/or thermal) by its productivity. All values were reported in kg of CO 2 equivalent for each kg of packed product (net weight). Resulting values ranged between 1. 2 g of CO 2 /kg for a 100 g bag of almond to 4. 8 g of CO 2 /kg for the 100 g bag of chocolate covered almond. The calculation procedure can be well used for similar cases of large consumer food productions...|$|R
