40|$|Although {{participation}} in {{continuing vocational training}} is often {{found to be associated}} with considerable individual benefits, a puzzlingly large number of people still do not take part in training. We argue that in order to solve the puzzle it is important to take selection effects into account when studying the returns to education. It has already been established that training participants and <b>non-participants</b> differ in unobservable charac-teristics and therefore self-select into training or not. We show that even <b>non-participants</b> cannot be treated as a homogeneous group: there are individuals who never take part in training (permanent <b>non-participants)</b> and individuals currently not taking part (occasional <b>non-participants).</b> Using a unique data set of <b>non-participants</b> we sepa-rate and compare those two groups. We find that, if they participated, permanent <b>non-participants</b> would have higher costs than occasional <b>non-participants</b> and the benefits associated with their current jobs would be lower. However, even permanent <b>non-participants</b> would benefit from {{participation in}} terms of improved prospects on the la-bor market.

40|$|Although {{participation}} in {{continuing vocational training}} is often {{found to be associated}} with considerable individual benefits, a puzzlingly large number of people still do not take part in training. In order to solve the puzzle we distinguish between temporary and chronic <b>non-participants.</b> Previous studies have shown that training participants and <b>non-participants</b> differ in unobservable characteristics and therefore self-select into training or not. We show that even <b>non-participants</b> cannot be treated as a homogeneous group: there are those who never take part in training (chronic <b>non-participants)</b> and those who are not currently taking part (temporary (non-) participants). Using a unique data set of <b>non-participants</b> commissioned by the German 'Expert Commission on Financing Lifelong Learning' and covering {{a very large number of}} individuals not taking part in training, we separate and compare chronic and temporary <b>non-participants.</b> By estimating a sample selection model using maximum likelihood estimation we take potential selection effects into account: temporary (non-) participants may be more motivated or may have different inherent skills than chronic nonparticipants. We find that chronic <b>non-participants</b> would have higher costs than temporary (non-) participants and their short-term benefits associated with their current jobs would be lower. However, in the long run even chronic <b>non-participants</b> would benefit similarly from participation due to improved prospects on the labor market. The results indicate that chronic <b>non-participants</b> either misperceive future developments or suffer from an exceptionally high discount rate, which in turn leads in their view to a negative cost-benefit ratio for training.

Four days later on SmackDown, Bryan defeated Orton, but to Bryan's dismay, it was via countout. On the next Raw, Bryan decisively defeated Orton via submission in a street fight, and later continued his hot streak by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian. On July 14 at Money in the Bank, Bryan competed in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match; during the match, Bryan was attacked by Curtis Axel, a <b>non-participant,</b> which ultimately prevented Bryan from winning the match that was won by Orton.|$|E

2500|$|The {{leaders of}} the Sumter County Movement were {{trying to decide what}} to do next, and a young activist chose to lead a group to pray in front of city hall. Aelony {{attended}} the march as a <b>non-participant</b> observer and was arrested on a charge of insurrection against the state of Georgia. This charge carried the death penalty under Georgia’s 1871 Anti-Treason Act. Three other CORE fieldworkers, Ralph Allen, Don Harris, and John Perdew, were arrested in Americus as well. With Aelony, this group became known as the Americus Four while they spent time on death row. Their arrest originally went unnoticed in the United States, but attracted attention in Europe and Africa. As public concern grew, awareness spread within the United States and eventually put pressure on the federal government to attend to the arrests in Georgia. The Americus Four were ultimately exonerated. [...] Shortly afterward, he suffered a myocardial infarction and was hospitalized at Grady Hospital, by a local black physician who cared for the CORE workers. [...] Thus, Aelony integrated the black ward at Grady Hospital.

Methods: This study sampled 1053 participants and 1006 <b>non-participants</b> from a screening trial and randomly allocated the participants to receive different levels of additional information about the screening programme. An ad hoc survey questionnaire about doubt and arguments in relation to the participation decision was given to participants and <b>non-participants</b> along with a contingent valuation task. Results: Among participants, 5 % had doubt about participation and the most frequent argument was that they did not want the test result. Among <b>non-participants,</b> 40 % would reconsider their non-participation decision after having received additional information while the remainder 60 % stood by their decision and provided explicit arguments for it. After having received additional information the participants still valued the programme significantly higher than <b>non-participants,</b> but the difference was relatively small. Conclusions: Participants and <b>non-participants</b> in cardiovascular screening programmes seem to have different strengths of preferences, which signals that their behavioural choice is founded in rational thinking.

Consequently, estimates of possible differences between participants and <b>non-participants</b> are increasingly important for the interpretation of study results and generalization to the background population. Methods: An age-specific, population-based cohort of 1, 198 individuals was examined at age 40, 45, 51, and 60. Participants were compared with <b>non-participants</b> and when possible also with the background population using {{a wide range of}} detailed information on somatic and mental health collected at each examination, including data from a clinical examination, biochemical measurements, questionnaires, interviews, and public registers. Results: Participation rates were higher than 80 % at examinations at age 40, 45, and 51, but decreased to 65 % at age 60. At the baseline investigation at age 40, analyses indicated that participants were representative of the cohort as well as the background population.
