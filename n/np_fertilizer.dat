The experiment was set-up using a split-plot design with 3 tillage methods as main treatments: conventional, reduced (till with crop residue incoperated in fall but no-till in spring), and no-till. Sub-treatments were 3 <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizer</b> rates: 105 - 46, 179 - 78 and 210 - 92 kg N and P ha. - 1 Maize grain yields were greatly influenced {{by the amount of}} growing season rainfall, and by soil water contents at sowing. Mean grain yields over the 6 -year period in response to tillage treatments were 5604, 5347 and 5185 kg ha, under reduced, no-till and conventional tillage, respectively. Mean WUE was 13. 7, 13. 6 and 12. 6 kg ha mm under reduced, no-till, and conventional tillage, respectively. Mean soil water contents at sowing and at harvest were significantly influenced by tillage treatments. At harvest time, the no-till treatment had ~ 8 - 12 % more water in the soil than the conventional and reduced tillage treatments. Under conventional tillage, grain yields increased with <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application rates. However, under reduced tillage, grain yields were highest with lowest <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application rate. In conclusion, grain yields and WUE were highest under reduced tillage at modest <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizer</b> application rates of 105 kg N and 46 kg P per ha.

The BRS used was either unamended (control) or amended with organic (e. g. greenwaste compost and biochar) or inorganic (e. g. zeolite) materials {{at a rate of}} 10 % v/v. BRS from 15 years of rehabilitation (15 YRRH) was also used as the second control. <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizer</b> was applied at different rates. The experimental set up was arranged in a two factorial complete randomized design. BRS with zeolite and 15 YRRH at <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizer</b> rates of 2. 0 and 2. 5 t/ha produced the highest dry matter, leaf N concentration and N uptake by ryegrass, which were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than the other treatments, suggesting the potential of zeolite in providing stability of applied N fertilizer in BRS. Further, BRS with biochar at NP rates 2. 0 and 2. 5 t/ha can also be suitable amendments as they enhance growth and also improved the N and P supplying capacity of BRS. Ryegrass leaf P concentration and P uptake were above the critical P values in the 15 YRRH compared with organic-inorganic amended BRS, suggesting that time is important for better P uptake from the residue. It is concluded that zeolite and biochar combined with appropriate <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizer</b> rates can improve plant growth and provide a source of nutrients for ryegrass establishment in bauxite residue storage areas.

Treatments comprised of 03 cotton cultivars (TH- 41 / 83, 35 / 83 and Rehmani) and 10 fertilizer levels. It has been observed that cotton cultivar TH- 35 / 83 gave highest seed cotton yield per plant i. e., 95. 13 g, fallowed by TH - 41 / 83 i. e., 84. 19 g plant - 1. While the maximum yield per plant was recorded under fertilizer level 200 - 50 kg ha - 1 (100. 52). Cultivar TH – 41 / 83 gave highest yield per plot 4. 89 kg and 3773. 12 kg ha - 1. Cultivar Rehmani gave lowest yield i. e. 3. 97 kg plot - 1 and 3063. 25 kg ha - 1. It is also investigated that <b>NP,</b> <b>fertilizer</b> level 200 - 75 kg ha - 1, produced maximum cotton yield 4. 88 kg plot - 1 and 37. 65. 40 -kg ha - 1 </sup...|$|E
30|$|The {{marketable}} {{and total}} yield of tomato were markedly {{influenced by the}} application of <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> vermicompost and their combination and they followed a similar trend as the marketable and total fruit number per plant. Integrating 75 % RDF with 11.25 ton ha− 1 of vermicompost (T 6) gave the best marketable and total yield (48.23 and 52.51 ton ha− 1) which was significantly different from other treatments investigated, followed by T 3 (44.64 and 48.96 ton ha− 1). The minimum yields (23.25 and 26.61 ton ha− 1) of the respective variables were recorded for the control treatment (T 1). T 6 and T 3, respectively, had a marketable yield advantage of 107.44 and 92 % over the control, 18.68 and 9.73 % over the sole mineral fertilizer (T 7); and 26.79 and 17.35 % over the sole vermicompost (T 8) treatments. The total and marketable yield variations among T 4, T 5 and T 7 and between T 5 and T 8 were statistically not significant (P >  0.05). The {{results of the present}} study were in agreement with those obtained by Chatterjee et al. (2014) who reported a great increase in yield of tomato when 75 % RDF chemical fertilizer was combined with higher amount of manure including vermicompost and bio fertilizer. The authors had also substantiated vermicompost as a better organic nutrient source over farmyard manure.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Eastern Amhara Region of Ethiopia to evaluate effects of intercropping sorghum with Tephrosia vogelii, Tithonia diversifolia and Leucenea palida on sorghum yield and soil fertility. The results showed that intercropping Tephrosia v. and Leucenea p. with sorghum didn’t have significant (p> 0. 05) negative effect on sorghum yields. However, sorghum-Tithonia d. intercropping significantly (p < 0. 05) harmed sorghum yields. The results of sorghum yields in the subsequent two experimental years, after ploughing under the above ground biomass of the green manures, revealed that plots which received Tephrosia v. and Tithonia d without inorganic fertilizers gave significantly (p < 0. 05) similar yields with application of 100 % of the recommended <b>NP</b> <b>fertilizers.</b> However, due to its poor growth and lowest biomass, Leucenea p. didn’t effect a significant yield difference over the control. At the end of the experiment, 8. 1 and 7. 3 % residual deposition of soil organic carbon was recorded on the plots under Tephrosia v. and Tithonia d., respectively. Thus, it is possible to recommend sorghum-Tephrosia v. intercropping and green manuring. While, due to its weed effect, Tithonia d. is not recommended for intercropping; it is rather recommended to transfer its biomass through cut and carry system.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on farmers' field in sofi district of Harari Regional State during 2013 / 2014 main cropping season, eastern Ethiopia, to investigate the impact of brewery sludge on sorghum production and soil fertility. The treatments comprised seven levels of brewery sludges (0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0, 12. 5 and 15. 0 t ha- 1) and <b>NP</b> inorganic <b>fertilizer</b> at recommended rate, arranged in randomized complete block design with four replications. Application of brewery sludge at 15 t ha- 1 significantly increased the yield and biomass yield of sorghum by 79 and 85 % over control and by 57 and 67 % over NP application, respectively. There was no effect of brewery sludge application on heavy metals concentrations in soil after crop harvest, compared to international standard tolerable level. Co and Se levels were high in the control {{as well as in}} the soils treated with brewery sludge indicating the already high concentration of these heavy metals in the soils of the area. Plots, which received higher brewery sludge application, resulted in decreased or less percentage of grain nitrogen content showing the independence of grain protein content on lower brewery sludge level. The nitrogen uptake by sorghum grain, straw and the total was maximum (52. 68, 44. 25 and 79. 03 kg ha- 1, respectively) with the application of brewery waste sludge at 10 and 15 t ha- 1 which were significantly higher than the other brewery sludge and <b>NP</b> mineral <b>fertilizer</b> applications...|$|R
