5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because they would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and}} neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> elevated.|$|E

5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|Tregelles dated the {{manuscript}} to the 8th century. Tregelles {{was aware that}} the handwriting is typical for the 6th century, but the handwriting of the commentary is much older. The letters ΕΘΟΣ are round, high, and narrow, and could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written before the 8th century. C. R. Gregory supported Tregelles's point of view.

5|$|Denied episcopal office, Wilfrid {{spent the}} three years from 665 to 668 as abbot of the monastery at Ripon.
