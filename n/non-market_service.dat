40|$|Developing {{policy and}} {{delivering}} {{services to people}} with disabilities is {{an important aspect of}} our society. As with all areas of policy and service provision, accurate, timely and reliable data are fundamental to the setting, monitoring and examination of that provision. Market and <b>non-market</b> <b>service</b> providers, advocacy groups and the general population seek increasingly detailed data on the prevalence, nature, severity and life circumstances of those people in our society who experience disability. However, disability is complex and difficult to measure. Whilst most people 2 ̆ 7 know 2 ̆ 7 what disability means there is little consensus as to a complete but concise definition of the concept that could be employed in censuses, surveys or other data and research instruments. This paper explores the recent experience of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency in defining, identifying and surveying this seemingly growing group in our society. Previous survey instruments as well as current international models are examined. Experiences of surveying in the usual arena of the household are compared with the survey process experienced in communal establishments such as long-stay hospital wards and care homes. The key results from analyses to date are also highlighted...|$|E
40|$|This article deals {{with the}} {{definition}} of amenity and more specifi- cally with cultural amenity issues. The very concept of amenity still remains unclear though it has been widely used both in the environmental field since the 70 ’s, and in the cultural one {{since the beginning of}} the twentieth century. In the latter stream of literature, it is used to discuss urban development based on culture and creative class theory. However, the concept is often reduced to the amount of cultural equipment available in a city. We define an amenity as a <b>non-market</b> <b>service</b> provided by the specific features pertaining to an area. In addition, the amenity is a non-excludable and non-rivalrous service within this area. The originality of this paper lies in the analysis of the conditions under which cultural amenities can be generated and strengthened at a city scale. The process of cultural amenity generation depends on three main features concerning cultural assets: their density, their anchorage in the city and the implementation of flagship assets. Cultural activities can be instrumental in shaping charm, image and ambiance of cities. The last three items are examples of amenities. The randomness, the complexity and the bottom-up aspect of the amenity generation phenomenon is also discussed. Side issues that are at stake such as city gentrification, strategies of access to amenities are also part of our reflection. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{empirical}} study of the contribution of the services sector to per capita economic growth for Pacific Island countries. Design/methodology/approach – Within the new growth theory framework, the empirical procedure consisted of the regression analysis of data using the panel data fixed effects procedure. Findings – The results confirm the positive and statistically significant correlation of services growth to per capita gross domestic product growth. Research limitations/implications – Limitations largely centre on the use of aggregate cross-country data. Variations may be found in what actually drives the services growth at the country level. Thus, a country-specific study would be more appropriate in order to get more robust results. Also, the data do not capture the effect of <b>non-market</b> <b>services.</b> Disaggregate services data that separate market data <b>services</b> with <b>non-market</b> <b>services</b> would provide a more accurate picture of the influence of <b>non-market</b> <b>services.</b> Practical implications – The practical implication is that that service sectors in the Pacific Island countries ought to be given greater support, for example, investment in physical and institutional infrastructure, market access, financial support, skill development and investment incentives. Social implications – Pacific Islands services sectors contribute to household welfare through paid employment and meet household demands of service sector output. Originality/value – This paper presents the first study among the Pacific Island countries that has examined the importance of services sector and its contribution to growth. The findings of this study are useful to Pacific policy makers in terms of improving the services sector through instituting appropriate growth enhancing policies.

The first chapter contains a description of indices and their use in {{the system of the}} national accounts. The second chapter is focused on the system of the national accounts especially supply and use tables, which are the basis for the estimate of macro aggregates at the prices of the reference period. The third chapter describes <b>non-market</b> <b>services</b> and their deflation. Output of <b>non-market</b> <b>services</b> is estimated as the sum of related costs. Input method does not allow to estimate productivity and efficiency of their provision. The main part of the chapter is devoted to the description of the developed methodology for deflation of education services in the Czech Republic, which is in line with international recommendations and enables an estimate of productivity. Using the methodology an estimate of the development of education services has been done for the year 2004 and onwards. The forth chapter deals with regional price levels and possibilities of their estimate. The description of the developed methodology as well as estimated price level for 2007 is included in this chapter.

Farmers may turn to conjunctive water management using on-farm reservoirs and tail water recovery when groundwater pumping becomes expensive. We use separate objectives for market returns from crops and the non-market benefits of ecosystem services to study whether on-farm reservoirs are built with optimal cropping and irrigation choices. The use of reservoirs enables the landscape to attain up to 10 % higher market returns for a given level of all <b>non-market</b> ecosystem <b>service</b> benefits by lowering the costs of irrigation, increasing groundwater levels, and reducing fuel combustion and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from groundwater pumping.

Our results also suggest that the production of public <b>non-market</b> <b>services</b> would offset the government compensation payments to support Stone pine afforestation and management. Finally, the results show that, on average, 7 % of the estimated total income would be captured by the current System of National Accounts for forestry if applied to our case study (including only the net value added from timber and pine cone production and from plantation investment) and that 14 % of this income would be dislocated into the government institutional accounts...|$|R
30|$|In summary, the {{experience}} in the Norwegian taxi service industry is that competitive tendering is no universal quick fix. In markets where the public authority has a series of policy objectives, purchase of transport services should reflect this to some extent. This can be done either by including the <b>non-market</b> <b>services</b> in the tenders or by requiring these service obligations to be met by all operators. The evidence suggests that competitive tendering is effective in creating price competition, where more than one actor can provide the service. However, {{the experience}} also shows that the heterogeneity between sectors and between markets within the same sector can result in different market responses to the same regulation. This highlights the need to look carefully at each market, and choose the method for procurement suited for that particular market.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} new {{approach}} for assessing the cost of marginal ecosystem changes {{and the effectiveness of}} agri-environmental schemes. The approach is based on a theoretical and empirical analysis of the bio-economic production interactions between marketed outputs and <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> at the micro level. To frame the economic nature of the problem, we employ a generalized joint production model in combination with cost minimization. The generalized joint production framework allows for the consideration of complementary, substitutive and competitive relationships between agricultural production and <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem <b>services</b> generation and avoids double counting. From this theoretical model we distinguish three theoretical cases depending on the imposed minimum acceptable level of the <b>non-marketed</b> ecosystem <b>services.</b> We employ farm level panel data for the UK to empirically investigate these cases. More specifically, to represent and evaluate the production structure, we estimate first- and second-order elasticities derived from a flexible transformation function. Results show that the majority of farms produce agricultural output and ecosystem services in a complementary relationship. Generation of multiple ecosystem services on the same farm showed either a substitutive or competitive relationship.

The spatial distribution of employment in these population-based activities is analyzed at the geographic scale of functional economic areas. The estimation of tourism-related employment uses the minimum requirements technique to assess the specific impact of tourism attractiveness on the population-based services. To explain the geography of population-based employment, explanatory factors relate to local market potential and the ability of territories to attract or retain consumers. Though, generally speaking, the distribution of population-based employment follows the urban hierarchy, one should also take account of sectoral characteristics that set <b>non-market</b> <b>services</b> somewhat apart, as well as geographic specificities in periurban areas and tourism resorts. population-based economy, location factors, tourism employment, minimum requirements approach...|$|R

In order to achieve this aim, we use a set of econometric techniques proposed in the literature for dealing with spatial data. The results obtained reveal the presence of positive spatial dependence in the variable of interest. This means that spatially close regions register similar welfare levels in the European context. The empirical evidence presented also shows that high welfare regions tend to be those characterised {{by the presence of}} certain types of advanced services with elevated productivity and by a relatively important endowment of human capital. However, the regional unemployment rates, the size of the agricultural sector and the <b>non-market</b> <b>services</b> are negatively correlated with the study variable.

Forests and woodlands provide a number of critical ecosystem services to society throughout the country (Smail and Lewis 2009), including a number of <b>non-market</b> <b>services.</b> These may be of particular relevance in the northeast where forested land is concentrated {{in the hands of}} non-industrial private owners who value <b>non-market</b> benefits and <b>services</b> over commodity production (Butler and Leatherberry 2004). Using data from long-term experiments at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, we assessed the capacity of several first-order watersheds to provide a suite of services over a 45 -year period. We surveyed citizens of Grafton County, New Hampshire (where Hubbard Brook is located) to determine the relative importance attached by these potential beneficiaries to each individual ecosystem service. Importance values calculated from survey responses were used in conjunction with ecosystem service metrics to calculate an overall index of ecosystem services. This index was used to conduct an MCA aimed at understanding which forest management and wood utilization practices have the potential to optimize service provision to different segments of the beneficiary population. Our objectives in this study were to 1) demonstrate how beneficiary surveys may be used to estimate non-monetary service values suitable for use in MCA, and 2) illustrate how ecosystem capacity to produce services may change over time in response to management, climate, and other forcing factors, and how that change will determine which management practices (including wood utilization practices) optimize potential benefit flows.|$|R
