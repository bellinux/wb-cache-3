5000|$|During her beatification, 7 March 1999, Pope John Paul II said: [...] "If {{we look to}} Blessed Anna Schäffer, we read in {{her life}} a living {{commentary}} on what Saint Paul wrote to the Romans: 'Hope does <b>not</b> <b>disappoint,</b> <b>because</b> the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that {{has been given to}} us' (Rom. 5:5). She most certainly was not spared the struggle to abandon herself to the will of God. But she was given to grow in the correct understanding that weakness and suffering are the pages on which God writes His Gospel ... Her sickbed became the cradle of an apostolate that extended to the whole world." ...|$|R

His forethought pleased him; and again he told himself that the present course of action was justified.|$|R
500|$|James {{felt that}} the Ascension's title match was bland, but he liked that their {{characters}} had gone from cheesy to serious. James said that the women's match was fantastic and he [...] "loved the small touches", while praising Paige's new look, saying that it [...] "just exudes danger". For the main event, James said that [...] "this didn't feel like a ladder match. Dallas simply {{did not take the}} risks needed to show that he really wanted to retain his title". However, he was <b>not</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>because</b> he did <b>not</b> [...] "expect too much from a Bo Dallas match". James felt that it was a problem to close the show with Dallas-Neville because [...] "the show could only go down" [...] from Cesaro-Zayn. Lastly, James had some technical issues viewing the live stream of the event, where the video paused during the Cesaro-Zayn match, and the feed cut out during Rusev's appearance, but returned before the main event match started.|$|R

50|$|The real spectator boom {{began in}} Kragujevac {{in the late}} sixties. In 1969, Radnički were {{promoted}} first time to the Yugoslav First League after beating Sutjeska from Nikšić and FK Crvenka in the play-off. To Nikšić traveled more than 1,000 Radnički supporters and in Crvenka came up to several thousand. At that time began the first approaches of organized support. In the Yugoslavian league Radnički acquired much more supporters. In the home game against Hajduk Split were 35,000 spectators. But the away win against Partizan Belgrade should make history. On this 7 September, in 1969, the Radnički fans support their team particularly fanatical and organized {{one of the first}} torch show. The atmosphere was so fantastic that it was compared with the atmosphere at Old Trafford stadium in Manchester (statements from local and foreign journalists and opponents). On this day, the Radnički fans and the club were given the nickname Crveni Djavoli (English: Red Devils), after the nickname for Manchester United. All thus made headlines. After that game, the Brazilian football giant FC Santos with the legendary Pele was so impressed by the atmosphere, instead of the friendly game against Partizan Belgrade, they drove to Kragujevac and played against Radnički. They were <b>not</b> <b>disappointed,</b> <b>because</b> 40,000 spectators were at the Čika Dača Stadium and around the stadium were a further seven to eight thousand enthusiastic fans. Radnički achieved with the support of their Djavoli in a legendary atmosphere a 4-4 draw. The Djavoli attracted thereby for the first time worldwide attention on themselves. In these years Radnički´s home games were very well attended and well known for its great atmosphere mainly made by Djavoli. Numerous Djavoli traveled to away games. So they went to the games to Belgrade, Split, Zagreb, Skopje, Ljubljana, Maribor and other cities.|$|R

40|$|After {{years of}} poor {{economic}} performance, many Latin American countries undertook ambitious programs of macroeconomic stabilization andstructural reform in recent years. This {{change in policy}} created high expectations for the region, and some observers have questioned whether actual growth outcomes have lived up to these expectations. The authors offer evidence that the response of economic growth to reforms in Latin America has <b>not</b> been <b>disappointing.</b> <b>Because</b> of their significant policy changes, and despite a global slowdown, Latin America did well to return to its historic growth rate of 2 percent per capita in 1990 - 93. Latin America has responded to changes in policy variables, as would have been predicted by the experience of other times and places. Those earlier experiences are summarized by a panel regression spanning many countries and multi-year periods from 1960 to 1993. To get consistent estimates of the parameters linking growth and policy variables, the authors use a dynamic panel methodology that both controls for unobserved time- and country-specific effects and accounts for the likely internal dynamism of the explanatory variables.

It can never be said of John Paul that he lacked either independence or spirit. But a nobleman was a nobleman then.|$|R

But at the present moment her great fears and her great hopes were centred on her son. She would not care how grey might be her hair, or how savage might be Mr Alf, if her Felix were to marry this heiress. On the other hand, nothing that pearl-powder or the 'Morning Breakfast Table' could do would avail anything, unless he could be extricated from the ruin that now surrounded him. So she went down into the dining-room, that she might be sure to hear the key in the door, even should she sleep, and waited for him with a volume of French memoirs in her hand.|$|R
