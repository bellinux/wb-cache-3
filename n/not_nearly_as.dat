5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of {{the most}} reliable dates, due to the use of radiocarbon dating on volcanic ash deposits, as well as {{some of the}} earliest MSA sites. Faunal preservation, however, is not spectacular, and standardization in site excavation and lithic classification was, until recently, lacking. Unlike northern Africa, shifts between lithic technologies were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> pronounced, likely due to more favorable climatic conditions that would have allowed for more continuous occupation of sites. Central Africa reflects similar patterning to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region is certainly required.|$|E

5|$|New York City {{attorney}} William Shea {{was attempting}} to create the Continental League, a rival league to Major League Baseball. Hunt met with him, and Shea suggested Harry Wismer, a minority shareholder in both the Washington Redskins and Detroit Lions, as a potential New York franchise owner for the new football league. Wismer was willing; he was feuding at the time with the Redskins' principal owner, George Preston Marshall, and realized he would never own the Washington franchise. Wismer, while wealthy, was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> rich as the other potential team owners.|$|E
5|$|Tech quarterback Reggie Ball was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> acclaimed. Despite {{leading the}} ACC with 20 {{touchdown}} passes and being named an All-ACC honorable mention, there were doubts about Ball's effectiveness. Since starting at quarterback in his freshman year, Ball went 0-4 against Tech rival Georgia, and was excoriated for his inconsistency. After suffering a game-losing fumble against the Bulldogs, commentators questioned how well Ball would recover from the setback before the ACC Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} {{mentioned in the}} earliest advertisement {{but it was not}} featured until March 1974. This was the same size as a desktop calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering hexadecimal key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a few units arranged ceasefires but the truces were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> widespread as in 1914; this was, in part, due {{to strongly}} worded {{orders from the}} high commands of both sides prohibiting fraternisation. Soldiers were no longer amenable to truce by 1916. The war had become increasingly bitter after devastating human losses suffered during the battles of the Somme and Verdun, and the incorporation of poison gas.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's {{defense was}} strongest against the rush. During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally. Their passing defense was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful. On average, the Tigers allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, the defense was ranked No. 37. In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, the Tigers were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E

This feature, along with earlier-mentioned lower labor costs and fast service, is enabling such companies {{to contribute to the}} numerical decline of America’s corporations and other multi-tiered companies. (Such companies may have many employees, but Nike-like companies do <b>not</b> have <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> many as they would have if they did not use subcontractors and Uber-like companies do <b>not</b> have <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> many as they would have if they hired all of their partners as employees).|$|R

5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|Phips and {{the crew}} were rewarded by the investors with medals, and Phips was knighted by James in June. James also rewarded Phips with the post of provost marshal general (chief sheriff) of the Dominion of New England, serving under Sir Edmund Andros. In September 1687 Phips {{returned}} to the wreck, {{though he did not}} command the venture. Admiral Narborough elected to personally lead the expedition, but it was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful. The wreck had been discovered by others, and the arrival of the English scattered more than 20 smaller ships. Treasure worth £10,000 was recovered before Narborough's death in May 1688 brought the expedition to an end. Phips had by then already left the wreck site in early May, sailing for Boston for what seems to have been his first time home in four and a half years, to take up his new post as provost marshal general.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus fruit {{bodies are}} {{sometimes}} infested with larvae, though <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> often as S.granulatus or B.edulis. Damage from maggots {{is much more}} common in warmer months, and rare {{late in the season}} with cooler weather. In a Finnish study, researchers found that 70–95% of fruit bodies collected from typical forest habitats were infested with larvae; the most common species were the flies Mycetophila fungorum, Pegomya deprimata, and Pegohylemyia silvatica. In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae. The fungus produces microscopic crystals of oxalic acid at the surface of its hyphae, a feature that is thought to help deter grazing by the springtail species Folsomia candida.|$|E

5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, most {{commonly}} known as Rawlings' Regiment in period documents, was organized in June 1776 as a specialized light infantry unit of riflemen in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The American rifle units complemented the predominant, musket-equipped, line infantry forces of the war with their long-range marksmanship capability and were typically deployed with the line infantry as forward skirmishers and flanking elements. Scouting, escort, and outpost duties were also routine. The rifle units' battle formation was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> structured {{as that of the}} line infantry units, which employed short-range massed firing in ordered linear formations. The riflemen could therefore respond with more adaptability to changing battle conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} the Forgotten Realms setting is the {{continent}} of Faerûn, part of the fictional world of Abeir-Toril, usually called simply Toril, an Earth-like planet with many real-world influences. Unlike Earth, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet Toril is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other peoples and creatures. Technologically, {{the world of the}} Forgotten Realms is <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> advanced as that of Earth; in this respect, it resembles the pre-industrial Earth of the 13th or 14th century. However, the presence of magic provides an additional element of power to the societies. There are several nation states and many independent cities, with loose alliances being formed for defense or conquest. Trade is performed by ship or horse-drawn vehicle, and manufacturing is based upon cottage industry.|$|E
5|$|This system {{developed}} as a tropical depression just offshore {{the west coast of}} Africa on September6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. However, about 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Still moving westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought 1,200deaths and extensive damage, including the destruction of approximately 85%–95% of banana crops, the severe damage dealt to 70%–80% of tree crops, and the roughly 40% of the sugar cane crops ruined. Martinique, Montserrat, and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities, but the impacts at those locations were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> severe as in Guadeloupe.|$|E

5|$|White Americans make {{up about}} three-fifths of Minneapolis's population. This {{community}} is predominantly of German and Scandinavian descent. There are 82,870 German Americans in the city, making up over one-fifth (23.1%) of the population. The Scandinavian-American population is primarily Norwegian and Swedish. There are 39,103 Norwegian Americans, making up 10.9% of the population; there are 30,349 Swedish Americans, making up 8.5% of the city's population. Danish Americans are <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> numerous; there are 4,434 Danish Americans, making up only 1.3% of the population. Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish Americans together make up 20.7% of the population. This means that ethnic Germans and Scandinavians together make up 43.8% of Minneapolis's population, and make {{up the majority of}} Minneapolis's non-Hispanic white population. Other significant European groups in the city include those of Irish (11.3%), English (7.0%), Polish (3.9%), French (3.5%) and Italian (2.3%) descent.|$|E
5|$|Johann Tetzel {{responded to}} the Theses by calling for Luther to be burnt for heresy and having theologian Konrad Wimpina write 106 theses against Luther's work. Tetzel defended these in a disputation before the University of Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1518. 800 copies of the printed disputation were sent to be sold in Wittenberg, but {{students}} of the University seized them from the bookseller and burned them. Luther became increasingly fearful that the situation was out of hand {{and that he would}} be in danger. To placate his opponents, he published a Sermon on Indulgences and Grace, which did not challenge the pope's authority. This pamphlet, written in German, was very short and easy for laypeople to understand. Luther's first widely successful work, it was reprinted twenty times. Tetzel responded with a point-by-point refutation, citing heavily from the Bible and important theologians. His pamphlet was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> popular as Luther's. Luther's reply to Tetzel's pamphlet, on the other hand, was another publishing success for Luther.|$|E
5|$|The third {{important}} {{work of this}} period is the Virgin of the Rocks, commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, {{to be done with}} the assistance of the de Predis brothers, was to fill a large complex altarpiece. Leonardo chose to paint an apocryphal moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant John the Baptist, in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water. While the painting is quite large, about , it is <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> complex as the painting ordered by the monks of St Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the Confraternity, while Leonardo took the other to France. The Brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de Predis their payment, until the next century.|$|E
