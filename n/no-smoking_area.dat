Given this documented link between exposure to smoke-filled environments and deleterious health consequences, there is a need to develop effective procedures that establish and maintain <b>no-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> in various public settings. The present study focused on decreasing cigarette smoking in a section of a university cafeteria. Posting of no-smoking signs was found to decrease levels of smoking only minimally.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{will argue that}} the state can limit {{individual}} freedoms, rights, or autonomy in instances where such restrictions maximize utility—defined here as well-being—using act-utilitarianism and state paternalism as the theoretical foundation of my argument. The state already follows such restrictions in many cases, as in <b>no-smoking</b> <b>areas</b> and helmet and seatbelt laws, and I {{will argue that the}}re follows a logical expansion of these limited restrictions to more controversial restrictions. I will use the examples of food regulation and gun control as specific cases for my argument. There is, however, a de facto limit to my claims: if a restriction does not maximize utility, then it is not justifiable and should not be implemented. I will present several cases of this to iterate the point throughout this paper, as well as a section on why restricting freedom of speech is unjustifiable. I will also provide several objections to my thesis and responses. One of the most common objections to my thesis is that it invasively controls the individual and could potentially lead to an abuse of state power; I will respond to this objection throughout my paper, as well as other pertinent objections...|$|R
40|$|A {{carefully}} structured Tobacco Harm Reduction (THR) initiative, with e-cigarettes as {{a prominent}} THR modality, added to current tobacco control programming, {{is the most}} feasible policy option likely to substantially reduce tobacco-attributable illness and death in the United States over the next 20 years. E-cigarettes and related vapor products are the most promising harm reduction modalities because of their acceptability to smokers. There are about 46 million smokers in the United States, and an estimated 480, 000 deaths per year attributed to cigarette smoking. These numbers have been essentially stable since 2004. Currently recommended pharmaceutical smoking cessation protocols fail in about 90 % of smokers who use them as directed, even {{under the best of}} study conditions, when results are measured at six to twelve months. E-cigarettes have not been attractive to non-smoking teens or adults. Limited numbers non-smokers have experimented with them, but hardly any have continued their use. The vast majority of e-cigarette use is by current smokers using them to cut down or quit cigarettes. E-cigarettes, even when used in <b>no-smoking</b> <b>areas,</b> pose no discernable risk to bystanders. Finally, addition of a THR component to current tobacco control programming will likely reduce costs by reducing the need for counseling and drugs...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{summarized}} {{the final results}} of a two-month continuous monitoring campaign on seven smoking lounges and some copy areas in a building housing the offices of a big company. The monitoring is based in particular on the detection of suspended particulates, in order to confirm some experimental correlations of the PM 10 / PM 2. 5 ratio in this critical situation. The experimental measures have been performed in smoking lounges equipped following the technical requirements of the Italian Regulation (DPCM 23 December 2003) recently approved (10 January 2005). The final results show how PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations in the proximity of smoking areas were similar to the conditions of an outdoor high-polluted environment while inside smoking lounges the mean values detected were respectively 110 and 60 µg/m 3 confirming the PM 10 /PM 2. 5 ratio of between 1. 5 and 2. 5 reported in technical literature. As a conclusion {{it is possible to}} underline how the presence of HVAC plants with specific requirements (no air recirculation, inlet air flow-rate 105 m 3 /h per person, ∆P of 5 Pa between smoking lounge and surrounding areas) is able to prevent the diffusion of passive smoke in <b>no-smoking</b> <b>areas.</b> Moreover, the extrasmall particulates (PM 2. 5 and PM 1) are not removed enough inside smoking lounges due to the great decrease of the filter capitation efficiency for particulate matter with diameters lower than 3 – 5 µm...|$|R
