5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of <b>non-resident</b> nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, <b>non-resident</b> nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, whether they had asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{instructions}} from the Ministry of Justice (Dirección General de Registros y Notariado), Spanish Consulates abroad may carry out the preliminary paperwork for a same-sex marriage. At {{least one of the}} marrying partners must be a Spanish citizen, residing in the Consular demarcation. However, the marriage itself can only take place at the Consulate if local laws recognize same-sex marriages. In all other cases, the partners must marry in Spanish territory. Two <b>non-resident</b> foreigners cannot marry in Spain, as {{at least one of the}} partners must be a Spanish resident, although they both may be non-Spanish citizens.|$|E
5|$|Kollam Airport, {{established}} {{under the}} Madras Presidency and closed before {{the inauguration of}} Trivandrum International Airport in the capital, was the first airport in Kerala. Trivandrum International Airport, managed by the Airport Authority of India, is among the oldest existing airports in South India. Cochin International Airport is the busiest {{in the state and}} the seventh-busiest in the country. It was the first Indian airport to be incorporated as a public limited company; it was funded by nearly 10,000 <b>non-resident</b> Indians from 30 countries.

5|$|Males {{and females}} {{have been seen}} {{sleeping}} and foraging together as monogamous pairs, although polygamy and solitary behavior has also been observed. At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs {{one out of every}} three days. During social grooming (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using a scent gland on the throat, and grooming sessions can last several minutes. While feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over <b>non-resident</b> males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta).|$|E
5|$|Support for {{the protests}} started to {{extend to the}} local {{community}} when Jean Gosling, a lollipop lady in Wanstead, upon learning of the tree's impending destruction, rallied the support of local children (and was later fired from her job for doing so while wearing her uniform), who in turn recruited their parents into the protests. It was then that the <b>non-resident</b> radicals realised that they had significant local support. When local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 November, they found their way barred by security fencing. With support from the protesters, they pulled it down.|$|E
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to <b>non-resident</b> companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E

5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. <b>Non-resident</b> males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E
5|$|These {{fundamental}} rights help {{not only in}} protection but also the prevention of gross violations of human rights. They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some {{fundamental rights}} apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. The right to life and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including <b>non-resident</b> Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E
5|$|The Teaneck Community Charter School (TCCS) had a 2011–12 {{enrollment}} of 306 students in Kindergarten through eighth grade with 26.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.77:1. TCCS is {{a charter school}} that operates independently of the Teaneck Public Schools under a charter granted by the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education, which was renewed for five years in 2012. Admission {{is open to the}} public for available slots (after returning students and siblings of existing students are entered) and offers an after school program and summer camp. As the school is a public school, no tuition is charged. Funding comes from the Teaneck Public Schools (and the home districts of <b>non-resident</b> students), which provides 90% of its cost per pupil in the district; the balance of funding comes directly from the state of New Jersey. The school moved to a new building at 563 Chestnut Avenue in the 2009–10 school year, from a space it had rented on Palisade Avenue.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the adequacy of meals provided for elderly residents and <b>non-residents</b> of nursing homes in Croatia. Menus of 44 ali-day meals provided for residents from 4 nursing homes and 34 meals on wheels provided for <b>non-residents</b> of low socioeconomic status were selected by random sampling. A questionnaire was used to determine socioeconomic status and attitude of residents (n = 89) and <b>non-residents</b> (n = 80) regarding meals offered. An average energy value of ali-day meals and meals on wheels was 96. 7 and 39. 8 % RDA respectively. All-day meals provide adequate amounts of the micronutrients examined (phosphorus, iron, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin C) with exception of calcium. Fat provided 35 % and 36 % of energy for ali-day meals and meals on wheels respectively. The body mass index (BMI) under 18. 5 kg/m 2 had 1. 7 % residents and 4. 0 % <b>non-residents.</b> BMI higher than 24. 9 kg/m 2 were observed in 50 % and 47 % of residents and <b>non-residents</b> respectively. Gender differences were observed for meal preferences offered to both residents and <b>non-residents.</b> The meals provided adequate amounts of energy and the micronutrient & examined. However, a decrease in the energy fraction of fat and decrease in protein content would be advisable. Key words: nursing home, meals on wheels, elderly, nutrition, low socioeconomic statu...|$|R
