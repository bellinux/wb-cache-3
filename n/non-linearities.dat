25|$|Automatic {{gain control}} {{circuits}} require an amplifier's gain {{be controlled by}} the time-averaged amplitude so that the output amplitude varies little when weak stations are being received. The <b>non-linearities</b> are assumed arranged so the relatively small signal amplitude suffers from little distortion (cross-channel interference or intermodulation) yet is still modulated by the relatively large gain-control DC voltage.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFast digital {{multi-channel}} analyzers (FDMCA) which {{based on}} flash ADCs have been intensively used recently. The FDMCA {{is different from}} traditional MCAs which based on Wilkinson ADCs. The <b>non-linearity,</b> including the integral <b>non-linearity</b> (INL) and differential <b>non-linearity</b> (DNL), mainly arising from flash ADCs, degrade the accuracy of fast digital MCAs. To improve the <b>non-linearity</b> of FDMCA, a practical off-line correction method has been proposed in this paper. The <b>non-linearity</b> features of the FDMCA system is obtained by a special measurement previously. In light of that the <b>non-linearity</b> of a system is inherent; the <b>non-linearity</b> can be eliminated by comparing the data between the general measurement and the special one...|$|R

The soil <b>non-linearity</b> during strong motion appears at more than about 15 cm/s of PGV (Midorikawa, 1993). On the other hand, the soil <b>non-linearity</b> on PGV is very small compared with peak ground acceleration (Midorikawa and Ohtake, 2003; Fujimoto and Midorikawa, 2006).

25|$|PID controllers, {{when used}} alone, can give poor {{performance}} when the PID loop gains must be reduced {{so that the}} control system does not overshoot, oscillate or hunt about the control setpoint value. They also have difficulties {{in the presence of}} <b>non-linearities,</b> may trade-off regulation versus response time, do not react to changing process behavior (say, the process changes after it has warmed up), and have lag in responding to large disturbances.|$|E
25|$|In general, analog {{computers}} {{are limited by}} non-ideal effects. An analog signal is composed of four basic components: DC and AC magnitudes, frequency, and phase. The real limits of range on these characteristics limit analog computers. Some of these limits include the operational amplifier offset, finite gain, and frequency response, noise floor, <b>non-linearities,</b> temperature coefficient, and parasitic effects within semiconductor devices. For commercially available electronic components, ranges of these aspects of input and output signals are always figures of merit.|$|E
25|$|A digital {{computer}} simulation model of an analog system {{such as the}} brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion. However, the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision, for example due to background noise. The errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate, and sufficiently accurate models of <b>non-linearities.</b> The computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations, preferably in real time.|$|E

To quantify the confusion property of S-boxes, different <b>non-linearity</b> criteria are proposed such as usual <b>non-linearity</b> (N F), unrestricted nonlinearity (UN F), generalised <b>non-linearity</b> (GN F), higher order <b>non-linearity</b> (HN F) and so on.
