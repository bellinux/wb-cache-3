He was an enthusiastic chess player and his chess problems were published in international journals, but that was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> the position he once had {{at the center of}} affairs. He spent increasingly more time with his second family, further humiliating his legitimate wife. With nothing left to do, Konstantin retired to Pavlovsk, spending most of his time abroad or on his Crimean estate of Oreanda. In August 1881 a fire completely destroyed Oreanda. The palace was never rebuilt and Konstantin lived from then on in a wooden pavilion. Tragedy struck him again while living there. In April 1885, his two surviving illegitimate sons died days apart of scarlet fever. Of the five children Constantin had had with Kousnetzova, only the two daughters, Marina and Anna, thrived; Konstantin showered them with affection. He was also particularly close to his eldest daughter Olga whom he visited in Greece in 1883. His grandson Prince Christopher of Greece remembered him for his sharp and loud voice, which Konstantin enjoyed using, usually for new servants and preferably in the presence of guests. Without any reason he would glare at the new servant and then scream the servant's name. Some were used to the trick and remained calm, while others dropped the dishes in terror, which amused him.|$|E

[...] He added that season 3 [...] "reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals." [...] The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the Iraq War and drug prohibition, which in Simon's view has failed in its aims and has become a war against America's underclass. This is portrayed by Major Colvin, imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims.|$|E

2500|$|Analyzing strategy, Schlesinger {{maintained}} that the {{theory and practice of}} the 1950s and 1960s had been overtaken by events, particularly the rise of the Soviet Union to virtual nuclear parity with the United States and the effect this development had on the concept of deterrence. Schlesinger believed that [...] "deterrence is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> defense; defense capabilities, representing the potential for effective counteraction, are the essential condition of deterrence." [...] He had grave doubts about the assured destruction strategy, which relied on massive nuclear attacks against an enemy's urban-industrial areas. Credible strategic nuclear deterrence, the secretary felt, depended on fulfilling several conditions: maintaining essential equivalence with the Soviet Union in force effectiveness; maintaining a highly survivable force that could be withheld or targeted against an enemy's economic base in order to deter coercive or desperation attacks against U.S. population or economic targets; establishing a fast-response force that could act to deter additional enemy attacks; and establishing a range of capabilities sufficient to convince all nations that the United States was equal to its strongest competitors.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to persistent demands for dual citizenship, {{particularly from the}} diaspora in North America and other developed countries, the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) scheme was introduced by amending The Citizenship Act, 1955 in August 2005. The scheme was launched during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention at Hyderabad in 2006. Indian authorities have interpreted the law to mean a person cannot have a second country's passport simultaneously with an Indian one — even {{in the case of}} a child who is claimed by another country as a citizen of that country, and who may be required by the laws of the other country to use one of its passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in the United States or in Australia to Indian parents), and the Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter. Therefore, Overseas Citizenship of India is not an actual citizenship of India and thus, does not amount to dual citizenship or dual nationality or anyone no longer to use Indian IDs after OCI. Moreover, the OCI card is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> an Indian visa and therefore, the passport which displays the lifetime visa must be carried by OCI holders while travelling to India.OCI Cards are now being printed without the lifelong “U” Visa Sticker (which is normally pasted on the applicant's passport). [...] The proof of lifelong visa will be just the OCI Card which will have “Life Time Visa” printed on it. [...] The OCI Card will be valid with any Valid Passport."However, countries may consider the OCI as dual citizenship: for example, the UK government considers that, for purposes of the British Nationality Act 1981, [...] "OCI is considered to be citizenship of another State".|$|E

6000|$|In this we {{hear the}} voice of the new time, as we do in his exclamation that the {{perfection}} of an Encyclopædia is the work of centuries; centuries had to elapse before the foundations could be laid; centuries would have to elapse before its completion: [...] "mais à la posérité, et À L'ÊTRE QUI NE MEURT POINT!"[127] These exalted ideas were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> arduous labour. In all that Diderot writes upon his magnificent undertaking, we are struck by his singular union of common sense with elevation, of simplicity with grasp, of suppleness with strength, of modesty with hopeful confidence.

60|$|This {{question}} {{has already been}} touched upon in the First Book.(355) We remarked, that if the capital taken in loans is abstracted from funds either engaged in production, or destined to be employed in it, their diversion from that purpose is equivalent to taking the amount from the wages of the laboring-classes. Borrowing, in this case, is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> raising the supplies within the year.

The system of public loans, in such circumstances, may be pronounced the very worst which, in the present state of civilization, is still included in the catalogue of financial expedients.|$|E
