40|$|The {{assessment}} of the reliability of components requires the knowledge of their crack resistance curves, which are often not available {{due to lack of}} specimen material. More likely is the availability of typical material parameters such as the yield strength, tensile strength, uniform elongation, fracture strain as well as upper shelf impact energy and the lateral elongation of <b>notched-bar</b> <b>impact</b> test specimens. The goal of the current work consists in developing a method with which one can construct fracture resistance curves using such information. To this end, three different kinds of steels were investigated, each quite different form the others in terms of its yield strength and upper shelf impact energy. Crack resistance curves for specimens made form each of these steels were determined experimentally for temperatures between 23 C and 300 C. In addition, the respective yield curves were obtained. To determine the influence of the notch geometry on fracture behaviour, tests on radially notched tensile specimens with different notch radii in the above temperature range were carried out. Using the low-blow method, J-resistance curves for Charpy specimens were determined in instrumented <b>notched-bar</b> <b>impact</b> tests performed between 23 C and 300 C. The material model of Gurson describes ductile crack growth due to the nucleation, growth and coalescence of damage pores in the material. Although dependent on the material and temperature, the material parameters of the Gurson model are independent of the specimen geometry and rate of loading. This latter fact allows one to use the values of these parameters determined on statically-loaded fracture mechanics specimens to model specimens with other geometries and subjected to other loading conditions, in particular to model impact loaded Charpy-V specimens. The material parameters of the Gurson ductile damage model were identified {{for each of the three}} above-mentioned steels with the help of quasi-static fracture tests on different specimen geometries at different temperatures. On the basis, it was confirmed that these parameters are in fact independent of the specimen geometry. In addition, good agreement was obtained between experimentally-determined and numerically-simulated curved crack fronts in non-side-grooved specimens. Taking advantage of the fact that the material parameters are independent of the rate of loading, <b>notched-bar</b> <b>impact</b> tests were also successfully modelled using these. (orig.)

Because the EB irradiation generated dangling bonds in the silica glass, partial relaxation of residual strain probably occured around these dangling bonds in the network structure.

40|$|The basic-safety-principle {{concerning}} {{components in}} German {{nuclear power plants}} (NPP) requires a high material quality in terms of characteristic toughness values. For this purpose, at present, <b>notched-bar</b> <b>impact</b> tests are carried out for example for {{the determination of the}} brittle fracture transition temperature. Compact tension tests are performed to determine mechanical and technological characteristics such as the fracture toughness, crack initiation, the crack growth. Because of the scattering in the data, the quantification of the failure behavior in the transition zone of the toughness is only possible with restrictions. Therefore considerably high safety margins are asked for in the design to avoid failure behavior. So far, the crack growth can only be determined in standardized bending tests and requires partial load relief cycles observing the development of the crack opening displacement by a clip-gauge. The time of the crack initiation can be determined with additional time-consuming microscopic analyses of the crack surface after the bending test. The additional instrumentation of the mentioned tests with NDT should provide further information about the failure process and a more precise and reliable determination of the failure probability. In order to document the principle feasibility, three point bending tests and drop impact tests were carried out using SE(B) samples with several nondestructive sensors applied. These sensors are Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducers (EMATs) to record the ultrasonic time of flight (TOF) of an ultrasonic wave travelling around the crack, and Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors to measure magnetic flux leakage (MFL) signals emanating from the crack. It was shown that both TOF and the MFL provide information about the crack growth during the bending test. In particular, the TOF was shown to increase with the crack length, thus allowing the determination of the crack length without the partial load relief cycles that were needed before. During the drop impact tests, the high-speed acquisition of MFL signals resolved details of the crack formation process...|$|R

BACKGROUND: The literature suggests that NQNs find the transition from student to qualified nurse to be stressful and that preceptorship can reduce this stress and promote adaptation to the new role. SETTING: This study took place in one NHS Healthcare Trust in South West London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety NQNs {{were invited to participate}} in the study and the response rate was 48. 9 % (n= 44). The study took place in 2011. METHODS: Evaluative research design was used incorporating a fourfold evaluation framework of preceptee engagement, <b>impact,</b> <b>value</b> and sustainability (Ooms et al., 2011). This was a mixed methods study. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through questionnaires, reflective journals and through personal audio recordings made by the preceptees. Quantitative data were analysed through descriptive statistics and t-tests, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to assess reliability of <b>impact</b> and <b>value</b> scales. In addition analysis of open-ended questions and qualitative data was undertaken using the Framework Method of analysis. FINDINGS: Findings show that preceptee engagement in the programme was high and preceptorship was highly valued by the majority of preceptees (85 %). Preceptors played a positive role in terms of alleviating stress. Preceptorship impacted positively on preceptees in terms of development of communication skills and clinical skills, and role, personal and professional development. In addition, preceptees felt that the programme was of value despite acknowledging difficulties in making time to meet with preceptors. Preceptees also indicated that they would wish to be preceptors in the future and that they would recommend preceptorship to all nurses who are either newly qualified or new in role. Preceptees judged the preceptorship programme positively for engagement, <b>impact,</b> <b>value</b> and sustainability. CONCLUSION: The study is unique when mapped against other research studies as it explores a breadth of evaluative issues not found in other preceptorship studies, e. g. engagement, <b>impact,</b> <b>value</b> and sustainability of preceptorship. The study adds insights about sustainability of preceptorship programmes and expectations of competence of NQNs that do not appear in previous literature about preceptorship...|$|R
