She meets {{sporadically}} with social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey), who learns about incest in the household when Precious reveals who fathered her children. While Precious is in the hospital giving birth to her second child, Abdul, she meets John McFadden (Lenny Kravitz), a <b>nursing</b> <b>assistant</b> who shows her kindness. Upon returning home, her mother carelessly drops 3-day-old Abdul and hits her, angrily declaring that Precious' revelation about the incest has resulted in their being cut off from welfare. Precious fights back and runs away from her home with Abdul. As they set out, she stops at a church window and watches the choir singing a Christmas hymn inside, imagining {{that she and her}} fantasy boyfriend are together and singing the song. Precious breaks into her school classroom seeking shelter. After Blu discovers her the next morning, she frantically calls local shelters looking for a safe place for Precious to stay. Later that night, Precious stays with Blu and her live-in girlfriend. The next morning, Blu takes her and Abdul to find assistance for them.

40|$|ENGLISH ABSTRACT Title: The {{perceptions}} of nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> on care-related prevention concerning people with dementia: a mixed methods approach. Background: Because {{of the growing}} number of people with dementia, care-related prevention activities done by nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> will become increasingly important to prevent complications and maintain an acceptable quality of life. Currently it’s unknown what the {{perceptions of}} nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> towards care-related prevention in dementia care are. Aim: To gain insight into the perceptions of nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> towards care-related prevention so care-related prevention for people with dementia can be further improved in the future. Research question: How do nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> working in home care, residential or nursing homes perceive care-related prevention concerning people with dementia? Method: A mixed methods approach with survey research and individual semi-structured interviews. First, secondary analyses were done on existing survey data collected in 2011 on a sample of 206 nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants.</b> Second, in March-May 2014 12 individual semi-structured interviews were conducted to embellish the quantitative results. Results: From this study three concepts related to the perceptions of nurses and CNAs towards care-related prevention activities emerged: attitude, knowledge and skills and the future. Nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> think care-related prevention is a task of their profession. They experience insufficient knowledge and skills and they like to devote more time to care-related prevention in the future. Conclusion: Nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> perceive care-related prevention to be part of their profession. They however express the need for more education on care-related prevention, preferably in a classroom setting. In the future, nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> like to devote more time to care-related prevention and e-health can support this. Recommendations: Additional training of nurses and certified <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> focused on their different needs and use of e-health...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> {{working in}} {{residential}} care facilities need support {{to ensure that}} they provide high-quality care for the residents and support for relatives, from admission to bereavement. Aim. The aim was to describe the nurse assistants' experience of how an intervention with a palliative care approach, had influenced them in their work in residential care for older people. Participants: Fourteen <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> working in three different municipal residential care facilities. Methods: Data were collected by means of semi-structured individual interviews following an intervention consisting of study circles combined with workshops. The data were analysed using content analysis. Result: The <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> felt that, through the intervention, they had gained insight into their understanding of the importance of quality of care. This included an increased awareness of, and respect for, residents' and relatives' needs, and an increased understanding {{of the importance of the}} outcome of encounters with residents and their relatives. After the intervention, they also felt there was increased openness and understanding between colleagues. However, the <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> also expressed frustration over obstacles to implementing a palliative care approach, such as lack of resources and supportive leadership. Conclusion: The <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> felt that the intervention was positive and encouraged them to provide more person-centred care within the framework of a palliative care approach. Although the intervention was intended to involve and support the management, it was not sufficient. <b>Nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> described lack of resources and supportive leadership. There is, therefore, a need to place greater emphasis on leadership and their support of <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> so that they can provide high-quality care. Implications for practice. To support <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> in the provision of care, clear leadership and opportunities to discuss and reflect on issues associated with care, including systematic improvement work in practice, appear to be essential to ensure high-quality care...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: As jobdemands in the {{healthcare}} system increases, {{one of the main}} protective factors involves support within the work environment. Limited knowledge exists about the work environment of <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> and their well-being at work. A relatively small number of studies on this topic in the Nordic countries, and their results indicate high job demands and risk for negative health outcomes. Purpose:This study aimed to investigate nurse assistants’ perception of job demands, the servant leadership of their next superior, job satisfaction, symptoms of emotional exhaustion, and physical well-being at work. It was also investigated whether perception of servant leadership of their next superior related to job satisfaction and symptoms of emotional exhaustion. Methods: Questionnaires sent to all <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> with registered email addresses at the Icelandic <b>Nurse</b> <b>Assistants</b> Association yielded 588 participants (49 % response rate). A new Dutch inventory on servant leadership (SLI) was used to measure perception of servant leadership in nursing; additional questions explored work environment, demands, control and support at work, symptoms of burnout, and job satisfaction. To answer the research questions, a cross-sectional descriptive designwas used Results: The majority of participants experienced high job demands and reported on control and support at work. Despite high levels of burnout, the majority of <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> were satisfied at work. Servant leadership was practiced some what within <b>nurse</b> <b>assistant’s</b> workplaces. The correlation between perception of servant leadership, job satisfaction, and emotional exhaustion was significant for all SLI sub-factors except courage, and the strongest correlation was for empowerment, humility, and stewardship as sub-factors of servant leadership. Conclusion: This study highlights supportive factors within the work environment, particularly regarding the leadership-empowering role of servant leadership in nursing. Results showhow thissupportis related to <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> ́ well-being at work andsuggeststhat servant leadership can support health promotion within the work environment of <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants.</b> These findings are valuable for <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants,</b> <b>nurse</b> managersand leadershipin the health care system, thus contributingto public health ISBN 978 - 91 - 86739 - 28 - 7 </p...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{gain insight}} into the {{knowledge}} and attitudes of <b>nurses</b> and <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> and to study the correlation between knowledge, attitudes and the compliance with the pressure ulcer prevention guidelines provided to residents at risk of pressure ulcers in nursing homes. BACKGROUND: There {{is a lack of}} evidence on knowledge and attitudes of <b>nurses</b> and <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> towards pressure ulcer prevention in nursing homes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional multi-centre study. METHODS: A convenience sample of nine Belgian nursing homes, representing 18 wards was chosen in the study. In total, 145 <b>nurses</b> and <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> were included. The compliance with the guidelines was evaluated in 615 residents, and data were collected using validated instruments. RESULTS: Fully compliant prevention was found in only 6 · 9 % of the residents at risk. The mean knowledge score of the nurses was 29 · 3 vs. 28 · 7 % for the <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants.</b> The overall attitude score was 74 · 5 %, and attitude scores were significantly different between <b>nurses</b> and <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants.</b> <b>Nurses</b> showed to have a more positive attitude towards pressure ulcer prevention than <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants,</b> respectively 78 · 3 and 72 · 3 %. A more positive attitude {{was a significant predictor of}} pressure ulcer prevention compliance with the guidelines provided to residents at risk of pressure ulcers in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about pressure ulcer prevention of both <b>nurses</b> and <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> in <b>nursing</b> homes was low. Attitudes were a significant predictor of the application of fully compliant prevention in residents at risk. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Pressure ulcer prevention is an important aspect in daily care for residents at risk in nursing homes. These insights will contribute to evidence-based practice in this area of care and will form the basis for the development of an education strategy for pressure ulcer prevention and management in nursing homes...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{illuminate}} <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> {{experiences of}} the clinical decision-making process when they suspect that a resident has an infection and how their process relates to other professions. Background: The assessment of possible infection in elderly individuals is difficult and contributes to a delayed diagnosis and treatment, worsening the goal of good care. Recently we explored that <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> have a keen observational ability to detect early signs and symptoms that might help to confirm suspected infections early on. To our knowledge there are no published papers exploring how <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> {{take part in the}} clinical decision-making process. Design: Explorative, qualitative study. Setting: Community care for elderly people. Participants: Twenty-one <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants,</b> 2261 years. Methods: Focus groups with verbatim transcription. The interviews were subjected to qualitative content analysis for manifest and latent content with no preconceived categories. Findings: The findings are described as a decision-making model consisting of assessing why a resident feels unwell, divided into recognition and formulation and strategies for gathering and evaluating information, influenced by personal experiences and preconceptions and external support system and, secondly, as taking action, consisting of reason for choice of action and action, influenced by feedback from the nurse and physician. Conclusion: <b>Nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> assessment is based on knowing the resident, personal experiences and ideas about ageing. Nurses and physicians response to the <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> observations had a great impact on the latters further action. A true inter-professional partnership in the clinical decision-making process would enhance the possibility to detect suspected infection early on, and thereby minimize the risk of delayed diagnosis and treatment and hence unnecessary suffering for the individual. Relevance to clinical practice: In order to improve the clinical evaluation of the individual, and thereby optimise patient safety, it is important to involve <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> in the decision-making process...|$|R
40|$|Aim. This paper {{reports on}} a study {{examining}} the level of agreement between the pain perceptions of <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants,</b> older people without dementia and patients with Alzheimer's dementia. It was hypothesized that <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> would overestimate the pain experience of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. Background. There is now increasing evidence that, in contrast to other subtypes of dementia, patients with Alzheimer's disease might experience a decrease in pain. It is unfortunate that these latest insights into the complex relationship between subtypes of dementia and pain are not always included in education programmes for <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants.</b> Method. Twenty patients with Alzheimer's disease and 17 older people with arthrosis and/or osteoporosis but no dementia and their personal <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> participated in the study. Pain experience was assessed using the Coloured Analogue Scale {{for the assessment of}} Pain Intensity and Pain Affect, the Faces Pain Scale, and the Checklist of Non-verbal Pain Indicators. The data were collected in 2002 - 2003. Results. Before and after walking, the absolute difference in pain evaluation between <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> and older people without dementia was statistically significantly less than the difference in pain evaluation between <b>nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> and patients with Alzheimer's disease on the Coloured Analogue Scale for Pain Intensity (P = 0. 007 and P = 0. 04, respectively) and on the Coloured Analogue Scale for Pain Affect (P = 0. 009 and P = 0. 01, respectively). Conclusion. <b>Nursing</b> <b>assistants</b> may overestimate the extent of suffering from pain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. They might be very well able to estimate this pain, provided they were educated about new insights into the influence of the various subtypes of dementia on pain. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R

It was {{the purpose of this study}} to examine the interpretation of a legislated act mandating continuing education in a course of study and to explore the effect of the completion of that course on job performance. Samples of <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> employed in <b>nursing</b> homes, paraprofessional workers, who by virtue of education, income, and status, might be classified as disadvantaged adults, served as subjects for the study. This population was selected for study since its members were affected by a recently mandated course of study in Illinois. The experimental group consisted of 47 currently employed <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> enrolled in the mandated course as offered by one of three community college programs. The control group consisted of 47 <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> who were exempted from course completion by virtue of extended experience and/or previous related education. The groups were matched on the variables of age, marital status, amount of education, amount of work experience as <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants,</b> and time elapsed since last educational encounter. The problem was approached by developing a <b>Nurse</b> <b>Assistant</b> Task Performance Inventory that was utilized to determine tasks routinely performed by that group. Tasks identified as routinely performed were compared with prescribed course content. In addition, a 24 -item task performance rating scale was developed which was utilized by nursing supervisors who evaluated the performance of <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> in their employ. The task performance of control and experimental group members was evaluated at the same times. Pre- and post-course performance scores were recorded and compared. As a result of the statistical analysis of data, tested at an. 01 level of significance, the following conclusions were made: (1) there was no significant relationship between prescribed course content and job skills needed by nurse assistants; (2) there was an improvement in task performance noted in <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> who completed the course; (3) there was no significant difference between task performance of <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> who completed the mandated course and those exempted from course participation.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study nurse assistants’ {{experience}} of palliative care and to investigate how an intervention {{with a focus on}} a palliative care approach in residential care facilities influenced the <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> and their work situation. The thesis is based on two qualitative and two quantitative studies, focusing on <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> working at residential care facilities for older people. The qualitative studies were based on focus-group interviews before the intervention (I) and individual interviews after the intervention (IV). The quantitative studies (II, III) were based on a questionnaire, including several measurements, that was answered pre-, and post- intervention. The intervention consisted of study circles with <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants,</b> and workshops together with their leaders, focusing on improvement work. A total of 75 <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> participated in the intervention and answered the questionnaire at baseline and at two follow-ups, in comparison with 110 <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> who served as controls. The results show that the <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> experienced that it was difficult to focus on “being”, i. e. on relationship aspects in their work, since the main discourse in residential care focused on “doing”, i. e. on task oriented aspects. Palliative care was described as something that was only applied during a short and defined phase, namely the very last days of the residents’ life. The results also show that <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> experienced difficulties facing emotional and existential issues with regards to both the residents and their relatives (I). The results of study I were, in turn, used as a basis {{for the development of the}} intervention. The evaluation of the intervention showed that the <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants,</b> after the intervention, had increased their focus on the residents’ situation and to a greater extent stated that they focused on the residents’ life stories and on aspects that brought meaning to their lives (III). The <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> also stated that they experienced less criticism from their superiors as well as from the residents after the intervention (II). However, the evaluation also showed that the <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> had a more negative view of the leadership (II), were more critical to the medical and the nursing care (III), and that their job satisfaction had decreased (II) after the intervention. Interviews after the intervention showed that they, as a result of the intervention, had not only gained increased insight into their own significance in their encounter with residents and their relatives, but also an increased awareness of the needs of the residents and their relatives. The intervention also contributed to an increased openness in the workgroup. However, the <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants</b> also expressed frustration over barriers, primarily in the form of a lack of resources and limited leadership (IV), standing in the way of the implementation of changes. The results indicate that the <b>nurse</b> <b>assistants,</b> through discussions and reflections over praxis in their ordinary work group, developed an increased awareness about, and focus on “being”, i. e. on relationship aspects. However, it would seem that essential prerequisites, such as support from the leaders and sufficient resources for working in line with a palliative care approach, were not provided. When implementing a palliative care approach in residential care facilities, more focus on support to the leaders is needed in order to maintain sustainable changes...|$|R
