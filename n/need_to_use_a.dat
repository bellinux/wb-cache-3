25|$|For its {{transmission}} speed, RTTY has low spectral efficiency. The typical RTTY signal with 170Hz {{shift at}} 45.45 baud requires around 250Hz receiver bandwidth, {{more than double}} that required by PSK31. In theory, at this baud rate, the shift size can be decreased to 22.725Hz, reducing the overall band footprint substantially. Because RTTY, using either AFSK or FSK modulation, produces a waveform with constant power, a transmitter does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> linear amplifier, which is required for many digital transmission modes. A more efficient Class C amplifier may be used.|$|E
25|$|The new {{timetable}} {{came into}} operation on 4 October 1981. Each Intercity service was accelerated {{by a large}} margin, up to 50 minutes in some instances. Unlike the Regional Fast Rail project of the early 2000s, no track or signalling improvements were carried out in order {{to speed up the}} services. Instead 35 little used stations were closed to passenger traffic, sectional running times were revised, higher powered locomotives allocated to services, and stops at railway refreshment rooms removed due to the introduction of on train catering. Turnaround times at country termini were also cut though the use of the twin cab B, A and N class locomotives, which did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> turntable.|$|E

Jane Holly, a 45-year-old housewife, {{was gunned down}} while doing her laundry in a laundromat, and Roxanne McMillian, 23, was shot while carrying items from her car to her new apartment.

25|$|Wheelchairs are {{devices that}} can be {{manually}} propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and {{are designed to be}} a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility-related activities of daily living which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick, sip-and-puff control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair or walker.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{generally}} {{have a higher}} food conversion efficiency than more traditional meats, measured as efficiency of conversion of ingested food, or ECI. While many insects can have an energy input to protein output ratio of around 4:1, raised livestock has a ratio closer to 54:1. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that feed first needs to be grown for most traditional livestock. Additionally endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> significantly greater amount of energy just to stay warm whereas ectothermic (cold blooded) plants or insects do not. An index which can be used as a measure is the Efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance: for example, only 10% of ingested food is converted to body substance by beef cattle, versus 19–31% by silkworms and 44% by German cockroaches. Studies concerning the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) provide further evidence for the efficiency of insects as a food source. When reared at 30°C or more and fed a diet of equal quality to the diet used to rear conventional livestock, crickets showed a food conversion twice as efficient as pigs and broiler chicks, four times that of sheep, and six times higher than steers (oxen) when losses in carcass trim and dressing percentage are counted.|$|E
25|$|A model {{proposed}} by Naqvi et al. (see above) {{is that the}} insula stores {{a representation of the}} pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of drugs of abuse. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula {{may play a role in}} memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that feel as if they arise from within the body. This may make addicts feel as if their bodies <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies have forgotten the urge to use, according to this study.|$|E

500|$|African-American {{travelers}} faced real physical risks {{because of}} the widely differing rules of segregation that existed from place to place, {{and the possibility of}} extrajudicial violence against them. Activities that were accepted in one place could provoke violence a few miles down the road. Transgressing formal or unwritten racial codes, even inadvertently, could put travelers in considerable danger. Even driving etiquette was affected by racism; in the Mississippi Delta region, local custom prohibited blacks from overtaking whites, to prevent their raising dust from the unpaved roads to cover white-owned cars. A pattern emerged of whites purposefully damaging black-owned cars to put their owners [...] "in their place". Stopping anywhere that was not known to be safe, even to allow children in a car to relieve themselves, presented a risk; Milloy noted that his parents would urge him and his brother to control their <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> bathroom until they could find a safe place to stop, as [...] "those backroads were simply too dangerous for parents to stop to let their little black children pee".|$|E
500|$|By April, Robert W. Woolley {{had been}} {{commissioned}} as Director of the Mint, and he approved {{samples of the}} gold dollar, the first to have work completed, on April 22. [...] He then traveled to San Francisco, and was there when the dies for the dollar arrived on the 27th. [...] When the San Francisco Mint's coiner examined them, they proved to be lacking the mint mark [...] "S", customary on coins produced there. [...] Woolley was not sure if this was intentional, and wired to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on the 29th. [...] Upon learning that it was intentional—Joyce reasoned that as the entire mintage of this, the first commemorative issue to be struck outside Philadelphia, would be produced at San Francisco, there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> mint mark—Woolley ordered that the dies at San Francisco and in transit be returned to Philadelphia, and new ones produced with the mint mark. [...] Woolley believed that people would assume the coins were struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use a mint mark. Burdette notes that the San Francisco Mint {{was a source of}} local pride and the omission of the mint mark would likely have led to widespread protest, and possibly to two varieties of each of the new coins: with mint mark, and without. New dollar dies were sent from Philadelphia on May 3, and for the half dollar the following day. [...] Dies for the $50 followed on May 14, and for the quarter eagle on May 27.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{issues with}} the orbiter's Ku antenna were noted by Cain, {{although}} he stated they would not impact the mission.

The other issue {{had to do with}} the antenna's failure to [...] "lock on" [...] to satellite targets after being given the pointing data.
