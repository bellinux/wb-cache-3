40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Severe <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia</b> can impair {{cerebral}} oxygen supply. Data {{on long-term}} outcomes following severe <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia</b> are scarce. METHODS: Clinical data and neurodevelopmental outcome of 49 (near) term infants with haemoglobin concentration after birth < 6. 0 mmol/l were retrospectively collected and analysed. In a subgroup of 28 patients, amplitude-integrated EEG was available and in 25 infants cerebral MRI was obtained. Infants were followed up at 14 - 35 {{months of age}} and assessed with the Griffiths Scale of Mental Development or Bayley Scale of Infant Development. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (37 %) died during the neonatal period. In 25 patients MRI was performed. A predominant pattern of injury on MRI {{was seen in the}} basal ganglia and thalami in 7 patients (28 %), whereas some form of white matter injury was present in 16 (64 %) and a combination in 3 (12 %). Follow-up data were available for 26 patients (84 % of survivors). Formal assessment of neurodevelopmental outcome was performed in 20 of 31 (65 %) infants who survived (median age: 19 months, range: 14 - 35). Sixteen infants (80 %) had a developmental quotient appropriate for age in the first 2 years after birth. On motor outcome, 1 patient (5 %) scored below average (Z-score - 1. 10). One patient developed cerebral palsy. CONCLUSION: Early neurodevelopmental outcome in surviving patients with severe <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia</b> was within the normal range in the majority of the survivors. MRI showed mild-to-moderate white matter injury in two thirds of the infants. Prospectively collected data with a longer follow-up period are needed...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Two {{neonates}} who went. into acute hypovolaemic shock {{due to a}} tight nuchal cord {{were successfully}} resuscitated. The occurrence of this life threatening complication in two low risk pregnan-cies emphasises {{the importance of having}} staff trained in resuscitation immediately available in the delivery unit. Cord entanglement occurs in about 20 % of all deliveries, ' 2 and is associated with anomalies of fetal heart rate during labour, and perinatal asphyxia. ' 3 4 Recently <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia,</b> usually asymptomatic, was reported as a complication of even a loose nuchal cord. 2 This paper describes two mature infants with life threatening hypovolaemic shock caused by a tigh...|$|E
40|$|The fetomaternal {{bleeding}} {{might be}} an important cause of anaemia in the neonate. It occurs in 8 % of all pregnancies and in 1 % of them the volume may be as large as 50 ml. These losses may be acute or chronic. If the blood loss is recent, it {{may lead to a}} neonatal hypovolemic shock along with it’s drastic consequences. If the bleeding is chronic, the baby develops an iron deficiency anaemia in which situation he is pale, the hematocrit level is low but his peripheral pulse and perfusion are good. The normal level of hematocrit does not put aside a massive acute haemorrhage or a chronic fetomaternal bleeding on it’s way to burst! ABO incompatibility may have a masking effect over a <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia</b> due to the foetal bleeding. This is why it is mandatory to take into consideration this possibility. The fetomaternal bleeding is confirmed by the Kleihauer – Betke preparation of the mother’s blood. A 50 ml loss of foetal blood into the maternal circulation will show up as 1 % foetal cells in the maternal circulation. Be aware that the test is considered non valid when there is evidence of a maternal hemoglobinopathy. There are some records that the foetal anaemia is frequently associated with a particular situation – the umbilical cord wrapped around the baby – and this concludes with a <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia</b> dued to a possible compression of the umbilical vein and secondary the decrease of foetal venous blood flow...|$|E
50|$|Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) and harderoporphyria are two phenotypically {{separate}} disorders {{that concern}} partial deficiency of CPOX. Neurovisceral symptomatology predominates in HCP. Additionally, {{it may be}} associated with abdominal pain and/or skin photosensitivity. Hyper-excretion of coproporphyrin III in urine and faeces has been recorded in biochemical tests. HCP is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, whereas harderoporphyria is a rare erythropoietic variant form of HCP and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Clinically, it is characterized by <b>neonatal</b> haemolytic <b>anaemia.</b> Sometimes, the presence of skin lesions with marked faecal excretion of harderoporphyrin is also described in harderoporphyric patients.|$|R
40|$|Infantile pyknocytosis {{is a rare}} form of <b>neonatal</b> {{haemolytic}} <b>anaemia</b> {{with unusual}} red cell morphology. Anaemia is mostly severe and red blood cells transfusion is often needed. In this report, we have described a male child aged 10 days, born at 37 weeks + 3 days, who presented neonatal jaundice and severe anaemia. After a careful peripheral blood smear examination, infantile pyknocytosis was diagnosed. A treatment with recombinant subcutaneous erythropoietin (1, 000 UI/prokg/week) in conjunction with iron supplementation (6 mg/kg/day) was started. The therapy was reduced 6 weeks after the beginning and discontinued 4 weeks after the reaching of a steady state of the haemoglobin values. After 12 months of follow up, the patient showed no anaemia and pyknocytosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Neonatal,</b> poikilocytic <b>anaemia</b> in {{some members}} of the Hippotragini has {{previously}} been documented but not fully investigated. This study was undertaken to describe the erythrocyte morphology of roan antelopes (Hippotragus equinus) during the first 4 weeks after birth and to identify aspects of haemoglobin (Hb) production that might be implicated in this syndrome. Twenty-nine roan antelope calves were sampled on, or close to, 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after birth. Erythrocyte morphology was characterized, and microhaematocrit values and Hb parameters determined, for each sampling occasion. Findings indicated a significant change in erythrocyte morphology during the neonatal period and two haemoglobin types, fetal and adult, were identified. The perinatal onset of adult Hb synthesis was delayed relative to the termination of fetal Hb production, resulting in the observed anaemia. Haemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte morphology were significantly correlated. These findings suggest an intimate relationship between Hb synthesis and the observed poikilocytosis. An imbalance in the synthesis of the &# 945;- and ß-globin chains of Hb (a thalassaemia) may prove to be the underlying pathophysiology of this syndrome.

40|$|The {{effects of}} gender on {{mortality}} and morbidity of all neonates weighing less than 1500 g admitted to King's College Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during 1980 - 82 (n = 271) were examined. Very low birthweight boys {{had a significantly}} higher mortality and more postnatal complications than girls. The higher incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary interstitial emphysema in boys was associated with increased mortality in the first year. Surviving boys had significantly more problems, including lower Apgar scores at five minutes, more frequent apnoeic attacks and bradycardic episodes, transient tachypnoea, <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia,</b> and lower blood calcium and phosphate concentrations. Surviving children were followed up at 1 and 2 years of age. Development of boys at 1 year was significantly delayed compared with girls in all fields save locomotor. Although at 2 years {{some of the differences}} had diminished, those in language and personal social skills were more pronounced.

40|$|Rh isoimmunisation {{leads to}} {{haemolytic}} anaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia {{in the first}} h of life. Isolated early onset <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia</b> has rarely been reported. The authors describe {{the case of a}} term infant, born to an 'A' negative, second gravida mother. On the second day of life, pallor was noticed. His haemoglobin (Hb) was 6. 8 g/dl, he had reticulocytosis and a positive direct antiglobulin test. However, {{he did not have a}} high total serum bilirubin (TSB) (87. 2 μmol/l). He was transfused with red blood cells and kept under phototherapy for 3 days. Three weeks later, he received another transfusion for severe anaemia (Hb 6 5 g/dl). During this period, he was never jaundiced and the maximum level of TSB was 122 μmol/l. On follow-up, his Hb stabilised and he had no further problems. This report highlights the possibility of early onset anaemia without jaundice as the sole manifestation of Rh isoimmunisation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study {{maternal}} and infant effects of delayed cord clamping (≥ 180 seconds, DCC) compared to early (≤ 10 seconds, ECC) in a randomised controlled trial. Practice and guidelines regarding when to clamp the cord vary globally, and different meta-analyses have shown contradictory conclusions on benefits and disadvantages of DCC and ECC. The study population consisted of 382 term infants born after normal pregnancies and randomised to DCC or ECC after birth. The primary objective was iron stores and iron deficiency at 4 months of age, but the thesis was designed to investigate {{a wide range of}} suggested effects associated with cord clamping. Paper I showed that DCC was associated with improved iron stores at 4 months (45 % higher ferritin) and that the incidence of iron deficiency was reduced from 5. 7 % to 0. 6 %. <b>Neonatal</b> <b>anaemia</b> at 2 - 3 days was less frequent in the DCC group, 1. 2 % vs. 6. 3 %. There were no differences between the groups in respiratory symptoms, polycythaemia, or hyperbilirubinaemia. In paper II we demonstrated that DCC versus ECC was not associated with higher risk for maternal post partum haemorrhage and rendered a comparable ratio of valid umbilical artery blood gas samples. In paper III, the Ages and Stages Questionnaire was used to assess neurodevelopment at 4 months. The total scores did not differ, but the DCC group had a higher score in the problem-solving domain and a lower score in the personal-social domain. Immunoglobulin G level was 0. 7 g/L higher in the DCC group at 2 – 3 days, but did not differ at 4 months. Symptoms of infection up to 4 months were comparable between groups. Finally, in paper IV, iron stores and neurodevelopment were similar between groups at 12 months. Gender specific outcome on neurodevelopment at 12 months was discovered, implying positive effects from DCC on boys and negative on girls. We conclude that delaying umbilical cord clamping for 180 seconds is safe and associated with a significantly reduced risk for iron deficiency at 4 months, which may have neurodevelopmental effects at a later age...|$|E
40|$|<b>Neonatal</b> {{jaundice}} and <b>anaemia</b> of infancy {{are both}} common diagnostic problems. Very rarely, both these symptoms {{may be due}} to congenital spherocytosis and, unless there is a known family history of the condition, their diagnosis may be very difficult. Difficulties in diagnosis were encountered in identical twins, whose case is reported here, and whose neonatal jaundice and subsequent anaemia were thought at first to be associated with pre-maturity. The unusual course of the anaemia (Fig. 1) subsequently revealed the correct diagnosis {{even in the absence of}} other affected members of the family. The clinical features of these two cases, together with a further 41 previously reported cases occurring in the first year of life, are summarized later in Table 1. This table is analyzed in order to deter-mine the characteristic features of congenital spherocytosis in infancy, and the management of these patients is discussed. Case History Female twins were born on March 22, 1956, to a multiparous woman after a 36 -week normal pregnancy. Both were vertex presentations and the first weighed 4 lb. 5 oz.

40|$|Malaria {{transmission}} {{has declined}} substantially in the 21 st century, but pregnant women {{in areas of}} sustained transmission still require protection to prevent the adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes associated with malaria in pregnancy (MiP). A recent call to action has been issued to address the continuing low coverage of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp). This call has, however, been questioned by some, {{in part due to}} concerns about resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), the only drug currently recommended for IPTp. Using an existing mathematical model of MiP, we combined estimates of the changing endemicity of malaria across Africa with maps of SP resistance mutations and current coverage of antenatal access and IPTp with SP (IPTp-SP) across Africa. Using estimates of the relationship between SP resistance mutations and the parasitological efficacy of SP during pregnancy, we estimated the varying impact of IPTp-SP across Africa and the incremental value of enhancing IPTp-SP uptake to match current antenatal care (ANC) coverage. The risks of MiP and malaria-attributable low birthweight (mLBW) in unprotected pregnancies (i. e., those not using insecticide-treated nets [ITNs]) leading to live births fell by 37 % (33 %- 41 % 95 % credible interval [crI]) and 31 % (27 %- 34 % 95 % crI), respectively, from 2000 to 2015 across endemic areas in sub-Saharan Africa. However, these gains are fragile, and coverage is far from optimal. In 2015, 9. 5 million (8. 3 million- 10. 4 million 95 % crI) of 30. 6 million pregnancies in these areas would still have been infected with Plasmodium falciparum without intervention, leading to 750, 000 (390, 000 - 1. 1 million 95 % crI) mLBW deliveries. In all, 6. 6 million (5. 6 million- 7. 3 million 95 % crI) of these 9. 5 million (69. 3 %) pregnancies at risk of infection (and 53. 4 % [16. 3 million/ 30. 6 million] of all pregnancies) occurred in settings with near-perfect SP curative efficacy (> 99 %) based on the most recent estimates of resistance. Forty-four percent of these pregnancies (23 % of all pregnancies) were not receiving any IPTp-SP despite making ≥ 3 ANC visits, representing 160, 000 (94, 000 - 236, 000 95 % crI) preventable low birthweight (LBW) deliveries. Only 4 % (1. 4 million) of pregnancies occurred in settings with > 10 % prevalence of the sextuple haplotype associated with compromised SP effectiveness. Forty-two percent of all pregnancies occurred in settings where the quintuple dhfr/dhps haplotype had become established but where in vivo efficacy data suggest SP maintains the majority of its effectiveness in clearing infections. Not accounting for protection from the use of ITNs during pregnancy, expanding IPTp-SP to all women with ≥ 3 ANC visits in Africa could prevent an additional 215, 000 (128, 000 - 318, 000 95 % crI) LBW deliveries. In 26 countries with sufficient recent data to estimate ITN impact (population-based ITN usage data that can be stratified by gravidity), we estimate that, due primarily to low ITN use by primigravidae, only 16. 5 % of the potential LBW births prevented by scaling up IPTp-SP would in fact have already have been prevented through ITN use. Our analysis also highlights the difficulties associated with estimating the relationship between the effectiveness of interventions against parasitological endpoints such as placental infection at delivery and health outcomes including birthweight, which is also determined by a wide range of unrelated factors. We also did not capture other aspects of malaria burden such as clinical malaria, maternal and <b>neonatal</b> <b>anaemia,</b> and miscarriage, all of which increase the overall importance of effective preventative strategies but have their own relationship with transmission intensity, parity, and SP resistance. Despite recent declines in malaria transmission in Africa, the burden of MiP in the absence of adequate prevention remains substantial. Even accounting for SP resistance, extending IPTp-SP to all women attending ANC, as well as long-lasting insecticidal net distribution targeted towards first-time mothers, would have a sizeable impact upon maternal and infant health in almost all malaria-endemic settings in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E
