40|$|Seventy {{patients}} with malignant lymphomas, including the entity known as polymorphic reticulosis (PR), involving the nose, nasal sinuses, nasopharynx, oropharynx (excluding tonsil), and larynx were studied. There were 26 cases of PR, 19 cases of lymphoma with features of PR (ML[PR]) and 25 cases of conventional lymphomas. Fourteen of the 25 conventional lymphomas {{were due to}} dissemination from distant sites. For all histologic types of primary lymphoma, the presenting symptoms were similar, and the nasal cavity was more commonly involved than the nasopharynx. Patients with PR were younger, had a higher male:female ratio, and had a better overall survival rate than {{patients with}} conventional lymphomas. Cryostat section immunohistochemistry performed on 17 samples from 16 patients showed only one B lymphoma out of 11 primary lesions; the other 10 cases and three recurrent tumors at distant sites showed phenotypic markers of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. All three secondary tumors were of B-cell type. Of eight patients with sequential biopsies, progression to a more malignant histopathologic type was found in six. In the PR and ML[PR] biopsies, angiocentricity was detected in 11 %, and angioinvasion in 22 %. We could <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> <b>identity</b> of PR with other angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

When asked about whether Falun Gong practitioners’ organs were ever used in transplant operations at a nearby hospital, the official answered in the affirmative: “All that was processed through the court.” The doctor soon grew uncomfortable with the line of questioning and refused to discuss the issue further without clearance from the hospital’s political division.|$|R
50|$|The NTV {{television}} network and Doğan News Agency identified the attackers as Erkan Kargın, 26, and Raif Topçıl, 20, {{both from the}} southeastern city of Bitlis and Bülent Çınar, 23, from the eastern city of Iğdır. Police did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> their <b>identities,</b> but Interior Minister Besir Atalay said two of the assailants had criminal records. It was suggested that a shotgun used by Erkan Kargın and two Glock automatic pistols were purchased with a 4,000 YTL loan, withdrawn from the Istanbul branch of a bank, by Kadir Özmen. Özmen had originally planned to attend the attack, but this plan was abandoned. A 24-page indictment, prepared by the Istanbul Public Prosecutor’s Office Deputy Fikret Seçen, charged Özmen with membership of an armed terrorist organization, possession of explosives and membership in the alleged Ergenekon organization, which meant being charged with attempting {{to overthrow the government}} of the Republic of Turkey. A decision to arrest him was made, however as his ID number could not be determined, the prosecutor’s office closed the investigation.|$|R

Among Canada’s metropolitan areas, Toronto hosts the largest population from the Horn of Africa. From 2011 to 2016, the estimated population of first-generation Somalis in Toronto grew by 2000, or 17.4 %. The corresponding increase in the single-ethnicity Somali population was 1875 (17.6 %), while {{the increase in the}} (first-generation) multiple-ethnicity Somali population was 140 (14.3 %). Meanwhile, the estimated population of Oromos grew by 45, or 10.6 %. The corresponding increase in the single-ethnicity first-generation Oromo population was 100 (39.2 %), while the multiple-ethnicity first-generation Oromo population decreased by 15 (8.8 %). The estimated population of Ethiopians grew by 2000 (24.4 %), single by 1745 (25.8 %), and multiple by 250 (17.2 %). These trends reflect the broader patterns discernible in the data, though given the small sample size there is need for substantiation in future research.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cronobacter spp. (formerly Enterobacter sakazakii), are a {{group of}} Gram-negative {{pathogens}} that have been implicated as causative agents of meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants. The pathogens are linked to infant formula; however, they have also been isolated {{from a wide range}} of foods and environmental samples. Results In this study, 233 samples of food, infant formula and environment were screened for the presence of Cronobacter spp. in an attempt to find its source. Twenty nine strains were isolated from samples of spices, herbs, infant foods, and dust obtained from household vacuum cleaners. Among the 76 samples of infant food, infant formula, milk powder and non-milk dairy products tested, only one sample of infant food contained Cronobacter spp. (1. 4 %). The other Cronobacter spp. isolates recovered include two from household vacuum dust, and 26 from 67 samples of herbs and spices. Among the food categories analyzed, herbs and spices harbored the highest number of isolates, indicating plants as a possible reservoir of this pathogen. Initial screening with API 20 E test strips yielded 42 presumptive isolates. Further characterization using 3 chromogenic media (α-MUG, DFI and EsPM) and 8 sets of PCR primers detecting ITS (internal transcribed spacer sequences), 16 S rRNA, zpx, gluA, gluB, OmpA genes followed by nucleotide sequencing of some PCR amplicons did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> the <b>identity</b> of all the isolates as none of the methods proved to be free of both false positives or false negatives. The final confirmation step was done by 16 S rRNA sequence analysis identifying only 29 of the 42 isolates as Cronobacter spp. Conclusion Our studies showed that Cronobacter spp. are highly diverse and share many phenotypic traits with other Enterobacteriaceae members highlighting the need to use several methods to <b>confirm</b> the <b>identity</b> of this pathogen. None of the biochemical, chromogenic or PCR primers proved to be a reliable method for confirmation of the identity of the isolates as all of them gave either false positives or false negatives or both. It is therefore concluded that 16 S rRNA sequencing is pivotal to <b>confirm</b> the <b>identity</b> of the isolates. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In Star Spangled War Stories #153, {{a soldier}} named Eddie Ray is introduced. His Serial Number is 32891681 {{which can be}} read on pages 5-6. Although he is <b>not</b> <b>confirmed</b> as the <b>identity</b> of the Unknown Soldier, it is {{strongly}} hinted at because his face is never shown. Another possibility is that {{the identity of the}} unknown soldier refers to the reader; because none of the characters know the name of who is reading the comic except that person himself. The origin story in Star Spangled War Stories #154 (December-January 1970 - 1971) reveals that the Unknown Soldier is an unnamed young man who joins the United States Army together with his brother Harry less than two months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Assigned to the Philippines when the Pacific War breaks out, he and Harry are present when the Japanese sweep across the islands.

40|$|The {{commodities}} one {{chooses to}} consume serve as visible signals of identity. With increased affluence, more economic resources {{are required to}} <b>confirm</b> one's <b>identity</b> as a "normal, respectable member of the society. " We argue that this induces formal structures similar to preferences for high relative consumption. This increased cost of <b>confirming</b> <b>identity</b> occurs if increased national income is used for private consumption. This is not the case, however, if increased national income is used to finance more public goods, since this does not increase the cost of <b>confirming</b> <b>identity.</b> Thus we argue that when we take the symbolic meaning of commodities into account, the social optimal level of public (and environmental) goods increases. Moreover, general income or consumption taxes may then be efficiency enhancing. This contrasts with the traditional estimates of marginal cost of funds, where the efficiency loss of taxation {{is added to the}} cost of providing public goods.

50|$|The scarlet myzomela was {{depicted}} in three paintings {{in a set}} of early illustrations known as the Watling drawings, done {{in the first years of}} settlement of Sydney between 1788 and 1794. Based on these, English ornithologist John Latham described it as three separate species in 1801. He based the description of Certhia sanguinolenta on an immature male moulting into adult plumage with incomplete red colouration, calling it the sanguineous creeper. In the same publication he described Certhia dibapha, the cochineal creeper, and C. erythropygia, the red-rumped creeper. John Gould determined these to be the one species in 1843, adopting the first-written binomial name as the valid one and relegating the others to synonymy, though the name Myzomela dibapha was occasionally used, particularly in New Caledonia. Stephens called it Meliphaga sanguinea in 1826 as a replacement name for Latham's Certhia sanguinolenta. In 1990, Ian McAllan proposed that the first drawing did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> the species <b>identity</b> and proposed the name Myzomela dibapha to hence be the oldest validly published name, however Richard Schodde countered in 1992 that the drawing of an immature male could not be any other species and so M. sanguinolenta should stand. He added that the alternative proposed name had not been in use since the 1850s. The Wakolo myzomela, Sulawesi myzomela, Banda myzomela, and New Caledonian myzomela were all previously considered to be conspecific with the scarlet myzomela.|$|R
