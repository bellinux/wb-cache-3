40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} panel of 189 {{countries}} to describe the salient trends that have emerged in <b>national</b> personal income <b>tax</b> systems spanning the twenty five year period from 1981 to 2005. Using complete <b>national</b> income <b>tax</b> schedules with statutory rates, thresholds, country-specific tax formulas and other information, we calculate actual average and marginal tax rates at different income levels as well as time-varying measures of structural progressivity and complexity of <b>national</b> <b>tax</b> systems. Overall, our analysis shows a significant transition from complex, graduated tax schedules that featured multiple tax brackets and stair stepped tax rates to simpler, flatter tax schedules distinguished by fewer tax brackets and lower rates. The emerging trend toward flat tax schedules is also highlighted. We show that frequent alterations of tax structures have diminished the overall progressivity and complexity of <b>national</b> <b>tax</b> systems; however, the degree of this change varies considerably by country group.
