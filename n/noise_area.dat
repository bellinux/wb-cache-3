In the proposed method the authors utilise the adaptive thresholding to blend the total variation filter with anisotropic diffusion filter.

More specifically, applying a hard thresholding on the higher <b>noise</b> <b>areas,</b> whereas, applying soft thresholding on the lower <b>noise</b> <b>areas.</b> Therefore, the authors can successfully remove the noise effectively and maintain the edges of the image simultaneously. Based on the adaptation and stability of the adaptive thresholding we can achieve; optimal noise reduction and sharp edges as well. Experimental results demonstrate that the new algorithm consistently outperforms other reference methods in terms of noise removal and edges preservation, in addition to 4. 7 dB gain higher than those in the other reference algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Noise in {{an image}} can be {{introduced}} from the image capture mechanism. It {{can be thought}} of as an area of a skin that is burned and needs skillful surgery to make it blend smoothly with the surrounding skin. The best place to get a patch skin for the surgery is to use the skin from the same body. For the eyes not to recognize any abnormality in the surgery, the patch and noise areas have to be blended as gradually as possible. A visual C++ GUI interface is developed for ease of using the mouse in selecting the noise and patch areas to be blended. How much of a blending should be done is controlled by the blend width (BW) parameter. As the BW increases, the greater is the area for blending and the better the surgery would look. Two blending algorithms, elliptical and rectangular, are used to blend the <b>noise</b> <b>area</b> and the patch area to the extent specified by the blend width.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel video {{denoising}} method based on adaptive thresholding and K-means clustering. In the proposed method the adaptive thresholding is applied rather than the conventional hard-thresholding of the VBM 3 D method. The adaptive thresholding has a high ability to adapt and change according to the amount of noise. More specifically, hard-thresholding is applied on the higher <b>noise</b> <b>areas</b> while soft-thresholding is applied on the lower <b>noise</b> <b>areas.</b> Consequently, we can successfully remove the noise effectively {{and at the same time}} preserve the edges of the image, because the clustering approach saves more computation time and is more capable of finding relevant patches than the block-matching approach. So, the K-means clustering method in the final estimate in this paper is adopted instead of the block-matching method in the VBM 3 D method in order to restrict the search of the candidate patches within the region of the reference patch and therefore improve the grouping. Experimental results emphasize the superiority of the new method over the reference methods in terms of visual quality, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Image Enhancement Factor (IEF). Execution time of the proposed algorithm consumes less time in denoising than that in the VBM 3 D algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Accelerated data {{acquisition}} with simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging for functional MRI studies leads to interacting and opposing effects {{that influence the}} sensitivity to blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes. Image {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) is decreased with higher SMS acceleration factors and shorter repetition times (TR) due to g-factor noise penalties and saturation of longitudinal magnetization. However, the lower image SNR is counteracted by greater statistical power from more samples per unit time and a higher temporal Nyquist frequency that allows for better removal of spurious non-BOLD high frequency signal content. This study investigated the dependence of the BOLD sensitivity on these main driving factors and their interaction, and provides a framework for evaluating optimal acceleration of SMS-EPI sequences. fMRI data from a scenes/objects visualization task was acquired in 10 healthy volunteers at a standard neuroscience resolution of 3 mm on a 3 T MRI scanner. SMS factors 1, 2, 4, and 8 were used, spanning TRs of 2800 ms to 350 ms. Two data processing methods were used to equalize the number of samples over the SMS factors. BOLD sensitivity was assessed using g-factors maps, temporal SNR (tSNR), and t-score metrics. tSNR results show a dependence on SMS factor that is highly non-uniform over the brain, with outcomes driven by g-factor noise amplification and the presence of high frequency noise. The t-score metrics also show a high degree of spatial dependence: the lower g-factor <b>noise</b> <b>area</b> of V 1 shows significant improvements at higher SMS factors; the moderate-level g-factor <b>noise</b> <b>area</b> of the parahippocampal place area shows only a trend of improvement; and the high g-factor <b>noise</b> <b>area</b> of the ventral-medial pre-frontal cortex shows a trend of declining t-scores at higher SMS factors. This spatial variability suggests that the optimal SMS factor for fMRI studies is region dependent. For task fMRI studies done with similar parameters as were used here (3 T scanner, 32 -channel RF head coil, whole brain coverage at 3 mm isotropic resolution), we recommend SMS accelerations of 4 x (conservative) to 8 x (aggressive) for most studies and a more conservative acceleration of 2 x for studies interested in anterior midline regions...|$|E
