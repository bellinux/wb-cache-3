40|$|Affiliative {{behaviour}} {{may have}} {{an essential role in}} many behavioural processes. Gently <b>nosing</b> between group members occurs in almost all social behavioural processes of pigs (Sus scrofa), but the reasons for its performance are unclear. We examined whether <b>nosing</b> between pigs was related to dominance relationships or harmful behaviours such as manipulation of the tail using 80 crossbred pigs. Both males and females, housed in straw pens, were studied at 8 weeks of age (10 pigs/pen). Dominance ranks were determined by a feed competition test. The behaviour of 64 focal pigs was observed for 2 h per pig in total. Pigs <b>nosed</b> their pen mates on average 36 ± 3 times within 2 h, and <b>nosing</b> behaviour mainly consisted of nose-to-nose contact, <b>nosing</b> the head and <b>nosing</b> the body, rather than <b>nosing</b> the ear, groin, tail or ano-genital region. These gentle pig-directed <b>nosing</b> behaviours, i. e. gently touching another individual with the snout, was here defined as social <b>nosing.</b> Dominance relationships did not influence the amount of <b>nosing</b> given or received. Social <b>nosing</b> was largely unrelated to harmful behaviour. <b>Nosing</b> the tail correlated with tail biting (rs = 0. 37), but only 0. 3 percent of social <b>nosing</b> was followed by this behaviour. Pigs which delivered much <b>nosing</b> did not receive less aggression, and nor did they receive a heightened amount of <b>nosing</b> in return. We suggest that pigs may <b>nose</b> each other for social recognition, as affiliative behaviour, to gain olfactory signals, or to satisfy an intrinsic need to <b>nose.</b> In conclusion, social <b>nosing</b> in pigs was largely unrelated to harmful behaviours, was not related to dominance relationships and should remain largely unaffected by efforts to minimise harmful behaviours in farming system...|$|R

5|$|The red {{and white}} variety of toy spaniel was first seen in {{paintings}} by Titian, including the Venus of Urbino (1538), where a small dog {{is used as a}} symbol of female seductiveness.

These dogs already had high domed heads with short <b>noses,</b> although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Nose</b> {{detection}} is {{an important}} part of a 3 D face recognition process. Knowledge of the <b>nose</b> location will enable us to align an unknown 3 D face with those in a face database. Besides that, the head pose can be deduced from information obtained from the <b>nose.</b> In this paper, a method is proposed to detect the <b>nose</b> tip from a three-dimensional face range image. This method identifies potential <b>nose</b> tip candidates by investigating the surrounding pixels. The <b>nose</b> tip is then identified from the potential candidates by their mean and variance values as well as their location which must be within the <b>nose</b> area. The proposed method has the ability to locate the <b>nose</b> tip without any manual input from the user, requires no training and is able to locate the <b>nose</b> tip for faces at different angles.

40|$|Introduction: The {{analysis}} {{and treatment of}} saddle <b>nose</b> {{have always been a}} surgical challenge. The study describes the three-stage classification of this deformity as well as a treatment algorithm adapted to each case. Materials and methods: A prospective study was carried out on 46 patients with saddle <b>nose.</b> The patients were divided into 3 groups according to the severity of saddling; minimal, moderate and major. The authors describe the treatment protocol adopted for each stage. Results: This series comprised 16 cases of minimal saddle <b>nose,</b> 20 cases of moderate saddle <b>nose</b> and 10 cases of major saddle <b>nose.</b> Minimal saddle <b>nose</b> was treated by enforcing and reconstructive septoplasty and dorsal septal augmentation grafts, conchal grafts were used to treat moderate saddle <b>nose,</b> and costal cartilage was used to reconstruct major saddle <b>nose.</b> We have used the open rhinoplasty approach to correct saddle <b>nose</b> in all cases. Surgical revision was never required. Conclusion: Saddle <b>nose</b> is a condition that is quite commonly faced by Otolaryngologists. The proposed treatment strategy is based on a meticulous analysis of the saddle <b>nose,</b> resulting in a graduated reconstruction adapted to each stage according to the severity of deformity.
