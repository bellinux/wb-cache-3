Thanks to {{the efforts}} of entrepreneur and computer engineer Yoichiro Hirano, the company evolved from the [...] "MyCon Club" [...] into a real business in 1981. As Carry Lab, the company developed popular word processing software and computer and video games. They also ported popular Taito titles such as Chack'n Pop to Japanese computers.

40|$|Three {{geothermal}} wells {{tapping the}} Dogger aquifer were studied in detail for their variations in chemical composition with time or conditions of exploitation. Analytical improvements for {{the determination of}} Cl, SO{sub 4 }, Ca, Mg, <b>Na</b> and K <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible to detect variations respectively of 0. 15, 0. 8, 0. 6, 1. 8, 1. 8 and 1. 4 %. Despite {{the fact that the}} natural flow may be important {{in some parts of the}} basin aquifer, we conclude that this factor is not responsible for the small variations noticed in mineralization within the one year survey period. The results concerning reactive and nonreactive species are best explained if a vertical heterogeneity of the chemistry of the fluid is assumed. A number of calcareous sub-layers, already demonstrated by geological studies, contribute to varying degrees to the production of the hot water. The changes in pumping rates, which are fixed according to external requirements, play a major role in the hydrodynamic and chemical disequilibrium of the wells. The consequences for the geothermal exploitations are emphasized...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{nucleic acid}} {{interactions}} {{play a critical}} role in all steps of the gene expression pathway. Nucleic acid (NA) binding proteins interact with their partners, DNA or RNA, via distinct regions on their surface that are characterized by an ensemble of chemical, physical and geometrical properties. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology based on differential geometry, commonly used in face recognition, to characterize and predict NA binding surfaces on proteins. Applying the method on experimentally solved three-dimensional structures of proteins we successfully classify double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) binding proteins, with 83 % accuracy. We show that the method is insensitive to conformational changes that occur upon binding and can be applicable for de novo protein-function prediction. Remarkably, when concentrating on the zinc finger motif, we distinguish successfully between RNA and DNA binding interfaces possessing the same binding motif even within the same protein, as demonstrated for the RNA polymerase transcription-factor, TFIIIA. In conclusion, we present a novel methodology to characterize protein surfaces, which can accurately tell apart dsDNA from an ssRNA binding interfaces. The strength of our method in recognizing fine-tuned differences on <b>NA</b> binding interfaces <b>make</b> <b>it</b> applicable for many other molecular recognition problems, with potential implications for drug design...|$|R

Game revealed rapper and record producer RZA had also contributed production on the album. Game also stated a Belizean rapper Shyne would be {{featured on the}} album as well. On June 11, 2010, Game leaked a song on his Twitter account titled [...] "We Do It Big". The song featured guest appearances from a fellow rapper Yung Joc and it contains a sample from the classic hit [...] "Juicy", performed by The Notorious B.I.G.. In an interview on 95.7 The Beat's, he also spoke during a live chat, in which he stated a fellow rapper <b>Nas</b> would not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to be featured on the album at this time. Game also gave his thoughts on a fellow rapper Drake and Will Smith. In addition to this, Game confirmed Nelly Furtado, T.I. and Snoop Dogg would be featured on the album, with production coming from Dr. Dre, The Neptunes, Kanye West and Timbaland. During his promotional tour of America, Game spoke to Jenny Boom Boom on Hot 97.3 and stated about the repeated delays have meant he been able {{to be working with}} DJ Toomp, and was also hoping to record with DJ Premier, before the album's release.|$|R

Additionally, offers the possibility of protonation, hydrogen bond formation, and chelation through the nitrogen atoms. Phthalazine derivatives have applications as therapeutic agents, chemiluminescent materials, ligands in transition metal catalysis, and as optical materials. Some time ago, our research group developed a methodology for the preparation of phthalazine derivatives in three steps, affording halo-thienyl-phthalazine derivatives that {{play an important role}} in diazine chemistry since they offer great potential for further functionalization by nucleophilic displacement of the halogen, making numerous otherwise inaccessible diazines become available. In continuation of the work developed before by our research group, we report in this communication the synthesis and the evaluation of the optical properties of two novel thienyl-phthalazine derivatives, having in mind further functionalization to prepare push-pull heterocyclic systems for several optical and photovoltaic applications. These studies showed that the optical properties could be readily tuned by varying the π-conjugation path length through the introduction of a second thiophene unit.
