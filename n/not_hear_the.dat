5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they continued to do their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> announcement of his death.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
60|$|Colville {{wished to}} beat him, but Imogene took his rebuke meekly, and murmured some apologies about <b>not</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> piano before. He hurried her off without {{recognising}} Colville's existence in any way.|$|R

5000|$|On 5 May 2011 court {{refused to}} <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> suit, saying, [...] "not before me, {{this is a}} court of law, not a court of justice" [...] {{as a reason for}} <b>not</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> plea. A Maharashtra Principal Secretary, C.S. Sangeet Rao, stated that no law existed to scrap these licences.|$|R
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound varies with {{temperature}}. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at {{some distance from the}} source. In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sounds of battle only six miles downwind.|$|E
5|$|With Ceylon {{no longer}} engaged, Duperré pulled ahead to engage Astell {{but found that}} Stewart had brought his {{battered}} Windham between the French frigate and the third East Indiaman. In the growing darkness, Stewart attempted to hail Astell to propose boarding Bellone together, but the remaining officers either ignored or did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> suggestion as Astell extinguished all her lights and made all sail to escape the action, receiving a final broadside from Bellone as she pulled away. Alone, Stewart continued to engage the French ships to enable Astell to make her escape. At 19:20 the repaired Minerve returned and took possession of Ceylon, and at 19:45 Stewart surrendered {{for the second time}} in less than a year: his ship badly damaged and casualties mounting among his crew and passengers.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a {{telegram}} to Bohr asking {{him to come to}} Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's bomb bay. During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea. Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.|$|E
60|$|This roaring concert, {{which lasted}} {{three or four}} minutes, having ended, I lingered a few minutes longer on <b>the</b> spot, and <b>not</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>the</b> voice again, {{went back to the}} edge of the wood, and then started on my way back to the village.|$|R

25|$|The {{captain of}} the Ollie K Wilds stated that the windows of his pilot house were closed, {{and that he did}} <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> Frosta's horn. A {{previous}} accident involving the George Prince followed a similar scenario. On that occasion, the {{captain of the}} ferry stated that he did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sounding of vehicle horns or the shouts of passengers. The morning of the accident, the windows were likely closed, and this may have prevented Auletta from hearing the Frosta's horn. Therefore, it is imperative that a lookout be designated and posted outside to listen for and relay signals from other vessels.|$|E
25|$|Note (1715): Although the Whig {{candidates}} received fewer votes {{than the}} Tory ones, the Returning Officer declared them elected and the House of Commons did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> petitions against the return; so Daines and Earle continued to sit throughout the Parliament.|$|E

25|$|A {{controversy}} developed when Kumar Sangakkara {{called the}} toss. The toss came up as heads, but the match referee Jeff Crowe did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> call over the crowd.

25|$|At this point, the Fremantle players {{began to}} {{celebrate}} {{what they thought}} was a one-point victory. Nicholls, however, did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> siren and refused to listen to the claims of Fremantle players, particularly Byron Schammer, that the siren had sounded. He also did not confer with the other two umpires as to whether the siren had sounded before restarting play.|$|E

25|$|Learning to sing is an {{activity}} that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds {{he or she is}} producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.|$|E
25|$|A new {{technology}} has been developed and is slowly becoming more popular with police. Called the Rumbler, it is a siren that emits a low frequency sound which can be felt. Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> audible siren of a police car behind them, but will feel the vibrations of the Rumbler. The feeling is that of {{standing next to a}} large speaker with pumped bass.|$|E

25|$|The two {{survivors}} were engineer Laurent Tabako and a {{woman from}} Chad, both were admitted to a hospital. According to Tabako, the engines stopped before landing and the crew may have dumped too much fuel before an emergency landing. The witnesses reportedly did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> usual engine noise during the crash and saw no flames when the aircraft disintegrated. The aircraft's flight recorder and voice recorder were recovered and an investigation was launched {{by the government of}} the Central African Republic.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} points, the Court {{found that a}} {{judicial}} review of the type brought by the Government against the railroads did not require a three-judge panel to make a ruling; rather, a single judge was the most appropriate course. In accordance with the other points the Court adopted, it declared that, because the District Court did <b>not</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> case based {{on the merits of}} the complaint, it was appropriate to reverse the decision of the lower court and remand the case back for such judgment.|$|E
25|$|After the South Tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{orders for}} firefighters in the North Tower to evacuate.
