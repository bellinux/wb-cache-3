40|$|There is {{very little}} {{agreement}} among the numerous papers which have been published {{on the content of}} oxides of nitrogen in ozonized air. The divergence in results might be attributed to either the method of analysis or the performance of the individual ozone generator. There are many methods for the determination of nitric acid and the oxides of nitrogen but the common method for analysis of ozone involves the re-action between potassium iodide and a measured volume of ozonized oxygen. The iodine liberated by the ozone is determined by the standard thiosulfate method. The method of analysis has been criticized on the basis that oxides of nitrogen which are present in ozonized air also liberate iodine. However, it has been established that nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide do not exist as such in the presence of ozone but are oxidized to <b>nitric</b> <b>anhydride</b> (1, 2). Furthermore, it has been established by many investigators (3, 4, 5, 6) that pure, dilute nitric acid is not an oxidizin...|$|E
40|$|Photochemical {{sources of}} peroxycarboxylic nitric {{anhydrides}} (PANs) are utilized in many atmospheric measurement techniques for calibration or to deliver an internal standard. Conventionally, such sources rely on phosphor-coated low-pressure mercury (Hg) lamps {{to generate the}} UV light necessary to photo-dissociate a dialkyl ketone (usually acetone) {{in the presence of}} a calibrated amount of nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O 2). In this manuscript, a photochemical PAN source in which the Hg lamp has been replaced by arrays of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) is described. The output of the UV-LED source was analyzed by gas chromatography (PAN-GC) and thermal dissociation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (TD-CRDS). Using acetone, diethyl ketone (DIEK), diisopropyl ketone (DIPK), or di-n-propyl ketone (DNPK), respectively, the source produces peroxyacetic (PAN), peroxypropionic (PPN), peroxyisobutanoic (PiBN), or peroxy-n-butanoic <b>nitric</b> <b>anhydride</b> (PnBN) from NO in high yield (> 90 %). Box model simulations with a subset of the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) were carried out to rationalize product yields and to identify side products. The present work demonstrates that UV-LED arrays are a viable alternative to current Hg lamp setups...|$|E
40|$|The Houston-Galveston Airshed (HGA) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{metropolitan}} areas in the US that is classified as a nonattainment area of Federal ozone standards. Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a key species in understanding ozone related air pollution; some of the highest HCHO concentrations in North America have been reported for the HGA. We report on HCHO measurements in the HGA from summer 2006. Among several sites, maximum HCHO mixing ratios were observed in the Houston Ship Channel (HSC), a region with a very high density of industrial/petrochemical operations. HCHO levels at the Moody Tower (MT) site close to downtown were dependent on the wind direction: southerly maritime winds brought in background levels (0. 5 – 1 ppbv) while trajectories originating in the HSC resulted in high HCH (up to 31. 5 ppbv). Based on the best multiparametric linear regression model fit, the HCHO levels at the MT site can be accounted for as follows: 38. 5 ± 12. 3 % from primary vehicular emissions (using CO as an index of vehicular emission), 24. 1 ± 17. 7 % formed photochemically (using peroxyacetic <b>nitric</b> <b>anhydride</b> (PAN) as an index of photochemical activity) and 8. 9 ± 11. 2 % from industrial emissions (using SO 2 as an index of industrial emissions). The balance 28. 5 ± 12. 7 % constituted the residual which cannot be easily ascribed to the above categories and/or which is transported into the HGA. The CO related HCHO fraction is dominant during the morning rush hour (06 : 00 – 09 : 00 h, all times are given in CDT); on a carbon basis, HCHO emissions are up to 0. 7 % of the CO emissions. The SO 2 related HCHO fraction is significant between 09 : 00 – 12 : 00 h. After 12 : 00 h HCHO is largely formed through secondary processes. The HCHO/PAN ratios are dependent on the SO 2 levels. The SO 2 related HCHO fraction at the downtown site originates in the ship channel. Aside from traffic-related primary HCHO emissions, HCHO of industrial origin serves as an appreciable source for OH in the morning...|$|E
40|$|The peroxycarboxylic <b>nitric</b> <b>anhydrides</b> (PANs, {{molecular}} formula: RC(O) O 2 NO 2) {{can readily}} be observed by gas chromatography (PAN-GC) coupled to electron capture detection. Calibration of a PAN-GC remains a challenge, because the response factors differ {{for each of}} the PANs, and because their synthesis in sufficiently high purity is non-trivial, in particular for PANs containing unsaturated side chains. In this manuscript, a PAN-GC and its calibration using diffusion standards, whose output was quantified by blue diode laser thermal dissociation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (TD-CRDS), are described. The PAN-GC peak areas correlated linearly with total peroxy nitrate (ΣPN) mixing ratios measured by TD-CRDS (r > 0. 96). Accurate determination of response factors required the concentrations of PAN impurities in the synthetic standards to be subtracted from ΣPN. The PAN-GC and its TD-CRDS calibration method were deployed during ambient air measurement campaigns in Abbotsford, BC, from 20 July to 5 August 2012, and during the Fort McMurray Oil Sands Strategic Investigation of Local Sources (FOSSILS) campaign at the AMS 13 ground site in Fort McKay, AB, from 10 August to 5 September 2013. The PAN-GC limits of detection for PAN, PPN, and MPAN during FOSSILS were 1, 2, and 3 pptv, respectively. For the Abbotsford data set, the PAN-GC mixing ratios were compared, and agreed with those determined in parallel by thermal dissociation chemical ionization mass spectrometry (TD-CIMS). Advantages and disadvantages of the PAN measurement techniques used in this work and the utility of TD-CRDS as a PAN-GC calibration method are discussed...|$|R

This represents the most selective quantitative method for 2, 4 -dinitration of toluene; the catalyst is re-usable, solvent is not needed and an aqueous work-up is not required...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} found that the {{nitration}} of suitably substituted aromatic compounds in <b>nitric</b> acid-acetic <b>anhydride</b> at 0 ° gives a mixture of products, some of which result from attack by the nitrating species at substituted ring positions (ipso-nitration). From this and earlier work, it is now known that ipsonitration may occur at ring positions substituted by either chloro, bromo, methyl, ethyl or methoxy groups. The product distributions suggest the factors determining the ratio of products arising from ipso-nitration and normal nitration are very sensitive to substituent changes. In general, however, provided the substituted ring position is of comparable reactivity to the available unsubstituted reaction sites, ipso-nitration is expected to be observed. Among the products that may arise from ipsonitration are nitrocyclohexadienones which rearrange to o,-nitrophenols. The rearrangement mechanism of two of these-dienones has been studied and found to be intermolecular, involving cleavage of the dienone into phenoxide and nitronium ions...|$|R
40|$|Product {{distributions}} {{from the}} nitration of toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, hemimellitene and pseudocumene have been determined in <b>nitric</b> acid-acetic <b>anhydride</b> mixtures, nitronium tetrafluoroborate-sulpholane mixtures {{and in the}} nitric acid-sulphuric acid-nitromethane system. The Additivity Principle {{is applied to the}} toluene results to calculate product ratios for the other hydrocarbons. Comparison of calculated and experimental results shows this to be an unsatisfactory method of calculating product distributions for these reactions. The differences between calculated and experimental results are examined quantitatively in terms of modified ortho substituent constants. Mixtures of nitric acid in acetic anhydride are shown to bring about direct acetoxylation of the aromatic nucleus when activated by more than one methyl group. The acetoxylation reaction has the characteristics of an electrophilic substitution reaction with large steric requirements and high selectivity. An estimate of the Hammett rho for the reaction is made. Product distributions from the nitration of indan and tetralin in the three nitrating systems have also been determined. These results are discussed in terms of the Mills-Nixon effect. An explanation for these and the results of other investigations of indan and tetralin is presented...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{nitration}} systems comprising <b>nitric</b> acid, trifluoroacetic <b>anhydride</b> and zeolite Hβ, with {{or without}} acetic anhydride, are described. The system having no acetic anhydride is more active and readily nitrates deactivated substrates such as nitrobenzene, benzonitrile, benzoic acid or 4 -nitrotoluene to give predominantly the product substituted meta to the deactivating group. The system incorporating acetic anhydride is more moderate in activity, and nitrates moderately deactivated systems such as halogenobenzenes quantitatively within two hours at ice–salt bath temperature, and provides very high selectivity for the para-nitrated product. This system also nitrates 2 -nitrotoluene to give high selectivity for 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene production. Furthermore, the system {{can be used for}} direct double nitration of toluene and gives a 92...|$|R
