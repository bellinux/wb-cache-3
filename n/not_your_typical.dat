500|$|Adolf, a Greeley, Colorado resident, was {{the only}} one of the three alleged {{plotters}} with any prior history of violence. Adolf was arrested on May 14, 1997, for his involvement in a theft of $350,000-worth of construction equipment, materials and vehicles in Greeley. He served prison time starting in 1997 on drug-related charges, and faced two third-degree assault charges in 2001. At the time of his arrest for the alleged assassination plot, eight outstanding warrants had been issued for him in response various crimes committed around Colorado, including one for skipping out on a $1 million bond. He was on the most-wanted list of the Weld County, Colorado sheriff's department for burglary, larceny, aggravated motor vehicle theft and other prior charges. Adolf possessed a handcuff key on one hand and a swastika ring on the other when he was arrested for the alleged assassination plot. His criminal history also included forgery, drug and weapon charges. Vicki Harbert, an investigator with the Weld County Sheriff's Department, had been pursuing Adolf since 2006 and feared he would eventually kill a police officer. Harbert said of Adolf after his 2008 arrest, [...] "I've been a cop for 18 years and he was <b>not</b> <b>your</b> <b>typical</b> bad guy." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, {{fundamental}} differences {{exist between the}} nature of Demand Guarantees and SBLCs. For example, SBLCs are issued as a contingent liability of the issuing banks and are issued {{in conjunction with a}} primary means of underwriting being considered. In effect SBLC's are as they sound.. there in a [...] "Stand-by" [...] position to a primary means of repayment. Demand Guarantees can be issued to be the primary means for repayment. In which case they are not necessarily contingent in nature. Because of the contingent and secondary means of collateral nature of the SBLC, it would be considered counter-intuitive for a bank to underwrite a loan or facility strictly on the basis of receiving an SBLC. A bank lending against an SBLC alone in such a manner would in effect be purposefully underwriting a loan with the expectation that there was to be a default...

After spending a glorious day walking along China’s Great Wall, we had returned from a performance of the Beijing Opera. Flipping on CNN, we were suddenly gripped by a surreal scene twelve time-zones away, as the two World Trade Center towers were struck, engulfed in flames and smoke, and eventually collapsed. Two months later we made our own pilgrimage to ground zero. (Part of me is New Yorker: There I learned to jaywalk and to adore opera and Broadway theatre, while nominally enrolled in doctoral studies at Columbia University – {{more than a hundred}} city-blocks north of the Trade Center site.) The twisted wreckage of the lower floors was still visible, as was the army of heavy equipment engaged in scouring the site. For blocks around there was an odor of still smouldering fires; the air was rank with the smells of death.

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that Smart's work {{comments}} on modern urban alienation, a post-industrial landscape that has fallen from human control. Others have cast him as a realist, hyper-realist, 'off-beat classicalist' and a metaphysical painter. Some critics have even referred to Smart's paintings as portraying 'Orwellian gloom' – a statement referring, in particular, to George Orwell's literary political masterpiece, Nineteen Eighty-Four. James Gleeson believes that Smart's paintings are [...] "too real to be real"; and believes that his realist portrayals of 20th century life {{are nothing more than}} superb geometrical compositions and bold colour, of man in his naturalistic, man-made environment. It is true, for instance, that trees are rarely seen in Jeffrey Smart's artworks, and the only grass is that growing between concrete stones, but as Smart claimed: [...] "an artist has to be moved to move his viewers", and Smart was moved by man in nature – man-made nature – <b>not</b> concerned with <b>your</b> <b>typical</b> Australian landscape. [...] "I like living in the 20th century – to me the world has never been more beautiful. I am trying to paint the real world I live in, as beautifully as I can with my own eyes... It's obvious a bunch of flowers or a billabong is beautiful, and I love natural beauty, but I am not moved by it.... to me composition is everything". Smart believed that people should view art with their eyes and not their head.|$|R
40|$|The Force. com {{platform}} {{is a new}} platform, and while the Apex programming language is syntactically similar to Java, the way you use it and the rules you must follow are very different. The best practices and design patterns that apply to Java may not apply to Force. com and the Apex language. That {{does not mean that}} none of the same principles apply. Many of the best practices you would use in Java can apply to Apex. General rules around efficient coding like limiting database queries and minimizing loops still apply. In this paper, I’ll share what I have found to be the best practices and good design patterns through the multiple development projects I’ve been a part of. The Force. com Platform The Force. com {{platform is}} <b>not</b> like <b>your</b> <b>typical</b> application server environment. It has a very large set of tools that is available to the developer without writing a single line of code. These tools can be a great help in development as they allow you to implement functionality very quickly and easily. This helps make Force. com a very quick development platform. While the included toolset that Salesforce gives you is a great positive for developers, there is another difference that is not so appealing. Salesforce uses governor limits to ensure one developer’s code does not run wild and end up hurting the performance of the overall system. Force. com is a multi-tenant architecture, which means all users share the same physical hardware and have their own virtual spaces. Since the hardware is shared between everyone, Salesforce needs to assure no one can affect others outside of their virtual space. They do this by enforcing governor limits or restrictions on things like the number of database calls, script statements, etc. that can happen in a transaction. While these limits are important to the stability of the system as a whole, they can be troublesome to developers who are not used to working with such tight restrictions...|$|R
