5000|$|The {{standard}} acceleration due {{to gravity}} (or standard acceleration of free fall), sometimes abbreviated as standard gravity, usually denoted by [...] or , is the <b>nominal</b> gravitational <b>acceleration</b> of an object in a vacuum near {{the surface of the}} Earth. It is defined by standard as , which is exactly [...] (about , or [...] ). This value was established by the 3rd CGPM (1901, CR 70) and used to define the standard weight of an object as the product of its mass and this <b>nominal</b> <b>acceleration.</b> The acceleration of a body near the surface of the Earth is due to the combined effects of gravity and centrifugal acceleration from rotation of the Earth (but which is small enough to be neglected for most purposes); the total (the apparent gravity) is about 0.5 percent greater at the poles than at the equator.|$|R
40|$|The {{acceleration}} {{environment on}} the Intern ational Space Station (ISS) will likely exceed {{the requirements of}} many micro-gravity experiments. The Glovebox Integrated Microgravity Isolation Technology (g-LIMIT) is being built by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center to attenuate the <b>nominal</b> <b>acceleration</b> environ- ment and provide some isolation for microgravity science experiments. G-LIMIT uses Lorentz (voice-coil) magnetic actuators to isolate a platform for mounting science payloads from the <b>nominal</b> <b>acceleration</b> environment. The system utilizes payload acceleration, relative position, and relative orientation measurements in a feedback controller to accomplish the vibration isolation task. The controller provides current commands to six magnetic actuators, producing the required experiment isolation from the ISS acceleration environment. This paper presents {{the development of a}} can- didate control law to meet the acceleration attenuation requirements for the g-LIMIT experiment platform. The controller design is developed using linear optimal control techniques for frequency-weighted H 2 norms.

40|$|Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{offers a}} quick, non-invasive way to detect evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Most laboratories routinely mea-sure {{the velocity of}} the jet of tricuspid regurgi-tation when present and use the modified Ber-noulli equation to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Another echocardiographic method for detecting elevated pulmonary pres-sure is to measure {{the duration of the}} acceler-ation phase of pulmonary systolic flow. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the reliability of the pulmonary <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> and the cor-relation with the Bournoulli method in deter-mining the severity of pulmonary hypertension and the reliability of pulmonary <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> to distinguish normal patients from those with pulmonary hypertension. We evaluated 56 patients with suitable Doppler tracings for pulmonary <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> and tricuspid regurgitation. Our results suggest that pulmonary <b>acceleration</b> <b>time,</b> when used cor-rectly, is a useful tool in evaluating patients for pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|PURPOSE: We revalidate {{parameters}} of the cavernous arterial response (peak systolic blood flow velocity) and <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> using penile duplex pharmaco-ultrasonography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood flow velocity in the cavernous artery following pharmaco-stimulation was determined with duplex ultrasonography in 106 patients with erectile dysfunction. Intima media thickness of the common carotid artery, a valid index for atherosclerosis and clinical diagnosis based on a comprehensive evaluation were used as references. The clinical diagnosis {{was used to determine}} cutoff values. For the statistical analysis, Pearson correlation and ROC curves were used. RESULTS: When correlating peak systolic velocity and <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> to intima media thickness, <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> (r = 0. 51, p < 0. 01) was the most valid parameter to detect cavernous atherosclerotic pathology (peak systolic velocity r = - 0. 18, p = 0. 12). This finding was confirmed by a comparison of both parameters to the clinical diagnosis. AUC was 0. 59, 95 % CI 0. 49 - 0. 69 for peak systolic velocity and 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 62 - 0. 80 for <b>acceleration</b> <b>time).</b> The cutoff point for <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> to discriminate between atherosclerotic and nonatherosclerotic erectile dysfunction was determined at <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> 100 milliseconds or greater. Sensitivity was 66 % and specificity was 71 %. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> has more power than peak systolic velocity to diagnose atherosclerotic erectile dysfunctio...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{clinical}} {{applicability of}} time-resolved 3 D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) remains compromised {{by the long}} scan times associated with phase-contrast imaging. The present work demonstrates the applicability of 8 -fold acceleration of Cartesian time-resolved 3 D flow CMR in 10 volunteers and in 9 patients with different congenital heart diseases (CHD). It is demonstrated that accelerated 3 D flow CMR data acquisition and image reconstruction using k-t PCA (principal component analysis) can be implemented into clinical workflow and results are sufficiently accurate relative to conventional 2 D flow CMR to permit for comprehensive flow quantification in CHD patients. Methods The fidelity of k-t PCA was first investigated on retrospectively undersampled data for different acceleration factors and compared to k-t SENSE and fully sampled reference data. Subsequently, k-t PCA with 8 -fold nominal undersampling was applied on 10 healthy volunteers and 9 CHD patients on a clinical 1. 5 T MR scanner. Quantitative flow validation was performed in vessels of interest on the 3 D flow datasets and compared to 2 D through-plane flow acquisitions. Particle trace {{analysis was used to}} qualitatively visualise flow patterns in patients. Results Accelerated time-resolved 3 D flow data were successfully acquired in all subjects with 8 -fold <b>nominal</b> scan <b>acceleration.</b> <b>Nominal</b> scan <b>times</b> excluding navigator efficiency were on the order of 6 min and 7 min in patients and volunteers. Mean differences in stroke volume in selected vessels of interest were 2. 5 [*]±[*] 8. 4 ml and 1. 63 [*]±[*] 4. 8 ml in volunteers and patients, respectively. Qualitative flow pattern analysis in the time-resolved 3 D dataset revealed valuable insights into hemodynamics including circular and helical patterns as well as flow distributions and origin in the Fontan circulation. Conclusion Highly accelerated time-resolved 3 D flow using k-t PCA is readily applicable in clinical routine protocols of CHD patients. Nominal scan times of 6 min are well tolerated and allow for quantitative and qualitative flow assessment in all great vessels...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{artificial}} potential, suitable for nominal {{control of the}} repetitive robot motion, is proposed. Starting with this potential a normalized energy equation has been established. This equation was the source for derivation of a nominal robot velocity as {{the function of the}} initial and final positions, as well as the limited maximal nominal velocity of the robot motion. For derivation of <b>nominal</b> robot <b>acceleration,</b> as the function of the same parameters, the artificial potential relation has been employed. Both <b>nominal</b> velocity and <b>acceleration</b> equations satisfy the condition of the repetitive motion: boundary velocities are equal to zero and boundary accelerations are positive on the first side and negative on the second one. The nominal transient position relation is twice continuously differentiable resulting in the mentioned <b>nominal</b> velocity and <b>acceleration</b> equations. The obtained <b>nominal</b> velocity and <b>acceleration</b> relations are very simple for calculation and {{can be applied to the}} real time nominal control of repetitive robot motion...|$|R
30|$|Ground motions {{are often}} {{recorded}} in three orthogonal directions, such as north, east, and up. However, when applying {{only one of}} the horizontal components, changing the orientation can change the intensity and frequency content of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> series. Therefore, an important consideration when performing dynamic slope stability analyses is the orientation of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> series with respect to the slope.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation was}} made to determine from component performance characteristics the effect of air bleed at the compressor outlet on the acceleration characteristics of a typical high-pressure-ratio single-spool turbojet engine. Consideration of several operating lines on the compressor performance map with two turbine-inlet temperatures showed that for a minimum <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> the turbine-inlet temperature should be the maximum allowable, and the operating line on the compressor map should be {{as close to the}} surge region as possible throughout the speed range. Operation along such a line would require a continuously varying bleed area. A relatively simple two-step area bleed gives only a small increase in <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> over a corresponding variable-area bleed. For the modes of operation considered, over 84 percent of the total <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> was required to accelerate through the low-speed range; therefore, better low-speed compressor performance (higher pressure ratios and efficiencies) would give a significant reduction in <b>acceleration</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R

Electromyographic activity of biceps and triceps and the kinematics of the movements were analysed. Results were compared with those of normal subjects making both rapid and slow movements. In the patients, the first agonist burst of the biceps was frequently prolonged regardless of the distance or speed of the movement. The most striking kinematic abnormality was prolonged <b>acceleration</b> <b>time.</b> The pattern of <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> exceeding deceleration time was common in patients but uncommon in normal subjects.

40|$|Renal artery {{stenosis}} (RAS) is the commonest secondary {{cause of}} hypertension and {{may result in}} renal ischaemia with resultant renal failure. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} colour Doppler ultrasound, with spectral analysis of the intrarenal waveforms, can identify those patients with a significant RAS. A prospective study was performed in which colour Doppler ultrasound was compared with angiography in 73 patients (143 kidneys) presenting for renal angiography. Colour Doppler ultrasound was unsuccessful in 16 % of kidneys due to a combination of technical failures and small kidney size. Accessory renal vessels were present in 14 % of kidneys on angiography but none was detected by ultrasound. Of the 120 kidneys that had both examinations, no significant difference in intrarenal pulsatility or resistive index was noted between the angiographically stenosed and normal arteries. There were significant differences for intrarenal peak and end diastolic velocities, and <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> and index. Of these measurements, <b>acceleration</b> <b>time</b> was the best indicator of RAS.
