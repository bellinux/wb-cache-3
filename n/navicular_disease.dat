25|$|It is {{possible}} that standing can also increase the chance of <b>navicular</b> <b>disease</b> (such as a horse that spends {{most of the day}} in a stall with little turnout, as with some racehorses and show horses).

40|$|Shape is a {{fundamental}} morphological descriptor, one method of its estimation being from digitally processed images. Elliptic Fourier method is an outline-based morphometrics that has some advantages: {{it does not require}} either landmarks or previous knowledge about the shape variation of the objects under study; it can visualize the contour of information and reconstruct the original shape; it can be mathematically normalized to size, rotation and starting point of the contour trace; and it can be conducted automatically using computer software. Hence, the variation could be decomposed into several mutually independent quantitative characteristics. In this manner, unacceptable errors based only on human visual judgment of shape, which is frequently deceptive and misled by size factors, can be effectively eliminated. The present study evaluated the shape of equine distal sesamoids ("navicular bone") in 28 feet belonging to "Cavall Pirinenc Català" by means of Elliptic Fourier methods. No allometric relationship (low coefficient of regression) was demonstrated between area and form of the bone. At the same time, different morphological patterns appeared. Shape differences were centred on the proximal ridge, which moved from a crescentic, oval lucency, slightly oval, to a flat contour, and no concave ridge was detected. So breed {{does not seem to be}} very prone to suffer from <b>navicular</b> <b>diseases,</b> as some authors have stated that there is an apparent predisposition according to shape of the proximal articular border. These results provide a baseline to further examine shape quantification in sesamoid morphology...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of investigation in the horse genome in the early nineties, {{there has been a}} great progress, especially during the last five years. At {{the beginning}} the exploration of monogenic hereditary diseases {{was one of the main}} aims, and the causal mutations of several diseases in the horse have been unravelled. The inheritance of coat colours has been explored very detailed, and there exist gene tests for different coat colours. Information about coat colours and inherited diseases is very important for the breeders and helps avoiding the appearance of lethal genetic factors or undesirable diseases. The most important achievements of horse genome analysis were well-developed linkage, radiation hybrid and cytogenetic genome maps including more than 2950 loci. These maps support comparative analysis of equine hereditary diseases. The present known gene mutations for five diseases in horses have human homologs. Studies on multifactorial diseases such as osteochondrosis and <b>navicular</b> bone <b>disease</b> and on fertility and temperament are underway. At the moment, the whole equine genome is sequenced as it has been done for the human genome and also for other animal genomes. Horse breeding will greatly benefit from identification of QTL for multifactorial traits and gene mutations for congenital anomalies, diseases and performance traits...|$|R

With or without shoes, the hoof must be trimmed {{in such a way as}} to restore the balance and angle that may have been lost. Horses with long toe-low heel conformation need careful trimming to counter this. Horses with upright feet may need their heels lowered and a shoe that will allow their heels to spread. Early intervention is key; in one study, shoeing was successful in 97% of horses treated within ten months of the onset of signs, while only 54% of horses lame for over a year responded.|$|E
2500|$|Poor trimming, shoe selection, or {{inappropriate}} shoe attachment are well-known {{causes of}} lameness, and <b>navicular</b> <b>disease</b> is fairly {{common in the}} modern-day domesticated horse. However, it is also seen in wild horse populations. Those who advocate [...] "barefoot trimming" [...] of domestic horses propose that in nature, a horse's hoof is designed to expand and contract as the horse moves. This expanding and contracting acts as an auxiliary blood pump, and aids the circulation of blood to the lower extremities. When an inflexible metal shoe is improperly attached to the hoof, the hoof can no longer work as designed, and blood flow is inhibited. However, evidence of navicular degeneration {{has been established in}} the fossil record of early horses. Mary Thompson, a vertebrate paleontologist at Idaho Museum of Natural History, has found evidence in many species of early horses and concludes, [...] "The results of this study strongly suggest that man’s intervention (whether by increased usage or improper breeding practices) may not be the sole cause of the syndrome", although she cautions that her results are preliminary.|$|E

5000|$|The horse has a {{sesamoid bone}} called the navicular bone, {{located within the}} hoof, that lies on the palmar aspect of the coffin joint between the second phalanx and third phalanx (coffin bone). The navicular bone in the horse is {{supported}} by the distal sesamoidean impar ligament and two collateral sesamoidean ligaments. The navicular bursa is located between the flexor surface of the navicular bone and the deep digital flexor tendon, which runs between the bursa and the distal phalanx. [...] The central tarsal bone in the hock of the horse is homologous and analogous to the navicular bone of the human foot, and thus the navicular bone in the horse is a different structure from the eponymously labeled bone in humans. The navicular region is an important structure in relation to lameness, particularly in the front feet, and is involved with a significant disease process called <b>navicular</b> <b>disease</b> or navicular syndrome. Recently much of the original literature concerning <b>navicular</b> <b>disease</b> has been called into question, particularly the significance of radiographic changes as a sole diagnostic criterion. Navicular syndrome may be responsible for as much as 1/3 of all cases of lameness in horses, but radiographic changes in the navicular bone do not always provide a definitive diagnosis. Newer imaging techniques have shown that damage to the soft tissues in the region may be significant contributors to lameness and that multiple causes may result in visible lameness.|$|E
5000|$|Isoxsuprine is most {{commonly}} used to treat hoof-related problems in the horse, {{most commonly}} for laminitis and <b>navicular</b> <b>disease,</b> as its effects as a vasodilator are thought to increase circulation within the hoof to help counteract {{the problems associated with}} these conditions.

[...] Isoxsuprine is a prohibited class B drug in FEI-regulated competition, and is often prohibited by other equine associations. It may be detected in the urine for several weeks or months following administration. It is therefore important to check the drug-rules within an animal's given competitive organization, before administering the drug.|$|E
50|$|Isoxsuprine and {{pentoxifylline}} are two {{commonly used}} vasodilators in equine medicine. Isoxsuprine {{has been shown}} to have vasodilatory and red blood cell deformability properties.

These properties are thought to improve blood flow to the digit, and makes them popular drugs for treatment of <b>navicular</b> <b>disease</b> and laminitis. However, some studies have shown oral isoxsuprine and pentoxifylline to have little to no effect on digital blood flow. The lack of efficacy of isoxsuprine may be partially due to its poor oral bioavailability (2.2%) and high first pass effect. While pentoxyfylline has a better bioavailability after oral dosing, its absorption may decrease with repeated administration. Pentoxyfilline has been shown to reduce lameness in horses with experimentally induced laminitis and has inhibitory effects on matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), so it may be beneficial for laminitis treatment despite its uncertain effects on digital blood flow.|$|E
