5|$|After then-front-runner Herman Cain {{was damaged}} by {{allegations}} of past sexual harassment, Gingrich gained support, and {{quickly became a}} contender in the race, especially after Cain suspended his campaign. By December 4, 2011, Gingrich was leading in the national polls. However, after an abundance of <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> run by his opponents throughout December, Gingrich's national polling lead had fallen to a tie with Mitt Romney.|$|E
5|$|Each {{candidate}} {{aimed to}} discredit the other by pointing out his opponent's flaws or mistakes. Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure {{to pay taxes on}} a start-up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. <b>Negative</b> <b>ads</b> from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
50|$|Though {{regarded}} as a <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> against Johnson's opponent, Barry Goldwater, Goldwater is never mentioned in the ad.|$|R
50|$|As {{general counsel}} for the 2008 campaign, Bauer asked the Justice Department to {{investigate}} the officers and donors of American Issues Project after it ran a <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> about Obama.|$|R
40|$|Charitable {{organizations}} {{often use}} directed charity appeals to solicit donations from potential donors. However, charity appeals {{can be written}} either in a positive frame (where {{the aim is to}} induce a positive mood), or in a negative frame (where the aim is to induce guilt and general negative emotions). Both positive and negative affect have been linked to an increased motivation to help and while some studies suggest positive appeals to be preferable to negative or neutral appeals (e. g. Benson & Catt, 1978; Perrine & Heather, 2000), other studies have found that negatively framed appeals render higher donations (e. g. Small & Verrochi, 2009; Chou & Murighan, 2013). In two studies using different charity contexts, we tested this systematically by randomly allocating participants to read either a very positively or a very negatively framed charity advertisement. Participants were then asked if they would like to anonymously donate the buying price of endowed lottery tickets to the organization behind the ad. Manipulation-checks showed that the <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> made participants experience more negative emotions (guilt, distress, sadness, and anger) compared to the positive appeal. In contrast, the positive ad made participants feel happier and more hopeful, and participants also liked the positive ad more than the <b>negative</b> <b>ad.</b> Despite this, the <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> rendered significantly higher donations than the positive ad in both studies. Follow-up analyses showed that there were no differences in the likelihood of helping (the proportion of participants donating something was not influenced by the type of ad), but there were differences in the magnitude of helping (those reading the <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> were more likely to donate all their resources than those reading the positive ad) ...|$|R
5|$|The Conservatives {{began the}} {{campaign}} period with a policy-per-day strategy, {{contrary to the}} Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began to rise. In response, the Liberals launched <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close {{what had been a}} ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice for prime minister than Martin.|$|E
25|$|Davis's <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> against Riordan and {{a variety}} of other equally {{important}} factors explained on the 2002 election page, led to Riordan's defeat in the Republican primary by the more staunchly conservative candidate Bill Simon. In the first 10 weeks of 2002, Davis spent $10 million on ads: $3 million on positive ads boasting of his record, $7 million on <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> against Riordan.|$|E
25|$|The Liberal {{advertising}} {{strategy was}} highly risky. While conventional wisdom {{says the only}} way to successfully respond to a negative campaign is with even more <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> against your opponent, McGuinty ran only positive ads {{for the duration of the}} campaign.|$|E
50|$|In April 2006, Johnson {{became the}} target of a <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> {{campaign}} run by a political action committee, MoveOn.org, which alleged ties to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX). Johnson responded with her own advertising campaign dismissing the charges and strongly attacking Murphy, accusing him of not disavowing the MoveOn attack ads.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} negative and positive political advertisements among voters in college. The study builds on past research exploring negative political advertising and demobilization and mobilization theories. Additionally, potential backlash against sponsoring candidates of <b>negative</b> policy-based attack <b>ads</b> is looked at as is whether those who regularly follow politics are affected differently by ads {{than those who do}} not. Fifty-three college students participated in an experiment in which they rated two candidates based on any prior knowledge and political party, assessing favorability and the likelihood of voting for each candidate. Students then watched a ten minute newscast with either a positive or <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> sponsored by the same candidate embedded during the commercial break. They were asked again to assess their favorability and likelihood of voting for each candidate. No results were found in support of either mobilization or demobilization theories. Results did not show backlash after viewing the <b>negative</b> <b>ad.</b> The positive ad, however, proved more effective in increasing both the sponsoring candidate’s favorability and participants’ reported likelihood of voting for him. Additionally, these findings do not support past research claiming differences in effects between those who regularly follow politics and those who do not...|$|R
5000|$|A {{particularly}} <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> titled [...] "Who Hasn't?" [...] {{sponsored by}} the Republican National Committee ("RNC") that aired during {{the third and fourth}} weeks of October gained national attention and condemnation from both Ford and Corker. The ad portrayed a scantily clad white woman (Johanna Goldsmith) acting as a Playboy bunny who [...] "met Harold at the Playboy party" [...] and invites Ford to [...] "call me".|$|R
25|$|Simmons {{launched}} <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> attacking WWE's {{history of}} steroid abuse, its record of premature wrestler deaths, and circulated some of WWE's most politically incorrect segments. By March 2010, the Simmons campaign had gone so negative that some established Connecticut Republicans began to denounce his attacks.|$|E
25|$|As the {{campaign}} entered week 2, it was {{anticipated that the}} Liberals would push a series of highly <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> to combat advertising by the Conservatives that attacked Dalton McGuinty. However, instead they went positive and stayed positive throughout {{the campaign}}. It was Eves who went on the defensive as the Liberals worked the media to put the Premier on his heels. Stung by years of arrogance by the PC Party toward reporters, the media were quick to pile on.|$|E
25|$|During the 2002 {{election}} campaign, Davis {{took the}} unusual step of taking out campaign ads during the Republican primaries against Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan. Davis claimed that Riordan had attacked his record {{and that his}} campaign was defending his record. Polls showed that, as a moderate, Riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate. Polls even showed that Riordan would defeat Davis. Davis attacked Riordian with <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> in the primary. The ads questioned Riordan's pro-choice stance by questioning Riordan's support of pro-life politicians and judges. The ads pointed out Riordan's position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of Gray Davis, who strongly supported it.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of 2000 - 2015 monthly Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System-Energy Balanced and Filled (CERES-EBAF) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA 2) data reveals statistically significant fall and wintertime relationships between Arctic surface longwave (LW) radiative flux anomalies and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and Arctic Dipole (AD). Signifying a substantial regional imprint, a <b>negative</b> <b>AD</b> index corresponds with positive downwelling clear-sky LW flux anomalies (greater than 10 W m(exp - 2)) north of western Eurasia (0 deg E- 120 deg E) and reduced sea ice {{growth in the}} Barents and Kara Seas in November-February. Conversely, a positive AO index coincides with negative clear-sky LW flux anomalies and minimal sea ice growth change in October-November across the Arctic. Increased (decreased) atmospheric temperature and water vapor coincide with the largest positive (negative) clear-sky flux anomalies. Positive surface LW cloud radiative effect anomalies also accompany the <b>negative</b> <b>AD</b> index in December-February. The results highlight a potential pathway by which Arctic atmospheric variability influences the regional surface radiation budget over areas of Arctic sea ice growth...|$|R
50|$|Following an {{election}} that was peppered with <b>negative</b> attack <b>ads</b> from both sides, Braley defeated Whalen by a solid margin.|$|R
25|$|Santorum ran a {{television}} ad suggesting that Casey's supporters {{had been under}} investigation for various crimes. The <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> backfired, as The Scranton Times-Tribune found that {{all but a few}} of Casey's contributors donated when he was running for other offices, and none were investigated for anything. In fact, two of the persons cited in Santorum's campaign ad actually gave contributions to Santorum in 2006, and one died in 2004. Santorum's campaign countered that those donations were not kept, and had been donated to educational institutions.|$|R
25|$|Hagan {{had been}} the target of {{numerous}} <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> paid for by Americans for Prosperity, which had spent over $7 million on the race by the end of March 2014. As part of a $3 million offensive effort against those efforts in early 2014, the Senate Majority PAC released ads supporting Hagan. In July 2014, Hagan had the largest cash-on-hand advantage of any vulnerable Democratic senator. She was endorsed by Vice President Joe Biden. In September 2014, Bill Clinton announced plans to campaign for Hagan. Hagan faced Republican Thom Tillis and Libertarian Sean Haugh in the general election on Tuesday, November 4. Hagan declined to participate in a scheduled October 21 debate. She was a speaker at the state AFL-CIO convention. After a close race, Kay Hagan lost her bid for re-election by roughly 45,000 votes, or by 1.5%.|$|E
25|$|Davis was re-elected in the November 2002 general {{election}} following {{a long and}} bitter campaign against Simon, marked by accusations of ethical lapses {{on both sides and}} widespread voter apathy. Simon was also hurt by a financial fraud scandal that tarnished Simon's reputation. Davis' campaign touted California's improving test scores, environmental protection, health insurance coverage for children and lower prescription drug costs for seniors. Davis' campaign featured several <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> that highlighted Simon's financial fraud scandal. The 2002 gubernatorial race was the most expensive in California state history with over $100 million spent. Davis' campaign was better financed; Davis had over $26 million in campaign reserves more than Simon in August 2002. Davis gained re-election with 47.4% of the vote to Simon's 42.4%. However, the Simon-Davis race led in the lowest turnout percentage in modern gubernatorial history, allowing a lower than normal amount of signatures required for a recall. Davis won the election, but the majority of voters disliked Davis and did not approve of his job performance.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle between}} Bush and McCain for South Carolina has entered U.S. {{political}} lore {{as one of}} the nastiest, dirtiest, and most brutal ever. [...] On the one hand, Bush switched his label for himself from [...] "compassionate conservative" [...] to [...] "reformer with results", as part of trying to co-opt McCain's popular message of reform. [...] On the other hand, a variety of business and interest groups that McCain had challenged in the past now pounded him with <b>negative</b> <b>ads.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alice Kryzan, an {{environmental}} attorney, won the Democratic party primary election on Tuesday, September 9th, 2008. She ran against Jon Powers, an Iraq war vet and the endorsed Democratic candidate, {{as well as}} wealthy industrialist Jack Davis. The primary was notable for its large <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> content, most heavily by self-financed Davis against Powers. Kryzan upset the conventional wisdom with a surprise win, partially {{on the strength of}} a last-minute TV ad characterizing the other two candidates as squabbling. A major selling point Kryzan used was that both of her primary rivals were former Republicans.|$|R

500|$|The Arizona Republic {{would write}} that the McCain–Bush primary contest in South Carolina [...] "has entered {{national}} political lore as a low-water mark in presidential campaigns", while The New York Times called it [...] "a painful {{symbol of the}} brutality of American politics". A variety of interest groups that McCain had challenged in the past ran <b>negative</b> <b>ads.</b> Bush borrowed McCain's earlier language of reform, and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain (in Bush's presence) of having [...] "abandoned the veterans" [...] on POW/MIA and Agent Orange issues.|$|E
500|$|Bush mobilized the state's evangelical voters, {{and leading}} {{conservative}} broadcaster Rush Limbaugh entered the fray supporting Bush {{and going on}} at length about how McCain was a favorite of liberal Democrats. [...] Polls swung in Bush's favor; by not accepting federal matching funds for his campaign, Bush was not limited in {{how much money he}} could spend on advertisements, while McCain was near his limit. [...] With three days to go, McCain shut down his <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> against Bush and tried to stress a positive image. [...] But McCain's unconstitutional campaign finance law, line item veto, suing HMO and McCain opposed tax cuts, did not appeal to core Republicans in the state.|$|E
500|$|Romney {{continued}} to seek {{support from a}} wary Republican electorate; {{at this point in}} the race, his poll numbers were relatively flat and at a historically low level for a Republican frontrunner. After the charges of flip-flopping that marked his 2008 campaign began to accumulate again, Romney declared in November 2011: [...] "I've been as consistent as human beings can be." [...] In the final month before voting began, Newt Gingrich experienced a significant surge– taking a solid lead in national polls and most of the early caucus and primary states– before settling back into parity or worse with Romney following a barrage of <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> from Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney Super PAC.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare {{differences}} in severity {{and type of}} electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities between early and late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to assess the influence of APOE genotype on this association, {{in order to understand}} the biological {{differences in}} AD according to age at onset Method: Of 460 probable AD patients and 336 patients with subjective complaints, serving as controls, EEG and APOE genotype were obtained. Subjects were categorised by age into a younger (≤ 65 years) and an older group (≥ 65 years), based on age at diagnosis. Severity and type of EEG abnormalities were visually assessed. Severity of EEG abnormalities ranged from normal to slightly abnormal to moderately severe. EEG abnormalities were characterised as only focal abnormalities, only diffuse abnormalities or both focal and diffuse abnormalities. Results: Logistic regression revealed that younger AD patients more often had EEG abnormalities, which were more severe, with a predominance of both focal and diffuse abnormalities. In controls, we observed the opposite, as older controls more often had EEG abnormalities than younger controls. Furthermore, APOE 34 <b>negative</b> <b>AD</b> patients had more severe EEG abnormalities than APOE ε 4 positive AD patients, while no such effect was observed in controls. There was no interaction between age at onset and APOE 34 genotype. Conclusion: Early onset and APOE ε 4 <b>negative</b> <b>AD</b> patients present with more severe EEG abnormalities than late onset and APOE ε 4 positive AD patients. These results suggest that in younger patients, AD manifests with more prominent functional brain changes...|$|R

50|$|Charges of mudslinging {{and dirty}} {{politics}} {{continued in the}} general election between Pappageorge and Levin.

500|$|In {{the run-up}} to the South Carolina Republican primary, Gingrich {{launched}} ads criticizing Romney for causing job losses while at Bain Capital, Perry referred to Romney's role there as [...] "vulture capitalism", and Sarah Palin pressed Romney to prove his claim that he created 100,000jobs during that time. Many conservatives rallied in defense of Romney, rejecting what they inferred as criticism of free-market capitalism. During two debates in the state, Romney fumbled questions about releasing his income tax returns, while Gingrich gained support with audience-rousing attacks on the debate moderators. Romney's double-digit lead in state polls evaporated; he lost to Gingrich by 13points in the January 21 primary. Combined with the delayed loss in Iowa, Romney's admitted poor week represented a lost chance to end the race early, and he quickly decided to release two years of his tax returns. The race turned to the Florida Republican primary, where in debates, appearances, and advertisements, Romney launched a sustained barrage against Gingrich's past record and associations and current electability. Romney enjoyed a large spending advantage from both his campaign and his aligned Super PAC, and after a record-breaking rate of <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> from both sides, Romney won Florida on January 31, gaining 46percent of the vote to Gingrich's 32percent.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{conducted}} by Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group showed that by December 30, some 45 percent of all television ads in Iowa were <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> against Gingrich; 20 percent were <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> against Romney; 10 percent were positive ads for Romney; 6 percent were positive ads for Gingrich; 8 percent were <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> against Perry; 8 percent were positive ads for Perry; and 3 percent were positive ads for Paul. Gingrich was the only candidate of the five leading candidates to face a net financial disadvantage in terms of ad money spent (as a percent of total ad money spent in Iowa) verses percent of ads run against that candidate: [...] Gingrich was at -35%, Santorum as +4%, Romney at +10%, Paul at +17%, and Perry at +31% (the largest net financial advantage).|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{included the}} heavy use of negative advertising attacking Cordova, including {{accusing him of}} cheating investors out of $1 million in a failed business venture, failing to pay income and business taxes, and living in California. Cordova denied the charges but had no funds to buy many television ads to refute them. The Renzi campaign also made heavy use of automated telephone calls throughout the district with various claims and innuendos about Cordova. Renzi said of the $2 million spent on <b>negative</b> <b>ads,</b> that he [...] "took no joy in any of that." [...] Renzi said {{he had tried to}} tell the National Republican Congressional Committee that the <b>negative</b> <b>ads</b> were the wrong way to go.|$|E
50|$|Martínez {{defeated}} his Democratic opponent, Betty Castor, in a {{very close}} election that was preceded by numerous <b>negative</b> television <b>ads</b> from both campaigns.

500|$|Holtzman, who was {{trailing}} last in polls, borrowed over $400,000 from Fleet Bank {{to run a}} <b>negative</b> <b>ad</b> accusing Ferraro and Zaccaro {{of taking}} more than $300,000 in rent in the 1980s from a pornographer with ties to organized crime. [...] Ferraro {{said there had been}} efforts to oust the man, Robert DiBernardo, after reports of the tenancy originated during her 1984 vice-presidential campaign, but he had remained in the building for three more years. [...] In addition, a report by an investigator for the New York State Organized Crime Task Force found its way to the media via a tip from a Holtzman aide; it said that Zaccaro had been seen meeting with the DiBernardo in 1985. [...] Ferraro said in response that those two had never met.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{performance}} of the two models we randomly split the training sample in two different sub-samples: the first one (90 % of the observations) is used to estimate the models using boosting, the second one (10 % of the observations) is used for the out-of-sample assessment of the classification performance. We repeat the operation 1000 times (drawing different sub-samples) and we evaluate the performance based on average results. Since the number of true <b>negatives</b> (<b>ads</b> that are not duplicates and are identified as such) is much larger than the number of true positives, using the classic accuracy rate can be misleading. For this reason we consider measures of classification performance that do not rely on the number of true negatives, namely: precision, recall and F-measure.|$|R
