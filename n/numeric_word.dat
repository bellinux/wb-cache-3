In remote times these words behaved otherwise which is proved by linguistic investigation, by reconstruction of old forms in different languages, by the study of semantic deviations and tendencies. The etymological analysis of number and measure words brings fruitful results. The mentioned analysis brings closer the past times, the mode of life of generations to have gone, their way of thinking, which spans efforts of people in cognizing Universe. <b>Numeric</b> <b>words</b> are traced in old linguistic forms; nowadays units fulfill nominative, cognitive and epidigmatic (word creating) functions...|$|R
3000|$|Additional {{information}} about the music is sparse in this work {{because of the large}} size of the music collection used (refer to Section 3.1): besides the year of release only the artist and title information is available for each song. While the date is directly used as a numeric attribute, the artist and title fields are processed in a similar way as the lyrics (cf. Section 2.1. 2 for a more detailed explanation of the methods): only the binary {{information about}} the occurrence of a word stem is obtained. The word stems are generated by string to word vector conversion applied to the artist and title attributes. Standard word delimiters are used to split multiple text strings to words and the Porter stemming algorithm [24] reduces words to common stems in order to map different forms of one word to their common stem. To limit the number of attributes that are left after conversion, a minimum word frequency is set, which determines how often a word stem must occur within one class. While the artist word list looks very specific to the collection of artists in the database, the title word list seems to have more general relevance with words like [...] "love", [...] "feel", or [...] "sweet". In total, the metadata attributes consist of one numeric date attribute and 152 binary <b>numeric</b> <b>word</b> occurrence attributes.|$|E

So there is a diverse need to find the quick method that can group the required documents. Numbers of algorithms like k-mean, agglomerative clustering are used for clustering purpose. Previously used algorithms deals with issues like handling outliers, data preparation etc. The Proposed System is pre-process unstructured document to structured data, then our idea extract four features of each document like title sentences, <b>numeric</b> <b>words,</b> proper nouns and term weights. This makes it much simpler than any other methods. The Proposed System neglecting unwanted extension’s considering only extensions which are rich in text like. pdf,. doc,. txt. As the final step of clustering, system creates a score matrix of all the documents by comparing with one another to yield a score matrix which contains aggregate feature score. The grouping of these scored values represents the most accurate clustered documents...|$|R
40|$|The {{human brain}} {{is at least}} a factor of 1 billion more {{efficient}} than our present digital technology, and a factor of 10 million more efficient than the best digital technology that we can imagine today. The unavoidable conclusion is that we have something fundamental to learn from the human brain about a new and much more effective form of computation, with a convenient, effective, efficient and reliable bottom-up (BU) approach. In another paper presented at this conference we focused on the computational information conservation properties of optimized <b>numeric</b> <b>words</b> with precisation of meaning. Here, we present a brain-inspired geometric-logical scheme defining fundamental human linguistic and predicative competence. According to CICT, complete duality of Opposition and Implication Geometry in Logical Geometry and Language can model n-dimensional predicative competence and beyond, according to available computational resources. In any case, their combination may provide even a concrete opportunity for the foundation of computational psychiatry and for reformulating psychoanalytical theory in a sharable way...|$|R

40|$|Data {{compression}} is {{very important}} feature in terms of saving the memory space. In this proposal, an indexed dictionary based compression is used for text data, where the word's reference in dictionary is used for compression. This approach is not file based, a common dictionary is used for compression. Which contains the words, {{the position of the}} word in dictionary {{is one of the key}} parts of encoded frame which is compressed form of the text word. This is loss-less compression. This compression approach is also take cares of small words like one or two characters words which usually decrease the efficiency of compression algorithms. This approach is also deals with file having special characters as a word. Special character <b>words,</b> alpha <b>numeric</b> <b>words,</b> normal texted words and small words all deals differently which makes this approach more efficient. Since a centralized dictionary is used for data compression, therefore, this approach is not preferred for transfer compressed file, while it is suitable to store text data in compressed form in hard disk drive and centralized storage or cloud drive for memory utilization.

40|$|Post-modern {{society and}} the global market heavily rely on the {{employment}} of information technology. Today’s successful business conduct requires an appropriate e-domiciliation within the Internet. The Internet space is spread in Top level domains (TLDs), each composed of sub-domains. The e-address consists of a <b>numeric</b> or <b>word</b> reference pointing to the relevant TLD (a pre-set few letters behind the dot) and sub-domains (a creative conglomerate of letters before the dot). Each TLD has its own legal and economic regime, and businesses should carefully study {{them in order to}} choose the best fitting TLD, so as to have the right few letters behind the dot. However, it is unclear how much importance should be placed on the word designation of the sub-domain(s), i. e. there is no conclusive evidence or commonly accepted consensus about the (in) significance of the letters before the dot. This issue requires an interdisciplinary study and a comparative analysis reflecting actual business reality. This paper summarizes underlying technical setting, concepts and functions of the pre-dot part of a domain name, rejects contemporary shortcuts and presents the domain name and its role from a global and super-temporal perspective. Considering the insufficiency of statistical data, independent studies and generally agreed upon conclusions, even approaches, it is vital to review underlying concepts and settings, and to engage in a comparative analysis along with observations from various angles. The ultimate goal is to enhance awareness and to open a constructive dialogue about intellectual property and domain names, in short, to move from the black-and-white and all-or-nothing perception to a more nuanced approach differentiating between domain names from the same TLD...|$|R
40|$|Both virtual and {{physical}} manipulatives are reported as effective learning tools when used with {{different groups of}} students {{in a variety of}} contexts to learn mathematical content. The use of multiple representations and the flexibility to translate among those representational forms facilitates students 2 ̆ 7 learning and has the potential to deepen their understanding. This classroom project involved two groups of third-grade students in a week-long unit focusing on algebraic relationships. The purpose of the unit was to engage students with different algebraic models and encourage students to use informal strategies to represent their relational thinking. The paper highlights examples of these student representations as evidence of the children 2 ̆ 7 s developing algebraic thinking. Result from the pre- and post-test measures showed that students in the physical and virtual manipulative environments gained significantly in achievement and showed flexibility in translating and representing their understanding in multiple representations: manipulative model, pictorial, <b>numeric</b> and <b>word</b> problems. The researchers recorded field notes, interviewed students, and videotaped class sessions in order to identify unique features of the learning environments. The virtual environment had unique features that promoted student thinking such as: a) explicit linking of visual and symbolic modes; b) guided step-by-step support in algorithmic processes; and c) immediate feedback and self-checking system. In the physical environment, some unique features were: a) tactile features; b) opportunities for invented strategies; and c) mental mathematics. These results show that although the different manipulative models had different features, both the physical and virtual environments were effective in supporting students 2 ̆ 7 learning and encouraging relational thinking and algebraic reasoning...|$|R
40|$|In this study, firstly it {{was aimed}} {{to see whether}} the tests with {{different}} item format create advantage or disadvantage on examinees’ performance, in other words, whether the examinees’ scores are fairly affected by particular test forms with different formatted items. Second purpose is to make use of test equating procedure as a tool for examining the effect of item formats on test performance and by this way identifying whether the two different item formatted test scores could be used interchangeably. This was questioned by searching whether the test scores obtained from different item formats could be used interchangeably. The data of the study was collected from 402 6 th grade students from various secondary schools. Single group design, and linear equating procedure from classical equating methodologies were used in the study. At the same time, {{as a part of the}} equating process, SEEs (Standart error of equating) for single group were estimated. Confidence bands based on the SEE was used to assess equivalence of different item formatted mathematic test edition. As a result of the study, differences were found between equating function and identity function, differences ranging from – 0, 041 to 1, 159. Because these differences are more than two SEEs for some score range, the two different item formatted mathematic test edition (<b>numeric</b> formatted and <b>word</b> formatted) can not be considered equivalent and interchangeable.

5000|$|The late 1970s and 1980s saw {{a massive}} {{increase}} of AAC-related research, publications, and training {{as well the}} first national and international conferences. The International Society for Alternative and Augmentative Communication (ISAAC) was founded in 1983; its members included clinicians, teachers, rehabilitation engineers, researchers, and AAC users themselves. The organization has since {{played an important role}} in developing the field through its peer-reviewed journal, conferences, national chapters and its focus on AAC in developing countries. AAC became an area of professional specialization; a 1981 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association position paper, for example, recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech-language pathologists. At the same time, AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations, by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations. [...] "Knowing that most of y'all do not know the HandiVoice, I will describe it...It was operated with a <b>numeric</b> keyboard...Each <b>word,</b> or sentence, or phrase, or phoneme was stored and accessed by a three digit code, for example, [...] "hello" [...] was 010...It took three codes to say [...] "Rick", that was nine numbers. Now if you think that's bad, let's go for the simple sentence, [...] "Hello, this is Rick Creech speaking." [...] This would have taken fifteen 3 digit codes, for a total of forty-five numbers. Looking back, I am not surprised that very few professionals thought a person could successfully use the HandiVoice 120. But I did. I did, because being able to communicate with people was so empowering to me." [...] Rick Creech describes the HandiVoice 120 speech generating device, which he received in 1977. From the 1980s, improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, and a reduction in their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Ewe. AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family. Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services. In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served. Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.|$|R
