5|$|An {{executive}} at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through hoops {{in order to}} get a promotion that his boss <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to give him. Markowitz wrote the role specifically for Bateman.|$|E
5|$|He {{was quoted}} by Rangers radio {{broadcasters}} {{as saying that}} he <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to physically harm Lefebvre but did {{want to speak to}} him; Daniels said he was upset that someone he didn't know was judging him.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2017, Frusciante, {{under the}} alias of Trickfinger, {{announced}} that he would be releasing the Trickfinger II EP on September 8, 2017 on the label Acid Test. The six songs, which were <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to be released, were originally recorded in 2007.|$|E
60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. I <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> to grow old. The soul is born old but grows young. That is {{the comedy}} of life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> {{to dance}} with Mr. Ellenborough again, so please don't urge me, Aunt Pen;" [...] and Debby knit her brows with a {{somewhat}} irate expression.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Sacho, [...] "but it is {{reasonable}} to guess that, being evil, he <b>intends</b> evil. He <b>never</b> <b>intends</b> to do good, I assure you." [...] Then the boy went away.|$|R
5|$|As the plenary {{legislative}} {{powers of}} the Parliament were sufficient to grant extraterritorial legislative powers to the Parliament, the Court declined to pronounce whether Article 73(a) was an empowering provision. However, it indicated on an obiter basis that had it been necessary to do so, it would have accepted the Attorney-General's alternate submission that Article 73(a) of the Malaysian Constitution was <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to be an empowering provision.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi {{served as}} head of the studio for eight months before Paramount closed its {{animation}} division on December 1, 1967. He learned that his position was always intended to be temporary and that Paramount <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to pick up his pitches. Although Hampft was prepared to offer Bakshi a severance package, Bakshi immediately ripped up the contract.|$|E
5|$|Caedmon's Call {{was formed}} in 1993 with four {{original}} members (three of whom still remain), Cliff Young, Danielle Glenn, Todd Bragg, and Aaron Tate. Aaron Tate, however, <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to tour with the band, and was included in a songwriting capacity only, sharing those duties with Derek Webb who also played lead guitar.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will never}} go so with me. I shall <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> to love any one. If I ever love any man {{it will be because}} I am made to do so, despite my intentions." ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{comments}} on Apple's own forums {{and many other}} technology websites show that users of iOS devices wish that the newsstand icon could be hidden or removed completely if they <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> to use it.|$|R
50|$|The {{complaint}} further accused Loria and Samson {{of conspiring}} with baseball officials to dilute the minority partners’ {{share of the}} team from 76 percent to 6-to-7 percent and of <b>never</b> <b>intending</b> to keep the franchise in Montreal.|$|R
5|$|In a {{manuscript}} {{he wrote in}} 1704 (<b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to be published) he mentions the date of 2060, {{but it is not}} given as a date for the end of days. It has been falsely reported as a prediction. The passage is clear, when you read the date in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} {{propose that the}} Founding Fathers <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> for District {{residents}} to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim that {{such a move would}} destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.|$|E
5|$|Alexander fled Macedon {{with his}} mother, {{dropping}} her {{off with her}} brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria, where he sought refuge with the Illyrian king and {{was treated as a}} guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.|$|E
6000|$|M. Look here! What's {{the meaning}} of it all? You <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> to leave us. You can't. Isn't the best {{squadron}} of the best regiment of the best cavalry {{in all the world}} good enough for you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Gilbert," [...] she said, [...] "haven't I {{always said}} that I <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> to marry any one who proposes to me? When I have quite made up my mind, I {{am going to do}} the proposing myself!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Encouraged by {{all these}} benefits, Vostri <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> to comply to the Sultan or make {{contracts}} and pay him annual tribute, as did other neighbors Illyrians (as author called Albanians) and Tribals (as author called Serbs), nor to subordinate themselves {{to him in}} any way.".|$|R
5|$|Architects who {{push the}} {{boundaries}} of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed {{the expectations of the}} public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to be practical.|$|E
5|$|DiCaprio {{appeared}} in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, {{as a favor to}} aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom. The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics. DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biographical film about Jim Carroll.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded {{its own version of}} the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. Zimmer turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to be put into the film. Zimmer also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs.|$|E
50|$|More {{traditional}} lyrics in {{the realm}} of positive relationships and religion were aided with clean in-line production. The band also noted that while they felt pressured at times, it was a welcome change of pace, and that they <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> to leave their roots; only expand them.|$|R
50|$|An example {{might be}} tapping someone's secured {{wireless}} LAN or public utility line (which could also amount to theft of services). Another example might {{be taking a}} joy ride in a car, <b>never</b> <b>intending</b> {{to keep it from}} the owner. Some have redefined such conduct as a specific type of theft.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must read}} it," [...] we said, with the {{readiness}} of one who <b>never</b> <b>intends</b> {{to read the book}} referred to. [...] "What you say of it is certainly very suggestive. But how do you account for the decay of the reverence and deference in which the Hajii were once held?" ...|$|R
5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was <b>never</b> <b>intended.</b> Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
5|$|A public {{announcement}} of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965, only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources {{at a time of}} severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure {{that there would be no}} repetition, Congress inserted a provision in the Coinage Act of 1965 forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years. That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.|$|E
5|$|Despite Australian fears, the Japanese <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> {{to invade}} the Australian mainland. While an {{invasion}} was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942, it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken. Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. This plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway. While these battles ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943.|$|E
50|$|I <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> {{giving up}} my Right to the Land in Question which I think I shall have full Paid for having under the Law of New Jersey acted as Commitioner (after {{the death of}} my father) to the Indians at Edgpillock and Coaxen for Near thirty years without fee or Reward.|$|R
6000|$|Tell Mrs. Benson I <b>never</b> <b>intend</b> to be a lawyer. I {{have been}} a slave several times in my life, but I'll never be one again. I always intend to be so {{situated}} (unless I marry,) that I can [...] "pull up stakes" [...] and clear out whenever I feel like it.|$|R
50|$|Instead of declaring openly that {{invasion}} of North Vietnam {{was out of}} the question for the purpose of relaxing the Soviet Union and China, the U.S. should have constantly threatened Hanoi with amphibious invasion while <b>never</b> <b>intending</b> to actually carry it out. Also, small scale raids into North Vietnam for one purpose or another would not be ruled out.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the late}} 1950s-era threat of surface-to-air {{missiles}} (SAMs) that could threaten high-altitude aircraft, seen in practice in the 1960 U-2 incident, the intended use of B-52 was changed {{to serve as a}} low-level penetration bomber during a foreseen attack upon the Soviet Union, as terrain masking provided an effective method of avoiding radar and thus the threat of the SAMs. Although <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> for the low level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast several intended successors as the nature of aerial warfare changed. The B-52's large airframe enabled the addition of multiple design improvements, new equipment, and other adaptations over its service life.|$|E
5|$|Liberty {{ships were}} an {{expedient}} {{solution to a}} pressing problem, and it was <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> that they last more than five years. It is remarkable that two (SS John W. Brown and SS Jeremiah O'Brien) have not only survived seventy plus years of service, but {{that they are in}} 'like-new' condition, and {{are open to the public}} as museums. The British needed a way to replace the ships lost to German U-boats, but did not have the resources to build them. In 1939, they asked the United States to help solve the problem, bringing a ship design that they wanted built. The design was modified to fit American production methods, and five new shipyards were built to give the shipbuilding industry capacity. These ships were called Ocean ships with each ship's name starting with Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{sent the}} first {{shipments}} of rifles up to Bechuanaland in January and February 1889, sending 250 each month, and instructed Jameson, Dr Frederick Rutherfoord Harris and a Shoshong trader, George Musson, to convey them to Bulawayo. Lobengula {{had so far}} accepted the financial payments described in the Rudd Concession (and continued {{to do so for}} years afterwards), but when the guns arrived in early April, he refused to take them. Jameson placed the weapons under a canvas cover in Maguire's camp, stayed at the kraal for ten days, and then went back south with Maguire in tow, leaving the rifles behind. A few weeks later, Lobengula dictated a letter for Fairbairn to write to the Queen—he said he had <b>never</b> <b>intended</b> to sign away mineral rights and that he and his izinDuna revoked their recognition of the document.|$|E
60|$|Had she {{known her}} sister sought to tear her from such {{prospects}} and such realities as these, {{what would have}} been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's <b>never</b> <b>intending</b> to go there himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see the necessity," [...] said Lord Marney; [...] "I {{never saw}} one, and <b>never</b> <b>intend.</b> Though to be sure, when I hear the rents that Mowbray gets for his land in their neighbourhood, I must say I wish the worsted works had {{answered}} at Marney. And {{if it had}} not been for our poor dear father, they would." ...|$|R
5000|$|In one instance, {{a caller}} confessed to an {{elaborate}} lie to an ex-boyfriend about {{giving birth to}} a child of his (which was actually miscarried) and subsequently putting the child up for adoption. [...] The caller admitted to faking documentation (such as borrowing a friend's ultrasounds and photos) and that she <b>never</b> <b>intends</b> to confess the truth to him, despite losing significant sleep over it.|$|R
