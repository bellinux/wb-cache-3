40|$|Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, are {{anticipated}} {{in many of}} NASA {{space exploration}} missions {{as well as in}} terrestrial applications. One can seldom find electronics that are capable of operation under both regimes. Even for operation under one (hot or cold) temperature extreme, some thermal controls need to be introduced to provide appropriate ambient temperatures so that spacecraft on-board or field on-site electronic systems work properly. The inclusion of these controls, which comprise of heating elements and radiators along with their associated structures, adds to the complexity {{in the design of the}} system, increases cost and weight, and affects overall reliability. Thus, it would be highly desirable and very beneficial to eliminate these thermal measures in order to simplify system's design, improve efficiency, reduce development and launch costs, and improve reliability. These requirements can only be met through the development of electronic parts that are designed for proper and efficient operation under extreme temperature conditions. Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) based devices are finding more use in harsh environments due to the benefits that their inherent design offers in terms of reduced leakage currents, less power consumption, faster switching speeds, good radiation tolerance, and extreme temperature operability. Little is known, however, about their performance at cryogenic temperatures and under wide thermal swings. The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of a new commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SOI parts over an extended temperature range and to determine the effects of thermal cycling on their performance. The results will establish a baseline on the suitability of such devices for use in space exploration missions under extreme temperatures, and will aid mission planners and circuit designers in the proper selection of electronic parts and circuits.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the VLSI era, various technologies have been adopted for developing the design and characterization of analog circuits. For robust design, the influences of the process parameter variations have been considered over the circuit simulation. Previous studies in this field concentrated more on the physical dimensions such as the width, length, area and perimeter as well as the threshold voltage of the device. The focus of this thesis was to characterize the performance of an analog IC standard cell library as well as optimize the simulation models. The circuits include NMOS FETs (<b>n-channel</b> <b>metal-oxide</b> <b>semiconductor</b> field-effect transistor), PMOS FETs (p-channel metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor), poly resistors, current mirrors, comparators, bias generators, voltage references, op-amps, and voltage regulators. The spice model used for simulation was the BSIM 3 (Berkeley Simulator version 3) model. Tanner Research designed the majority of the standard cells evaluated. These cells were fabricated in the AMI 1. 5 -um CMOS process using the MOSIS service. The ICs (Integrated Circuits) have been developed using software from Tanner Research namely, the schematic editor, S-Edit; layout editor, L-Edit and simulated using T-Spice (Tanner version of Spice). The simulations carried out on the circuits using the optimized model exhibited an overall performance improvement over the unoptimized model. Based on these simulations, numerous plots and tables are presented and the data was discussed in terms of the output characteristics. There was a noticeable improvement in the accuracy of 60. 44 % for the PMOS FET and 17. 25 % for the NMOS FET with the optimized model.
