25|$|The huipil endures in many {{indigenous}} communities, if not as {{an everyday}} garment, as one for ceremonies or special occasions. When a woman puts on a huipil, especially a ceremonial or very traditional one, {{it is a kind}} of ritual. She becomes the center of a symbolic world as her head passes through the <b>neck</b> <b>opening.</b> With her arms, she forms a cross and is surrounded by myth as between heaven and the underworld.|$|E
25|$|Waterwear of Newport Beach, California, {{produced}} the natural gum-rubber Seal suit for US Divers from 1953 or earlier. Several versions were available, including one piece and two piece suits. The one piece suits were available with long or short legs and sleeves, and with front, neck or back entry. Neck entry suits were sealed by overlapping the <b>neck</b> <b>opening</b> and the hood over a grooved neck ring, and clamping {{with a large}} elastic O-ring. The two piece suit shirt and pants were also available separately and could be sealed together at the waist by a system similar to the neck entry suit.|$|E
500|$|The team wears a black {{alternate}} jersey for all Monday {{home games}} and frequently {{on the road}} in place of the traditional gray road jersey. These mesh jerseys are similar to the home and road versions, but with [...] "Music City" [...] written across the chest, no names on the back, and [...] "Nashville" [...] sewn in red letters under the Athletics sleeve logo. They are usually paired with a cap with the letters [...] "MC", for [...] "Music City", over a guitar pick. Alternate red jerseys with printed graphics are worn for all Friday home games. These jerseys are made from red material with black and white striping at the <b>neck</b> <b>opening</b> and bands of silver, black, and white around the sleeve openings. A guitar's fret and headstock extend upward from these bands on each sleeve. [...] "Nashville" [...] is printed across the chest in white sound-hole lettering bordered by silver and black. The player's number is located below the city's name on the player's left chest in silver characters with a white border and a black drop shadow. The number is also displayed on the back in white lettering with a silver border and black drop shadow. This jersey is paired with white pants and a cap of solid red with a spinning black record with white stars from the flag of Tennessee on the center red label set against a white and black silhouette of the state of Tennessee.|$|E
50|$|Leotards are {{entered through}} the neck (in {{contrast}} to bodysuits which generally have snaps at the crotch, allowing the garment {{to be pulled}} on over the head). Scoop-necked leotards have wide <b>neck</b> <b>openings</b> and are {{held in place by}} the elasticity of the garment. Others are crew necked or polo necked and close {{at the back of the}} neck with a zipper or snaps.|$|R
50|$|The French SAS {{wore the}} Denison while {{fighting}} with Free French Forces to liberate France during WWII, {{and continued to}} wear it after the war. The Denison smock was also utilized {{by most of the}} soldiers in the French army's 8e Batallion de Parachutistes de Choc (8e BPC) in Indochina, including while the unit was at Dien Bien Phu; the majority of the smocks worn were in their original configuration, but modifications (particularly to the front and <b>neck</b> <b>openings)</b> were often made by local tailors or unit riggers.|$|R
25|$|The basic garment {{for both}} genders and all classes was the tunica (tunic), often worn beneath {{one or more}} {{additional}} layers. In its simplest form, the tunic was a single rectangle of woven fabric, originally woolen, but from the mid-republic onward, increasingly made from linen. It was sewn into a sleeveless tubular shape and pinned around the shoulders like a Greek chiton, to form <b>openings</b> for the <b>neck</b> and arms. In some examples from {{the eastern part of}} the empire, <b>neck</b> <b>openings</b> were formed in the weaving. Sleeves could be added. Most working men wore knee-length, short-sleeved tunics, secured at the waist with a belt. Some traditionalists considered long sleeved tunics appropriate only for women, very long tunics on men as a sign of effeminacy, and short or unbelted tunics as marks of servility. Women's tunics were usually ankle or foot-length, long-sleeved, and could be worn loosely or belted. Though essentially simple in basic design, tunics could also be luxurious in their fabric, colours and detailing.|$|R
2500|$|A zipper running {{vertically}} {{down the}} front of the garment, from the <b>neck</b> <b>opening</b> to the inside or front ankle of one of the legs (usually the left), designed to make it easy to put on and take off. [...] On teen and adult sizes, the zipper usually instead runs from the neck to the crotch.|$|E
2500|$|Optional snap tab {{where the}} zipper meets the <b>neck</b> <b>opening.</b> [...] This {{is a small}} tab of fabric sewed to the garment {{on one side of}} the zipper (usually the right), and {{fastening}} to the other side with a snap fastener, designed to prevent discomfort from the zipper slider coming into contact with the wearer's chin and deter access to the zipper.|$|E
2500|$|Early gorgets were wide, copying {{the shape}} of the earlier aventail, however, with the {{narrowing}} of the <b>neck</b> <b>opening</b> the gorget plates had to be hinged to allow the helmet to be put on. Early great bascinets had the skull of the helmet riveted to the rear gorget plate, however, some later great bascinets had the skull forged in a single piece with the rear gorget plate. The gorget was often strapped to both the breast and backplate of the cuirass. In this late form the head was relieved of the [...] entire weight of the helmet, which rested on the shoulders; however, the helmet was rendered totally immobile {{and the head of the}} wearer had only limited abilities to move inside it. Though very strongly constructed, this type of helmet imposed limitations on the wearer's vision and agility.|$|E

5000|$|Tracheotomy ( [...] ) is a {{surgical}} procedure {{which consists of}} making an incision on the anterior aspect of the <b>neck</b> and <b>opening</b> a direct airway through an incision in the trachea (windpipe). The resulting stoma (hole), or tracheostomy, can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheal tube or tracheostomy tube [...] to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe {{without the use of}} the nose or mouth.|$|R

40|$|Dewar flasks {{have been}} {{proposed}} as containers for relatively long-term (25 days) storage of perishable scientific samples or other perishable objects at a temperature of 175 C. The refrigeration would be maintained through slow boiling of liquid nitrogen (LN 2). For {{the purposes of the}} application for which these containers were proposed, (1) the <b>neck</b> <b>openings</b> of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Dewar flasks are too small for most NASA samples; (2) the round shapes of the COTS containers give rise to unacceptably low efficiency of packing in rectangular cargo compartments; and (3) the COTS containers include metal structures that are too thermally conductive, such that they cannot, without exceeding size and weight limits, hold enough LN 2 for the required long-term-storage. In comparison with COTS Dewar flasks, the proposed containers would be rectangular, yet would satisfy the long-term storage requirement without exceeding size and weight limits; would have larger neck openings; and would have greater sample volumes, leading to a packing efficiency of about double the sample volume as a fraction of total volume. The proposed containers would be made partly of aerospace- type composite materials and would include vacuum walls, multilayer insulation, and aerogel insulation...|$|R
60|$|This, however, {{sprang up}} later on. Meantime {{in common with}} the rest of the {{shipping}} in that Eastern port, I was left in no doubt as to Hermann's notions of hygienic clothing. Evidently he believed in wearing good stout flannel next his skin. On most days little frocks and pinafores could be seen drying in the mizzen rigging of his ship, or a tiny row of socks fluttering on the signal halyards; but once a fortnight the family washing was exhibited in force. It covered the poop entirely. The afternoon breeze would incite to a weird and flabby activity all that crowded mass of clothing, with its vague suggestions of drowned, mutilated and flattened humanity. Trunks without heads waved at you arms without hands; legs without feet kicked fantastically with collapsible flourishes; and there were long white garments that, taking the wind fairly through their <b>neck</b> <b>openings</b> edged with lace, became for a moment violently distended as by the passage of obese and invisible bodies. On these days you could make out that ship at a great distance by the multi-coloured grotesque riot going on abaft her mizzen mast.|$|R

50|$|The {{use of the}} Schandmantel was {{comparable}} to the Lästersteine (German) or schandstenen (Dutch), heavy stones weighing down from the neck. The Schandtonne was weighted along the lower rim and around the <b>neck</b> <b>opening</b> {{as a way of}} corporal punishment in addition to the severe public humiliation it posed.|$|E

2500|$|Modesty was {{important}} for all except the very rich, and most women appear almost entirely covered by rather shapeless clothes, which needed {{to be able to}} accommodate a full pregnancy. The basic garment in the early Empire comes down to the ankles, with a high round collar and tight sleeves to the wrist. [...] The fringes and cuffs might be decorated with embroidery, with a band around the upper arm as well. [...] In the 10th and 11th century a dress with flared sleeves, eventually very full indeed at the wrist, becomes increasingly popular, before disappearing; working women are shown with the sleeves tied up. [...] In court ladies this may come with a V-collar. Belts were normally worn, possibly with belt-hooks to support the skirt; they may have been cloth more often than leather, and some tasselled sashes are seen. [...] <b>Neck</b> <b>openings</b> were probably often buttoned, which is hard to see in art, and not described in texts, but must have been needed if only for breast-feeding. [...] Straight down, across, or diagonally are the possible options. The plain linen undergarment was, until the 10th century, not designed to be visible. However at this point a standing collar starts to show above the main dress.|$|R

50|$|A catsuit is a {{one-piece}} form-fitting garment {{that covers}} the torso and the legs, and frequently the arms. They are usually made from stretchable material, such as lycra, chiffon, spandex (after 1959), latex, or velour, but may use less elastic materials, such as leather or PVC. Catsuits frequently close using a zipper at the front or back, or are pulled on over the <b>neck</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Humbucker Casing The Gibson-designed P-90s come in {{a unique}} shape, wider than a Fender-style single coil but {{narrower}} than a humbucker, and longer than both. If one wanted to install a P-90 in a guitar routed for humbucker pickups (a Les Paul Standard for example), the existing rout in the body {{would have to be}} modified. [...] This may result in aesthetic issues, due to gaps between the body and hardware, or even structural problems, as is the case when re-routing the <b>neck</b> humbucker <b>opening</b> on a Gibson SG guitar.
