The {{events of}} 11 August 1940 {{increased}} the ferocity and tempo of German air operations <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> large period of clear and fine weather was predicted. The day's operation {{amounted to a}} coordinated attack on No. 10, 11 and 12 Groups coupled with naval interdiction activity in the Channel. Kesselring hoped to draw out and disperse Park's defences by sending out large numbers of single Staffeln. With {{the exception of the}} early morning, Park did not take the bait. While a high proportion of No. 11 Group aircraft were forced into the air it did not achieve Kesselring's aim of attracting enforcements from other RAF Groups.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Cameroonian community also became involved in a number of initiatives. In 1985 Bahá'ís established a tutorial school among the pygmies and the building infrastructure was to be expanded by the government <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> site had been developed. In 1990 the Cameroonian community held a nationwide campaign on the growth of the religion named in honor of Hand of the Cause Enoch Olinga with teams named after other Hands of the Cause.|$|E

In fact, the opposite has happened – political discord throughout the Alpha and Beta Quadrants has declined. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> second drone vessel {{is ready to be}} launched, Valadore suggests a mission against the Enterprise in order to impress the Senate. Nijil argues that the pilot requires time to recover from his previous exertions, but Valadore insists and prioritizes the mission.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the number}} of {{children}} with intersex conditions referred to Lawson Wilkins' new pediatric endocrinology clinic at Hopkins increased, it was recognized that doctors [...] "couldn't tell by looking" [...] at the external genitalia, and many errors of diagnosis based on outward appearance had led to anomalous sex assignments.
