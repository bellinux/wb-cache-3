25|$|After she {{remarried}} in America, Suyuan {{has high}} hopes for her new daughter June, but June constantly fails to meet her expectations out {{of a lack of}} interest. She performs badly during a piano recital at age nine (Melanie Chang), and when Suyuan pushes her to continue training to be a concert pianist, June refuses, saying that she wishes herself dead like Suyuan's other daughters, an action that offends Suyuan. When June grows into adulthood, at a dinner party a year before Suyuan's passing, Waverly, June's long-time rival whom she is freelancing for, turns down her business ideas, and Suyuan remarks that Waverly and June are not alike and that style is something one's born with and cannot be taught implying Waverly has style. June feels humiliated, believing her mother had betrayed her for being a failure in her eyes, and Lindo shows sympathy for June. The following day, June berates Suyuan for her remarks and admits she could <b>never</b> <b>live</b> up to her high expectations. June laments that Suyuan has always been disappointed with June because June dropped out of college, is not married, and has an unsuccessful career. However, Suyuan gives her a jade necklace and assures June that she is the one who has the unteachable style and that while Waverly was the best in competitions, June always had the best heart which made her mother prouder than she would have been otherwise.|$|E

500|$|As {{the evening}} progressed Huskisson {{continued}} to weaken. The doctors {{had concluded that}} without amputation {{he would continue to}} deteriorate, but that he had no realistic chance of surviving major surgery, and broke this news to the Huskissons. William Huskisson already believed that he was dying and had resigned himself to his fate; Emily Huskisson at first caused [...] "a dreadful scene... but at last she calmed herself and {{during the rest of the}} time sat weeping by the couch". Huskisson told Brandreth [...] "You see I shall <b>never</b> <b>live</b> to make any return for your kindness. You have done all that is possible, but it is all in vain." [...] After further laudanum, he complained [...] "Why endeavour to support my strength? I must die, it is only prolonging my sufferings." ...|$|E
500|$|Over time, a rift {{developed}} between the family's three eldest and three youngest children. The deaths of Charlotte's brothers Sigismund and Waldemar in 1866 and 1879, respectively, devastated the Crown Princess. The historian John C. G. Röhl posits that Vicky's eldest three children [...] "could <b>never</b> <b>live</b> up to [...] idealised {{memory of the}} two dead princes". The strict upbringing Vicky gave to the eldest three children—Wilhelm, Charlotte, and Henry—was not replicated in {{her relationship with her}} three youngest surviving children, Viktoria, Sophia, and Margaret. The eldest children, in turn and sensing their mother's disappointment, became resentful of Vicky's indulgence towards their youngest siblings. The historian John Van der Kiste speculates that had Vicky shown the same level of acceptance with Charlotte as with her younger children, [...] "the relationship between them might have been a happier one".|$|E

[...] The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpses—the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom Maus success was built. [...] He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son, {{and that some of}} Art's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way. As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this [...] "separate universe", and feels inadequate in portraying it.|$|E

500|$|... "The Mansion Family" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Michael Polcino {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was the first of many episodes of the series that Polcino directed. Executive producer Mike Scully was the one who received the idea for {{the first part of the}} story. He explained on a DVD audio commentary for the episode that his grandmother was the oldest citizen of his hometown West Springfield, Massachusetts, and [...] "they had a ceremony where she was awarded a cane that had a golden head on it. And the weird thing of the ceremony is her name wasn't on the cane, and the mayor of the town stood up and he says: 'And now, of course as soon as Hazel passes away, her name will be engraved on the cane.' So she would <b>never</b> <b>live</b> to see it happen. But nonetheless, she was given the cane." ...|$|E

[...] The essence of Objectivist ethics is summarized by the oath her Atlas Shrugged character John Galt adhered to: [...] "I swear—by my life and my love of it—that I will <b>never</b> <b>live</b> for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though the {{character}} performs {{most of the}} same actions in the films as in the books, Jackson presents Théoden as a leader who is often unsure of himself and fears that he will <b>never</b> <b>live</b> up to the reputation of his forefathers. In the extended edition of [...] (2003), Saruman derisively calls him [...] "a lesser son of greater sires" [...] after he refuses {{to side with the}} fallen wizard after the battle at Helm's Deep. In Tolkien's original novel, the phrase was uttered sarcastically by Théoden himself in dismissal of Saruman's flattering attempts to regain his loyalty. In the movie, it is a pointed insult that hits its mark.|$|E

On February 2, 1929 Jennie Wedge applied in the superior court to have her marriage to Wedge annulled {{on the basis of his}} [...] "unsound mind" [...] and his fraud, alleging that Wedge [...] "falsely and fraudulently" [...] represented that he had sufficient funds to provide for her immediate needs, whereas he had insufficient funds to pay the $100 bill for their honeymoon suite. Also on February 2, 1929 Wedge was charged with insanity at his own request, with the papers signed by his son, Hugh.
