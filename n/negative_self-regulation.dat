40|$|The time {{evolution}} of gene expression across the developmental {{stages of the}} host organism can be inferred from appropriate DNA microarray time series. Modeling this evolution aims eventually at improving the understanding and prediction of the complex phenomena that are the basis of life. We focus on the embryonic-to-adult development phases of Drosophila melanogaster, and chose to model the expression network {{with the help of}} a system of differential equations with constant coefficients, which are nonlinear in the transcript concentrations but linear in their logarithms. To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, genes having similar expression profiles are grouped into 17 clusters. We show that a simple linear model is able to reproduce the experimental data with very good precision, owing to the large number of parameters that represent the connections between the clusters. Remarkably, the parameter reduction allowed elimination of up to 80 - 85 % of these connections while keeping fairly good precision. This result supports the low-connectivity hypothesis of gene expression networks, with about three connections per cluster, without introducing a priori hypotheses. The core of the network shows a few gene clusters with <b>negative</b> <b>self-regulation,</b> and some highly connected clusters involving proteins with crucial functions.

40|$|The {{learning}} {{and development of}} teamwork skill is only possible if its achievement is a self-building process of the student. In turn,the teachers must become guides {{in the process of}} a learning which is not limited only to the topic of their own course, but which must be imbedded with a good dose of this skill. Promotion of teamwork is not spontaneous but very often requires the use of self-regulation within teams. The aim of the paper is to elucidate if positive or <b>negative</b> <b>self-regulation</b> of teams are useful to promote teamwork. The paper presents some experiences on the use of self-regulation of teams within ofactive teaching strategies that involve teamwork as a critical skill in engineering education. The paper presents first the fundamentals of the learning strategy adopted, intended to develop teamwork abilities in the students. It then describes the context and challenges faced up in the case studies, as well as the essentials of the learning activities proposed. Finally, the paper discusses the student’s achievement and perception. Although some influence of unbalanced teams there exists, it can be stated that positive self-regulation of teams is more easily accepted by teams than the negative ones, because of the influence on interpersonal relation ships amongst students. The topics involved in this experience are energy related topics such as electrical installations, heat transfer, engineering thermodynamics or theory of circuit...|$|E
40|$|The korAB operon in RK 2 {{plasmids}} is {{a beautiful}} natural example of a negatively and cooperatively self-regulating operon. It has been particularly well characterized both experimentally and with mathematical models. We have carried out a detailed investigation {{of the role of}} the regulatory mechanism using a biologically grounded mechanistic multi-scale stochastic model that includes plasmid gene regulation and replication in the context of host growth and cell division. We use the model to compare four hypotheses for the action of the regulatory mechanism: increased robustness to extrinsic factors, decreased protein fluctuations, faster response-time of the operon and reduced host burden through improved efficiency of protein production. We find that the strongest impact of all elements of the regulatory architecture is on improving the efficiency of protein synthesis by reduction in the number of mRNA molecules needed to be produced, leading to a greater than ten-fold reduction in host energy required to express these plasmid proteins. A smaller but still significant role is seen for speeding response times, but this is not materially improved by the cooperativity. The self-regulating mechanisms have the least impact on protein fluctuations and robustness. While reduction of host burden is evident in a plasmid context, <b>negative</b> <b>self-regulation</b> is a widely seen motif for chromosomal genes. We propose that an important evolutionary driver for negatively self-regulated genes is to improve the efficiency of protein synthesis...|$|E

40|$|MA (Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Humans are {{relational}} beings, as {{they are}} constantly in interaction with others and with their environment. In schools, learners spend at least nine years {{of their lives in}} formal schooling, and the relationships they have with their teachers are bound {{to have an impact on}} their self-configuration. According to the Field theory, the Bioecological theory and the Dialogical theory of self, which were used as theoretical frameworks for this study, individuals’ self-configuration is impacted by their environment, experiences and interactions with others. The focus of this study was on Grade 7 learners’ self-configuration experiences within the teacher-learner relationship. Grade 7 learners are at the beginning of the adolescent phase, which is characterised by many changes, transitions, challenges and uncertainties. One of these transitions is the forthcoming transition from primary school to high school and a healthy self-configuration could assist learners to adapt to these changes in a positive manner. The research was qualitative in nature and made use of the case study method. This allowed the researcher to use data gathering approaches through which the subjective experiences of the participants could be explored. Twelve participants volunteered to take part in this study, and data was gathered by means of individual interviews as well as group discussions. All interviews and group discussions were voice and video recorded, where after they were transcribed and analysed by means of thematic analysis. The analysis allowed for data to be organised into meaningful themes. It was found that learners’ experiences of relationships with teachers are both positive and <b>negative.</b> <b>Self-regulation</b> in learners takes place through encouragement and disapproval from teachers, as well as through lessons learnt from teachers and from past experiences. Further studies around self-configuration and teacher-learner relationships are recommended, in order to make teachers more aware of the importance of the teacher-learner relationship, and also to determine what the obstacles are in developing supportive and caring teacher-learner relationships. By highlighting the importance, and by determining the obstacles, more meaningful teacher-learner relationships could be encouraged and developed in order to enhance learners’ self-configuration experiences.

We hypothesized that negative emotionality in combination with poor self-regulation would predict elevated AL. Mothers reported on children’s emotionality (N 239, 116 males) at age 9, and self-regulation was measured at age 9 using a standard behavioural index of delay of gratification.

SIRT 1 has been extensively investigated and shown to delay senescence; however, less {{is known about the}} regulation of SIRT 1 during aging. In this study, we show that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), which is a ligand-regulated modular nuclear receptor that governs adipocyte differentiation and inhibits cellular proliferation, inhibits SIRT 1 expression at the transcriptional level. Moreover, both PPARγ and SIRT 1 can bind the SIRT 1 promoter. PPARγ directly interacts with SIRT 1 and inhibits SIRT 1 activity, forming a <b>negative</b> feedback and <b>self-regulation</b> loop.

Similarly, albeit time perspective was studied in relation with other individual variables that might provide insights for a better understanding of its volitional nature (such as, locus of control, optimism/pessimism or self-determination), self-regulation is one such variable, which has not yet been considered.

Study 1 (N = 240) involved a two-phase design to examine main and interactive effects of perfectionism dimensions predicting adaptive outcomes (i. e., well-being, achievement, motivation) and maladaptive outcomes (i. e., psychological distress, repetitive thought, procrastination) over a semester. The results largely supported the 2 ? 2 model of perfectionism. Pure personal standards (PSP) predicted higher levels {{of many of the}} adaptive outcomes and lower levels of some of the maladaptive outcomes compared to no tendency towards perfectionism. Pure evaluative concerns (ECP) predicted lower levels of adaptive outcomes and higher levels of maladaptive outcomes than no tendency towards perfectionism. A mixed combination buffered both the adaptive benefits of high personal standards and the maladaptive effects of high evaluative concerns. Mediation models indicated that: (1) worry and rumination mediated pure ECP and <b>negative</b> affect, (2) <b>self-regulation</b> mediated pure ECP and procrastination, (3) mindfulness mediated pure PSP and positive affect, and (4) intrinsic motivation mediated pure PSP and goal achievement, while extrinsic motivation did not mediate this relationship.

Although the mindfulness group (n = 23) and the control group (n = 25) did not change in adaptive outcomes, the control group increased in ECP and many maladaptive outcomes compared to the mindfulness group.

40|$|Minimising {{intake of}} dietary fats and {{consuming}} appropriate amounts {{of fruit and}} vegetables {{reduce the risk of}} numerous <b>negative</b> health consequences. <b>Self-regulation,</b> and the processes underlying this capacity, namely executive functions, have been proposed to influence the adoption and maintenance of such healthy eating behaviours. In this thesis, a multi-method approach was taken to establish which facets of executive function were involved in healthy eating behaviour and whether these could be modified to improve eating behaviour. The results of a series of focus groups and a prospective study revealed that inhibitory control was specifically involved in fat intake, while updating ability was involved in fruit and vegetable consumption. A meta-analysis of current inhibitory control training studies revealed the need to assess change in eating behaviour using ecologically valid measures of eating behaviour, and to assess the mechanisms by which inhibitory control training influence eating behaviour. Results of an intervention based on these findings revealed that behaviour-specific stop-signal training led to a reduction in body mass index, which was mediated by changes in vulnerability to depletion. However, training did not result in a reduction in fat intake or an increase in inhibitory control capacity. The intervention was replicated to assess the reliability and longevity of the effects and to address methodological limitations. Results revealed that both behaviour-specific and general inhibitory control training improved inhibitory control capacity and decreased vulnerability to depletion; however, these improvements did not result in behaviour change, nor did they persist over time. While it appears that inhibitory control training alone may not be a suitable technique to change everyday eating behaviour, this technique may be efficacious for short-term improvement in self-regulatory outcomes, or when combined with other behaviour change techniques...|$|R
40|$|Leadership trait {{theory has}} shaped {{constructive}} leadership research {{for over a}} century, yet ineffective and destructive leadership has been ignored until relatively recently. Emerging evidence indicates that ineffective and destructive leadership causes substantial harm to both employees and organizations, yet we know little {{about the causes of}} such behavior. This thesis presents a neurocognitive process model of leadership explaining the antecedents of constructive, ineffective and destructive leadership. The first stage of model development draws on reinforcement sensitivity theory (Gray & McNaughton, 2000) and explains how specific situations activate neuropsychological processes responsible for leader emotions and behavior. The second stage of model development incorporates the emotion–leadership linkages developed in stage one within a broader process model of leadership. This process model of leadership explains how a central neurocognitive self-regulatory mechanism (MacCoon, Wallace, & Newman, 2004) results in constructive, ineffective and destructive leadership during a demanding performance task. It is proposed that attentional resources moderate the impact of <b>negative</b> emotions on <b>self-regulation</b> such that sufficient attentional resource capacity results in constructive leadership, while insufficient capacity results in ineffective or destructive leadership. Evidence from a field study of 157 participant–superior dyads and 137 participant–subordinate teams shows that poor constructive leadership, as indicated by low superior ratings of transformational leadership, is associated with low attentional resource capacity and high trait anxiety as predicted. Destructive leadership, as indicated by high subordinate ratings of abusive leadership, is associated with low attentional resource capacity and high trait anger. Results from a field study of 161 leaders shows that an increase in negative state emotions occurs when performing a difficult task, which overwhelms a leader’s limited attentional resource capacity as predicted. This leads to ineffective <b>self-regulation,</b> increased <b>negative</b> state emotions and destructive leadership. However, low negative state emotions are associated with easy performance tasks, which have little aversive effect on a leader’s attentional resource capacity.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe {{research}} problem {{for this study}} is the limited and unsuccessful implementation of the IWRM concept. This thesis has argued that comprehensive assessment of physical and socioeconomic conditions is essential to provide explanation on factors that limit the successful execution of the IWRM approach. It has further argued that the local IWRM works as proxy for full and successful implementation of the IWRM approach. To contextualise this thesis, the prevailing physical and socioeconomic factors in Malawi in relation to current management and usage of water resources were explained. With 1, 321 m 3 per capita per year against index thresholds of 1, 700 - 1, 000 m 3 per capita per year, this study showed that Malawi is a physically water stressed country but not physically water scarce country although economically it is a water scarce country. This novelty is against some literature that present Malawi as a water abundant country. Again, this study showed that executing a full and successful IWRM in Malawi remains a challenge because of the prevailing socioeconomic situation in terms of water policies,water laws, institutions and management instruments. These aspects have not been reformed and harmonised to facilitate a successful operation of the IWRM approach. The main water-related problem in Malawi is the mismanagement of the available water resources. This is largely {{due to the lack of}} implementing management approaches which can generate systematic data for practical assessment of water resources to guide the coordinated procedure among water stakeholders working in catchments. This lack of implementing a coordinated management approach commonly known as integrated water resources management (IWRM) can be attributed to various reasons that includei) lack of comprehensive assessment of factors that can explain lack of successful IWRM implementation at catchment level and ii) lack of methods to demonstrate data generation and analysis on quantity, quality and governance of water that show practical operation of IWRM at community level using groundwater as a showcase among others. This study revealed that introducing local IWRM requires a prior knowledge of the evolution and role of the full IWRM concept in the international water policy which aimed at addressing broader developmental objectives. Globally, the current status of the IWRM concept has potential to address such broader developmental objectives, but sustaining IWRM projects where they have been piloted showed slow progress. Basing on the factors that slow such a progress, local IWRM approach has emerged as a proxy to execute the full IWRM as demonstrated in chapter 8 in this thesis. However, the observed lack of sustainable resources to fund continual functioning of local IWRM activities will defeat its potential solution to water management challenges. The main threat for sustainable local IWRM activities is the tendency of national governments to decentralise roles and responsibilities to local governments and communities without the accompanying financial resources to enable the implementation of the local participation, investments and initiatives at local level. If this tendency could be reversed, the contribution by local IWRM towards solving management problems in the water sector will be enormous. Chapter four has provided the general case-study approach used in this study in terms of research design, data collection methods, data analysis methods, ethical consideration and limitation of the current study within the context of water resource management with a focus on groundwater management. Using geologic map, satellite images, photographs and hydrogeologic conceptual model, the following results emerged: 1) that the Upper Limphasa River catchment has fractured rock aquifer with limited permeability and storage capacity; 2) The topographic nature and north-south strikes of the lineaments explained the north-south flow direction of groundwater in the catchment; 3) The drainage system observed in the Kandoli and Kaning’ina Mountains to the east and west of the Upper Limphasa River catchment respectively (Fig. 5. 1; Fig. 5. 2) formed a groundwater recharge boundary; 4) The regional faults in the same mountains (Fig. 5. 1; Fig. 5. 2) formed structural boundar as well as hydrogeologic boundary which controlled flow direction of the groundwater; 5) the hydrogeologic conceptual model showed the existence of the forested weathered bedrock in the upland areas of the entire catchment which formed no-flow boundary and groundwater divide thereby controlling the water flow direction downwards (Fig. 5. 9); 6) The major agricultural commercial activities existed in Lower Limphasa catchment while only subsistence farming existed in Upper Limphasa catchment. This knowledge and visualization from the map (Fig. 5. 3) and conceptual model (Fig. 5. 9) showed interactions between upland and lowland areas and the role of physical factors in controlling groundwater flow direction in the catchment. It also provided the enlightenment on implications of socioeconomic farming activities on water management. These insights enabled this study to recommend the need for expedited implementation of holistic effective management for sustainable water utilization. Using different physical factors, water scarcity indices and methodologies, this study showed that Malawi is a physically water stressed as well as an economic water scarce country. This novelty is against some literature that present Malawi as a water abundant country. Again, despite the high proportion (85 %) of Malawians relying on groundwater resource, groundwater availability (storage in km 3) is relatively low (269 km 3 in Table 6. 10) compared to other countries within SADC and Africa. Given the complexity of groundwater abstraction, the available groundwater for use is further reduced for Malawians who depend on such a resource for their domestic and productive livelihoods. Such insights provided the basis for discussing the need for IWRM. Although daily statistics on groundwater demand (i: 21. 20 litres; 116. 91 litres; 80, 550. 99 litres), use (ii: 16. 8 litres; 92. 55 litres; 63, 766. 95 litres) and abstracted but not used (iii: 4. 4; 24. 36; 16, 784. 04 litres) were relatively low per person, per household and per sub-catchment respectively, such statistics when calculated on monthly basis (i. Demand: 636 litres; 3, 507. 30 litres; 2, 416, 529. 70 litres; ii. Use: 504 litres; 2, 776. 5 litres; 1, 913, 008. 5 litres iii. Abstracted but not used: 132 litres; 730 litres; 503, 521. 2); and on yearly basis (i. Demand: 7, 632 litres; 42, 087. 6 litres; 28, 998, 356. 4 litres; ii. Use: 6, 048 litres; 33, 318 litres; 22, 956, 102 litres; iii: Abstracted but not used: 1, 584 litres; 8, 769. 6 litres; 6, 042, 254. 4 litres) per person, per household and per sub-catchment provided huge amount of groundwater (Table 6. 5). Given the limited storage capacity of fractured rock aquifer in the basement complex geology, the monthly and yearly groundwater demand and use on one hand and abstracted but not used on the other was considered enormous. With the population growth rate of 2. 8 for Nkhata Bay (NSO, 2009) and the observed desire to intensify productive livelihoods activities coupled with expected negative effects of climate change, the need to implement IWRM approach for such groundwater resource in the study catchment remains imperative and is urgently needed. In addition to identifying and describing factors that explain the limited groundwater availability in the study catchment, the study developed a methodology for calculating groundwater demand, use and unused at both households and sub-catchment levels. This methodology provided step-by-step procedure for collecting data on groundwater demand and use as a tool that would improve availability of data on groundwater. Implications of such results for IWRM in similar environments were discussed. Despite the time-consuming procedure involved in using the developed methodology, the calculations are simple and interpretation of results is easily understood among various stakeholders. Hence, such an approach is recommended for the IWRM approach which requires stakeholders from various disciplines to interact and collaborate. Nonetheless, this recommends the use of this method as its further refinement is being sought. The analysis on groundwater quality has shown that the dominant water type in the aquifers of Upper Limphasa catchment was Ca-HCO 3, suggesting that the study area had shallow, fresh groundwater with recent recharged aquifer. Analyses on physicochemical parameters revealed that none of the sampled boreholes (BHs) and protected shallow dug wells (PSWs) had physical or chemical concentration levels of health concern when such levels were compared with 2008 -World Health Organisation(WHO) guidelines and 2005 -Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS). Conversely, although the compliance with 2008 -WHO and 2005 -MBS of pathogenic bacteria (E. coli) in BHs water was 100 % suggesting that water from BHs had low risk and free from bacteriological contamination, water from PSWs showed 0 % compliance with 2008 -WHO and 2005 -MBS values implying high risk to human health. The overall assessment on risk to health classification showed that PSWs were risky sources to supply potable water, hence the need to implement strategies that protect groundwater. On the basis of such findings, the analysis in this study demonstrated the feasibility of using IWRM approach as a platform for implementing environmental and engineering interventions through education programmes to create and raise public awareness on groundwater protection and on the need for collaborative efforts to implement protective measures for their drinking water sources. The use of different analytical methods which were applied to identify the exact sources of the observed contaminants in the PSWs proved futile. Therefore, this study concluded that rolling-out PSWs either as improved or safe sources of drinking water requires further detailed investigations. However, this research recommended using rapid assessment of drinking water-quality (RADWQ) methods for assessing the quality of groundwater sources for drinking. Despite the study area being in the humid climatic region with annual rainfall above 1, 000 mm, many of the physical factors were not favourable for availability of more groundwater in the aquifers. Such observation provided compelling evidence in this study to commend the local IWRM as a proxy for the full IWRM implementation for sustainable utilization of such waters. Although institutional arrangements, water laws and water policy were found problematic to facilitate a successful implementation of full IWRM at national level in Malawi, this thesis demonstrated that local institutional arrangements, coordination among institutions, data collection efforts by local community members (active participation), self-regulation among local community committees were favourable conditions for a successful local IWRM in the Upper Limphasa River catchment. This research recommends continuation of such local participation, investment and initiatives as proxy for the full and successful IWRM beyond the study catchment. However, the observed lack of financial resource from central government to facilitates local IWRM activities were seen as counterproductive. In addition, this thesis recommended further studies which should aim at improving some observed <b>negative</b> implications of <b>self-regulations</b> on community members and the limited decentralisation elements from the Department of Water Development. Finally, one of the contributions from {{this study is the}} scientific value in using different methods to assess the quality of groundwater as presented in chapter 7. The second value is the demonstration of applying practical techniques to evaluate factors that explain the amount of groundwater storage in the aquifers that can be understood by water scientists, water users, water developers and water managers to implement IWRM collaboratively using groundwater as a showcase. The third contribution is the provision of the procedure to systematically generate data on demand (abstraction) and use of groundwater in unmetered rural areas which has the potential to guide water allocation process in the catchment. Fourthly, the thesis has provided a hydrogeologic conceptual model for the first time for Limphasa River catchment to be used as a visual tool for planning and developing management practices and addressing current water problems. Fifthly, the study has shown how local IWRM works at community level as a proxy for the full implementation of IWRM despite the absence of Catchment Management Agencies. The last contribution is the dissemination of results from this study made through publications and conference presentations as outlined in the appendix...|$|R
