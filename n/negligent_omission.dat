40|$|To answer whether moral {{responsibility}} {{is compatible with}} determinism, two different methods for justifying compatibilist conditions of responsibility have emerged in recent literature. First-person approaches, such as Hilary Bok 2 ̆ 7 s, appeal to the first-person experience of human agency to justify our practices of holding agents responsible. In contrast, T. M. Scanlon and Jay Wallace, following P. F. Strawson, begin with {{an account of the}} interpersonal significance of holding each other responsible in order to discern the conditions under which it is appropriate to assign that significance to an agent 2 ̆ 7 s actions. In this dissertation, I evaluate these different methodologies, and I examine the details of each view in order to find a proper understanding of the conditions of responsibility and of the significance of responsibility judgments within our interpersonal lives. ^ I argue that the backward-looking significance we attach to responsibility judgments, including those of blame and praise, can be captured only by an interpersonal approach. Specifically, I argue that the significance of responsibility is not found in the negative consequences (such as punishment) or emotions (such as resentment) that we associate with holding agents responsible. Rather, ascribing to an agent the status of being responsible is a form a deep respect, which has practical implications. I argue that our intuitions concerning victims of severely deprived childhoods are best accounted for if we recognize that ascription as a form of respect and we separate the question of whether an agent is responsible from considerations of appropriate punishments. ^ With regard to the conditions of responsibility, I argue that practical reasoners should be considered responsible not only for their choices, but also for <b>negligent</b> <b>omissions,</b> moral beliefs, and certain emotional reactions, even if such phenomena are not based on their choices. In addition, I argue that compatibilists do not need to add the capacity to grasp distinctly moral reasons to the requirements of responsible agency because that capacity is entailed by the basic capacity to reason practically. I examine the psychological literature on psychopaths—agents who supposedly are practical reasoners without moral understanding—to counter an objection to my view. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} health {{professionals}} facing criminal charges of manslaughter or criminal negligence causing death or {{grievous bodily harm}} {{as a result of}} alleged negligence in their professional practice was thrown into stark relief by the recent acquittal of four physicians accused of mismanaging Canada’s blood system in the early 1980 s. Stories like these, as well as international reports detailing an increase in the numbers of physicians being charged with (and in some cases convicted of) serious criminal offences as the result of alleged negligence in their professional practice, have resulted in some anxiety about the apparent increase in the incidence of such charges and their appropriateness in the healthcare context. Whilst research has focused on the incidence, nature and appropriateness of criminal charges against health professionals, particularly physicians, for alleged negligence in their professional practice in the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and New Zealand, the Canadian context has yet to be examined. This article examines the Canadian context and how the criminal law is used to regulate the <b>negligent</b> acts or <b>omissions</b> of a health care professional {{in the course of their}} professional practice. It also assesses the appropriateness of such use. It is important at this point to state that the analysis in this article does not focus on those, fortunately few, cases where a health professional has intentionally killed his or her patients but rather when patients’ deaths or grievous injuries were allegedly as a result of that health professional’s <b>negligent</b> acts or <b>omissions</b> when providing health services to that patient...|$|R

The FTCA, with few exceptions, provides the exclusive means by which individuals can seek compensation when injured by federal employees acting within the scope of their work for the federal government; in effect, the FTCA largely immunizes federal government employees from tort liability, including medical malpractice. In 1993, medical malpractice coverage under FTCA was first extended to grantees of the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Health Center Program. The centers funded by this program, referred to in this report as Health Centers, are designed to increase access to primary care for medically underserved populations. While FTCA coverage is available to the approximately 1, 100 Health Centers and their employees nationwide, it does not extend to health care providers who volunteer services at the 78 Health Centers currently using volunteers.

40|$|Section 9 - 11 - 9. 1 of the Georgia Code {{might be}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s most notorious {{procedural}} statute. Enacted in 1987 to protect professionals against the harm done by groundless malpractice litigation, the statute provides that a professional malpractice claim ordinarily {{must be accompanied by}} an affidavit executed by an expert. In the affidavit, the expert must substantiate the claim by attesting that some act or omission alleged in the claim was a <b>negligent</b> act or <b>omission</b> [...] a departure from a professional standard of conduct. During the past decade, Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s appellate courts have returned again and again to the problem of what section 9 - 11 - 9. 1 means, generating scores of decisions on who qualifies as a professional, what constitutes malpractice, who may serve as an expert, what counts as an adequate affidavit, what must be done to claim the benefit of the statute 2 ̆ 7 s grace period, and what happens when a party fails {{in one way or another}} to satisfy the affidavit requirement. The judicial preoccupation with section 9 - 11 - 9. 1 has yielded a complex and in some respects counterintuitive body of procedural doctrine that must be mastered by anyone who brings, defends, or judges a professional malpractice claim in the state. This Article offers a tenth anniversary critique of section 9 - 11 - 9. 1, of the case law that hs grown up around it, and of the 1997 legislation that revises it.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Laws (LLM) Workplace-related death, {{injuries}} and illness remain {{a major concern}} for Australian society in the 21 st century. This thesis addresses {{one aspect of the}} prevention of avoidable risks to occupational health and safety - the issue of how a company officer, whether a board member or other manager, may be held personally accountable for the consequences of such risks. Research shows that the potential for such personal liability is a major factor which focusses the attention of company officers on the need for due diligence in implementing safety systems. This thesis explores the limits of the legal liability of officers, both for awards of damages under civil law, and for criminal penalties. The thesis aims, as a legal doctrinal study, to demonstrate that the existing common law and statutory personal liability of company officers is already much wider than is commonly assumed. It suggests that this liability may be relied on to further the goals of effective compensation for, and prevention of, workplace accidents. It demonstrates that a company officer is not always protected by the “corporate veil” from the consequences of <b>negligent</b> actions or <b>omissions</b> which lead to death or injury of workers. A duty of care will often exist between the individual officer and workers whose safety is put at risk by a company culture which ignores or downplays safety issues. Breach of this duty may result in a substantial award of damages against the officer personally. The criminal law may also be invoked against a company officer. Where a death is involved a company may be found guilty of manslaughter. An officer may also be convicted of manslaughter, either through their own actions or omissions, or through their complicity with the company. While cases where these options will apply are rare, company officers are already subject, under specific workplace safety statutes such as the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2000 (NSW), to personal criminal liability if the company commits an offence. The operation and interpretation of deeming provisions in this and similar statutes in other States is explored, through an analysis of a number of decided cases, and suggestions made to improve the effectiveness of the provisions. In particular it is recommended that these and the more general criminal provisions be used more often, in appropriate cases, to target board members of larger corporations. As recent amendments to NSW legislation confirm, a systems-based approach to the improvement of workplace safety holds out the best hope for workplace risks to be effectively dealt with. In many cases death or injury flows from a systemic management failure rather than simply from the careless action of an individual manager. Ensuring that board members are aware of their potential liability, even when they are not directly involved in the workplace, will hopefully lead to more attention being paid at higher levels to improving the culture of workplace safety in a company. Many companies already have proper workplace safety procedures in place. But for those which continue to put profit above the life and safety of workers, increased awareness of the personal liability of officers will remind managers of the need to pay due attention to these issues...|$|R
