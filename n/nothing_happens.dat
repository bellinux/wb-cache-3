They announce that the Star Trek series has been cancelled. Captain Kirk orders the crew to fire their hand phasers at the aliens but <b>nothing</b> <b>happens.</b> Mr. Spock assumes that the aliens have a type of weapons de-activator and tries to employ his famous Vulcan nerve pinch on him, but that does not work either. The executive confiscates Mr. Spock's pointed ears. Spock then mind-melds with Goodman only to discover that, as he describes it, his brain is devoid of substance and contains only a few rodents.|$|E
5|$|Blomkvist {{breaks into}} Martin's house {{to look for}} more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV. He loses control of his vehicle on an icy road and dies when it catches fire. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health and tells him that she tried to kill her father when she was 12. Blomkvist deduces that Harriet is still alive and her cousin Anita (Joely Richardson) {{probably}} knows where she is. He and Salander monitor Anita, {{waiting for her to}} contact Harriet. When <b>nothing</b> <b>happens,</b> Blomkvist confronts her, deducing that the woman posing as Anita is Harriet herself. She explains that her father and brother had sexually abused her for years, and that Martin saw her kill their father in self-defense. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her out of the island and let her live under her identity. Finally free of her brother, she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} commentators, although David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street: The Unofficial Companion, said mainstream television audiences were [...] "somewhat {{turned off by}} the minimalist approach". USA Today writer Matt Roush gave the episode four out of four stars, comparing it to David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross and calling it [...] "minimalist drama (with) maximum impact". Roush wrote, [...] "Imagine a crime show during which no crime occurs. Next to <b>nothing</b> <b>happens.</b> Yet every second counts." [...] Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave it four out of four stars. He wrote, [...] "If Life on the Street winds up dead after tonight's episode [...] the victim of low Nielsen ratings [...] at least the nine superb actors in the squad will know they made a grand exit." ...|$|E
500|$|When the dikes in Grand Forks {{could not}} keep out the {{flooding}} river, Pat Owens ordered the evacuation of over 50,000 people on April 18, which up to that time, had been the largest civilian evacuation in the United States since the evacuation of residents in Atlanta, Georgia, during the Civil War. She later reflected on the decision saying, [...] "...if I evacuate this city and <b>nothing</b> <b>happens</b> they're gonna impeach me. But if I don't, we're going to lose lives." [...] Because all transportation was cut off between the two cities (and for many miles, the two states), East Grand Forks residents were evacuated to nearby Crookston, namely to the University of Minnesota Crookston, while residents of Grand Forks, who were given mandatory evacuation orders on April 18, went to Grand Forks Air Force Base (residents stayed in airplane hangars containing more than 3,000 cots).|$|E

I can make a landscape like Mr. Paul Cézanne, I learned how... by walking through the Luxembourg Museum a thousand times." [...] Hemingway wanted the structure of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] to resemble a Cézanne—with a detailed foreground set against a vaguely described background. In a letter to Stein from August 1924, he wrote, [...] "I have finished two long stories... and finished the long one I worked on before I went to Spain where I am doing the country like Cézanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit.

500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} an A-, while Television Without Pity {{gave it a}} C+. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named it the fourth best episode of the series, {{explaining}} [...] "The late season lark that officially launched a tradition for similar stunts, the musical film noir homage 'Brown Betty'... was an offbeat gem that expressed all of Fringes core themes — redemption, connection, rehumanization — and encapsulated the key relationships (the slow-moving Walter-Peter reconciliation; Peter and Olivia's carefully tended soul-deep romance) more poignantly than most on-point episodes of Fringe, and it left fans wanting the show to keep pushing the innovation. It could never do it enough." [...] In a similar list, Den of Geek named it the ninth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "it shouldn’t work, and yet it does, because although technically <b>nothing</b> <b>happens,</b> the episode shows us just how deep Walter has sunk into a metaphorical pit of despair and guilt, making himself the villain in his own story and despairing of ever being forgiven. It also gives the audience a refreshing break {{from some of the}} high level angst {{of the end of the}} season, allowing Peter and Olivia to act out a properly romantic storyline while their characters in the ‘real’ world have been torn apart. Also, there are singing corpses in it. Only on Fringe." ...|$|E

Susan is brought to Ramsay Street, but <b>nothing</b> <b>happens.</b> Woodburne stated that Susan hates her hair and her clothes and wants to change everything. Karl takes her to Lyn Scully's salon and manages to persuade her to have her hair styled rather than cut short. While she is at the salon, Susan remembers her high school sweetheart, Craig Benson (Tim Hughes), and decides to find him. [...] Woodburne told Herbison [...] "As far as she's concerned, Craig is her boyfriend and they're in love. So she looks {{him up in the}} phone book and sets off to find him." [...] Woodburne added that there was a danger the storyline could cross a line and become silly, but the crew tried to portray the fear a person would feel when everything is suddenly unfamiliar. Susan falls in love with Karl and her memories return during their vow renewal service. During a 2012 interview, Woodburne told a What's on TV reporter that she and the writers initially joked about the storyline, but they found some truth in it. She explained [...] "It was actually based on a story of a woman who lived in England. The same thing happened to her. She fell over in a supermarket. Between leaving the supermarket and getting home, she'd lost 30 years. I don't think she recovered. She had a husband and grown-up children and she had no idea who they were.

What's more, {{since the second}} act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which <b>nothing</b> <b>happens,</b> twice.". Mercier once questioned Beckett on the language used by the pair: [...] "It seemed to me...he made Didi and Gogo sound {{as if they had}} earned PhDs. 'How do you know they hadn't?' was his reply." [...] They clearly have known better times, a visit to the Eiffel Tower and grape-harvesting by the Rhône; it is about all either has to say about their pasts, save for Estragon's claim to have been a poet, an explanation Estragon provides to Vladimir for his destitution. In the first stage production, which Beckett oversaw, both are [...] "more shabby-genteel than ragged...Vladimir at least is capable of being scandalised...on a matter of etiquette when Estragon begs for chicken bones or money." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beckett is {{most famous}} for his play En {{attendant}} Godot (1953) (Waiting for Godot). In a much-quoted article, the critic Vivian Mercier wrote that Beckett [...] "has achieved a theoretical impossibility—a play in which <b>nothing</b> <b>happens,</b> that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, since the second act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which <b>nothing</b> <b>happens,</b> twice." [...] Like most of his works after 1947, the play was first written in French with the title En attendant Godot. Beckett worked on the play between October 1948 and January 1949. He published it in 1952 and it premièred in 1953; an English translation appeared two years later. Directed by Roger Blin, the play was a critical, popular, and controversial success in Paris. It opened in London in 1955 to mainly negative reviews, but the tide turned with positive reactions from Harold Hobson in The Sunday Times and, later, Kenneth Tynan. In the United States, it flopped in Miami and had a qualified success in New York City. After this, the play became extremely popular, with highly successful performances in the US and Germany. It is frequently performed today.|$|E
