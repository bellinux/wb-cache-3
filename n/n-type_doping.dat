The formation of the layer is promoted only when phosphorous atoms {{are present in the}} film. The deposition of a very thin <b>n-type</b> <b>doped</b> layer (around 5 nm) on top of a p-type doped film has allowed us to achieve the chromium silicide formation also on p-type material without changing its doping properties. Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the presence of chromium-oxide, chromium silicide and metallic chromium in similar percentages for both p- and <b>n-type</b> <b>doped</b> layers: From the ellipsometric analysis, the refractive index spectra have been extracted, and the layer thickness has been estimated to be 5 nm for both p- and <b>n-type</b> <b>doped</b> layers.

50|$|Inducing <b>n-type</b> <b>doping</b> within silicene {{requires}} an alkali metal dopant. Varying the amount adjusts the band gap. Maximum doping increases the band gap 0.5eV.

Alkali metal-doped silicene can only produce n-type semiconductors; modern day electronics require a complementary n-type and p-type junction. Neutral doping (i-type) is required to produce devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs use a p-i-n junction to produce light. A separate dopant must be introduced to generate p-type doped silicene. Iridium (Ir) doped silicene allows p-type silicene to be created. Through platinum (Pt) doping, i-type silicene is possible. With the combination of n-type, p-type and i-type doped structures, silicene has opportunities for use in electronics.|$|E

50|$|In a {{conventional}} solar cell, light is absorbed by a semiconductor, producing an electron-hole (e-h) pair; the pair may be bound and {{is referred to}} as an exciton. This pair is separated by an internal electric field (present in p-n junctions or Schottky diodes) and the resulting flow of electrons and holes creates electric current. The internal electric field is created by doping one part of semiconductor interface with atoms that act as electron donors (<b>n-type</b> <b>doping)</b> and another with electron acceptors (p-type doping) that results in a p-n junction. Generation of an e-h pair requires that the photons have energy exceeding the bandgap of the material. Effectively, photons with energies lower than the bandgap do not get absorbed, while those that are higher can quickly (within about 10−13 s) thermalize to the band edges, reducing output. The former limitation reduces current, while the thermalization reduces the voltage. As a result, semiconductor cells suffer a trade-off between voltage and current (which can be in part alleviated by using multiple junction implementations). The detailed balance calculation shows that this efficiency can not exceed 31% if one uses a single material for a solar cell.|$|E

The density of electron donors determines the charge state of dioxygen, either in superoxo and peroxo, which exactly correlates with the 'end-on' and 'side-on' configurations, respectively.
