In late November that year Hammond was summoned to Farnham, where he was arrested and the King was removed under military escort to the mainland. On 20 December the King and his escort entered Farnham, where groups of men, women and children gathered at the roadside to welcome him and touch his hand. That night the King lodged at Culver Hall (now Vernon House) in West Street before the party continued to London for Charles's trial and execution in January 1649. The King gave his <b>night</b> <b>cap</b> to Henry Vernon, owner of Culver Hall, [...] "as a token of Royal favour". Records show that the following period of interregnum until restoration of the monarchy in 1660 was a time of prosperity and growth for Farnham. In 1660 the bishops of Winchester were restored to the adjoining Bishops Palace, which remained their residence until 1927. From 1927 until 1955 it was a residence of the bishops of the newly created diocese of Guildford. The castle is currently owned by English Heritage.|$|E

The band became {{regionally}} popular on the teen club circuit in Northern California, and released two singles on Amber Records that were composed of self-penned material by saxophonist Barry Carlos. After seven years of being billed as the <b>Night</b> <b>Caps,</b> the group decided during a rehearsal to change the name to better cater to the changing musical tastes of the pop culture. Carlos recalled how the band {{came up with the}} new moniker, saying, [...] "'How about something {{that has to do with}} money, like dough or bread.' Bob Fox instantaneously blurted out with, 'How about Peter Wheat and The Breadmen?' (For those who don't know, Peter Wheat was a bread company that delivered bread to your home in brightly painted trucks)".|$|R

For six months, the group performed regionally while outfitted with bakers aprons. After achieving a considerable following, the group disbanded, and Carlos formed BLP Productions to promote the next band that would carry on the Peter Wheat and the Breadmen name. Carlos discovered Fremont quintet the Tarantels, whose lineup consisted of Roger Kennedy (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Barry Houk (lead guitar), Bob Birdwell (bass guitar), Terry Reisman (drummer), and Chuck Tedford (keyboards), gigging at the San Leandro Rollerina in support of the Turtles. Carlos explains his decision to choose the Tarantels, saying, [...] "they were not afraid to test their creativity by exploring innovative chord changes on new original material or embark on complicated arrangements of cover tunes that I arranged for them". Although initially the Tarantels assumed the Peter and the Breadmen identity almost exactly, upon the band's insistence, they dropped the apron gimmick in favor of their own style.|$|R

They marched merrily {{to the music of}} their voyageur songs as they perceived our scarlet uniform as we came up, they set up the Indian War-Whoop, followed by a shout of Vive le Roi along the whole line.
