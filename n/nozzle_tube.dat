This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes, avoiding the use of wooden centering altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E

30|$|In 1993, Swedish {{scientists}} Stemme et al [1], {{published the}} paper entitled “A valveless diffuse/nozzle-based fluid pump”. It marked {{the birth of}} the first non-rotary pump without any movable valve body driven by piezo-vibrators, which is invented based on the dynamic passive valve presented by Smith [2]. The proposed pump consists of a diffuser, a nozzle and a piezoelectric vibrator, where the diffuser and the nozzle are mounted below the pump chamber as inlet and outlet of pump, and the piezoelectric vibrators are used as driving source to generate reciprocating change of volume in pump chamber. Along flow direction, the tube whose cross-section broadens is defined as the diffuser tube, while the one whose cross-section tapers off is defined as the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tube.</b> The two aforementioned flow tubes are collectively named cone-shaped tubes by their shape. Hence, the valveless piezoelectric pump encompassing these tubes is known as valveless piezoelectric pump with cone-shaped tubes.|$|E

40|$|The European Ariane 5 {{launcher}} {{is powered}} by two solid boosters and a cryogenic liquid core engine. A full analysis of the thermo-mechanical loading of the <b>nozzle</b> extension <b>tubes</b> of this engine has to model the production, the welding and the cyclic loading of the tubes during the hot run.

Therefore, the welding of the <b>nozzle</b> extension <b>tubes</b> was modeled by a general purpose Finite Element code (ANSYS).

40|$|An {{array of}} three {{identical}} premixed butane-air-fired impinging circular flames with induced-swirl operating at low-pressure and low-Reynolds-number was developed. A swirling motion was imparted successfully to the flame by forcing the butane/air mixture through {{a specially designed}} burner assembly before ignition. The burner assembly consisting of a conical base and a <b>nozzle</b> <b>tube</b> into which a cylindrical bar fabricated with three spiral channels was inserted. Its thermal performance was {{compared with that of}} a similar impinging flame jet system without induced-swirl. Effects of varying the Reynolds number and the equivalence ratio of the butane/air mixture and the nozzle-to-plate distance on the thermal performance of each of these two impinging flame jet systems were studied. Experiments were conducted with different combinations of Reynolds number, equivalence ratio and nozzle-to-plate distance. In the present investigation, the Reynolds number ranged from 500 to 2500, the equivalence ratio ranged from 1. 0 to 1. 8 and the nozzle-to-plate distance ranged from 20 mm to 30 mm. To facilitate comparison, flame shapes of both impinging flame jet systems were also visualized by a high speed digital camera system. The comparison showed that the array of three small-scale, low-pressure and low-Reynolds-number premixed butane-air-fired impinging circular flame jets could enhance its thermal performance, with respect to heat transfer characteristics and blow-out limits, by incorporating an induced-swirl. The performance enhancement increased with increasing Reynolds number or equivalence ratio, but decreased with increasing nozzle-to-plate distance. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Numerous lessons {{have been}} {{documented}} from the Space Shuttle Propulsion elements. Major events include loss of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB's) on STS- 4 and shutdown of a Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) during ascent on STS- 51 F. On STS- 112 only half the pyrotechnics fired during release of the vehicle from the launch pad, a testament for redundancy. STS- 91 exhibited freezing of a main combustion chamber pressure measurement and on STS- 93 <b>nozzle</b> <b>tube</b> ruptures necessitated a low liquid level oxygen cut off of the main engines. A number of on pad aborts were experienced during the early program resulting in delays. And the two accidents, STS- 51 L and STS- 107, had unique heritage in history from early program decisions and vehicle configuration. Following STS- 51 L significant resources were invested in developing fundamental physical understanding of solid rocket motor environments and material system behavior. And following STS- 107, the risk of ascent debris was better characterized and controlled. Situational awareness during all mission phases improved, and the management team instituted effective risk assessment practices. The last 22 flights of the Space Shuttle, following the Columbia accident, were characterized by remarkable improvement in safety and reliability. Numerous problems were solved in addition to reduction of the ascent debris hazard. The Shuttle system, though not as operable as envisioned in the 1970 's, successfully assembled the International Space Station (ISS). By {{the end of the}} program, the remarkable Space Shuttle Propulsion system achieved very high performance, was largely reusable, exhibited high reliability, and was a heavy lift earth to orbit propulsion system. During the program a number of project management and engineering processes were implemented and improved. Technical performance, schedule accountability, cost control, and risk management were effectively managed and implemented. Award fee contracting was implemented to provide performance incentives. The Certification of Flight Readiness and Mission Management processes became very effective. A key {{to the success of the}} propulsion element projects was related to relationships between the MSFC project office and support organizations with their counterpart contractor organizations.

40|$|STS- 93 was {{launched}} on July 23, 1999. There was an anomaly {{at the end}} of the launch in that the main engines shut down 0. 16 second early because sensors detected a low level of oxidizer in the LOX tank (actually the duct from the tank to the vehicle). This resulted in a cutoff velocity for the vehicle that was 16 ft/sec low. It should have been 25872 ft/sec. The OMS engines were subsequently used to achieve the proper orbit. An investigation was immediately initiated into the cause of this LOX tank low level cutoff. It was noticed during the launch that the turbine temperatures for Main Engine 3 (E 2019) were approximately 100 F higher than the preflight prediction. Linear Engine Model matching of the data indicated that a nozzle leak best fit the data. Post launch review of the data showed, that at approximately five seconds into the start, numerous parameters indicated small anomalous shifts. These shifts were all consistent with a rupture of <b>nozzle</b> <b>tubes.</b> Post launch review of the films showed that just after Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) ignition and just prior to liftoff a streak is seen in the exhaust plume of E 2019. Just after liftoff the streak can be seen emanating from the nozzle wall. This photo confirmed that a leak was coming from the <b>nozzle</b> <b>tubes.</b> Based on the photo, the axial location of the leak was estimated to be 28 in. from the aft end of the nozzle and in line with nozzle coolant feed line # 1.
