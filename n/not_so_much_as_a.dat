25|$|In forming {{their view}} of Attila's people, the Romans tapped into attitudes {{inherited}} from the Greeks. These were the vilest creatures imaginable. They came from the North and everyone knew that the colder the climate was, the more barbaric the people were. They knew nothing of metal, had no religion and lived like savages, without fire, eating their food raw, living off roots, and meat tenderized by placing it under their horses' saddles. They had no buildings, of course, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reed hut, indeed, they feared {{the very idea of}} venturing under a roof.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} and social assumptions underlying the early Robin Hood ballads have long been controversial. It has been influentially argued by J. C. Holt that the Robin Hood legend was cultivated in the households of the gentry, {{and that it would}} be mistaken to see in him a figure of peasant revolt. He is not a peasant but a yeoman, and his tales make no mention of the complaints of the peasants, such as oppressive taxes. He appears <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes. Other scholars have by contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a plebeian literature hostile to the feudal order.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} year, the social psychologist Gerhard Vinnai (University of Bremen), came to similar conclusions. When writing his work Hitler – Scheitern und Vernichtungswut (2004; “Hitler – Failing and rage of destruction”), Vinnai had a psychoanalytic point of depart; he first subjected Hitler’s book Mein Kampf a depth psychological interpretation {{and tried to}} reconstruct how Hitler had processed his experiences in World War I {{against the background of}} his childhood and youth. But similar to Dorpat, Vinnai explains the destructive potential in Hitler's psyche <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of early childhood experiences, but rather due to trauma that Hitler had suffered as a soldier in World War I. Not only Hitler, but a substantial part of the German population was affected by such war trauma. Vinnai then leaves the psychoanalytical discourse and comments on social psychological questions, such as how Hitler’s political world view could have emerged from his trauma and how this could appeal to large numbers of people.|$|E

500|$|John Cleland {{was one of}} {{the first}} reviewers of the novel, and in the December 1751 Monthly Review, claimed the work as [...] "the boldest stroke that has yet been {{attempted}} in this species of writing" [...] and that Fielding [...] "takes up his heroine at the very point at which all his predecessors have dropped their capital personages." [...] However, he also stated that parts of the novel [...] "stand in need of an apology." [...] A review in the London Magazine in the same month claimed that there were too many anachronisms. This piece was also the first to mention Amelia's nose, and on it the writer claims that Fielding [...] "should have taken care to have had Amelia's nose so compleatly cured, and set to rights, after it being beat all to pieces, by the help of some eminent surgeon, that <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scar remained." [...] John Hill soon attacked Amelia in the London Daily Advertiser on 8 January 1752 where he claimed that the book's title character [...] "could charm the World without the Help of a Nose." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase {{can be in the}} right context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, I still think that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E

2500|$|The {{critical}} line {{of questioning}} was conducted by Donald Sanders. Armstrong had given a copy of Buzhardt's report to Butterfield; now Sanders asked if the quotations in it might have come from notes. Butterfield said no, that the quotations were too detailed. In addition, Butterfield said that neither staff nor the president kept notes of one-on-one private meetings with Nixon. When asked where the quotations might have come from, Butterfield {{said he did not}} know. Then Sanders asked if there was any validity to John Dean's hypothesis that the White House had taped conversations in the Oval Office. Butterfield replied, [...] "I was wondering if someone would ask that. There is tape in the Oval Office." [...] Butterfield then told the investigators that, while he had hoped that no one would ask about the taping system, he had previously decided he would disclose its existence if asked a direct question. Butterfield then testified extensively about when the taping system was installed and how it worked, and told the staff members, [...] "Everything was taped ... as long as the President was in attendance. There was <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hint that something should not be taped." [...] Butterfield later said that he assumed the committee knew about the taping system, since they had already interviewed Haldeman and Higby.|$|E

2500|$|Another of Caird's lifelong preoccupations was Paul the Apostle, seen {{particularly}} in his works Principalities and Powers, Paul's Letters from Prison, and comments scattered throughout The Language and Imagery of the Bible and New Testament Theology. For Caird Paul {{has not been}} given his proper due by modern scholarly opinion {{in terms of the}} uniqueness and importance of his contribution to Christianity. As a dyed-in-the-wool Cambridge-trained classicist, Caird saw Paul <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conveyor of supernatural information but as a brilliantly innovative thinker, a skillful interpreter of the scriptures and of the mind of Jesus, or [...] "humanity at its very best". Paul was also a revolutionary, as Caird saw him: one who was fervently committed to the socially convulsive implications of the gospel, especially in such concerns as class divisions within society (including the equality of women), the constant corruption of political and religious authority, and the unity of the Christian church as a rebuke to a warring and fractured world. In all his works Caird never shrank from making clear his unqualified admiration for what he saw as the frequently misunderstood apostle; yet this could hardly be mistaken for hero worship. He could disagree with Paul at times, and [...] "if he had ever seen [...] approaching in the High Street, he wouldn't have treated him with exaggerated deference, nor would he have crossed the street to avoid him. He would probably have invited him to read a paper to his Postgraduate Seminar, and would have felt no embarrassment at taking him into the Senior Common Room for tea beforehand". In certain ways Caird contributed to the debate concerning the New Perspective on Paul, seen perhaps most visibly in an extended review of E. P. Sanders's work Paul and Palestinian Judaism.|$|E
