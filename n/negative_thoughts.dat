40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the hypothesis that work-ing memory deficits contribute to both <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> disorder and some components of formal thought disorder (discourse coherence and fluency deficits) in individuals with schizophrenia. We exam-ined the language produced by 44 patients with either schizophrenia or schizoaffectlve disorder during base-line and a dual-task condition designed to decrease working memory capacity. Results indicated that decreasing working memory capacity significantly increased <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> disorder, but not discourse coherence or fluency deficits. However, both <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> disorder and discourse coherence deficits were significantly correlated with working memory deficits. In addition, increases in <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> disorder and discourse coherence deficits in the dual-task condition were negatively correlated, consistent with the hypoth-esis that {{these two types of}} language deficits may reflect alternative manifestations of working memory deficits...|$|R

40|$|Career {{exploration}} {{and decision making}} can be a stressful experience, and is often accompanied by dysfunctional thinking regarding {{the world of work}} and one’s place in it. Individuals who are able to modify their <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> are more likely to navigate career exploration successfully. Factors which may influence a person’s ability to cope with dysfunctional thoughts include cognitive ability (IQ) and the inadequately explored construct of emotional intelligence (EI). Establishing the validity of EI by demonstrating its relationship to important outcomes is necessary. This study sought {{to determine the extent to}} which IQ and EI were associated with <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> and <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> change as a result of career exploration. This correlational study measured IQ using a standard measure and EI using an ability-based instrument. In addition, <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> were measured both before and after a career exploration program. One hundred ninety three unemployed adults between the ages of 25 and 60 participated in the study. Significant correlation relationships were found between IQ and aspects of <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> post program. Only one branch of the EI model, managing emotions, was seen to correlate significantly with all aspects of <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts,</b> both before and after career exploration. No correlations were found between either IQ or EI with <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> change. Regression analysis indicated that IQ predicted overall <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> as well as decision-making confusion, but only after career exploration. Overall EI scores did not predict <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts.</b> However, among the four branches of EI, managing emotions predicted <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> both before and after career exploration for all of global <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts,</b> decision-making confusion, commitment anxiety, and external conflict. Neither IQ nor EI predicted <b>negative</b> career <b>thoughts</b> change. The results show that the ability to manage emotions is associated with reduced dysfunctional thinking both before and after career exploration, suggesting that EI managing may be a psychological resource that individuals use in coping with stress.

40|$|Persistent <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> is a {{hallmark}} feature of both {{major depressive disorder}} and generalized anxiety disorder. Despite its clinical significance, {{little is known about}} the underlying mechanisms of persistent <b>negative</b> <b>thought.</b> Recent studies suggest that reduced cognitive control might be an explanatory factor. We investigated the association between persistent <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> and switching between internal representations in working memory, using the internal shift task (IST). The IST was administered to a group of undergraduates, classified as high-ruminators versus low-ruminators, or high-worriers versus low-worriers. Results showed that high-ruminators and high-worriers have more difficulties to switch between internal representations in working memory as opposed to low-ruminators and low-worriers. Importantly, results were only significant when the negative stimuli used in the IST reflected personally relevant worry themes for the participants. The results of this study indicate that rumination and worrying are both associated with reduced cognitive control for verbal information that is personally relevant. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Worry {{is a key}} {{component}} of anxiety and may be an effective target for therapeutic intervention. We compared two psychological processes (attention and acceptance) on the frequency of intrusive worrying thoughts in an experimental worry task. Method: 77 participants were randomised across three groups and completed either a 10 minute attention or acceptance-based psychological exercise, or progressive muscle relaxation control. We subsequently measured anxiety, and the content and frequency of intrusive thoughts before and after a ‘worry induction task’. Results: Groups did not differ in baseline worry, anxiety or thought intrusions. Both attention and acceptance-based groups experienced fewer <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> intrusions (post-worry) compared to the relaxation control group. The acceptance exercise had the largest effect, preventing ‘worry induction’. Increases in <b>negative</b> intrusive <b>thoughts</b> predicted subjective anxiety.

40|$|Adaptive {{behavior}} {{relies on}} the ability to effectively and efficiently ignore irrelevant information, an important component of attentional control. The current research found that fundamental difficulties in ignoring irrelevant material are related to dispositional differences in trait propensity to worry, suggesting a core deficit in attentional control in high worriers. The degree of deficit in attentional control correlated with the degree of difficulty in suppressing <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> intrusions in a worry assessment task. A cognitive training procedure utilizing a flanker task was used in an attempt to improve attentional control. Although the cognitive training was largely ineffective, improvements in attentional control were associated with improvements in the ability to suppress worry-related thought intrusions. Across two studies, the findings indicate that the inability to control worry-related <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> intrusions is associated with a general deficiency in attentional control...|$|R

Experiments have shown that targeted negative memories are recalled less vividly and with less emotion after treatments with EMDR. Skin conductance responses, a measure of stress and arousal, have also shown lower levels when negative memories treated with EMDR were brought to mind.|$|E
25|$|Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these {{strategies}} of regulating attachment anxiety {{have very different}} consequences. The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave {{in a particular way}} and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more <b>negative</b> <b>thoughts</b> and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways used to treat loneliness, social isolation, and clinical depression. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is therapy. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short term therapy, {{the most common form}} for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the <b>negative</b> <b>thoughts,</b> feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend group therapy as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system. Doctors also frequently prescribe anti-depressants to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found. Some patients may also develop a resistance to a certain type of medication and need to switch periodically.|$|E

40|$|Beck's {{cognitive}} model of depression proposes that depressogenic schemas {{have an effect}} on depressive symptoms by increasing the frequency of <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts</b> in response to negative life events.

Results supported the proposed moderated mediation model. Both psychological inflexibility and <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts</b> were significant mediators of the relationship between depressogenic schemas and depressive symptoms, and psychological inflexibility also moderated the effect of depressogenic schemas on <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts.</b> We conclude that the role of psychological inflexibility in the {{cognitive model}} of depression deserves more attention...|$|R

40|$|Insomnia is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} 24 hour complaint {{that is associated with}} an increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders. However, the effects of insomnia symptoms on maladaptive daytime patterns of thinking are poorly understood. We examined the relationship between subjective insomnia symptoms, attentional control and <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> intrusions during daytime in a large sample of undergraduates experiencing disturbed sleep. A total of 109 participants completed self-report measures of sleep quality, current sleepiness, anxiety and attentional control. A behavioural measure of intrusive thought required participants to control their attention during two focus periods separated by a five-minute period of self-referential worry. Thought intrusions were sampled throughout the pre- and post-worry periods. Perceived insomnia severity was associated with the reduced ability to focus attention and uniquely associated with increased <b>negative</b> <b>thought</b> intrusions in the pre-worry period. These results support suggestions that acute episodes of poor sleep can dysregulate key networks involved in attentional control and emotion regulation, and that promote negative cognitive activity...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{depression}} suggest that cognitive {{and environmental factors}} may explain the relationship between personality and depression. This study tested such a model in early adolescence, incorporating neuroticism, stress-generation and <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts</b> {{in the development of}} depressive symptoms. Participants (896 girls, mean age 12. 3 years) completed measures of personality and depressive symptoms, and 12 months later completed measures of depressive symptoms, recent stressors and <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts.</b> Path analysis supported a model in which neuroticism serves as a distal vulnerability for depression, conferring a risk of experiencing dependent negative events and <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts,</b> which fully mediate the effect of neuroticism on later depression.

40|$|Few {{studies have}} looked at the {{relationship}} between psychological and the mental health status of pregnant women in rural China. The current study aims to explore the potential mediating effect of <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts</b> between <b>negative</b> life events and antenatal depression. Data were collected in June 2012 and October 2012. 495 rural pregnant women were interviewed. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, stresses of pregnancy were measured by the pregnancy pressure scale, <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts</b> were measured by the automatic <b>thoughts</b> questionnaire, and <b>negative</b> life events were measured by the life events scale for pregnant women. We used logistic regression and path analysis to test the mediating effect. The prevalence of antenatal depression was 13. 7 %. In the logistic regression, the only socio-demographic and health behavior factor significantly related to antenatal depression was sleep quality. Negative life events were not associated with depression in the fully adjusted model. Path analysis showed that the eventual direct and general effects of <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts</b> were 0. 39 and 0. 51, which were larger than the effects of negative life events. This study suggested that there was a potentially significant mediating effect of <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts.</b> Pregnant women who had lower scores of <b>negative</b> automatic <b>thoughts</b> were more likely to suffer less from negative life events which might lead to antenatal depression...|$|R
