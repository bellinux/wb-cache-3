5|$|As a <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Senator, Owen campaigned {{actively}} {{on behalf}} of William Jennings Bryan {{in the presidential election}} of 1908; the two men were to remain political allies for many years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Newly</b> <b>elected</b> Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards {{issued an}} {{executive}} order to accept the expansion, becoming the 32nd state to do so. The program was expected to enroll an additional 300,000 Louisianans.|$|E
5|$|In March 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter {{met with}} Bukovsky at the White House. In the USSR {{the meeting was}} seen by dissidents and rights activists {{as a sign of}} the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> president's {{willingness}} to stress human rights in his foreign policy; the event provoked harsh criticism by Soviet leaders.|$|E
5|$|Later Sulien, now Bishop of St David's (he was bishop 1073–1078 and 1080–1086), himself {{took refuge}} at Llanbadarn Fawr from the Vikings who were raiding St David's. Many {{of the bishops}} were murdered by raiders and marauders, {{including}} Bishop Morgeneu I (also known as Morgenveth, Morgeney, Uregeneu) in 999 and Bishop Abraham (who had been <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> to succeed Sulien) in 1080.|$|E
5|$|Rokonok (2006) was a Hungarian {{production}} {{based on}} a 1932 novel by Zsigmond Móricz about political corruption. Sándor Csányi plays a <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> attorney general whose relatives (rokonok) {{come out of the}} woodwork looking for favors. It was entered into the 28th Moscow International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} Japan's {{mounting}} fiscal deficits, the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> government of Yukio Hatoyama formed the Government Revitalization Unit in 2009 {{to look for}} areas where the budget could be trimmed. The Unit recommended that the government cease purchasing and distributing foreign language periodicals like Japan Echo.|$|E
5|$|Bevin {{was sworn}} into a {{four-year}} term as Kentucky Governor on December 8, 2015. Observers {{from both parties}} praised Bevin's selection of experienced, relatively moderate individuals for his cabinet, including his former rival, Hal Heiner, as Secretary of the Education and Workforce Cabinet and former University of Kentucky football standout Derrick Ramsey as his Secretary of Labor. The appointments of two Democratic state representatives– John Tilley as Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a state judgeship– reduced the party's majority in the House and set up special elections that gave Republicans {{a chance to win}} their seats from Democrats. Bevin set the dates of the special elections to fill the seats of Tilley and Pullin, as well as those formerly held by <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Auditor Mike Harmon and <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, for March 8, 2016. Democratic representatives Denver Butler and Jim Gooch also switched their party affiliation to Republican in December, reducing the Democratic majority to 50–46 for the beginning of the first General Assembly of Bevin's governorship, and giving Republicans a chance to evenly split the chamber's 100 seats by sweeping the special elections. Republicans held only Harmon's seat, giving Democrats a 53–47 advantage in the House {{for the remainder of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|Clark campaigned heavily {{throughout}} the 2006 midterm election campaign, supporting numerous Democrats {{in a variety}} of federal, statewide, and state legislature campaigns. Ultimately his PAC aided 42 Democratic candidates who won their elections, including 25 who won seats formerly held by Republicans and 6 <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> veteran members of the House and Senate. Clark was the most-requested surrogate of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee {{throughout the}} 2006 campaign, and sometimes appeared with the leadership of the Democratic Party when they commented on security issues.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} Farmer left office, Comer {{announced}} that he had requested a full audit of the department by <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Democratic State Auditor Adam Edelen. Among the items Comer asked Edelen to investigate were 171 items of missing agriculture department property valued at about $334,000 and another 103 items worth about $146,000 that were supposed to be returned to the state as surplus but could not be accounted for. A week later, Farmer returned some of the missing items.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Muller {{travelled}} to South Africa, {{where he}} visited Cape Town, the Orange Free State, and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In Pretoria {{he attended the}} inauguration of President Kruger and in Bloemfontein he struck up a friendship with the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> President M.T. Steyn and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President F.W. Reitz, government secretary P.J. Blignaut, {{and chairman of the}} Volksraad C.H. Wessels. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Daniels {{earned a}} Bachelor's {{degree from the}} Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. While there, {{he was a member}} of the American Whig–Cliosophic Society, where he {{overlapped}} with future Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who was a year below. He initially studied law at the Indiana McKinney School of Law in Indianapolis. After accepting a job with <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Senator Richard Lugar, he transferred to the Georgetown University Law Center, from which he earned a Juris Doctor.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Jerry Weintraub's {{independent}} film company Weintraub Entertainment Group (WEG) obtained the film rights from Paramount. Oliver Stone, {{a fan of}} the musical, expressed interest in the film adaptation and contacted Stigwood's production company RSO Films to discuss the project. After he was confirmed as the film's writer and director in April 1988, Stone travelled to Argentina, where he visited Eva's birthplace and met with the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> President Carlos Menem, who agreed to provide 50,000 extras for the production as well as allowing freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, in {{an attempt}} to rectify this, the Ready Reserve scheme was established. Under this scheme the 6th Brigade, an {{existing}} Regular brigade based in Brisbane at the time, was converted to a Ready Reserve formation. The majority of the personnel were Reservists who undertook a period of twelve months full-time service before returning to normal Reserve status for a further four years. The scheme showed considerable promise. Nevertheless, due to cost constraints it was abolished in 1996 by the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Howard government.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, when Harriet Harman {{was moved}} by the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Labour Leader Tony Blair to become Shadow Secretary of State for Employment, Miliband stayed on in the Shadow Treasury team and was {{promoted}} to work for Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown. In 1995, with encouragement from Gordon Brown, Miliband took time out from his job to study at the London School of Economics, where he obtained a Masters in Economics. After Labour's 1997 landslide victory, Miliband was appointed as a special adviser to Chancellor Gordon Brown from 1997 to 2002.|$|E
5|$|In January 1961, {{just prior}} to leaving office, Eisenhower {{formally}} severed relations with the Cuban government. In April 1961, the administration of <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> American President John F. Kennedy mounted an unsuccessful CIA-organized ship-borne invasion of the island at Playa Girón and Playa Larga in Santa Clara Provincea failure that publicly humiliated the United States. Castro responded by publicly embracing Marxism–Leninism, and the Soviet Union pledged to provide further support.|$|E
5|$|Louie B. Nunn {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} at his home just outside Versailles, Kentucky, on January 29, 2004, hours after hosting a luncheon with labor leaders seeking help in dealing with the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Fletcher administration. He was buried at the Cosby Methodist Church {{cemetery}} in Hart County, Kentucky. The Cumberland Parkway was renamed the Louie B. Nunn Cumberland Parkway in 2000, and the main lodge at the Barren River Lake State Resort Park is also named in Nunn's honor.|$|E
5|$|Maximus {{may have}} {{remained}} in Rome, because he was present when the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome. The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod, which some believe may {{have been written by}} Maximus. It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II, who supported the Monothelite doctrine. Pope Martin was condemned without a trial, and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital.|$|E
5|$|Stewart {{retired from}} the {{military}} in 1954 but, in a break with convention, he was not rewarded with a knighthood for his services. This was most likely due to his previous clashes with Holland. He was knighted four years later by the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Labour Government. He retired to Northland and died {{in the small town}} of Kawakawa on 13 November 1972. He was survived by his wife Rita, who he had married in 1922, and the couple's two children. He is buried in the servicemen's section of Wellington's Karori Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans won {{control of}} both houses of the {{legislature}} {{for the first time}} in decades, while Dayton narrowly defeated Republican candidate Tom Emmer with 44% of the vote. Many of the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Republican legislators were affiliated with the Tea Party movement and had more anti-government positions than the Republican establishment. Both Dayton and Republican legislators claimed a popular mandate for their positions.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{freshman}} class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> senators {{had been elected}} through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More {{than half of the}} states had some form of primary selection for the Senate. The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826.|$|E
5|$|The four-strong party which visited London, {{as well as}} <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Alfred Ayrton made up {{five members}} of a 13-man {{sub-committee}} which controlled club affairs. The first five, who also included J.Brunt, J.E.Fattorini, A.J.Foxcroft and J.T.Whyte, were responsible for first team matters. On 20 June, the club directors appointed former Sunderland secretary-manager Robert Campbell as Bradford City's first manager from a shortlist of 30 applicants. Campbell's role was to coach the players, helped by trainer George Cutts. Ayrton, who had been president of Manningham FC, became the club's first chairman.|$|E
5|$|The <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Texian {{delegates to}} the Convention of 1836 quickly signed a Declaration of Independence on March 2, forming the Republic of Texas. After electing interim officers, the Convention disbanded. The new {{government}} joined the other settlers in Texas in the Runaway Scrape, fleeing from the approaching Mexican army. After several weeks of retreat, the Texian Army commanded by Sam Houston attacked and defeated Santa Anna's forces at the Battle of San Jacinto. Santa Anna was captured and forced to sign the Treaties of Velasco, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{stringent}} {{rules of}} Ubi periculum {{were used in}} the conclaves that elected Pope Innocent V (January 1276) and Pope Adrian V (July 1276), lasting one and nine days respectively. However, at the urgings of the College, the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Adrian V suspended the constitution on July 12, 1276—indicating that he wished to revise it—and died on August 18, without having promulgated a revised version.|$|E
5|$|With the {{political}} situation in Spain relatively settled, Irving continued to closely monitor {{the development of the}} new government and the fate of Isabella. His official duties as Spanish Minister also involved negotiating American trade interests with Cuba and following the Spanish parliament's debates over slave trade. He was also pressed into service by the American Minister to the Court of St. James's in London, Louis McLane, to assist in negotiating the Anglo-American disagreement over the Oregon border that <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> president James K. Polk had vowed to resolve.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{disagreements}} existed, such as the papal income tax and the refusal of the pope to create John Morton, the archbishop of Canterbury, a cardinal; Innocent VII had passed over Morton in his first consistory, despite creating two French cardinals. Nor had John Sherwood, the English ambassador in Rome, been created a cardinal in 1484, despite the request of King Richard III. Piccolomini's creation as cardinal protector was requested by Henry VII in a letter congratulating the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Pope Alexander VI, and was confirmed in a response which was probably written by Giovanni Gigli.|$|E
5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice on the Senate floor in 1828. A consistent opponent of internal improvements and tariffs, even those that would benefit his own constituents, he voted against a measure allocating federal funds {{for the construction of}} a road connecting the cities of Lexington and Maysville. The vote was ill-received by the people of the state, and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan voted for it only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in this session, but <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. The Senate began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{recommended}} Savige for a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for the Salamaua {{campaign in}} October 1944. A year later, he recommended Savige for a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath {{for the campaign}} on Bougainville. Both recommendations were turned down by the Labor government. Following {{the election of the}} coalition government in the 1949 election, Blamey wrote to the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful, and Savige was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division) in the King's Birthday Honours on 8 June 1950. In 1953, he travelled to London to represent Legacy at the coronation of Queen ElizabethII.|$|E
5|$|Despite Venice's {{economic}} and maritime decline, in 1601 {{at the behest}} of the Doge Marino Grimani, the Venetian Senate decided to have a new bucentaur built at the cost of 70,000 ducats; although the existing one was still in service, experts regarded it as too old. The designer of the new ship is unknown, but he was selected from among the most qualified marangoni (ships' carpenters) of the Arsenale. The work was supervised by Marco Antonio Memmo, the sovraprovveditore (overseer of the provveditore) of the Arsenale. The new vessel was approved and praised by all on its maiden voyage to the Lido with the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Doge Leonardo Donato on Ascension Day, 10 May 1606.|$|E
5|$|During the siege, <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> {{delegates from}} across Texas {{met at the}} Convention of 1836. On March 2, the delegates {{declared}} independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, the delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 warning of his dire situation. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.|$|E
5|$|Following his election, O'Malley's first {{personnel}} {{decision was}} {{to retain the}} director of the city's economic development agency. O'Malley had his transition team, and had them compile policy drafts by mid-December, so they would be ready to compete for state funds when the Maryland State Legislature reconvened on January 12, 2000. He participated in the <b>Newly</b> <b>Elected</b> Mayors Program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government in mid-November. By the beginning of December, he named five deputy mayors and filled most of his cabinet. He finalized his cabinet on December 7, during his last session as a city councillor. He was sworn in as mayor later that day at the War Memorial Plaza, near Baltimore City Hall.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his rule, Basiliscus showed his support for the Miaphysites. Zacharias Scholasticus reports how a group of Egyptian Miaphysite monks, having heard of Emperor Leo's death, had moved from Alexandria to Constantinople to petition Zeno in favour of Timothy, but at their arrival in the capital, they found the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Basiliscus instead. The Magister Officiorum Theoctistus, the former physician of Basiliscus, was the brother of one of the monks, so the delegation obtained an audience with Basiliscus, and, with the support of Theoctistus and of the Empress, they convinced Basiliscus to recall from exile the banished Miaphysite Patriarchs.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham was {{involved}} in the transition to open democratic elections in South Africa. He had visited South Africa in 1982 with other black jurists and had been appalled by the racial oppression he found and analogized to before the American Civil War. After apartheid's demise, Higginbotham consulted with Nelson Mandela and founded the South Africa Free Election (SAFE) Fund. He raised several million dollars to support fair elections in South Africa, and served as one of the international mediators of the first inter-racial elections in South Africa in 1994. After the election, he helped South Africa's <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> government draft a new constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1584 Skarga was {{transferred}} to the new Jesuit College at Kraków. On 26 March 1587 he founded the Polish version of the Mount of Piety, a pawnbroker run as a charity and called in Polish the Bank Pobożny (lit. the Pious Bank). In 1588 the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> King Sigismund III Vasa established the new post of court preacher, and Skarga became the first priest to hold it. Skarga became a valued adviser to the King, and Sigismund became so fond of him that when the priest considered retirement, Sigismund rejected this, requesting that he remain at court for as long as possible.|$|E
5|$|In July 1216, the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> Pope Honorius III {{once again}} called upon Andrew {{to fulfill his}} father's vow to lead a crusade. Andrew, who had {{postponed}} the crusade {{at least three times}} (in 1201, 1209 and 1213), finally agreed. Steven Runciman, Tibor Almási and other modern historians say that Andrew hoped that his decision would increase his likelihood of being elected as Latin Emperor of Constantinople, because his wife's uncle, Emperor Henry, had died in June. According to a letter written by Pope Honorius in 1217, envoys from the Latin Empire had actually informed Andrew that they planned to elect either him or his father-in-law, Peter of Courtenay, as emperor. The barons of the Latin Empire elected Peter of Courtenay in the summer of 1216.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} {{election}} {{he was in}} favour of Henryk II Walezy (later, Henry III of France). Subsequently, {{he was part of}} the diplomatic mission that traveled to France to finish formalities with the <b>newly</b> <b>elected</b> king. He also published a pamphlet praising the new king, and thus suffered a loss of face when Henryk secretly abandoned Poland and returned to France. During the following 1575 election he was a vocal enemy of the Habsburg dynasty and its candidate, and this anti-Habsburg stance, resounding among the lesser nobility, helped him regain his popularity. For the king, Zamoyski championed the case of a Polish candidate, which ended up in the marriage of Anna Jagiellon with the anti-Habsburg Stephen Bathory of Transylvania.|$|E
