40|$|The {{northwest}} and west coast <b>herring</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>survey</b> programme was first implemented in 1994. Prior to this a larval survey programme {{was carried out}} between 1981 and 1986. In the early 1990 s, the ICES herring working group (HAWG) identified {{the need for a}} dedicated <b>herring</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>survey</b> in this area (Anon, 1994). The stock in this area is composed of 2 spawning components (autumn and winter), covering a large geographical area. Spawning may extend over a 4 month period from late September through to late March (Molloy et al, 2000). Traditionally fishing activity has targeted spawning and pre-spawning aggregations, no summer matje fishery exists in this area, {{as is the case in}} the Celtic Sea. In VIaS, fishing has traditionally taken place in late October and continues until late February (winter spawners). Traditionally in VIIb, fishing is mainly concentrated on the later months of the year and would be concluded by the early part of the new year (Autumn spawners). The protracted spawning period of herring and the overlap between the two spawning stocks in this area (October to February) is highly dynamic with variations between annual spawning events of up to 3 weeks. Accurate survey timing is a key component of the design to cover the overlap of peak spawning events. A project is currently underway to describe stock structure and discrimination of herring around Ireland. The results of this project may have implications for the design of this survey and for the stock assessment. However, since 1994, <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> have been carried out, and currently are the only tuning indices available. The current survey makes up the 13 th in the time series. The design and execution of this survey has evolved from summer feeding phase surveys, in the mid 1990 s until its present winter spawning state.

40|$|The {{northwest}} and west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) <b>herring</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>survey</b> programme was first established in 1994. A larval survey programme was initially carried out between 1981 and 1986. In the early 1990 s, the ICES herring working group (HAWG) identified {{the need for}} a dedicated <b>herring</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>survey</b> in this area (Anon, 1994). From 1994 to 1996 surveys were carried out on this stock during the summer feeding phase. In 1997 a two-survey spawning aggregation program was established covering both autumn and winter components. In 2004, a single spawning stock survey was carried out early in quarter 1 and continued until 2007, whereupon it was decided that this survey should be incorporated into the larger coordinated Malin shelf survey. This survey will be the first in a new time series and a step away from the traditional spawning stock surveys. The Irish survey will be carried out concurrently with the West of Scotland (MarLab) and Irish Sea surveys (AFBI) and was coordinated through the ICES Planning Group of Herring <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Surveys</b> (PGHERS). Combined survey data on herring distribution, abundance and age will be used to provide a measure of the relative abundance of herring within the Malin shelf stock complex. Survey data on stock numbers at age are submitted to the ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) and used in the annual stock assessment process. The {{northwest and}} west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) herring stock is composed of 2 of spawning components (Autumn and Winter spawners) covering a large geographical area, which extends over a 4 -month period from late September through to late March (Molloy et al, 2000). Traditionally fishing effort has been concentrated on spawning and pre-spawning aggregations. In Vlas, fishing begins in late Novemember and continues until late March (winter spawners). Further south in Vlllb, peak fishing takes place from October to December (Autumn spawners). The protracted spawning period of herring and the overlap between the two spawning stocks in this area (October to February) is highly dynamic with variations between annual spawning events of up to 3 weeks. Up to 40 vessels commonly participate in the fishery, many of which are based in the Co. Donegal port of Killybegs. The fleet is made up of 20 RSW (Refrigerated Seawater) vessels of 40 - 70 m in length; 20 polyvalent trawlers 10 of which are vessels of 22 - 40 m and 10 of less than 25 m.

40|$|The {{northwest}} and west coast <b>herring</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>survey</b> programme was first implemented in 1994, {{with the current}} winter spawning survey representing the 9 th in the time series. The stock {{in this area is}} composed of 2 spawning components (autumn and winter), covering a large geographical area. Spawning occurs over a protracted period of over 4 -months from late September through to late March. The age profile of the survey stock as generated from trawl samples indicated ages ranging from 1 - 7 years. Maturity samples indicate the largest proportion of the stock to be in a pre-spawning, spawning or spent state, with small amounts of immature fish, as would be expected at this time. The 2007 survey estimate generated a TSB (total stock biomass) of 14, 200 t relating to a SSB (spawning stock biomass) of 13, 974 t. Poor weather dominated the survey with almost 25 % lost in downtime. As a result the survey area and track lines had to be reduced to compensate and hydrographic stations had to be sacrificed. The poor weather experienced no doubt had an impact on herring schooling behaviour and our detection ability.

40|$|Atlantic saithe (Pollachius virens) and Norwegian {{spring-spawning}} herring (Clupea harengus) represent two of {{the most}} abundant and ecologically important fish species in the Northeast Atlantic. The two species co-occur in the Vesterålen/Lofoten area during the wintering of herring, but the temporal and spatial overlap between species in different scales as well as their trophic interactions is otherwise largely unknown. Saithe is a potentially important predator on herring. In the present study we found the commercial catches of saithe off western Norway to be closely related to the migration of herring into the coastal spawning grounds, indicating that saithe follow the high concentrations of migrating <b>herring.</b> <b>Acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> within a defined study area demonstrated that the species overlapped spatially and temporarily. Degree of overlap varied both diurnally and with the maturity status of the herring (pre-spawning, spawning or spent). Concurrent catches of saithe and herring from trawling and gillnets supported an overlap also on the meso-scale. Observations on more fine-scaled behaviour obtained from an underwater rig with highsensity cameras positioned in high-density areas of herring demonstrated that the distribution and behaviour of herring and saithe was closely linked to the diel light cycle and spawning of herring. When looking at the actual outcome of the interactions between the species on a kind of temporally, integrated spatial microscale, it was observed that stomachs of large saithe (> 50 cm) on average contained 2 – 3 herring, while the stomachs of smaller saithe were filled with herring eggs. This suggests a considerable predation pressure by saithe on different life stages of herring...|$|R
40|$|In the Celtic Sea and ICES Division VIIj, to {{the south}} and {{southwest}} of Ireland, herring is an important commercial species and currently Ireland is the only country targeting this species in this area. Herring in this region comprise both autumn and winter spawning components. Commercial fishing has targeted the fish during spawning times, though in most recent years fish have been targeted during the summer feeding phase too. In VIIj, fishing has traditionally taken place in October, and concentrated in the bays and inlets. In contrast, fishing in VIIaS has mainly been in December to January, though in VIIg the fishery traditionally takes place from November to January. The protracted spawning period of herring and the overlap between the two spawning socks in this area (October to February) means {{that it is difficult to}} design a survey that covers all spawning fish in one specific survey. The stock structure and discrimination of herring in this area is not fully understood. It is known that fish in the eastern Celtic Sea recruit from nursery areas in the Irish Sea and tagging studies have shown linkages between these areas also. For the purpose of stock assessment and management these areas have been combined since 1982. A project is currently underway to describe stock structure and discrimination of herring around Ireland. The results of this project may have implications for the design of this survey and for the stock assessment. For a period in the 1980 ’s, egg and larval surveys were conducted for herring in this area.

The Baginbun area is located east of Waterford Harbour in ICES division VIIaS. Baginbun has supported a large winter fishery for many years and is one of the most important and well known winter spawning areas on the south coast. This year for the first time the RV Celtic Explorer was to survey the area. This allowed a more extensive degree of coverage in the time allocated, the survey was further complemented with a number of hydrographic transects concentrating along the bays in the west and southwest and also along the southern coastline.

40|$|In the Celtic Sea and ICES Division VIIj, to {{the south}} and {{southwest}} of Ireland, herring are an important commercial species to the pelagic fleet. The local fleet is composed of dry hold polyvalent vessels and a number of purpose built RSW (Refrigerated seawater) vessels. This stock is composed of both autumn and winter spawning components. The commercial fishery has historically taken place within 6 nmi (nautical miles) of the coast and focused on aggregated schools within the spawning cycle. In recent years the RSW fleet has actively targeted offshore summer feeding grounds in the south Celtic Sea. In division VIIj, the fishery traditionally begins in early October and is concentrated within several miles of the shore bays and inlets. The division VIIaS fishery peaks towards the year end in December, but may be active from mid October depending on location. In division VIIg, along the south coast herring are targeted from October to January at a number of known spawning sites and surrounding areas. Overall, the protracted spawning period of the two components extends from October through to January, with annual variation of up to 3 weeks. Spawning occurs in successive waves in a number of well known locations including large scale grounds and small discreet spawning beds.

40|$|At the Møre coast {{there are}} {{important}} spawning areas for cod, coalfish, haddock and herring. As a part of an interaction study of these species, i. e. the predation of the demersal species on the spawning stock and the eggs of <b>herring,</b> an <b>acoustic</b> <b>survey</b> for estimation of the abundance of the demersal stocks {{was carried out in}} the last week of March. During the survey hydrographic data were sampled by a CTD-sonde. Acoustic abundance of demersal fish was devided between cod and haddock as one category and coalfish as another. As biological sampling by trawling occasionally was difficult because of high density of fishermens gillnets and rough bottom, biological data also were sampled from commercial catches in the surveyed area througout March. The behaviour of the fish was favourable for acoustic abundance estimation. However, some informations about haddock, observed as a heavy predator on eggs of herring, were supposed to be lost because it often stuck close to the bottom. The highest densities of cod were observed in the Breisund and at the Buagrunn, the last area also with the best acoustic recordings of coalfish and haddock. The stock abundance estimates of cod, haddock and coalfish were respectively 32 200, 11 560 and 51 760 tonnes. The experiences from this investigation indicate the acoustic method to be prosperous in abundance estimation of demersal fish in the surveyed area during the winter season...|$|R

The stock structure and discrimination of herring in this area has been investigated recently. Hatfield et al. (2007) has shown the Celtic Sea stock to be fairly discrete. However, it is known that fish in the eastern Celtic Sea recruit from nursery areas in the Irish Sea, returning to the Celtic Sea as young adults (Brophy et al. 2002; Molloy et al., 1993). The stock identity of VIIj herring is less clear, though there is evidence that they have linkages with VIIb and VIaS (ICES, 1994; Grainger, 1978). Molloy (1968) identified possible linkages between young fish in VIIj and those of the Celtic Sea herring. For the purpose of stock assessment and management divisions VIIaS, VIIg and VII j have been combined since 1982.

Results will be ready for the Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) meeting in March 2005. COORDINATION OF LARVAE SURVEYS FOR 2006 / 2007 : In the 2006 / 2007 period, the Netherlands and Germany will undertake seven larvae surveys in the North Sea from 1 September 2005 to 31 January 2006. Germany will contribute a second vessel to the IHLS to ensure coverage in the Orkney and Buchan area, which has not been covered in recent years; this will also take place {{in the first half of}} September. Thus, with the combined effort of Germany and Netherlands an almost complete coverage of the main spawning grounds is achievable. The Baltic Sea Fisheries Institute will continue with the larvae survey in the Greifswalder Bodden area in 2006. NORTH SEA ACOUSTIC SURVEYS IN 2005 : Six <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> were carried out during late June and July 2005 covering the North Sea and west of Scotland. The provisional total combined estimate of North Sea spawning stock biomass (SSB) is 1. 9 million t, a decrease from 2. 6 million t in 2004. The stock is dominated by the 2000 year class. Growth of the 2000 year class seems again to be slower than average: 96 % is mature. The west of Scotland SSB estimate is 190, 000 t (400, 000 t in 2004); this is a substantial reduction from last years estimate. The surveys are reported individually in Annex 2. WESTERN BALTIC ACOUSTIC SURVEYS IN 2005 : A joint German-Danish <b>acoustic</b> <b>survey</b> was carried out with RV “Solea” from 4 to 21 October in the Western Baltic. The estimate of Western Baltic spring spawning herring SSB is 197, 700 t (192, 100 t in 2004). A full survey report is given in Annex 3. MANUALS FOR <b>ACOUSTIC</b> AND <b>HERRING</b> LARVAE SURVEYS: The manual for <b>herring</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> in ICES Divisions III, IV, and VIA will be reviewed and updated in 2006 by correspondence. Development of the equipment used, has been extensive in recent years: an extensive review is, therefore, required: there was not enough time to carry out this activity at the meeting. The manual for the International Herring Larvae Surveys south of 62 ° north has been reviewed and updated. Version 2 of the manual is attached in Annex 5. STATUE AND FUTURE OF THE FISHFRAME AND HERSUR DATABASE: The status of the HERSUR database has not changed since 2005. Only Denmark has uploaded new data. Three countries have uploaded aggregated (“stage 3 ”) data in the Fishframe database. The international data set was completed by extracting national input data from the excel sheet used so far. The calculation, aggregation and reporting procedures on uploaded data of 2003, 2004 and 2005 was tested against the old procedure. The minor differences found were caused by differences in precision. It was decided that the Fishframe stage 3 module will be used to aggregate data from the 2006 surveys at the next meeting in 2007. To ensure that all countries confirm to same methods in stage 2, a group to design the user requirement specifications should be formed and meet during 13 – 14 June 2006 at DIFRES in Copenhagen. SPRAT: Data on sprat were available from RV “Walther Herwig” III, RV “Tridens” and RV “Dana”. The total sprat biomass was estimated as 562, 000 t in the North Sea (up from 360, 000 t in 2004) and 59, 800 t in the Kattegat (up from 15, 000 t in 2004). The present data suggest that sprat abundance is decreasing in the south and the distribution limit might therefore have been reached. COORDINATION OF ACOUSTIC SURVEYS IN 2006 : Six <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> will be carried out in the North Sea and west of Scotland in 2006 between 25 June and 30 July. Participants are referred to Figure 4. 4. 1 for indications of survey boundaries. “Tridens” and “Walther Herwig” will cover the area between 52 º and 57 º together with interlaced transects. A survey of the western Baltic and southern part of Kattegat will be carried out by a German research vessel in October. LARVAE SURVEY SAMPLER: In the sampling period 2004 - 2005 the Netherlands changed from a Gulf III to a Gulf VII plankton torpedo. The Gulf VII seems to perform better in that the oblique hauls show a sharp ‘V’-shape. Possible differences between these two sampling devices will be investigated by sampling simultaneously with the Gulf III and Gulf VII during the September 2006 survey. A special set-up will be tested and improved during a survey in May targeting spawning horse mackerel in the southern North Sea. If the tests during the May survey prove successful, the apparatus will be used during the herring larvae survey in September 2006 to obtain a set of intercalibration hauls. REVIEW OF THE AGE READING WORKSHOP AT THE ARCHIPELAGO RESEARCH INSTITUTE ON THE ISLAND OF SEILI, FINLAND ON 6 –JUNE 2005 : Thirty-five participants from 25 countries attended the Age Reading Workshop to identify present problems in herring age determination, improve the accuracy and precision of age determinations and spread information of the methods and procedures used in different ageing laboratories working with herring. The main conclusion was that it is recommended that regular otolith exchanges take place between institutes in order to detect precision drift in the age estimations. EVALUATING THE POTENTIAN OF THE TORRY FISH FAT METER FOR MEASURING LIPID CONTENT OF HERRING AT SEA: Deborah Davidson from the University of Aberdeen gave a presentation of her ongoing PhD study examining the fat content in herring (see working document in Annex 7). The overall aim of the field study in 2006 is to determine whether lipids impose a threshold on the onset of maturation in North Sea herring. PGHERS recommends that in the 2006 North Sea <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys,</b> all participants take a student from Aberdeen University to make measurements of the fat content of herring...|$|R

40|$|Systematic use of {{echo sounder}} in {{fisheries}} and marine science comrnenced in the 1930 's and developed rapidly after World War II. During the 1950 's and 1960 's large scale echo surveys {{were carried out}} in many regions as a service to fishing fleets and resulting in {{a substantial increase in}} knowledge of distribution and migration for many species and stocks. Already in 1958 - 1968 Russian scientists provided estimates of abundance of Norwegian spring spawning <b>herring</b> based on <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveying</b> and underwater photography. Acoustic instruments in use in fisheries and plankton research span a frequency range from about 1 kilohertz (kHz) to several megahertz (MHz). At 1 kHz typical ranges and sampling volumes are tens of kilometers and thousands of cubic meters while the corresponding figures at some MHZ are ranges of a few meters and sampling volumes of less than a cubic centimeter. The echo ability of fish and plankton varies considerably between species and for groups of species as well as between acoustic frequencies depending on the material properties and shape and size of targets and particularly on whether or not the organisms contain gas (swim bladders). Integration of echo energy is the most widely used acoustic method for estimating densities and abundance of fish. The basis for the method is the linearity principle, i. e. that the accumulated echo energy per unit volume or area from an aggregation is proportional to actual fish density; the factor of proportionality being the average echo ability (scattering cross section) of the individual fishes. Echo integration was introduced in the early 1960 's, and the linearity principle was verified by measurements of live fish in the early 1980 's. Studies of fish behaviour using acoustic instruments have increased in recent years both because of the need to evaluate the reliability in acoustic and swept area estimates of abundance as well as to validate behaviour theory and to increase the knowledge on fish behaviour in general...|$|R

40|$|NOAA’s Coral Reef Conservation program (CRCP) {{develops}} {{coral reef}} management priorities by bringing together various partners {{to better understand}} threats to coral reef ecosystems {{with the goal of}} conserving, protecting and restoring these resources. Place-based and ecosystem-based management approaches employed by CRCP require that spatially explicit information about benthic habitats and fish utilization are available to characterize coral reef ecosystems and set conservation priorities. To accomplish this, seafloor habitat mapping of coral reefs around the U. S. Virgin Islands (USVI) and Puerto Rico has been ongoing since 2004. In 2008, fishery <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> were added to NOAA survey missions in the USVI and Puerto Rico to assess fish distribution and abundance in relation to benthic habitats in high priority conservation areas. NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) have developed fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>survey</b> capabilities onboard the NOAA ship Nancy Foster to complement the CRCP seafloor habitat mapping effort spearheaded by the Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment Biogeography Branch (CCMA-BB). The integration of these activities has evolved on the Nancy Foster over the three years summarized in this report. A strategy for improved operations and products has emerged over that time. Not only has the concurrent operation of multibeam and fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> been beneficial in terms of optimizing ship time and resources, this joint effort has advanced an integrated approach to characterizing bottom and mid-water habitats and the fishes associated with them. CCMA conducts multibeam surveys to systematically map and characterize coral reef ecosystems, resulting in products such as high resolution bathymetric maps, backscatter information, and benthic habitat classification maps. These products focus on benthic features and live bottom habitats associated with them. NCCOS Centers (the Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research and the Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecular Research) characterize coral reef ecosystems by using fisheries acoustics methods to capture biological information through the entire water column. Spatially-explicit information on marine resources derived from fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys,</b> such as maps of fish density, supports marine spatial planning strategies and decision making by providing a biological metric for evaluating coral reef ecosystems and assessing impacts from pollution, fishing pressure, and climate change. Data from fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> address management needs by providing a measure of biomass in management areas, detecting spatial and temporal responses in distribution relative to natural and anthropogenic impacts, and identifying hotspots that support high fish abundance or fish aggregations. Fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted alongside multibeam mapping efforts inherently couple water column data with information on benthic habitats and provide information on the heterogeneity of both benthic habitats and biota in the water column. Building on this information serves to inform resource managers regarding how fishes are organized around habitat structure and the scale at which these relationships are important. Where resource managers require place-based assessments regarding the location of critical habitats along with high abundances of fish, concurrent multibeam and fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> serve as an important tool for characterizing and prioritizing coral reef ecosystems. This report summarizes the evolution of fisheries <b>acoustics</b> <b>surveys</b> onboard the NOAA ship Nancy Foster from 2008 to 2010, in conjunction with multibeam data collection, aimed at characterizing benthic and mid-water habitats in high priority conservation areas around the USVI and Puerto Rico. It also serves as a resource for the continued development of consistent data products derived from <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys.</b> By focusing on the activities of 2010, this report highlights the progress made to date and illustrates the potential application of fisheries data derived from <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> to the management of coral reef ecosystems...|$|R

Coefficients of variation of hydroacoustic abundance estimates from deep stream trout lakes where fish appeared randomly distributed ranged from 9 %- 44 %. Coefficients of variation from shallow lakes ranged from 36 %- 125 %. Two deep, mine pit lakes with patchy fish distributions had coefficients of variation of 93 % and 125 %. Evidence of acoustic sur-vey accuracy varied. Repeated <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> over three time intervals and days in Echo Lake, a relatively deep lake, suggested no systematic inaccuracy. Acoustic and capture-recapture population estimates of fish larger than 20 cm TL in Kimball Lake compared fa-vorably.

40|$|During their migrations between low {{latitude}} breeding {{areas and}} high latitude feeding areas, male humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, are frequently heard singing, often continuously for many hours, {{and the sounds}} are audible for tens of kilometres. The stock that passes close to the coast of southeast Queensland has been extensively surveyed visually, but little is known of movements of whales that pass {{out of sight of}} land here, or {{in other areas of the}} world, where the migratory paths of humpback whales are often across open ocean. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>surveying</b> may be useful in quantifying whale movements in oceanic waters beyond the range of land surveying and an addition to visual monitoring. For <b>acoustic</b> <b>surveys</b> to be of use, the acoustic cues of the whales must be quantified and calibrated against the numbers of whales in an area. In 1997 we performed a combined visual and <b>acoustic</b> <b>survey</b> of whales migrating close to shore on the coast of southeast Queensland. Song activity was measured using two indices: number of passing singers and number of singer-hours observed within a 10 km sector, and correlated with the number of whales passing through the area determined visually. Both were significantly correlated with r = 0. 68 and 0. 64 for singers and singer-hours respectively on a daily basis, and 0. 79 and 0. 89 respectively on a weekly basis. Linear regressions of daily measures of song activity with numbers of whales seen lead to estimates of ratios of singers with whales seen of 0. 127 ± 0. 027 (95 % confidence interval) and singer-hours with whales seen of 0. 288 ± 0. 065.
