500|$|During {{his time}} at the United States Department of State, Keyes defended the Reagan policy of not {{imposing}} economic sanctions on South Africa as punishment for apartheid. Stated Keyes, [...] "I see the black people in South Africa as the most critical positive factor for eliminating apartheid and building the future of that country... And that is <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> do with rhetoric, slogans and noninvolvement. It's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> will achieve through disinvestment." ...|$|E

On June 30, 2017, she {{was appointed to}} the Order of Canada. Of the honor she said, [...] "I am a very, very proud Canadian, I am proud of where I am from, and to be recognized in this nature is surreal. It's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can dream about happening to you. I can dream of winning a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal, and that's my job, but to have your country recognize you – I don't even know what to say." ...|$|E
500|$|In an 8 November 2002 Slate article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a [...] "trust-fund kid whose {{success at}} school is largely {{attributable}} to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him". Noting that in Rowling's fiction, magical ability potential is [...] "something you are born to, <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can achieve", Suellentrop wrote that Dumbledore's maxim that [...] "It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities" [...] is hypocritical, as [...] "the school that Dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else". In a 12 August 2007 New York Times review of Deathly Hallows, however, Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for [...] "unmooring" [...] her [...] "English school story" [...] from literary precedents [...] "bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery", arguing that she had instead created [...] "a world of youthful democracy and diversity".|$|E

On the other hand, Sterling Whitaker of The Boot put [...] "Don't You Wanna Stay" [...] at number six on his list of Top 10 Jason Aldean Songs. Laura McClellan of Taste of Country ranked the song at number three of Aldean's Top 10 songs, citing it as [...] "the biggest reason the industry is beginning to recognize Aldean with award nominations."

500|$|U2 {{returned}} to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded {{better than they}} originally thought. They briefly {{returned to}} Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and said, [...] "It was something {{we had to go}} through to realize {{what we were trying to}} get to was <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." [...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|E
500|$|Whedon uses several disorienting {{effects to}} heighten {{the reality of}} the {{situations}} in the episode {{to the point that they}} seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in constant movement as she walks through the house to the phone and back to her mother again. The buttons on Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what he is saying. The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality. Kristine Sutherland stated that the script was [...] "amazing", specifically at capturing the detachment: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> can process. I mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you're that age." ...|$|E

500|$|Duff {{explained}} of the album's title, [...] "I'm {{older and}} more mature now than I was when I made my last record, but I don't think I know it all. Having dignity is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. I hope I always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> can be given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's <b>something</b> that <b>you</b> have to work on." ...|$|R
5000|$|As Hiromi says, [...] "I {{called this}} album Voice because I believe that people’s real voices are {{expressed}} in their emotions.

Maybe you’re never going to say it. But it’s your true voice. Instrumental music is very similar. We don’t have any words or any lyrics to go with it. It’s the true voice that we don’t really put into words, but we feel it when it’s real." ...|$|R
500|$|That {{was one of}} {{the first}} words I said to the entire team at ILM. I said, [...] "This movie needs to be theatrical, operatic, romantic." [...] We used a lot of words not usually {{associated}} with high-tech blockbusters … We went for a very, very, very, very saturated color palette for the battle for Hong Kong. I kept asking John to tap into his inner Mexican and be able to saturate the greens and the purples and the pinks and the oranges. The classic Japanese woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai was a common motif in the ocean battles; Del Toro recalled, [...] "I would say 'Give me a Hokusai wave'… we use the waves and weather in the movie very operatically." [...] The director asked that Knoll not necessarily match the lighting from shot to shot: [...] "It's pretty unorthodox to do that, but I think the results are really beautiful and very artistically free and powerful, <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> would associate with a big sci-fi action movie." [...] Del Toro considers the film's digital water its most exciting visual effect: [...] "The water dynamics in this movie are technically beautiful, but also artistically incredibly expressive. We agreed on making the water become almost another character. We would time the water very precisely. I'd say 'Get out of the wave [...]'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{while living}} on Fire Island in the 1970s, Kramer had no {{intention}} of getting involved in political activism. There were politically active groups in New York City, but Kramer notes the culture on Fire Island was so different that they would often make fun of political activists: [...] "It was not chic. It was <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> could brag about with your friends... Guys marching down Fifth Avenue was a whole other world. The whole gestalt of Fire Island was about beauty and looks and golden men." ...|$|E
2500|$|William L. Phillis, {{executive}} director of the Coalition for Equity and Adequacy, a group of public schools suing the State of Ohio for more funding, told the newspaper [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> expect in a democracy. You might expect this kind of behavior from a third-world dictator, one that would want to hide wrongdoing by making a decree that makes it right." [...] Johnson told The Dispatch [...] "I need unlimited, unfettered discretion to seek every fact I can find in order to come to a decent conclusion.

2500|$|On 11 July 2015, Ronaldinho {{announced}} {{his return to}} Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense, but on 28 September, Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal. He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans. Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, [...] "Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting. He respectfully told us he didn't feel {{he was able to}} perform as good as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him. He made a great gesture in saying he wasn't being the player he felt he could be right now. I'll never speak about whether or not he is retiring. That's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> say about a player of his calibre. He was always spectacular, as player and person." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, {{the writers}} created {{character}} Zach Slater. He {{was introduced in}} the [...] "back from the dead" [...] Maria Santos storyline. At the time, the series was focused on Kendall Hart's romantic involvement with Ethan Cambias. Ethan was later revealed as Zach's son. Head writer Megan McTavish had not planned on writing Zach and Kendall as being seriously romantically intertwined; Zach was only supposed to marry Kendall as a temporary [...] "roadblock" [...] in the way of Kendall and Ethan's relationship and later for the coupling of Kendall and her former love, Ryan Lavery. In their Best & Worst December 13, 2005 issue, Soap Opera Digest stated: [...] "We thought the 'Zendall' union was a bump in the Kendall/Ethan road, not its own destination. This enabled Zach and Kendall's growing affection to sneak up and surprise us as much as it did them. When they ended up in love, it felt like a happy accident, not some writer's 'You Will Love This Couple' dictate and on daytime, alas, that's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> see every day." ...|$|E

5000|$|Achebe's {{choice to}} write in English has caused controversy. While both African and non-African critics agree that Achebe {{modelled}} Things Fall Apart on classic European literature, they disagree about whether his novel upholds a Western model, or, in fact, subverts or confronts it. Achebe continued to defend his decision: [...] "English is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> spend your lifetime acquiring, {{so it would be}} foolish not to use it. Also, in the logic of colonization and decolonization it is actually a very powerful weapon in the fight to regain what was yours. English was the language of colonization itself.
