His poetry makes one feel the desperation for warmth amidst a painful life, which deeply moves his readers.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to reframe the debate on {{societal}} constitutionalism and constitutionalization from a spatial to a temporal framework. This analytical shift is due to the dramatic acceleration of societal processes, which are increasingly crossing the spatial boundaries of nation-states and of all the other social structures embedded in peculiar places. This high-speed society is characterized by the so-called temporalization of complexity, which influences every aspect of social life and, in particular, the 2 ̆ 2 validity 2 ̆ 2 of law. On the basis of this theoretical background, I would like to show that changing the form of observation from a spatial to a temporal framework may help in understanding the future of constitutionalism in a different and creative way. To cite some of the examples presented in this article, such shifts in the form of observation could help us to reconsider: (a) why so many scholars prefer <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 2 ̆ 7 orocesses 2 ̆ 2 of constitutionalization instead of constitutions as 2 ̆ 2 structures 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 (b) the growing relevance of courts instead of legislative bodies for processes of global constitutionalization; (c) the blurring or vanishing of the modern distinction between pouvoir constituant/pouvoir constitu 6; and (d) the fundamental role of human rights and dignity within the processes of global constitutionalization. The temporalization of constitutions could help us to understand and foresee a new and emerging ideal of societal constitutionalism in which the processes and structures of the structural coupling between (not national) polities and law are open to the challenges of a hyper-complex world society.

Many works have focused on the study of charge transport along nanosystems, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoribbons, or metallic nanowires, and spin dependent transport properties at this scale may lead to new behaviors due to the manipulation of a small number of spins. Metal nanowires have been studied as electric contacts where atomic and molecular insertions can be constructed. Here we describe what might be considered the ultimate spin device, namely, a Au thin nanowire with one Co atom bridging its two sides. We show that this system has strong spin dependent transport properties and that its local symmetry can dramatically change them, leading to a significant spin polarized conductance...|$|R

Today, with results from both {{spacecraft}} observations [e. g. 1] and laboratory analyses [e. g. 2], the regolith of the Moon is considered to contain a number of different forms of water at various levels of concentrations (up to % levels).

One component of this arises from a substance that is seen to come and go [3], known as “space dew” [4], which is most likely {{to be the result of}} an interaction between the solar wind (H) and the lunar surface (O). It is a short step to postulate that an equivalent effect would also be associated with the surfaces of asteroidal bodies. And, by extension, these would also have atmospheres (perhaps more accurately considered as exospheres, although if cycling of dew at the surface of the Moon is a reality then perhaps “exosphere” is semantically incorrect). This would be on top of the large volumes of water that are already considered to exist within the upper layers of large bodies like Ceres, and as prominent surface deposits on asteroids such as 24 Themis...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} have been verified by now {{in a variety of}} different situations, setting strong constraints on any alternative theory of gravity. Nonetheless, there are strong indications that general relativity has to be regarded as an approximation of a more complete theory. Indeed theorists have long been looking for ways to connect general relativity, which describes the cosmos and the infinitely large, to quantum physics, which has been remarkably successful in explaining the infinitely small world of elementary particles. These two worlds, however, come closer and closer to each other as we go back in time {{all the way up to}} the big bang. Actually, modern cosmology has changed completely the old big bang paradigm: we <b>now</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> (at least) two (big?) bangs. If we know quite something about the one closer to us, at the end of inflation, we are much more ignorant about the one that may have preceded inflation and possibly marked the beginning of time.

Finding such a synthesis and confirming it experimentally will no doubt be one of the biggest challenges of this century’s physics...|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} it has been widely {{accepted}} that stem cells {{play a crucial role}} in adult tissue maintenance. The concept that the renewing tissues of the body contain a small subcompartment of self-maintaining stem cells, upon which the entire tissue is dependent, is also now accepted as applicable to all renewing tissues. Gene therapy and tissue engineering are driving considerable interest in the clinical application of such hierarchically organized cellular compartments. Recent initial observations have provided a tantalizing insight into the large pluripotency of these cells. Indeed, scientists are <b>now</b> beginning <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the possible totipotency of some adult tissue stem cells. Such work is currently phenomenologic, but analysis of data derived from genomics and proteomics, identifying the crucial control signals involved, will soon provide a further impetus to stem cell biology with far reaching applications. The epidermis with its relatively simple structure, ease of accessibility, and the ability to grow its cells in vitro is one obvious target tissue for testing stem cell manipulation theories. It is crucial, however, that the normal keratinocyte stem cell is thoroughly characterized prior to attempting to manipulate its pluripotency. This commentary assesses the data generated to date and critically discusses the conclusions that have been drawn. Our current level of understanding, or lack of understanding, of the keratinocyte stem cell is reviewed...|$|R

Viewed {{as a whole}} and throughout its historical duration, it has not been realized within the framework of one nation or one ethno-national community, nor within only one language or only one alphabet, nor within the framework of only one cultural-civilizational circle. This fact and this kind of literary-historical and cultural-historical reality gives the basis from which it is <b>now</b> possible <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a unique, singular literature of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or Bosnian-Herzegovinian literature, and also about parallel, plural literatures of Bosnia-Herzegovina – Bosniak as well as Croat and Serbian literatures in Bosnia-Herzegovina, together with the literary traditions of Bosnian-Herzegovinian minority communities, such as the Jewish community and others. Also, it is possible to speak about a phenomenon that should – given its own, internal historical-developmental dynamics and its literary-developmental principles and relationships in general – probably be named the Bosnian-Herzegovinian interliterary community. That is why, in understanding the phenomenon of literary creativity in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well in defi ning Bosnian literary studies, primarily the theoretical concepts of interliterariness as well as closely related concepts of interculturality occur as potential solutions, as – both of them – have their essential meaning and full realization in the cases of both literary and culturally complex phenomena like literature in Bosnia-Herzegovina in general...|$|R
40|$|Most current {{thinking}} about evolution is couched {{in the concept}} of trees. The notion of a tree with recursively bifurcating branches representing recurrent divergence events is a plausible metaphor to describe the evolution of multicellular organisms like vertebrates or land plants. But if we try to force the tree metaphor onto the whole of the evolutionary process, things go badly awry, because the more closely we inspect microbial genomes through the looking glass of gene and genome sequence comparisons, the smaller the amount of the data that fits the concept of a bifurcating tree becomes. That is mainly because among microbes, endosymbiosis and lateral gene transfer are important, two mechanisms of natural variation that differ from the kind of natural variation that Darwin had in mind. For such reasons, when it comes to discussing the relationships among all living things, that is, including the microbes and all of their genes rather than just one or a select few, many biologists are <b>now</b> beginning <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> networks rather than trees in the context of evolutionary relationships among microbial chromosomes. But talk is not enough. If we were to actually construct networks instead of trees to describe the evolutionary process, what would they look like?
