The early version of this code simulated only β−γ and ec−γ emitters with reasonably high electron and X-ray energies. To extend the code to include other radionuclides and enable the code to be applied to software coincidence counting systems, several improvements have been made and are presented in this work...|$|E
40|$|Claims that {{proximity}} to the Sun causes variation of decay constants at permille level have been investigated for alpha decaying nuclides. Repeated decay rate measurements of 209 Po, 226 Ra, 228 Th, 230 U, and 241 Am sources were performed over periods of 200 d up to two decades at various <b>nuclear</b> <b>metrology</b> institutes around the globe. Residuals from the exponential decay curves were inspected for annual oscillations. Systematic deviations from a purely exponential decay curve differ in amplitude and phase from one data set to another and appear attributable to instabilities in the instrumentation and measurement conditions. The most stable activity measurements of 3 ̆b 1 decaying sources set an upper limit between 0. 0006...|$|E
40|$|The ASTM {{standards}} {{provide guidance}} and instruction {{on how to}} field and interpret reactor dosimetry. They provide a roadmap towards understanding the current ''state-of-the-art'' in reactor dosimetry, as reflected by the technical community. The consensus basis to the ASTM standards assures the user of an unbiased presentation of technical procedures and interpretations of the measurements. Some insight into the types of standards {{and the way in}} which they are organized can assist one in using them in an expeditious manner. Two example are presented to help orient new users to the breadth and interrelationship between the ASTM <b>nuclear</b> <b>metrology</b> standards. One example involves the testing of a new ''widget'' to verify the radiation hardness. The second example involves quantifying the radiation damage at a pressure vessel critical weld location through surveillance dosimetry and calculation...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} and experimental study {{was carried out}} on 238 U source preparation optimization for electrodeposition. A proper uranium source for alpha spectrometry must be thin and uniform and have a homogeneous activity distrubution {{in order to obtain}} high energy resolution spectra and avoid low energy tailing. To meet these requirements, electrodeposition {{is one of the most}} common methods for preparing alpha sources for high resolution spectroscopy. The spectral properties (resolution, tailing) are more important in <b>nuclear</b> data <b>metrology</b> than in any other type of measurement (e. g. environmental analysis, geological studies). For a high quality alpha source many parameters should be optimized. The following settings were studied: type of the electrolyte, type of the electrode, surface quality of the backings, deposited mass, rotation and shape of the anode, current density, deposition time and the experience of the analyst.

40|$|Optical clock {{interrogation}} protocols, {{based on}} laser-pulse spectroscopy, {{are suffering from}} probe-induced frequency shifts and their variations induced by laser power. Original Hyper-Ramsey probing scheme, which was proposed to alleviate those issues, does not fully eliminate the shift, especially when decoherence and relaxation by spontaneous emission or collisions are present. We propose to solve the fundamental problem of frequency shifts induced by laser probe by deriving the exact canonical form of a multi-pulse generalized Hyper-Ramsey (GHR) resonance, including decoherence and relaxation. We present a universal interrogation protocol based on composite laser-pulses spectroscopy with phase-modulation eliminating probe-induced frequency shifts at all orders in presence of various dissipative processes. Unlike frequency shifts extrapolation-based methods, a universal interrogation protocol based on ±π/ 4 and ± 3 π/ 4 phase-modulated resonances is proposed which does not compromise {{the stability of the}} optical clock while maintaining an ultra-robust error signal gradient in presence of substantial uncompensated ac Stark-shifts. Such a scheme can be implemented in two flavours: either by inverting clock state initialization or by pulse order reversal even without a perfect quantum state initialization. This universal interrogation protocol can be applied to atomic, molecular and <b>nuclear</b> frequency <b>metrology,</b> mass spectrometry and to the field of precision spectroscopy. It might be designed using magic-wave induced transitions, two-photon excitation and magnetically-induced spectroscopy or it might even be implemented with quantum logic gate circuit and qubit entanglement.

40|$|The REIMEP (Regular European Interlaboratory Measurement Evaluation Programme) {{campaign}} 15 for isotopic {{ratios of}} uranium in UF 6 samples {{has been completed}} in 2002. The participants received 4 samples of low-enriched or slightly depleted uranium {{in the form of}} UF 6 in standard monel capsules. The samples were prepared at IRMM by mixing uranium reference materials certified by gas mass-spectrometry in the form of UF 6. The minor isotopes, 234 U and 236 U were certified at IRMM by Thermal Isotope Mass-spectrometry (TIMS) using a MAT 262 -RPQ mass spectrometer in ion counting mode. Certified values were sent to the participating laboratories immediately after receiving their measured results. The measured results and their comparison with the certified values allowed an overall view of the analytical capability in the nuclear field to measure uranium isotopic ratios in UF 6 samples. However, for the so-called minor ratio 234 U. 238 U the comparison of IRMM¿s certified values with all the participants results showed a significant relative deviation of about 2 %, which is by far larger than the typical uncertainties expected for this kind of measurements. This significant deviation was considered disappointing for IRMM as the leading European <b>nuclear</b> safeguards <b>metrology</b> institute. This problem has now overcome first by measurements using the new TRITON TIMS at IRMM and second by a thorough investigation on the reasons for the deviation observed in the past. JRC.

40|$|A {{neural network}} {{structure}} {{has been used}} for unfolding neutron spectra measured by means of a Bonner Sphere Spectrometer set and a foil activation set using several neutron induced reactions. The present work used the SNNS (Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator) as the interface for designing, training and validation of the Multilayer Perceptron network. The back-propagation algorithm was applied. The Bonner Sphere set chosen has been calibrated at the National Physical Laboratory, United Kingdom, and uses gold activation foils as thermal neutron detectors. The neutron energy covered by the response functions goes from 0. 0001 eV to 14 MeV. The foil activation set chosen has been irradiated at the IEA-R 1 research reactor and measured at the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Metrology</b> Laboratory of IPEN-CNEN/SP. Two types of neutron spectra were numerically investigated: monoenergetic and continuous The unfolded spectra were compared to a conventional method using code SAND-II as part of the neutron dosimetry system SAIPS. Good results were obtained, indicating that the Neural Network can be considered an interesting alternative among the neutron spectrum unfolding methodologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the GUM (Guide to the expression of Uncertainty in Measurement) to calculate standard uncertainties for routing uranium isotope mass spectrometry measurements for nuclear safeguards and <b>nuclear</b> <b>metrology</b> is introduced. The benefit {{of this approach is}} an improved coherency and transparency of the uncertainty calculation, which should include contributions from all potentially significant sources of uncertainty to the mass spectrometric measurement result. The GUM approach puts the responsibility for quantifying the uncertainty on the analyst who makes the measurements and not with the user of the data. The uncertainty budget also serves to provide a feedback to the analyst. It identifies the dominant components of the measurement uncertainty and allows for better understanding, management, and improvement of the measurement process. Detailed examples of uncertainty calculations are presented for the most common types of uranium isotope measurements by multi-collector thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS); e. g., total evaporation, conventional Faraday cup measurements using internal normalization, and combined measurements using a secondary electron multiplier and Faraday cups. Various sources of uncertainty common to multi-collector TIMS, such as baseline noise, peak tailing effects, peak flatness, detector inter-calibration, and detector linearity response are discussed with respect to the determination of their uncertainty contribution and their influence on the results; Different approaches are explained with their advantages and disadvantages.

40|$|International audienceCoherent {{control of}} quantum systems has {{far-reaching}} implications in quantum engineering. In this context, coherent population trapping (CPT) involving dark resonances 1, 2 {{has played a}} prominent role, leading to a wealth of major applications including laser cooling of atoms 3 and molecules 4, optical magnetometry 5, light storage 6 – 8 and highly precise atomic clocks 9. Extending CPT methods to individual solid-state quantum systems has been only achieved in cryogenic environments for electron spin impurities 10 – 17 and superconducting circuits 18 – 21. Here, we demonstrate efficient CPT of a single nuclear spin in a room temperature solid. To this end, we make use of a three-level system with a Λ-configuration in the microwave domain, which consists of nuclear spin states addressed through their hyperfine coupling to the electron spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Dark state pumping requires a relaxation mechanism which, in atomic systems, is simply provided by spontaneous emission. In this work, the relaxation process is externally controlled through incoherent optical pumping and separated in time from consecutive coherent microwave excitations of the nuclear spin Λ-system. Such a pumping scheme with controlled relaxation allows us (i) to monitor the sequential accumulation of population into the dark state and (ii) to reach a new regime of CPT dynamics for which periodic arrays of dark resonances can be observed, owing to multiple constructive interferences. This work offers new prospects for quantum state preparation, information storage in hybrid quantum systems 22, 23 and <b>metrology.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> spins in solids have attracted considerable interest {{over the last years}} owing to their high level of isolation from the environment, leading to very long coherence times 24 – 26. The detection and control of individual nuclear spins is usually achieved by exploiting their hy-perfine coupling to an ancillary electronic spin. This can be performed by using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond 27, 28 whose spin triplet ground state (S = 1) can be optically initialized, coherently manipulated with microwave fields and read-out by optical means through its spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) intensity 29. Experiments making use of the hyperfine coupling between the NV defect and nearby long-lived nuclear spins are now reaching a level of control allowing to realize elaborate quantum information protocols 30 – 32. Here, we make use of electron spin transitions of a single NV defect to achieve coherent control of a single nuclear spin through CPT under ambient conditions. The spin system considered in this study is depicted in Fig. 1 a. The electronic spin of a single NV defect is coupled by hyperfine interaction with a nearby 13 C nuclear spin (I = 1 / 2). In the m s = 0 (| 0 e) electron spin mani-fold, the nuclear spin eigenstates are denoted |↑ and |↓, corresponding to the nuclear spin projections along the NV defect quantization axis. In the m s = − 1 (|− 1 e) electron spin manifold, efficient nuclear spin mixing can be obtained by exploiting the anisotropic component of the hyperfine interaction in combination with a magnetic field applied along the NV defect axis 34.
