The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) assessed the supplementary information supplied by the applicant on the diclazuril impurity/metabolite R 070016 {{and concluded that the}} compound is devoid of genotoxic activity.

The metabolic fate of diclazuril in chicken and turkey is qualitatively similar, diclazuril being the marker residue in tissues. At a zero withdrawal time, the theoretical consumer exposure to the total residues from both chickens and turkeys represents about 13 % of the ADI. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that applying a withdrawal period of zero day would not compromise consumer safety.

40|$|The modern Markov chain {{models of}} ionic {{channels}} in excitable membranes are numerically stiff. The popular numerical methods for these models require very small time {{steps to ensure}} stability. Our objective is to formulate and test two methods addressing this issue, so that the timestep can be chosen based on accuracy rather than stability. Both proposed methods extend Rush-Larsen technique, which was originally developed to Hogdkin-Huxley type gate models. One method, "Matrix Rush-Larsen" (MRL) uses a matrix reformulation of the Rush-Larsen scheme, where the matrix exponentials are calculated using precomputed tables of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The other, "hybrid operator splitting" (HOS) method exploits asymptotic properties of a particular Markov chain model, allowing explicit analytical expressions for the substeps. We test both methods on the Clancy and Rudy (2002) INa Markov chain model. With precomputed tables for functions of the transmembrane voltage, both methods are comparable to the forward Euler method in accuracy and computational cost, but allow longer time steps without numerical instability. We conclude that both methods are of practical interest. <b>MRL</b> <b>requires</b> more computations than HOS, but is formulated in general terms which can be readily extended to other Markov Chain channel models, whereas the utility of HOS depends on the asymptotic properties of a particular model. The significance of the methods is that they allow a considerable speed-up of large-scale computations of cardiac excitation models by increasing the time step, while maintaining acceptable accuracy and preserving numerical stability.

High levels of pesticide residues potentially expose daily the florists who han-dle cut flowers and possibly could endanger their health. A study was carried out to evaluate the risk for florists exposed to fungicide residues during normal profes-sional tasks. Cotton gloves were distributed to 20 florists (two pairs to each florist) and worn during two consecutive half days during normal professional tasks (from min 2 hours to max 3 hours/day) to measure their potential dermal exposure (PDE). Samples were analyzed with a multi-residue (QuEChERS) method validated by a laboratory accredited for pesticide residues and {{with a combination of}} gas and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. It appears from the results that a total of 54 fungicides with different toxicity classes were detected on cotton gloves. An average of 15. 53 mg/kg fungicide residues per glove sample was meas-ured. Six of 54 are suspected of causing cancer after prolonged or repeated expo-sure. Boscalid was both the active substance for which the highest maximum and average concentrations (26. 21 and 3. 47 mg/kg, respectively). Famoxadone had the most critical PDE (156 % AOEL for the maximum concentration).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Veterinary {{drugs are}} used in dairy cattle {{management}} mainly for therapy and prophylaxis of diseases, which chemicals may leave residues in milk. Human exposure and the unintentional consumption of residues of drugs can lead to side effects and development of resistant bacteria, representing a considerable concern to consumer health. This paper presents the occurrence of residues of veterinary drugs in milk from 2009 to 2011 in Brazil, monitored by the Official Program for Analysis of Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods of Animal Origin. A total of 961 samples were collected in the retail and evaluated for the main β-lactams, tetracyclines, amphenicol, aminoglycosides, quinolones, sulfonamides and avermectins. Residues of veterinary drugs did not exceed maximum residue limit (MRL); although, there is a considerable use of critically/highly important antimicrobials and avermectins in dairy cows, especially quinolones and tetracyclines. Doxycycline (9 %) and abamectin (1. 6 %) were detected, even though these substances are {{not intended to be}} used in milk producing animals for human consumption. Norfloxacin (15 %) was observed; although, there are <b>no</b> <b>MRL</b> established, consequently, <b>no</b> residue level should have been detected. No residues of streptomycin, chloramphenicol and β-lactams were confirmed. Milk in Brazil contains low levels of veterinary drugs so that toxicological risk regarding milk consumption could not be considered as a public health concern. However, {{due to the nature of}} the samples, which correspond to milk from several farms, it could occur a dilution effect. The absence of MRL established for norfloxacin prevents suitable interpretation of the findings and makes tough the control of these chemical residues in food. Detection of some antimicrobials and avermectins may be linked to extra-label use or noncompliance withdrawal periods suggesting that good veterinary practices are not being followed, since residues of unauthorized drugs have been detected...|$|R

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the United Kingdom received an application from Dow AgroSciences Ltd. {{to modify the}} existing MRLs for aminopyralid in food derived from ruminants in order to account for residues which occur in these commodities when livestock is fed with grass treated with aminopyralid according to the authorized GAPs in the United States, Canada, Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil. The EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for aminopyralid in ruminant meat, fat, liver, kidney and milk. The metabolism of aminopyralid has been elucidated in lactating goats and poultry. Parent aminopyralid is proposed as residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment for all products of animal origin. The residue levels in the imported {{food of animal origin}} should reflect livestock exposure from the intake of all feed crops treated with aminopyralid in the country of origin. Since EFSA does not have a comprehensive overview of the feeding practices and the aminopyralid residues in feed available in these countries, it is more appropriate to calculate the dietary burden on an international level, using internationally agreed methodologies. Thus, livestock dietary burden calculated by the JMPR was used to estimate the potential carry-over of residues into food of animal origin. Data from feeding studies indicate that the existing EU MRLs have to be raised for ruminant meat, fat, kidney and liver. For milk, eggs, poultry and swine products no modification of the existing EU <b>MRLs</b> is <b>required.</b> Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that residues in food commodities of animal origin from the use of aminopyralid on grass in third countries and the resulting MRL proposals will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|R

40|$|Consumer risk {{assessment}} {{relating to the}} maximum limits of pesticide residues is a crutial step in {{the approval of the}} plant protection products for an agricultural use. Although MRL is not a health limit it fully reflects the safety intake of the food containing residues of the pesticide for which the MRL has been set. MRL should be derived from the supervised residue field studies carried our according to the international rules and its final value is calculated by the statistical models. <b>MRL</b> value is <b>required</b> to be assessed for a dietary exposure risk. Residues dietary intake covered by the MRL {{is the result of the}} {{risk assessment}} which is then compared to the toxicological reference values of ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) and ARfD (Acute Reference Dose). Until recently, attention has focused on estimating chronic intake because long term effects have been of more concern. It has been recognized meantime that many of the commonly used pesticides can have adverse effects when a single dose with a high residue content is ingested. The probability of a high residue content can be increased since a variability of residues appears, mainly in units of fruit and vegetables. Such variability expressed as a variability factor at present, is one of the inputs into the International Estimated Daily Intake (IESTI) equation. The variability appears to be generally independent of the type of pesticide, however it still depends on many other factors. The pesticide deposition on the individual food unit is probably the most significant factor. Variability is variable itself and is very difficult to standardize. The MRL risk assessment conclusion differences are affected by many factors so the international regulatory bodies make an effort focused on the harmonization of the MRL risk assessment methodologies by the means of creating new tool like guidance documents or calculation models...|$|R
