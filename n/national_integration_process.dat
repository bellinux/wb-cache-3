That we shared a socialisation, and <b>national</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process?</b> That surely would be (nationalist) cultural integration, more David Miller than Will Kymlicka, the multiculturalist, speaking. Defending our political obligation {{in terms of our}} political membership just begs the question – this is surely a circular definition of solidarity. Why are we not equally politically responsible to foreigners and strangers? And, in moral terms, why should we follow the mawkish nationalist sentimentality of headline writers when they underline (and therefore mourn more) the six Britons among the 350 dead after a disaster. The horror here is surely the loss of life for all; not our special feelings for our co-nationals. Maybe we owe this to our families, our friends, or (even) our local communities. But those are not “citizenship” obligations, and it is not what is being asked on behalf of our anonymous co-nationals. This example may make us question whether we do indeed have more of an obligation of solidaristic equality to our co-nationals than others.|$|E

However, these distinctions tend to only blur differentiation between real and â€œfakeâ€ citiziens.

Media {{are found to}} play an important role to enhance the process, especially in disseminating government policies. After independence, the biggest task entrusted to the government of Malaysia was to integrate the different races together without taking away the ethnic identity of the races. The integration process reached a breaking and turning point during the incident of May 13, 1969 the bloody riot caused by racial tension. The government became more diligent and the media became one of the machinery by which the government continued to work on nation building and the integration of different races. One policy was implemented after another, from National Cultural Policy; New Economic Policy and the Rukun Negara. Revamp of education policies and the setting up of National Unity Department in the Ministry Of National Unity And Social Development was some of the major milestones in national integration. This conceptual paper is a reflection of the past policies and emulation of the present 1 Malaysia roadmap for national integration. It started out by defining the different means by which national integration can be achieved such as through the process of assimilation, integration and pluralism.

Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{analyzes}} Italian regionalism in {{a historical}} context. The evolution of regionalism {{as a result of}} the failure of national integration in Italy will be discussed in different time spans that are deemed critical in Italian political life. The thesis will elaborate on the historical and structural factors such as the localist culture, the presence of the Church, the North-South divide that acted as an obstacle on the way to a successful national integration. Finally, the interplay of these forces during the unification, the fascist and post-fascist periods will be analyzed with regard to the <b>national</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process.</b> The thesis will aim to address the following questions: (1) Given that neoregionalism in Italy is not a new phenomena, what are the reasons or the structural factors that had caused the persistence of regionalism in Italy despite the attempts to create a unified country? (2) How did the Italian state try to make the Italians? What kind of integration model was used to provide the integration and to what extent was it able to overcome the duality between the North and the South? (3) What is the nature of the neoregionalism in Italy, is it a result of the failure of 'making Italians?' and to what extent does it pose a threat to the national unity of the country? It is concluded that the rise of neo-regionalism in Italy can not be explained only by the old and more recent theories on regionalism without taking into consideration the sui generis historical background of the problem of regionalism in that country.

The data were collected during several months from some popular Cameroonian Football websites, where Cameroonians around the globe comment about Cameroonian football in particular and world football in general. The data were analyzed qualitatively along related themes to <b>national</b> <b>integration.</b> The study is particularly important in the context of Cameroon as a recurrent successful football nation in Africa because of its <b>national</b> unity, <b>integration</b> and longstanding peace, which contrast its very diverse and fragmented multicultural, multi ethnic and heterogeneous society, with over 200 ethnic groups. This record of peace which may be indicative of its <b>national</b> <b>integration</b> makes Cameroon an interesting case study to which none in the (Central and West African) sub-region may be comparable to. The strategies of the Cameroonian government in pulling together the different ethnic groups to be both, a recurrent successful football and peaceful nation were some of the issues of interest in the research. Despite the controversial natures of some of the arguments and the negative impacts of such sentiment-driven activities, the study generally suggests that, football in that particular context and other collective activities could be as important and influential as any major political or economic instruments in nation-building processes. The contribution of football seems significant in the <b>national</b> <b>integration</b> and peace <b>processes</b> in Cameroon. In a successful football nation like Cameroon, football may help divert attention from serious political and economic issues like poverty, government businesses, governance debates and underdevelopment. Because of the accumulated heritage in football and consequently its capacity to mobilize collective sentiments and love for the game, people especially the lay majority, tend to forget their differences because most of their attention and discourses are regularly focused on sporting events {{and in the case of}} Cameroon, football. Other literatures in the thesis suggest as well that sporting activities like football usually enhance social cohesion as well as lubricate national socio-economic and political <b>processes.</b> Asiasanat:Football, ethnicity, <b>national</b> <b>integration,</b> unity, tribalism...|$|R

The rapid flow of immigrants to Bali has caused some problems, though it is admitted that their arrival is also give a positive affect, both for the place of origin and the place of destination. Besides emerged from inter provincial migration, problem caused by inter regency migration seems to be critical and have to be overcame soon in the regional autonomy era. The strategy carried out has to be based on national demography policy, especially in relation with Undang-Undang No. 10, 1992 about ?Population Growth and Development of Wealthy Family?, and Undang-Undang No. 39, 1999 about ?Human Right?. Based on those regulations, it is stated that government not able to prohibit resident to do both inter provincial and inter regency mobility, because every resident have right to chose their residence and job according to their wish.

It {{sought to determine}} if internationally trained medical doctors have similar work qualifications as Scandinavian trained physicians and if the current <b>national</b> <b>integration</b> <b>process</b> is a cause of concern. It addresses {{the issue of the}} quality of the primary health care provided by IMGs, resident in Norway, as experienced by their Norwegian professional peers. Questionnaires were sent to 485 physicians. 327 returned the filled-in questionnaires and reported about their experiences with colleagues with a non-Scandinavian medical education. The returned questionnaires show how the respondents assess the professional, cultural, and communication skills of the foreign-trained physicians after their authorization as medical doctors in Norway. Interviews were conducted with representatives from the medical faculty, SAFH and the Norwegian Board of Health to discuss their plans for the future assessment and support of IMGs. Results: 1. Respondents express low satisfaction with IMGs trained in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, and point to inadequate language and communication skills as the number-one problem among these physicians. 2. Respondents report that the problems they see with the foreign trained physicians were compromising the quality of health care provided. Substantial proportions (5 %) of all reports conclude that poor communication skills are a very or fairly serious problem for patients, and of even greater concern, 4, 6 % of all respondents say that as a result of poor communication quality of care suffers and may put patients at risk. 3. Beyond the problems with communication, the Eastern Europe and World groups are united when it comes to IMGs medical professional skills (core medical knowledge, technical skills). Almost one third of the respondents pointed out that they are poorly satisfied with the quality of the professional skills of these IMGs. 4. Only a minority of respondents had concerns about IMGs respect for the autonomy of patients. 5. The solutions to the quality problems identified by the respondents and the interviewees include mandatory increased support and good parenting practices, better opportunities for continuing education and a stronger social and cultural training. To conclude, this study indicates that there are greater variations in the skill mix among internationally trained medical doctors than among their Scandinavian trained colleagues in tertiary health care. About one third of the reports point to more or less impaired quality of care. In 5 per cent of the reports these quality problems are closely linked to patient and colleague (dis) satisfaction. The problems are so grave in these cases that they may affect patient safety. The single most important problem identified in this report is inadequate language and communication skills. Given these results, it is clearly not a problem limited to certain facilities, professions, regions or places of education. Those working closely with foreign-trained physicians do, however, think that it is possible to introduce an educational program that might significantly alleviate the problems identified through this study...|$|E
