5|$|The network {{largely ignored}} the {{standard}} business model of 1950s TV, {{in which one}} advertiser sponsored an entire show, enabling it to have complete control over its content. Instead, DuMont sold commercials to many different advertisers, freeing producers of its shows from the veto power held by sole sponsors. This eventually became the standard model for US television. Some commercial time was sold regionally on a co-op basis, while other spots were sold <b>network-wide.</b>|$|E

25|$|By 1960, Silver City's 40,000 annual cross-Channel flights transported 220,000 {{passengers}} and 90,000 vehicles while <b>network-wide</b> freight haulage reached 135,000 tons a year. The following summer, the airline reached agreement with a French rival to co-finance {{construction of a}} branch line linking Le Touquet Airport with the nearby main railway line to reduce surface travelling time from/to Paris. Unsustainable losses {{as a result of}} the loss of the Libyan oil industry support flight contract, increasing competition from roll-on/roll-off ferries and the lack of suitable replacements for the ageing Bristol Freighters resulted in growing financial difficulties, culminating in Silver City's takeover by British United Airways (BUA) holding company Air Holdings in 1962.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1930s, the Metropolitan {{line was}} {{suffering}} from congestion caused by the limited capacity of its tracks between Baker Street and Finchley Road stations. To relieve this pressure, the <b>network-wide</b> New Works Programme, 1935-1940 included {{the construction of new}} sections of tunnel between the Bakerloo line's platforms at Baker Street and Finchley Road and the replacement of three Metropolitan line stations (Lord's, Marlborough Road and Swiss Cottage) between those points with two new Bakerloo stations (St. John's Wood and Swiss Cottage). The Bakerloo line took over the Metropolitan line's service to Stanmore on 20 November 1939. The branch remained part of the Bakerloo line until 1 May 1979, when similar congestion problems for the Bakerloo line caused by two branches converging at Baker Street led to the opening of the Jubilee line, initially created by connecting the Stanmore branch to new tunnels bored between Baker Street and Charing Cross.|$|E

2500|$|On October 13, 2014, CNBC HD was relaunched, {{due to the}} {{aforementioned}} <b>network-wide</b> switch to a full-screen 16:9 presentation. [...] The sidebar graphic was permanently removed as well (having started with Mad Money on August 4 {{of the same year}} and before that, during commercial breaks), which in turn, led to all other live shows being presented in full-screen 16:9 and therefore, eliminating the enhanced format altogether.|$|E
2500|$|Discussions on the livery for British Railways {{coaching}} stock in 1948 eventually {{settled on a}} <b>network-wide</b> two-tone livery of crimson lake and cream for corridor coaches, with all-over crimson lake being used for local, non-corridor stock. The colours were chosen {{to be different from}} those of any of the [...] "Big Four" [...] pre-nationalisation railway companies while retaining a traditional aspect. However many people were not happy with the loss of the traditional [...] "historic" [...] regional colour schemes as used by the former private companies.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, {{a group of}} natural {{heritage}} program directors began to develop <b>network-wide</b> information products.

In 1999, TNC’s natural heritage network and ABI formally joined forces, with the Conservancy transferring its databases, professional staff, and scientific standards and methodology to ABI.
