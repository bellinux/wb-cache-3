5|$|During World War II, Allison became {{involved}} in defence-related work. He was {{a consultant to the}} National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) from October 1940 to January 1941. In January 1941 the NDRC let him a contract to study the possibility of using beryllium as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator.</b> The team he assembled in Chicago would grow into the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear {{applications}} where graphite {{is used as}} a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator,</b> {{accumulation of}} Wigner energy followed by a sudden, spontaneous release may occur. Annealing to at least 250°C can release the energy safely, although in the Windscale fire the procedure went wrong, causing other reactor materials to combust.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of World War II between 1939 and 1941, Wigner led the Princeton group in a series of {{experiments}} involving uranium and two tons of graphite as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator.</b> In early 1942, Arthur Compton concentrated the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design, including Wigner's team from Princeton, at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. The name was a codename; Creutz was the first to conduct actual metallurgy research, and he hired its first metallurgist to work with him.|$|E
5000|$|Neutron {{radiation}} causes embrittlement of some materials, neutron-induced swelling, and {{buildup of}} Wigner energy. This {{is a process}} especially important for <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> and nuclear reactor vessels (see ductility).|$|R

5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with {{paraffin}} wax as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator,</b> and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a device that could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|The uses {{of carbon}} and its {{compounds}} are extremely varied. It can form alloys with iron, of which the most common is carbon steel. Graphite is combined with clays to form the 'lead' used in pencils used for writing and drawing. It is also used as a lubricant and a pigment, as a molding material in glass manufacture, in electrodes for dry batteries and in electroplating and electroforming, in brushes for electric motors and as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator</b> in nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Pile-1 {{was soon}} {{moved by the}} lab to a more remote site in the Argonne Forest, where its {{original}} materials were used to build an improved Chicago Pile-2. Another reactor, Chicago Pile-3, was built at the Argonne site in early 1944. This was the world's first reactor to use heavy water as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator.</b> It went critical in May 1944, and was first operated at full power in July 1944. The Metallurgical Laboratory also designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the B Reactor at the Hanford Engineer Works {{in the state of}} Washington.|$|E
50|$|Any solid {{can display}} the Wigner effect. The effect is of most concern in <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators,</b> such as graphite, {{intended}} {{to reduce the}} speed of fast neutrons, thereby turning them into thermal neutrons capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction involving uranium-235.|$|R
25|$|To control such {{a nuclear}} chain reaction, neutron poisons and <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> {{can change the}} portion of {{neutrons}} that {{will go on to}} cause more fission. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to shut the fission reaction down if monitoring detects unsafe conditions.|$|R
25|$|In the U.S., {{however, the}} first {{experimental}} atomic reactor (1942), {{as well as}} the Manhattan Project Hanford production reactors that produced the plutonium for the Trinity test and Fat Man bombs, all used pure carbon (graphite) <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> combined with normal water cooling pipes. They functioned with neither enriched uranium nor heavy water. Russian and British plutonium production also used graphite-moderated reactors.|$|R
5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a coolant and a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator.</b> The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, {{and it would have}} to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the {{reactors}} for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, {{and so it was}} chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator,</b> graphite was chosen {{on the basis of its}} availability compared with beryllium or heavy water.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, made {{the development of}} an atomic bomb a theoretical possibility. Fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop atomic weapons first, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries, were expressed in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted preliminary research in the United States in late 1939. Progress was slow until the arrival of the British MAUD Committee report in late 1941, which indicated that only 5–10 kilograms of isotopically enriched uranium-235 was needed for a bomb instead of tons of un-enriched uranium and a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator</b> (e.g. heavy water).|$|E
5000|$|RPMs geared for {{interception}} {{of nuclear}} threats usually incorporate a neutron detection technology. The {{vast majority of}} all neutron detectors deployed in RPMs to date relies on He-3 tubes surrounded by <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators.</b> Since the end of 2009, the global He-3 supply crisis [...] however has made this technology unavailable. The search for alternative neutron detection technologies has yielded satisfactory results.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> {{are used}} to produce [...] "thermal neutrons" [...] that have kinetic {{energies}} below 1 eV (T < 500K). Thermal neutrons {{are used to}} maintain a nuclear chain reaction in a nuclear reactor, and as a research tool in neutron science comprising scattering experiments and other applications (see below). The remainder of this article concentrates on the scattering of thermal neutrons.|$|R
50|$|Isotopes {{with a large}} scatter {{cross section}} and have a low mass are good <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> (see chart below). Nuclides which have a large {{absorption}} cross section are neutron poisons if they are neither fissile nor undergo decay. A poison that is purposely inserted into a nuclear reactor for controlling its reactivity {{in the long term}} and improve its shutdown margin is called a burnable poison.|$|R
5|$|Wigner led the Theoretical Group at the Metallurgical Laboratory that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Gale Young and Edward Creutz. The group's {{task was to}} design the production nuclear reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator</b> and water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial at the time. Water was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium or liquid metal as a coolants would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|Henry D. Smyth was a {{professor}} of physics {{and chairman of the}} physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949. During World War II, he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941, initially {{as a member of the}} National Defense Research Committee’s Committee on Uranium, and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. In late 1943, the President of Princeton University, Harold W. Dodds, began insisting that Smyth work part-time at Princeton, where there was a shortage of physicists because so many of them were engaged in war work. Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel, and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments. Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago, where he was in charge of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator,</b> and commuted from Princeton, working in Chicago on alternate weeks.|$|E
5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi {{to build a nuclear}} reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of natural uranium, or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd conducted a series of experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if they could find a suitable <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator.</b> They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was convinced that they would succeed if only they could get the materials.|$|E
50|$|Molten lead or {{lead-bismuth}} eutectic {{can be used}} as {{the primary}} coolant in a nuclear reactor, because lead and bismuth have low neutron absorption and relatively low melting points. Neutrons are slowed less by interaction with these heavy nuclei, (thus not being <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators)</b> and therefore help make this type of reactor a fast-neutron reactor. The coolant does however serve as a neutron reflector, returning some escaping neutrons to the core.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} {{numerical}} optimization study {{we have found}} that liquid para-hydrogen coupled cold <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> deliver 3 - 5 times higher cold neutron brightness at a spallation neutron source if they {{take the form of a}} flat, quasi 2 -dimensional disc, in contrast to the conventional more voluminous shapes used by now. In the present paper we describe a simple theoretical explanation of this unexpected behavior, which is based on the large difference in para-hydrogen between the values of the scattering mean free path for thermal neutrons (in the range of 1 cm) and its much larger equivalent for cold neutrons. This model leads to the conclusions that the optimal shape for high brightness para-hydrogen <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> is the quasi 1 -dimensional tube and these low dimensional moderators can also deliver much enhanced cold neutron brightness in fission reactor neutron sources, compared to much more voluminous liquid D 2 or H 2 moderators currently used. Neutronic simulation calculations confirm both of these theoretical conclusions. Comment: 6 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of modernized research reactor IBR- 2 M for condensed matter investigation on neutron beams {{is planning to}} start in 2010. The new complex of moderators will start operation together with the reactor. This complex will consist of some parts: water pre- and post-moderators, water grooved moderators and three cold moderators. We are developing a technology of utilization of aromatic hydrocarbons as a moderator material for them. There are some reasons of our choice (good moderation properties, resistance to radiation, etc.). The main idea of conception is to load chamber of cold moderator by small balls (4 – 5 mm in diameter) of frozen aromatic hydrocarbons. These balls will be delivered by helium flow, which {{will be used as}} a coolant as well. Use of such a technology gives us opportunity to avoid a lot of problems of radiation effects. Neutron spectra onto beams, project of complex of moderators for the IBR- 2 M reactor as well as necessity of cold <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> for condensed matter investigation will be presented. Key words: cold <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators,</b> research reactors, aromatic hydrocarbons. 1...|$|R
5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to retain its own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator</b> instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting with}} Fermi yielded no supplies, {{but it did}} result in Pontecorvo {{receiving}} an offer from von Halban and Placzek to join the Tube Alloys team at the Montreal Laboratory in Canada. There was some concern from Sir Edward Appleton over his appointment, not because of Pontecorvo's political beliefs, but {{on account of the}} fact that he was not a British national, and there were already a large number of foreign scientists working on Tube Alloys. Appleton was ultimately persuaded due to Pontecorvo's reputation, and the fact that good physicists were in short supply. Pontecorvo was officially appointed to Tube Alloys on 15 January 1943, and arrived in Montreal with his family on 7 February 1943. The Montreal team designed a nuclear reactor using heavy water as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator,</b> but lacked the quantity of heavy water needed. In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which resulted in a resumption of cooperation between the United States and Great Britain, merging Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|When Britain began {{planning}} to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, {{it was decided}} to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly graphite was chosen as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator</b> because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns {{about the possibility of a}} catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> {{are thus}} {{materials}} that slow down neutrons. Neutrons are most effectively slowed by colliding with {{the nucleus of}} a light atom, hydrogen being the lightest of all. To be effective, moderator materials must thus contain light elements with atomic nuclei that tend to scatter neutrons on impact rather than absorb them. In addition to hydrogen, beryllium and carbon atoms are also suited to the job of moderating or slowing down neutrons.|$|R
50|$|In graphite-moderated {{reactors}} fissile uranium rods {{are placed}} inside graphite blocks. These blocks act as <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> and their {{purpose is to}} slow down the fast moving neutrons so that nuclear chain reaction can occur with thermal neutrons. During their use, some of the non-radioactive (C-12) in graphite gets converted into radioactive C-14 by capturing neutrons Once the graphite blocks are removed during station decommissioning their induced radioactivity qualifies them as low-level waste, and disposal is a tough job.|$|R
50|$|The latest {{technology}} being deployed at ports uses pressurized natural helium to directly detect fast neutrons, {{without the need}} for bulky <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators.</b> Utilizing recoil nuclei following neutron scatter events, natural helium glows (scintillates), allowing photomultipliers (e.g. SiPMs) to produce an electrical signal. Introducing moderators and lithium-6 to capture thermalized neutrons further increases the detection capabilities of natural helium, at the expense of losing the initial information of the neutrons (such as energy) and reducing sensitivity to shielded neutron-emitting materials.|$|R
5|$|Wigner led the Theoretical Group that {{included}} Creutz, Leo Ohlinger, Alvin M. Weinberg, Katharine Way and Gale Young. The group's {{task was to}} design the reactors that would convert uranium into plutonium. At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a graphite <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator</b> and water cooling.

Working seven days a week, the group designed the reactors between September 1942 and January 1943. Creutz studied the corrosion of metals in a water-cooled system, and designed the cooling system. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
5|$|The French {{scientists}} {{made good}} {{progress on the}} design of an aqueous homogeneous reactor, but there were doubts that their work was relevant to the main task of the British Tube Alloys project, that of building an atomic bomb, and resources were tightly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed plutonium, but its use in a bomb seemed a remote possibility. The MAUD Committee therefore felt that they should relocate to America. It made sense to pool resources, and America had advantages, notably access to materials such as heavy water. American scientists such as Henry D. Smyth, Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor urged that the Cambridge team be sent to America. On the other hand, American officials had concerns about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the Cambridge group was British, and about French patent claims. These included patents on controlling nuclear chain reactions, enriching uranium, and using deuterium as a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator.</b> There were also two patent applications in conjunction with Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather on the production and use of plutonium. George Thomson, the chairman of the MAUD Committee, suggested a compromise: relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
25|$|These {{reactors}} use soluble nuclear salts {{dissolved in}} water and mixed with a coolant and a <b>neutron</b> <b>moderator.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The liquid metal {{coolants}} {{used are}} poor <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators,</b> thus such systems strongly favor U-238/Pu-239 usage; adding moderators to enable use with U-235 or Th-232/U-233 would be [...] "feasible but unattractive". Conversely, {{water is a}} good moderator and this rules out exclusive plutonium breeding in such systems. Gas-cooled systems with U-238/Pu-239 (Gas Cooled Fast Breeder Reactor (GCFR) and EM2 concepts) are described as feasible but with difficult fuel processing, while molten salt systems with U-238/Pu-239 (e.g. MSFR) are only [...] "somewhat feasible." ...|$|R
500|$|Plutonium was {{produced}} by irradiating uranium-238 in three 250 MW nuclear reactors at the Hanford site. In theory they could produce [...] of plutonium per megawatt-day, or about [...] per month. In practice, production never approached such a level in 1945, when only between [...] {{was produced}} per month. A Fat Man core required about [...] of plutonium, of which 21% fissioned. Plutonium production fell off during 1946 due to swelling of the reactors' graphite <b>neutron</b> <b>moderators.</b> This {{is known as the}} Wigner effect, after its discoverer, the Manhattan Project scientist Eugene Wigner.|$|R
50|$|The high-flux {{research}} reactor produces neutrons through fission in a specially designed, compact-core fuel element. <b>Neutron</b> <b>moderators</b> cool the <b>neutrons</b> to useful wavelengths, {{which are then}} directed at a suite of instruments and used to probe the structure and behaviour of many forms of matter by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering, and to probe the fundamental physical properties of the neutron. Nothing goes to waste: Fission products and gamma rays produced by nuclear reactions in the reactor core are also used by specialised instruments, which forms {{an important part of}} the instrument suite.|$|R
