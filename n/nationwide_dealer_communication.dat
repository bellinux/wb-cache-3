The {{industry in the}} U.S. and Canada is well-established, having had its primary period of growth during the post-World War II era {{with the advent of}} affordable central air conditioning and heating systems for both residential and commercial applications. The advent of HVAC/R products in Latin America and the Caribbean is also well-established, but has emerged in more recent years as those economies have grown and products have become more affordable and have matured from luxury to necessity.The estimated annual market for residential HVAC/R products in the Americas is approximately US$35 billion. Residential central air conditioners are manufactured primarily by seven major companies that together account for approximately 90% of all units shipped in the U.S. each year. These companies are: Carrier Corporation (Carrier), a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation, Goodman Manufacturing Company, L.P.

40|$|The aim of Bachelor’s thesis „Estonian Car <b>Dealers</b> Marketing <b>Communication</b> Before and After the Beginning of Recession in Estonia” was to analyze, how Estonian car dealers’ {{marketing}} communication {{has changed over}} the period of economic recession. The author of the thesis believed, that the {{marketing communication}} had changed relevantly, in the field of channels used for marketing and in the field of messages sent to consumers. Also the author believed that the financial resources available to marketing divisions had not been decreased, but rather preserved at the same level, which was in the growth period. The advertisements appearing in Postimees before the economic downturn and after were used to fulfill the research objectives. The time periods were second half of the year 2006 and {{the second half of the}} year 2008 respectively. Also, interviews with the leading car-dealers’ marketing executives were performed. The research methods used were content analysis, qualitative content analysis and interviews. The analysis unit that was used for the content analysis was one car advertisement. The essential categories were placement of advertisement in the paper (page number), size of the advertisement and principle marketing message, secondary marketing messages, specialness of the advertisement, product visualization, use of slogan, product price disclosure, coloring of the advertisement and the use of secondary objects or sceneries in the advertisement. There were 59 distinguished advertisements from the economic growth period and 62 from the downturn period. Those individuals being interviewed were the Marketing Executives or their representatives, which were working in one of the top 10 car dealers firms. The goal of applying the content analysis was to get an overview of how the advertisements, and therefore in some proportion the marketing communication, had changed after the start of economic downturn. This overview was done by comparing advertisements from the economic growth period with the ones from the downturn period. The aim of the interviews was to get secondary opinions to the results found from the content analysis and also to give an opportunity to the marketing executive to represent his or hers opinions and views regarding the two periods and also the near-future statuses in that field. The research results revealed that the marketing communication had changed noticeably after the start of economic downturn, focusing now more on price communication and on the observation of the competitive car dealers’ marketing campaigns. Also the types of messages communicated were consolidated, with the focus on the price being now more important than in the growth period. Likewise the diversity of the marketing messages declined in the downturn period and advertisements increasingly shared the similarity between them. Executives noted that somewhat significant change had been in the use of marketing channels too. With the decrease of print media (newspapers, magazines), more resources were invested in the televised advertisement. Despite the decrease of sales the marketing budgets were not cut according to the executives. By their words, the budgets were planned at the same level as before the downturn period. Nevertheless executives decreased marketing spending, because the results from the market were not as expected. With the support of the results of the content analysis and interviews, it can be concluded, that main reason for the changes in marketing communication was the insufficient support by the loan-companies to the consumers. Therefore customers were unable to buy the product because of the high entry-point (deposit made when buying). Decreasing sales forced the marketing divisions now to communicate more strongly the price and the benefits gained when making a sale, thus hoping to sustain the sales levels. When revealed, that this strategy did not succeed as planned, the actions head in two directions, the first one being to cope with the changed, cut spending and hope to survive the recession and the second one being to sustain marketing levels, hoping to improve customer awareness and satisfaction, so when the new growth period arrives, the company can get its marketing investments back with a well proportioned revenue. The latter being the right decision, according to the empirical studies, which were presented in part 1. 4...|$|R

The GNDU liaises with other European Police Forces and has strategic partners in the United Kingdom, Spain, Holland and Belgium; countries where OCGs affecting the Irish jurisdiction tend to be the most proactive. In 2014 the Garda National Drugs Unit arrested 60 persons in connection with drug trafficking offences with € 698, 234, 000 of controlled drugs seized which included Cocaine, Heroin, Herbal Cannabis, Cannabis Resin and Ecstasy. In total 43 significant seizures were made. Major investigations carried out by the Garda National Drugs Unit in 2014 are detailed in the report.

In response to the issue of Drug Related Intimidation under Action 5 of the National Drug Strategy 2009 – 2016, An Garda Síochána has developed a clear policy as recommended un-der the Strategy in conjunction with the National Family Support Network. A framework has been developed ‘the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme’ and is now in place on a National level. An Inspector has been nominated in every Garda Division throughout the country to act as the single point of contact (SPOC) to ensure that there is an appropriate and effective response to this is-sue. An Garda Síochána will ensure a confidential, safe and effective means of dealing with reports of intimidation and providing families with sufficient support. An Garda Síochána continue to meet our obligations under the National Drugs Strategy 2009 - 16.
