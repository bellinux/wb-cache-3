40|$|The purpose if this {{research}} {{paper is to}} analyze how the two directives, The Racial Equality Directive (2000 / 43 /EC) and of The Equal Treatment Directive (2000 / 78 /EC), were transposed into national legislation. One objective of the paper is to present and analyze some outcomes of the transposition: the national legislation on combating discrimination and the national institutions in this field. The second objective is to present and analyze the first case against Romania regarding the transposition of The Racial Equality Directive (2000 / 43 /EC) and of The Equal Treatment Directive (2000 / 78 /EC) into national legislation: preliminary ruling C- 310 / 10 (Agafi ei and Others, Romania) and the possible impact of this case. Council Directive 2000 / 43 is implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. Directive 2000 / 78 /EC is establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. The case stems from a salary dispute Agafitei and others, staff of the national anti-corruption board and management research to fight organized crime and terrorism.

Thailand is in some sense peculiar in that it brought disproportionately many complaints to the WTO dispute settlement system while it was hardly challenged by other Members. In contrast to the GATT era, Korea has become legally very aggressive under the WTO system. It is also noted that Japan has been rarely challenged since October 1998.

In this paper, I cast the net more widely, to include harmonization of procedure through Community legislation, namely directives. Judicial and legislative harmonization of national administrative law are part of the same phenomenon and should be examined as such. Once considered together, I argue, the possible effects of procedural harmonization for Community and the Member States come into focus. First, drawing on American literature that critically assesses similar developments in American administrative law, I suggest that expanded access to courts and administrative agencies might impair the quality of administrative policymaking in the Member States. Interest groups might distort the policymaking process, courts might unduly interfere with expert agencies, and agency action might be delayed. Second, again relying on the American reaction to the “ferment” of the 1960 s and 1970 s, I argue that the direction that Community harmonization has taken might compromise the constitutional powers of national parliaments and governments over state administration, to the advantage of national courts...|$|E

40|$|M. A. The {{study of}} the two {{possible}} routes for the magnetite slurry pipeline between Phalaborwa and Maputo was motivated because of the impact it can have on the environment. Since the early 1970 's the environment has {{become more and more}} important to the people that live in it. By law any development should by forgone by an Environmental Impact Assessment, and for that reason this study was undertaken. Environmental Impact Assessment (E. I.

Further more an Environmental Impact Assessment means a <b>national</b> <b>procedure</b> for evaluating the likely impact of a proposed activity on the environment. It is thus a tool used to minimise the impacts of human development on the environment. This tool will be used to compare the two routes and to identify the route with less Environmental Impact. Within the growing field of environmental science and engineering, there is increasing interest in and use of Environmental Assessment (EA). In this form of assessment, the experts evaluate the probable impact of a range of alternative actions that have been proposed in response to a problem, in this case the placing of a pipeline from Phalaborwa to Maputo. Environmental Impacts may be considered in light of economic, social, or security constraints; hence the lightest impact is not necessarily always chosen by planners...|$|E
40|$|Background: In the Netherlands we select {{candidates}} for the postgraduate GP training by assessing personal qualities in interviews. Because of differences in the ratio of number of candidates and number of vacancies between the eight departments of GP training we questioned whether {{the risk of being}} rejected diverged amongst them. Objective: The research question {{of this study was to}} which degree department of choice, candidates' characteristics and qualities assessed during interviews explain admission into GP training. Methods: A nationwide observational study was conducted of all candidates who applied for postgraduate GP training in 2009 / 2010. Application ratio per department, candidates' characteristics (gender, age, region of medical school and times of application) and qualities (motivation, orientation on the job, personal attributes and learning needs) were collected. Outcome measures were admission to interview and admission to GP training. Results: The study population addressed 542 candidates. Sixty three candidates were rejected on application letter (11. 6 %). So 479 candidates were admitted to the interview, of which 340 were admitted to the GP training (71 %). Gender and region of medical school outside North West Europe were associated with admission to the interview. Department of choice had a strong association with admission in both stages (RR: 0. 30 to 0. 74; 0. 20 to 0. 79 respectively), while candidates' qualities explained admission (RR: 1. 09 - 1. 25) as well.

40|$|BackgroundRelenza {{represents}} the first neuraminidase inhibitor (NI), {{a class of}} drugs that also includes the drug Tamiflu. Although heralded as breakthrough treatments in influenza, NI efficacy has remained highly controversial. A key unsettled question is why the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved more cautious efficacy statements in labelling than European regulators for both drugs. MethodsWe conducted a qualitative analysis of United States and European Union regulatory appraisals for Relenza to investigate the reasons for divergent regulatory interpretations, pertaining to Relenza’s capacity to alleviate symptoms and reduce frequency of complications of influenza. ResultsIn Europe, Relenza was evaluated via the so-called <b>national</b> <b>procedure</b> with Sweden as the reference country. We show that FDA reviewers, unlike their European (i. e. Swedish) counterpart, (1) rejected the manufacturer’s insistence on pooling efficacy data, (2) remained wary of subgroup analyses, and (3) insisted on stringent statistical analyses. These differences meant that the FDA was less likely to depart from prevailing regulatory and scientific standards in interpreting trial results. We argue that the differences are explained largely by divergent institutionalised review methodologies, i. e. the European regulator’s reliance on manufacturer-compiled summaries compared to the FDA’s examination of original data and documentation from trials. ConclusionsThe FDA’s more probing and meticulous evaluative methodology allowed its reviewers to develop ‘deep’ knowledge concerning the clinical and statistical facets of trials, and more informed opinions regarding suitable methods for analysing trial results. These findings challenge the current emphasis on evaluating regulatory performance mainly in terms of speed of review. We propose that persistent uncertainty and knowledge deficits regarding NIs could have been ameliorated had regulators engaged in the public debates over the drugs’ efficacy and explained their contrasting methodologies and judgments. Regulators use major resources to evaluate drugs, but if regulators’ assessments are not effectively disseminated and used, resources are used inefficiently...|$|E

During {{the first phase of the}} work were identified 239 plants belonging from ‘Sangiovese’, ‘Canaiolo nero’ and ‘Colorino’, which were subjected from the Department ‘Coltivazione e Difesa delle Specie Legnose’, section of Plant Pathology, to tests for virus detection according to the <b>national</b> <b>procedure</b> for clonal selection. Candidate clones virus-free were planted in two different vineyards located in the ‘Chianti Classico’ area in order to make comparative ampelographic, yield and technological observations. Plants from each candidate clone were maintained isolated as primary source in screenhouse from the Plant Pathology section. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Politics (M. i. P. A. F.) with a specific ministerial law (D. M. n. 31434 of 01 March 1999), has authorised the homologation of four ‘Sangiovese’ clones, named ‘CCL 2000 / 1 ’, ‘CCL 2000 / 2 ’, ‘CCL 2000 / 3 ’ and ‘CCL 2000 / 4 ’, afterward the ministerial commission approved the homologation of three additional ‘Sangiovese’ clones named ‘CCL 2000 / 5 ’,‘CCL 2000 / 6 ’ and ‘CCL 2000 / 7 ’.

40|$|Economic {{development}} and rapid social change have significantly modified family and child-rearing patterns across OECD countries. This review {{of early childhood}} education and care (ECEC) in twenty OECD countries describes the social, economic, conceptual and research factors that influence early childhood policy. These include increasing women's labour market participation; reconciling work and family responsibilities on a more equitable basis for women; confronting the demographic challenges faced by OECD countries; and in particular, addressing issues of access, quality, diversity, child poverty and educational disadvantage. How countries approach such issues is influenced by their social and economic traditions, their understandings of families and young children, and by accumulated research {{on the benefits of}} quality early childhood services. Starting Strong II outlines the progress made by the participating countries in responding to the key aspects of successful ECEC policy outlined in the previous volume, Starting Strong (OECD, 2001). It offers many examples of new policy initiatives adopted in the ECEC field. In their conclusion, the authors identify ten policy areas for further critical attention from governments. The book also presents country profiles, which give an overview of ECEC systems in all 20 participating countries. This book is relevant for the many concerned by child development, work/family balance and early childhood education and care policy. Countries covered: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.
