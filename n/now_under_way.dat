5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel is <b>now</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> {{in several countries}} with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E

25|$|At the {{cemetery}} owned {{and run by}} the town council is a chapel built in 1855., In recent years, the building has not {{been used as a}} chapel, and the fabric has deteriorated. This is attributed to a lack of maintenance by the council due to financial constraints. However, the shallowness of the foundations {{is said to be the}} principal cause. The chapel now requires considerable expenditure if it is to survive, but on 23 January 2007 the town council took the decision to demolish it. In 2007, Bourne historian Rex Needle applied for and obtained a Grade II listing from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which secures the building from demolition for the foreseeable future. In 2008, the effort is <b>now</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> to identify a source of funding (estimated around £400,000) to render the building fit for long-term community use.|$|E

2500|$|Smart's {{tactics to}} defend the Habbaniya {{cantonment}} was to mount continuous bombing and strafing attacks with as many aircraft as possible. At 05:00 on 2 May, 33 aircraft from Habbaniya, out of the 56 operational aircraft based there, and eight Wellington bombers, from RAF Shaibah, began the attack.

50|$|Until 1995 the {{national}} government had been responsible for centrally planning and implementing water and sanitation projects. Under the 1995 constitution Ethiopia became a federal state, which implied the decentralization of many functions to lower levels of government.

2500|$|There was no {{significant}} British interest in South Africa until the colony was seized by British forces in 1795 under General Sir James Craig during the French Revolutionary War, the Netherlands having fallen to Bonaparte in the same year. [...] British policy was to secure the colony against French encroachment {{in the name of}} the Dutch Stadtholder Willem V. [...] Under the terms of the short-lived Treaty of Amiens in 1803, Cape Colony was handed back to the Netherlands, or the Batavian Republic as Bonaparte wished it to be known. [...] In 1806, with the Napoleonic Wars proper <b>now</b> <b>under</b> <b>way,</b> Britain again invaded and seized Cape Colony, this time with permanent designs on it.

Very slowly the boat crept toward the shore, gaining more speed at every moment.

I was now alone in the Reindeer, seeking feverishly to capture a third prize. The first junk I took after was a clean miss, for it trimmed its sheets and shot away surprisingly into the wind. By fully half a point it outpointed the Reindeer, and I began to feel respect for the clumsy craft. Realizing the hopelessness of the pursuit, I filled away, threw out the main-sheet, and drove down before the wind upon the junks to leeward, where I had them at a disadvantage.|$|E

We must see about getting on board <b>now,</b> and <b>under</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
6000|$|This was a {{beautiful}} bit of war-practice by King Olaf on land. By another stroke still more compendious at sea, he had already settled poor young Hakon, and made him peaceable for a long while. Olaf by diligent quest and spy-messaging, had ascertained that Hakon, just returning from Denmark and farewell to Papa and Knut, both <b>now</b> <b>under</b> <b>way</b> for England, was coasting north towards Trondhjem; and intended on or about such a day to land in such and such a fjord {{towards the end of}} this Trondhjem voyage. Olaf at once mans two big ships, steers through the narrow mouth of the said fjord, moors one ship on the north shore, another on the south; fixes a strong cable, well sunk under water, to the capstans of these two; and in all quietness waits for Hakon. Before many hours, Hakon's royal or quasi-royal barge steers gaily into this fjord; is a little surprised, perhaps, to see within the jaws of it two big ships at anchor, but steers gallantly along, nothing doubting. Olaf with a signal of [...] "All hands," [...] works his two capstans; has the cable up high enough at the right moment, catches with it the keel of poor Hakon's barge, upsets it, empties it wholly into the sea. Wholly into the sea; saves Hakon, however, and his people from drowning, and brings them on board. His dialogue with poor young Hakon, especially poor young Hakon's responses, is very pretty. Shall I give it, out of Snorro, and let the reader take it for as authentic as he can? It is at least the true image of it in authentic Snorro's head, little more than two centuries later.|$|E

50|$|Much of the {{motivation}} for the regrade had been to increase land values, but the area opened up—the heart of today's Belltown—was left as a strip cut off from {{much of the rest}} of the city by the remaining eastern half of the hill, whose western face offered no route of approach. Meanwhile, property-owners and investors hesitated to build on the remaining portion of the hill, because they considered it likely that their buildings would eventually be destroyed in the next phase of the regrading process, which was <b>now</b> well <b>under</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R

50|$|In August 2015, {{planning}} permission was approved for {{the demolition of}} the old disused Argos building and the British Heart Foundation shop.
