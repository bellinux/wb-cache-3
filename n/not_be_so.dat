5|$|In United States v. Hamilton (1883), the Court reaffirmed {{its earlier}} {{holdings}} that certificates could not issue from motions to quash an indictment. And, in United States v. Rosenburgh (1868) and United States v. Avery (1871), the Court {{held that a}} motion to quash an indictment could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> certified, even if the motion called into question {{the jurisdiction of the}} circuit court.|$|E
5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> similar in different directions.|$|E
5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed. Due {{to the nature of}} the game, the longer the player plays, the larger the save file becomes. These same issues plagued , but a performance patch to improve New Vegas seems unlikely. Sawyer said that it is a core-engine issue that can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> easily patched.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{retrieving}} {{all three}} plasma crystals and destroying the Omegamatic Warp Drive, Keen is confronted by McMire, who {{tells him that}} he will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> lucky the next time before teleporting away; Keen responds that he still defeated McMire, and will make it home in time for dinner. The game then congratulates the player on winning, and warns that with McMire still at large, Keen never knows when he will be called on again to defend the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species that may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but {{little research has been}} done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative and comprehensive source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Burns had a {{significant}} influence on Alexander McLachlan and some influence on Robert Service. While this may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> obvious in Service's English verse, which is Kiplingesque, it is more readily apparent in his Scots verse.|$|E

25|$|A {{generalized}} electric {{scalar potential}} {{is also used}} in electrodynamics when time-varying electromagnetic fields are present, but this can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> simply calculated. The electric potential and the magnetic vector potential together form a four vector, so that the two kinds of potential are mixed under Lorentz transformations.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple of}} seasons later in 1983–84 Genoa would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> lucky, despite beating champions Juventus {{on the final}} day of the season, the club were relegated even though they {{finished}} the season with the same number of points as surviving Lazio; this was because Lazio had recorded better results in matches against Genoa.|$|E
25|$|While some U.S. policymakers, {{including}} Condoleezza Rice, {{have linked}} democracy promotion to achieving peace and security, the relationship may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> clear, some scholars maintain, given that {{a level of}} instability {{is inherent in the}} democratization process in the short-run, even if a politically reformed Middle East in the long-term could be an asset for international security.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{a design}} {{constraint}} {{is that the}} microwave beam must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> intense as to injure wildlife, particularly birds. Experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations. Suggestions {{have been made to}} locate rectennas offshore, but this presents serious problems, including corrosion, mechanical stresses, and biological contamination.|$|E
25|$|The {{policy must}} not be {{unreasonable}} in the special sense given to the term in Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation (1947), that is, the policy must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who applied his or her mind to the matter could have arrived at such a view.|$|E
25|$|One part {{of space}} {{is not by}} itself and in the {{absolute}} {{sense of the word}} equal to another part of space, for if it is so for us, it will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> for the inhabitants of the universe B, and they have precisely as much right to reject our opinion as we have to condemn theirs.|$|E

25|$|The {{next season}} for the club in Serie A would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> fortunate, they were relegated in 17th place. Some notable high points of the season {{included}} a 1–0 victory over Roma at the Stadio Olimpico. A team from Rome would also be the opposition for Messina's other most impressive result of the season, they stunned Lazio by beating them 4–0 {{on the last day}} of the season.|$|E
25|$|Various {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} God establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some atheists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit). Taking a nuanced position, philosopher Del Ratzsch suggests that the application of the razor to God may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> simple, least of all when we are comparing that hypothesis with theories postulating multiple invisible universes.|$|E
25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to you to be red it might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> in reality, but if you seem to yourself to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.|$|E

As it was, she had a comfortable conviction that she herself was the very last person Sylvia would be likely to suspect.|$|R
25|$|After {{the heavy}} defeat to New Zealand their next {{international}} fixture would be during their second World Cup where the Tongans would again {{be placed in}} another tough group with France, Papua New Guinea again and the South Africans. Tonga would face South Africa in their first match of the tournament {{where they would be}} comfortable victors in a 66–18 drubbing, however the rest of the tournament would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> kind to the Tongan side with losses to both France and Papua New Guinea meaning the Tongans would again fail to make it past the first stage of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Growth {{continued}} {{throughout the}} decade of the 1940s, with the CCW growing from a network of 126 affiliate store with 50,000 members and sales of $4.7 million in 1941 to 211 stores with about 90,000 members and sales of about $11.5 million in 1948. The next decade would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> kind, however, as the Central Wholesale organization began a long term decline owing in large measure to the growth of supermarkets in the United States. This loss of size and strength moved the CCW to seek formal consolidation with other like-minded enterprises in the region.|$|E
25|$|One {{feature of}} a plant is its phyllotaxy. The {{arrangement}} of leaves on the plant body is such that the plant can maximally harvest light under the given constraints, and hence, one might expect the trait to be genetically robust. However, it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>so.</b> In maize, a mutation in only one gene called abphyl (abnormal phyllotaxy) was enough to change the phyllotaxy of the leaves. It implies that sometimes, mutational tweaking of a single locus on the genome is enough to generate diversity. The abphyl gene was later on shown to encode a cytokinin response regulator protein.|$|E
