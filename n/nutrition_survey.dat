40|$|Abstract Background Malnutrition {{prevalence}} and mortality rates are increasingly used as essential indicators {{to assess the}} severity of a crisis, to follow trends, and to guide decision-making, including allocation of funds. Although consensus has slowly developed on the methodology to accurately measure these indicators, errors {{in the application of}} the survey methodology and analysis have persisted. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify common methodological weaknesses in <b>nutrition</b> and mortality <b>surveys</b> and to provide practical recommendations for improvement. Methods Nutrition (N = 368) and crude mortality rate (CMR; N = 158) surveys conducted by 33 non-governmental organisations and United Nations agencies in 17 countries from October 1993 to April 2004 were analysed for sampling validity, precision, quality of measurement and calculation according to several criteria. Results One hundred and thirty (35. 3 %) <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveys</b> and 5 (3. 2 %) CMR surveys met the criteria for quality. Quality of surveys varied significantly depending on the agency. The proportion of <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveys</b> that met criteria for quality rose significantly from 1993 to 2004; there was no improvement for mortality surveys during this period. Conclusion Significant errors and imprecision in the methodology and reporting of <b>nutrition</b> and mortality <b>surveys</b> were identified. While there was an improvement in the quality of <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveys</b> over the years, the quality of mortality surveys remained poor. Recent initiatives aimed at standardising <b>nutrition</b> and mortality <b>survey</b> quality should be strengthened. There are still a number of methodological issues in <b>nutrition</b> and mortality <b>surveys</b> in humanitarian emergencies that need further study. </p...|$|R

The Laboratory inherited most of the equipment and some of the staff of the Survey, but not the accommodation. Hugh's powers of organisation were again much in demand. Hugh was appointed as the first University Reader in Human Nutrition in 1951. In 1954, Hans Adolf Krebs succeeded Sir Rudolph Peters as Professor and Head of the Department of Biochemistry, to which the Laboratory was transferred and closed shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{summarize}} some methodological problems with <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveys</b> in Eastern European countries. A brief review of the literature was con-ducted and a questionnaire was sent to a sample of researchers regarding dietary assessment methods used, technical aspects of data collection, and data analysis. The findings suggest that de-spite considerable work and effort devoted to <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveys,</b> little information exists on current food and nutrient consumption by individuals, either from total population studies or from stud-ies of subgroups within the population. Furthermore, there is a lack of uniformity in calculating nutritive values of consumed foods with respect to quantification of amounts, accounting for differences in food-preparation methods and percentage of losses in recipes. These findings indicate a need for standardi-zation, both within and between countries, for all types of dietar...|$|R

50|$|In consequence, {{it is not}} {{surprising}} that Hugh was invited in 1945 to take the mobile laboratories to Düsseldorf, where he set up the headquarters for the <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Survey</b> Group for the British Control Commission. Hugh again achieved extraordinary feats of organisation, setting up five teams in different cities, under leaders drawn from his colleagues in Oxford and from elsewhere. Hugh was made an honorary Brigadier and was subsequently awarded the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the work}} of the Oxford <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Survey</b> was carried out by a small mobile team, which was sent to {{industrial}} towns, such as Accrington, Merthyr, Chesterfield, and Dundee. It was experience in organising and managing all the facets of this work that made Hugh the most clearly qualified person to be invited by the Dutch Government in exile to conduct surveys of the nutritional status of the Dutch population affected by the famine of the last months of the war in Europe. Following hectic preparations, Hugh and his team went to the Netherlands as the <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Survey</b> Group SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force), just before the German surrender. He found a base in Leiden, where 26,000 biochemical analyses were said to have been carried out in just two weeks. The pace was hectic without doubt for the Oxford team and for their Dutch colleagues, but the situation was dire. The actual state of the famine needed to be assessed, treatment and response recorded, and the results set out to inform future action in parallel circumstances. Medically, the best treatment needed to be discovered and applied.|$|E

He subsequently returned to the US and worked for a decade on maternal and child nutrition research, including initiating the Cebu Longitudinal Household Health and <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Survey</b> with two economics colleagues. He started the China Health and <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Survey</b> in the mid and late 1980s and it was out of this experience that he wrote a series of papers which created the concept of the nutrition transition.

40|$|Background: National {{surveys have}} {{demonstrated}} a long-term decrease in mean energy intake in Japan, despite {{the absence of}} a decrease in the prevalence of overweight and obesity. We aimed to examine whether total energy intake of survey respondents is associated with completion of an in-person review of dietary records and whether it affects the trend in mean energy intake. Methods: We pooled data from individuals aged 20 – 89 years from the National <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Surveys</b> of 1997 – 2002 and the National Health and <b>Nutrition</b> <b>Surveys</b> of 2003 – 2011. We conducted a linear mixed-effects regression to estimate the association between total energy intake and the lack of an in-person review of semi-weighed household dietary records with interviewers. As some respondents did not have their dietary data confirmed, we used regression coefficients to correct their total energy intake. Results: Compared with respondents completing an in-person review, total energy intake was significantly inversely associated with respondents not completing a review across all sex and age groups (P < 0. 001). After correction of total energy intake for those not completing a review, mean energy intake in each survey year significantly increased by 2. 1...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} review was to collate and review data from national <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveys</b> to examine changes and trends in dietary sugars intake. Only thirteen countries (all in the developed world) appear to report estimates of sugars intake from national <b>nutrition</b> <b>surveys</b> at more than one point in time. Definitions of dietary sugars that were used include ‘total sugars’, ‘non-milk extrinsic sugars’, ‘added sugars’, sucrose 2 ̆ 7 and ‘mono- and disaccharides’. This variability in terminology across countries meant that comparisons were limited to within countries. Hence trends in dietary sugars intake were examined by country for the whole population (where data permitted), and for specific or combined age and sex subpopulations. Findings indicate that in the majority of population comparisons, estimated dietary sugars intake is either stable or decreasing in both absolute (g/d) and relative (...|$|R
