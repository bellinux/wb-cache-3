40|$|The {{theme of}} death, {{prominent}} in Der Zauberberg, finds a memorable and shocking expression in Hans Castorp's snow vision, where he enters a temple and finds two old women devouring a child. Commentators have mostly interpreted this scene as a philosophical allegory of cosmic suffering, inspired by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, and suggested to Mann by {{the legend of}} Dionysus. These interpretations ignore both the brutal vividness of the scene and its Northern European connotations. Its associations with witchcraft, cannibalism, and human sacrifice are explored, with particular reference to texts by Heine and Nietzsche with which Mann was familiar and where such images occur. As a malign sacrifice, the scene is also connected to two other parodic sacrifices in the novel: the blood-libel for which <b>Naphta's</b> father was crucified, and the vegetarian Communion celebrated by the Dionysiac figure of Peeperkorn. © 2006 W.

40|$|Life, death, {{disease and}} Eros are themes of {{universal}} relevance {{that have been}} addressed in works of science, philosophy, literature and art throughout recorded human history. In the early 20 th century, the unprecedented scale of human extermination during World War I necessitated the adaptation of old ideas to a new reality. This is manifest {{in the work of}} the German author Thomas Mann, whose developing ideas on life, death, disease and Eros are clearly apparent in his novel Der Zauberberg (1913 - 1924). Der Zauberberg is set at a Swiss tuberculosis sanatorium in the years leading up to World War I. The main protagonist, Hans Castorp, arrives at the sanatorium as a visitor and is subsequently diagnosed with tuberculosis. During his sanatorium stay, Castorp comes into contact with three pedagogic figures: Ludovico Settembrini, Leo <b>Naphta</b> and Mynheer Peeperkorn. These men represent various attitudes towards life, death, disease and Eros. The humanist Settembrini, for example, affirms life but is repulsed by Eros, disease and death; the Jesuit ascetic <b>Naphta</b> glorifies erotic suffering and death while denying life, and the coffee magnate Peeperkorn celebrates life and Eros – yet to a pathological extent. My thesis follows the dialogic clash between the views of these pedagogues, as well as their influence on Hans Castorp, and is divided into sections that relate these views to their sociological implications. After examining the nature of death, life and disease within the novel, I relate these to the novel’s portrayal of society. I follow this with an investigation of the connection between death, life, disease and Eros, and conclude by examining these themes within their sociological context in Der Zauberberg. The conceptions of life, death, disease and Eros in Der Zauberberg are largely borrowed, following Thomas Mann’s creative technique of “Montage”, which allowed him to incorporate themes, concepts, paraphrased passages and quotations from other thinkers into his own work. These borrowed ideas create a complexity of textual relationships that corresponds to the theory of intertextuality; accordingly, my thesis examines Thomas Mann’s novel from an intertextual angle. Although Der Zauberberg has been the subject of intensive, source-critical study, the newer field of intertextual theory has largely been ignored, notable exceptions being the analyses of Thomas Mann’s works by Barbara Beßlich, Claudia Gremler, Michael Maar and Franziska Schößler. These scholars have narrowed the original, prohibitively wide scope of intertextual theory to enable intertextual analysis of individual texts. Following their example, I limit my definition of the intertext to philosophy, sociology and psychology, specifically to the works of the philosopher-poet Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg), of the philosophers and sociologists Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche, and of the psychologist and sociologist Sigmund Freud. My analysis of Der Zauberberg identifies connections to the intertexts within the novel, and examines how clearly these are presented and what form they take. Most importantly, I investigate the heuristic impact of the novel’s intertextuality, that is, how the intertextual relationships in Der Zauberberg influence the reader’s interpretation of both the nature of life, death, disease and Eros, and their effect on culture in the novel...|$|E
40|$|SSCI-VIDE+ING+YCP:ATU:CMI:YSCInternational audienceIn {{order to}} meet the EU’s {{renewable}} energy targets by 2020 (up to 10 % share in all forms of transportation fuels), a realistic alternative to first generation bio-fuels is to produce hybrid bio/fossil fuels by co-refining biomass pyrolysis liquids (PL) with crude oil fractions in a conventional oil refinery. However, co-refining may lead to severe changes in products quality, such as a higher aromaticity and residual oxygenates in the hybrid fuels that are produced. For the case of co-FCC (fluid catalytic cracking), various strategies can be implemented to limit those impacts along this complex value chain ranging from bio-mass to bio-gasoline. A first strategy was tested to preserve the gasoline yield and quality by implementing a PL hydrotreating prior to co-processing, to lower their oxygen content. By following the changes in conversion, yields and gasoline composition (aromatics/olefins vs saturated alkanes) {{as a function of the}} bio-oils hydrotreating severity, measured in a Micro Activity Test (MAT) reactor, it was shown that a compromise could be reached between bio-oil upgrading severity and FCC products yields and quality (RON, PIONA analysis). An optimum in the gasoline yields and quality was found by adding 10 to 25 wt. % of a mildly deoxygenated bio-oil to a standard VGO, via a co-processing carried out on a commercial equilibrated FCC catalyst. A second strategy was to adapt the FCC catalysts to the presence of oxygenate molecules typical of the bio-feedstock still present in the upgraded pyrolytic liquids. To that end, Y zeolites, which are the main active component in FCC catalysts, were up-graded by creating a mesoporosity in addition to the microporosity to favor the diffusion of the large lignocellulosic fragments throughout the cracking catalysts, according various hierarchical post synthesis processes. The main effects of replacing progressively micro- by meso-porosity are i) to slightly increase <b>naphta</b> yields (Fig. 1), ii) to decrease coke formation at high conversion (Fig. 2), iii) to increase the unsaturated fraction in gaseous (C 3 -C 5) (Fig. 3) and liquid products (not shown here), and iv) to decrease markedly the remaining oxygenated products in the liquid fraction (mainly alcohols, acids and phenolics, from 31 PNMR measurements). These effects underline the positive role of creating a mesoporosity in hierarchical FCC catalysts, in line with cracking mechanistic features. The combined impact for these two strategies on co-FCC will be discussed as a guideline for minimizing the cost of bio-oils upgrading and thereof the hybrid transportation fuels, while maintaining their quality within the specification limits.

40|$|A {{chemical}} cluster {{producing a}} variety of products is situated in Stenungsund, Sweden. In 2010 the ethylene consumption of the cluster (currently covered by import and a steam cracker converting e. g. <b>naphta)</b> increased due to the start-up of a new polyethylene (PE) plant by Borealis AB. This work investigates the opportunity to cover the current ethylene import (i. e. 200 000 tonnes/year) {{by the introduction of}} a biorefinery plant (reducing fossil fuel dependence and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the cluster). High material and energy efficiency is of utmost importance to achieve economic competitiveness. Hence, heat integration is essential. A simulation model for a biorefinery is established in Aspen Plus based on literature review and personal contacts with experts. A process integration study is conducted using pinch analysis of simulation results. The aim is to investigate the integration consequences (e. g. potential energy savings and economical aspects) of combining a stand-alone lignocellulosic ethanol and a stand-alone ethanol dehydration plant into a biorefinery producing ethylene from lignocellulosic feedstock via the fermentation route. Several process configurations of the biorefinery are investigated, e. g. the integration of the biorefinery with the existing cluster based on results obtained from a total site analysis (TSA) (Hackl, et al., 2010). In the lignocellulosic ethanol production spruce (749 MW) is converted to ethanol (337 MW) and a lignin-rich co-product (370 MW), which can be utilised as fuel in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant supplying steam (for hot utility and direct injection into process streams) and electricity. The stand-alone ethanol plant results in excess solid residues (86 MW) and electricity (24 MWel). In the ethylene production, ethanol (337 MW) is converted to ethylene (307 MW). The stand-alone ethylene plant requires external fuel (16 MW) to cover hot utility demand. Moreover, electricity (4 MWel) and steam for direct injection (25 MW) must be produced externally. The results indicate that energy savings (40 % and 28 % reduction of minimum hot and cold utility respectively) can be achieved by integrating the two stand-alone processes into a biorefinery. Moreover, the integration opportunity to eliminate external fuel, steam and electricity requirements by firing of excess solid residues arises. It is shown that the minimum hot utility demand can be further reduced by 59 % by introducing a MVR in the biorefinery (Bio-MVR), which corresponds to a 75 % reduction compared with the two stand-alone processes. The results show that the excess solid residues of the biorefinery can eliminate the external fuel requirement by flue gas integration or deliver VHP (41 bar) steam to the existing cluster. The lowest ethylene production cost (1. 0 €/kg ethylene) is obtained for the Bio-MVR...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Ethylene and {{propylene}} {{are important}} chemical feedstocks {{for the production of}} polyethylene and polypropylene. Ethylene and propylene can be produced by various methods including steam cracking of liquefied natural gas (LNG), <b>naphta</b> or light olefin fractions. The methanol to olefin (MTO) process provides an alternative means of producing ethylene and propylene, where ZSM- 5 is frequently used as catalyst due to its hydrophobicity, strong acidity, molecular sieve properties and low tendency towards coking, which makes ZSM- 5 one the most popular zeolite catalysts in the industry. The oil crisis 1973 and the second oil crisis in 1978 caused the development of a commercial MTO process. Mobil Research and Development Corporation built a fixed-bed pilot plant to demonstrate the feasibility of the MTO as well as methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process. When the oil price dropped again during the 1980 ’s, further developments of commercial processes were stopped for the time being. However, investigations on a bench scale are still pursued, and applications for patents are still submitted. During this study ZSM- 5 was synthesized with a hydrothermal method, which produced agglomerated polycrystalline grains with characteristic ZSM- 5 morphology and a Si/Al ratio of approximately 40. The synthesis time, synthesis temperature and aging time were varied while keeping all the other synthesis parameters constant in order to determine their influence on crystallite size. The synthesis time was varied between 12 - 72 hours, synthesis temperature was varied between 130 - 170 °C and aging time between 30 - 90 minutes. Using SEM to determine crystal size, it was found that a variation in the aging time produced the largest crystallites (average of 21. 6 μm ± 10. 8 μm) while also having the largest influence on crystallite size followed by synthesis temperature (average of 13. 1 μm ± 4. 9 μm) and finally synthesis time (average of 5. 7 μm ± 0. 4 μm). In all cases XRD and SEM confirmed the formation of ZSM- 5. To evaluate the as-synthesized ZSM- 5 and compare it to a commercial ZSM- 5 catalyst, Catalyst A using the MTO process, ZSM- 5 was synthesized for 72 hours at 170 °C with an aging time of 60 minutes before synthesis. The as-synthesized as well as Catalyst A’s agglomerated polycrystalline grains were sieved into three size fractions: smaller than 75 μm, 75 - 150 μm and 150 - 300 μm. All six ZSM- 5 fractions of ZSM- 5 were used as catalysts for the MTO process in a fixed bed reactor at 400 °C, atmospheric pressure and a 20 wt% methanol to water feed. At 3. 5 hours time on stream (TOS), the intermediate 75 - 150 μm fraction had the highest light olefin selectivity for both the as-synthesized as well as Catalyst A, followed by the 150 - 300 μm fraction and finally the smaller than 75 μm fraction with the lowest light olefin selectivity. From this results {{it is clear that the}} as-synthesised ZSM- 5 did not perform as well as Catalyst A. While the intercrystalline voids of the agglomerated ZSM- 5 form second-order pores where self-diffusion is enhanced, the increased diffusional barriers created by the intercrystalline boundaries reduce the diffusion rate, promoting secondary reactions at the strong Brönsted acid sites thereby reducing ethylene and propylene selectivity. Coking reduces access to the Brönsted acid sites and plays a more influencial role for smaller crystallite sizes. Accordingly, the smaller than 75 μm fraction had the lowest light olefin selectivity, while the 150 - 300 μm fraction was probably least influenced by coking. The increased pathways for products and reagents in the 150 - 300 μm fraction resulted in more secondary reactions taking place within this catalyst than the 75 - 150 μm fraction explaining the superior performance of the 75 - 150 μm fraction. Since the grain size determines the ratio of the external to the internal surface areas as well as the amount of intercrystalline boundaries in the catalyst, it follows that the catalytic activity and polycrystalline grain size ratio should actually be tailored when optimising the product distribution of the ZSM- 5 catalysed MTO process. The as-synthesized ZSM- 5 didn’t perform very well when compared to Catalyst A and modification of the synthesis method is recommended. Master...|$|E
40|$|Developing new gas {{fields in}} cold and harsh {{environment}} requires cost effective technology for removal of water, heavy hydrocarbons (HHC) and carbon dioxide. Operating at such low temperatures requires {{a technology that}} do not experience freeze out and prevents hydrate formation. Mono- Ethylene Glycol (MEG) and methanol (MeOH) are both used as hydrate inhibitors in the industry today. Freezing point of MEG and MeOH is - 13 &# 176;C and - 98 &# 176;, respectively. By mixing MeOH and MEG together, a freeze out temperature lower than the freezing point of the components themselves will be experienced. In addition the mixture will function as a hydrate inhibitor, preventing hydrates from forming. A process utilizing this mixture, operating at low temperature, is of great interest since it can eventually simplify the pretreatment process of sales gas and/or LNG. A literature review of different dehydration methods for natural gas was performed in thesis, together with different hydrate inhibition technology. Physical absorption as a method for removal of CO 2 is also presented. A collection of experimental data for freeze out temperature, hydrate formation temperature and solubility in mixtures of water, MEG and MeOH, was performed and used {{as a basis for}} evaluating accuracy of the Cubic Plus Association- Equation of state (CPA-EoS) to calculate freeze out, hydrate formation and solubility in such mixtures. Two different CPA-EoS was evaluated for solubility calculations: CPA-DTU and CPA-NeqSim. CPA-NeqSim was used for calculations of freeze out and hydrate formation in mixtures of water, MEG and MeOH, and showed good accuracy. CPA-DTU was chosen for simulations performed in HYSYS. Four different process solutions has been performed and evaluated in HYSYS using the CPA-DTU. Two processes were designed for production of sales gas, where one processes had an initial CO 2 content of 2 mole %, and the other 15 mole % CO 2. Flow rate of gas was 20 MSm 3 /d. The first process included an extraction process for dew point control of the gas, with injection of a MeOH-MEG mixture to avoid freeze out and hydrate formation. A fractionation process was also included, making liquid propane, butane and <b>naphta.</b> The second process was expanded with an absorption process downstream the extraction process for removal of CO 2 from 15 mole % to 2, 5 mole %. A MeOH-MEG-water mixture was used as physical solvent in the absorption process. A case study was performed on the two cases, {{to see if it was}} possible to achieve LNG-specifications for water, CO 2 and HHC by using a MeOH-MEG mixture. A cascade process was implemented for liquefaction of the natural gas and for process integration with the extraction process and the absorption process. Results from the simulations performed in HYSYS show that the mixture achieves LNG specifications for water and HHC of 1 ppm and 1000 ppm, repectively. This is achieved in an extraction process using an expander, where injection of MeOH-MEG is used for prevention of freeze out and hydrate formation. An absorption process is installed downstream the extraction process for removal of CO 2 from 15 mole % to 2, 5 mole %. A case study was performed to evaluate if a MeOH-MEG-water mixture could reach CO 2 specifications of 50 ppm in a physical absorption process. It was clearly stated that unfeasible circulation rates was necessary with the operating temperatures and pressures chosen in this thesis. An adsorption process was therefore installed downstream the absorption process for deep removal of CO 2 to 50 ppm. After have met all specifications regarding water, CO 2 and HHC, the natural gas was liquefied in a convential cascade process using pure refrigerants. The cascade process was integrated with the extraction and absorption process and proved to reduce the power consumption of the absorption process with 50 %, for the case with 15 mole % CO 2. This thesis indicates that the biggest potential for a MeOH-MEG mixture lays in processing of gas for sales gas. For a CO 2 content of 2 mole %, a simple extraction process with injection of MeOH-MEG was used to achieve low water and HC dew point of the gas. For a CO 2 content of 15 mole % an absorption process using a MeOH-MEG-water mixture as physical solvent was used to achieve a CO 2 content of 2, 5 mole % in the sales gas. However; high losses of MeOH are indicated for the extraction process, and as much as 0, 53 Sm 3 /h is lost. The loss of MeOH in the absorption process is calculated to 0, 02 %, and make up of MeOH is therefore needed for both the extraction and absorption process. The absorption process is operating with a circulation of 5047 Sm 3 /h, consisting of a MeOH-MEG-water mixture. Loss of methane is calculated to 1, 4 % and total power consumption is 20 MW. Over 40 % of the MeOH lost in the extraction process follows the propane product in the fractionation process. Specification for MeOH in propane is therefore not achived, and also CO 2 content in propane exceeds the specifications. This indicates that the process needs further optimization to achieve all specifications related to NGL and condensate for natural gas. Evaluating other mixtures like MEG-TEG could be interesting to reduce the loss of solvent in the extraction process, and achieve these specifications. &# 8195; </p...|$|E
