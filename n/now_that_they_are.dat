A better educated public leads to a more efficient workforce, and can also lead the country to technological breakthroughs in industry and manufacturing. These countries will also experience much less severe famine <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> able to trade successfully on a global scale.|$|E

The same imagination that led us to slight or overlook their sufferings, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> forever lost to us, magnifies their estimable qualities ...

While she lived, her existence never seemed necessary to my happiness; but no sooner did I lose her, than it appeared {{to me as if}} I could not live without her.|$|E

UNICEF sent Aiken on another mission in May 2005, to northern Uganda, to witness the plight of children called [...] "night commuters", who flee the villages each night to sleep in streets and shelters in hopes of avoiding being kidnapped by the Lord's Resistance Army. He was sent to Kabul and Bamyan, in Afghanistan in April 2007, where he was able to spend time with children in their classrooms; he also visited a health center for women and children where he administered oral polio vaccinations to babies. He observed that Afghani children, after being forbidden for so many years by the Taliban regime to attend school, are eager to return to school <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> once again allowed to receive an education. Aiken spent his 2007 Christmas in Mexico with the children affected by the floods in the states of Chiapas and Tabasco. In late June and early July 2008, UNICEF sent Aiken to Somalia and Kenya.|$|E
