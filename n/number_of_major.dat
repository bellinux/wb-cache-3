Drawing from its Native American and Yankee roots, along with later {{immigrant}} groups, Massachusetts has produced a number of writers, artists, and musicians.

40|$|In some fields—notably, foreign languages—second majors make up {{an unusually}} large share of the {{students}} receiving degrees. If we compare the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> second <b>majors</b> in a field with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> first <b>majors,</b> we see that second majors range from 3 %– 5 % <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> first <b>majors</b> in fields like communication and psychology to 10 %– 16 % in economics and mathematics but jump to significantly higher percentages in foreign languages. In 2001 the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> second <b>majors</b> in foreign languages was 28. 0 % <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> first <b>majors,</b> and it increased to 38. 6 % in 2013...|$|R
40|$|Declining <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>majors</b> {{have become}} a {{pressing}} concern for chairs of English and Foreign Language departments. With the celebration of STEM disciplines and students' and parents' concerns about the job prospects for humanities graduates, English and Foreign Language department chairs find themselves needing {{to fight for the}} health <b>of</b> our <b>majors</b> in ways that we did not need to in previous decades. And, of course, it becomes imperative to focus on recruiting because declines in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>majors</b> affect everything we do [...] our ability to run upper-level courses, hire new faculty, and make a strong case university resources...|$|R
5|$|The Hustler {{was a major}} {{critical}} and popular success, gaining {{a reputation as a}} modern classic.

5|$|After William the Conqueror {{defeated}} Harold Godwinson and the English at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, {{he continued}} to face resistance to his rule {{in the north of}} England. For a number of years, William's position was very insecure. In order to project his influence northwards to control the people of the Danelaw (an area that had for a time been under the control of Scandinavian settlers), he constructed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> castles in the North and Midlands of England: including those at Warwick, Nottingham and York. After gaining control of York, the Conqueror turned southwards and arrived at the Roman and Viking city of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms {{with a long}} history in many languages, many {{variations}} have been developed, including forms with a quasi-musical poetic diction in Urdu. Ghazals have a classical affinity with Sufism, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> Sufi religious works are written in ghazal form. The relatively steady meter {{and the use of the}} refrain produce an incantatory effect, which complements Sufi mystical themes well. Among the masters of the form is Rumi, a 13th-century Persian poet.|$|E
30|$|Sites can {{strategically}} leverage this affect by consciously tying “new” {{activities to}} essential departmental tasks. For example, both VTech and BU started Studio Physics and an LA program {{around the same}} time as PhysTEC. For both institutions, the introductory course transformation helped increase student engagement and interest in physics in general—cutting failure rates and increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>majors.</b> Attracting more students into physics creates a bigger pool of potential teachers; however, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> teachers does not automatically increase linearly with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>majors.</b> For example, undergraduates may enjoy serving as LAs but without explicit encouragement, they may not associate that with a career in high school teaching.|$|R

5|$|Australia {{competed in}} Pool D—along with Dominican Republic, Italy and Venezuela—in {{the first round}} at Cracker Jack Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The other three teams were able to field a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Major</b> League players.

Italy is among the top nations in Europe and had access to Italian-American players under the eligibility rules for the tournament. Thus, Australia was considered the underdog in the pool.|$|E
5|$|CSU began issuing outlooks in December1997 and {{initially}} predicted 9named storms, 5hurricanes, and 2major hurricanes would {{occur in the}} upcoming season. Later, in April1998, CSU released a forecast calling for 10named storms, 6hurricanes, and 2major hurricane. The predictions by CSU in June and August1998 remained {{the same as the}} forecast in April. Additionally, forecasters at CSU predicted that the El Niño event that began in 1997 would dissipate either before or shortly after the 1998 season began. The WRC predicted 8named storms and 5hurricanes in early 1998, but did not include a forecast for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has 12.1named storms, of these 6.4reach hurricane strength, and 2.7major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Additional, the 1950-2000 CSU average for a normal season is 9.6named storms, of these 5.9reach hurricane strength, and 2.3become major hurricanes. In December1995, CSU predicted that only 8named storms would form and 5of those would become hurricanes; no specific <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> hurricanes was given. However, in April1996, CSU revised their forecast, stating that 11named storms would develop, with seven of those intensifying into a hurricane, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. In June, CSU predicted 10named storms, 6hurricanes, and 2major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1996 was 10named storms and 6hurricanes, though there was no prediction on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Henry's wealth {{allowed him}} to {{maintain}} what was probably the largest curia regis, or royal court, in Europe. His court attracted huge attention from contemporary chroniclers, and typically comprised a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> nobles and bishops, along with knights, domestic servants, prostitutes, clerks, horses and hunting dogs. Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were particularly important to the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling the gaps between the official structures and the king.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Yahoo! Sports {{reported}} that Braun's name appeared {{three times in}} records of Biogenesis of America, a Coral Gables clinic alleged to have distributed performance-enhancing drugs to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>Major</b> League Baseball players who tested positive for banned substances. One entry noted that Braun owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000. Braun's name was not listed next to any specific PEDs, unlike {{some of the other}} players mentioned in the records. Braun released a statement maintaining that his attorneys had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any further dealings with the clinic.|$|E

The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>major</b> multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of track and field events held within them.
