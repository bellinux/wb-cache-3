A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the <b>nasal</b> <b>bot</b> <b>flies</b> Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions.

Although cuterebrid <b>bot</b> <b>flies</b> are among the physically largest and most-studied insect parasites of mammals, the only study conducted on metabolic consequences of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism revealed a surprisingly small effect of <b>bot</b> <b>flies</b> on host metabolism. Here we test the prediction that <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism increases the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), particularly in juveniles who have not previously encountered parasites and have to allocate energy to growth. We found no effect of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism on adults. In juveniles, however, we found that RMR strongly increased {{with the number of}} <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae hosted. For a subset of 12 juveniles during a year where parasite prevalence was particularly high, we also compared the RMR before versus during the peak of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> prevalence, allowing each individual to act as its own control. Each <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larva resulted in a ~ 7. 6 % increase in the RMR of its host while reducing juvenile growth rates. Finally, <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism at the juvenile stage was positively correlated with adult stage RMR, suggesting persistent effects of <b>bot</b> <b>flies</b> on RMR. This study is the first to show an important effect of <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> parasitism on the metabolism and growth of a wild mammal. Our work highlights the importance of studying cost of parasitism over multiple years in natural settings, as negative effects on hosts are more likely to emerge in periods of high energetic demand (e. g. growing juveniles) and/or in harsh environmental conditions (e. g. low food availability) ...|$|R

40|$|Human myiasis {{caused by}} bot fl ies of nonhuman animals is rare {{but may be}} increasing. The {{treatment}} of choice is laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy with larva removal and intraocular steroids. Ophthalmomyiasis caused by Hypoderma spp. should {{be recognized as a}} potentially reversible cause of vision loss. Ophthalmomyiasis interna is invasion of the globe by larvae of any species of oestrid flies; ophthalmomyiasis externa involves only the external ocular structures (1). Dermatobia hominis, endemic to tropical or subtropical areas, and Oestrus ovis (sheep bot fly) cause most cases of ophthalmomyiasis (2). Both typically cause ophthalmomyiasis externa (2). Only 2 bot flies inhabit Nearctic circumpolar regions: the Caribou bot fly (Hypoderma tarandi) and the Caribou <b>nasal</b> <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> (Cephenemyia trompe), a nonhuman pathogen (2). H. tarandi is a nonbiting fly whose obligate endoparasitic larvae typically affect caribou throughout their circumpolar range (2, 3). From late June to early September. the fly lays eggs directly on the guard hairs of the caribou (2, 3). Once deposited, eggs hatch into larvae that penetrate skin (3). They move subcutaneously to reach the animal’s dorsal region, where they cut breathing holes and are encased within granulomatous cysts, termed warbles. There they develop for 9 – 11 months; in May or June of the following year, they leave the animal and pupate on the ground (3). Mated adult females are capable of long flights (≈ 900 km) in search of suitable hosts (3). Infestations by H. tarandi in humans are rare but are likely underreported (4). Related species, H. bovis and H. lineatum, inhabit various regions of North America, Europe, and Asia and have also been implicated in human disease (2, 5).

With the aim to investigate the presence of this myiasis in autochthonous horses and donkeys from southern Italy and to study the seasonal trend of larval infection, 212 native horses were necropsied in two slaughterhouses in the Apulia region (site A) from January to November 2003, and 120 native horses and two donkeys in one slaughterhouse in Sicily (site B) from January to October 2003. Thirteen of 212 and 5 of 120 horses examined from sites A and B, respectively, were infected by <b>nasal</b> <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae. Both donkeys examined were positive. Two hundred and thirteen larvae, representing all stages, were collected from the throat region, the turbinates and beyond the lamina cribrosa of the ethmoid bone, in the cerebral cavity. Third larval stages were retrieved from April to September with the highest mean burden in site A in May and in July in site B. The simultaneous presence all three larval stages at site B suggests the existence of two or more overlapping generations.

Some L 3 collected from sites A and B presented morphological characteristics of both R. usbekistanicus and R. purpureus. The presence of mixed features on the L 3 of Rhinoestrus collected from the same animals may be explained by the existence of a single species of Rhinoestrus presenting different morphotypes or of two species of Rhinoestrus which are both present in southern Italy since this area is midway between eastern and African countries where these two species have been reported...|$|E
40|$|Given the ubiquity and {{evolutionary}} importance of parasites, {{their effect on}} the energy budget of mammals remains surprisingly unclear.

We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) and cold-induced [Vo. sub. 2]-max (under heliox atmosphere) in 20 free-ranging individuals, of which 4 individuals were infected by one or two larva. We found that RMR was significantly higher in chipmunks infected by <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae (mean [+ or -] SE = 0. 88 [+ or -] 0. 05 W) than in uninfected individuals (0. 74 [+ or -] 0. 02 W).

The present experiment aimed to evaluate if that reported resistance difference against GIN also occurred against Oestrus ovis infestation and also to evaluate the influence of O. ovis infestation on the gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) infections. SI (n = 12) and IF (n = 12) young male lambs were weaned at 2 months of age {{and moved to a}} paddock (0. 3 ha) with Brachiaria decumbens grass, where they also received concentrate ration. The animals were kept together during the experimental period (September to early December 2009). Fecal and blood samples were taken from all animals every 2 weeks and body weight and nasal discharge score (oestrosis clinic signs) were recorded on the same occasion. In early December 2009, all lambs were sacrificed and O. ovis larvae and GIN were recovered, counted and identified according to the larval stage. All animals were infested by different larval instars of O. ovis without any statistical difference between breeds (P > 0. 05). The SI lambs had an average of 24. 8 larvae, and the intensity of infection ranged between 14 and 39 larvae, while the IF lambs showed an average of 23. 5 larvae with the minimum and maximum from 11 to 36 larvae, respectively. SI lambs presented the lowest nematode fecal egg counts (FECs) and the lowest mean numbers of Haemonchus contort us, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Strongyloides papillosus, however, there was no significant differences between group means (P > 0. 05). Inverse relationship between numbers of O. ovis larvae and gastrointestinal nematodes was observed in both breeds. SI sheep showed a significant increase in blood eosinophils and total IgE serum levels and these variables were negatively correlated with nematode FEC. A negative correlation was observed between total IgE serum level and H. contortus burden in both breeds. In conclusion, there was no breed difference regarding O. ovis infestation and in each breed, animals with more <b>nasal</b> <b>bot</b> <b>fly</b> larvae tended to display smaller worm burden.
