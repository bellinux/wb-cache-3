In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment.

25|$|People {{with only}} a casual concern for Internet privacy need not achieve total anonymity. Internet users may protect their privacy through {{controlled}} disclosure of personal information. The revelation of IP addresses, non-personally-identifiable profiling, and similar information might become acceptable trade-offs for the convenience that users could otherwise lose using the workarounds needed to suppress such details rigorously. On the other hand, some people desire much stronger privacy. In that case, they may try to achieve Internet anonymity to ensure privacy — use of the Internet without giving any third parties the ability to link the Internet activities to personally-identifiable information of the Internet user. In order to keep their information private, people <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> with what they submit to and look at online. When filling out forms and buying merchandise, that becomes tracked and because the information was not private, some companies are now sending Internet users spam and advertising on similar products.|$|E

2500|$|In 638, {{there was}} yet another {{incident}} where Wang, by then the minister of ceremonies, suggested that high-level officials {{should not have to}} yield to imperial princes when their processions meet.

[...] Although Colorado law already defined marriage as being {{between a man and}} a woman, Haggard and other gay marriage opponents sought to enshrine the prohibition in the state constitution, so that the Colorado Supreme Court would not have the power to declare the statute unconstitutional. [...] In the movie Jesus Camp, Haggard says, [...] "we don't have to debate about what we should think about homosexual activity. It's written in the Bible." [...] Haggard initially opposed same-sex marriage, but supported civil unions for homosexual couples. [...] He later came to support same-sex marriage as a civil institution, saying that while he still believes it is forbidden under Biblical law, he feels that [...] "we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to inculcate [...] into civil law." ...|$|E
