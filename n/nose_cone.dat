5|$|The cockpit was {{significantly}} altered for the Comet 4's introduction, on which an improved layout {{focusing on the}} onboard navigational suite was introduced. An EKCO E160 radar unit was installed in the Comet 4's <b>nose</b> <b>cone,</b> providing search functions as well as ground and cloud mapping capabilities, and a radar interface was built into the Comet 4 cockpit along with redesigned instruments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>cone,</b> which {{contained}} the ordnance that would impact the target, would {{separate from the}} rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> and its ordnance {{had to be able}} to survive re-entry, rather than the rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimballed engines, and the internally supported frame, would go on to inspire the Atlas rockets. Several things changed however, such as the aluminum used for the missiles skin of the Hiroc, was switched out for stainless steel in the Atlas, because stainless steel had a higher melting point. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much stronger, generating a total of 150,000 pounds-force (667,000 Newtons), compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 pounds-force (35,585 Newtons).|$|E

Crowley used the <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E
5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the <b>nose</b> <b>cone,</b> a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision goggles, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E

The other cars started from the grid in the order they were at the point the race was stopped. Michael Schumacher had a poor start and Gerhard Berger took the lead on track (but Schumacher still led the race overall due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped). Hill, from third, made contact attempting to overtake Schumacher at the Tosa corner, dropping Hill {{to the back of the}} field and was forced to make a pitstop in order to fit a new <b>nose</b> <b>cone.</b> Hill battled back to finish in sixth position.|$|E

5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the <b>nose</b> <b>cone,</b> to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E

Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot {{and manager of}} the fleet estimated in 2004 that it would cost £10–15million to make G-BOAF airworthy again. BA maintain ownership and have stated {{that they will not}} fly again {{due to a lack of}} support from Airbus. On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a <b>nose</b> <b>cone,</b> at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Vergne was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 2.350 seconds, ahead of Prost in second and Bird third. Rosenqvist was fourth-fastest; Félix da Costa was fifth and Heidfeld sixth. Buemi was seventh-fastest, Ma eighth, Sarrazin ninth and Loïc Duval rounded the top ten ahead of qualifying. Duval lost control {{of his car and}} crashed into the turn ten outside barrier's exit, removing both his right-hand side tyres, and caused the session to be stopped for ten minutes to allow his car to be removed from the centre of the track. Engel spun and damaged his right-rear suspension, but was able to drive slowly back to the pit lane. Di Grassi ran wide and went deep into the turn two run-off area. He spun his car to leave the corner but made contact with the wall, removing his rear wing. López lost his vehicle's <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> in a collision with the wall at the same corner, and his rear wing was removed from his car when he impacted the turn eight barrier. The driver's rear wing was off the racing line, avoiding the need for yellow flags, and Piquet caused the session to conclude under red flag conditions when he heavily collided with the chicane exit barrier.|$|E

From February through July 1962, eleven pilots and six H-21B {{helicopters}} where airlifted by C-124 Globemaster aircraft to Christmas Island in the South Pacific {{in support of}} the Operation Dominic atomic tests. They would provide personnel airlift and search and rescue. They also conducted recovery of rocket <b>nose</b> <b>cones</b> shot through the clouds of an atomic device detonation by Research agencies.

5|$|Vettel {{began to}} pull away {{from the rest of the}} field. Trulli made a pit stop for a {{replacement}} <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> at the start of the second lap after another car made contact with the rear end of his car and his front wing was removed. Webber battled Hülkenberg for eighth position but was unable to overtake the latter. Trulli made a second pit stop on the fifth lap to allow his mechanics to rectify a problem with his car's gearbox and turned off his engine to allow for repairs to occur. Vettel set a fastest lap of the race on lap five, a 1:43.055, and was three seconds ahead of Hamilton, who in turn was being caught by Alonso. It was reported by Red Bull on the following lap that eighth-placed Webber had no mechanical issues. Webber made an early pit stop on lap seven for the medium compound tyres but his crew had a minor problem fitting his left-front wheel which meant he was stationary for 7.9 seconds, and rejoined in 18th position. Rosberg made a similar stop on the next lap but he overshot his pit stall and rejoined in 19th place.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first night, {{indirect}} fire had again {{played a crucial role}} in the defence, with the New Zealand gunners firing another 5,700 rounds (out of a divisional total of 9,500 rounds) in support of the Australians and the US Marines. Dug-in to the east, 16 RNZA had been forced to fire with minimum crest clearance over the Australian lines in order to bring effective fire to bear on the assaulting Chinese from their 25-pounders. Using both variable time proximity and time-set fuses, the New Zealand gunners used air bursts to break up the Chinese assaults, causing heavy casualties. Despite the risk of causing casualties among their own soldiers no serious casualties were incurred by the Australians, although one suffered a broken shoulder after a brass <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> from a faulty time-of-flight fused shell exploded over his position. High explosive was also provided by C Company's 60mm mortar which operated against the Chinese in no man's land despite being exposed and unprotected from fire, while the mortars also provided battlefield illumination which had allowed the Australian riflemen and machine-gunners to bring accurate fire to bear on the Chinese crossing 2 RAR's front to attack Hills 111 and 121. The Chinese had suffered heavily during the fighting, with over 300 dead counted in front of Hill 111 alone. Throughout the following day the Australians observed a steady stream of Chinese casualties evacuating Hill 111 and crossing the paddy fields on the left flank. Later, a group of 20 armed Chinese had also attempted to withdraw but were engaged by the 2 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon, resulting in at least six casualties. In the area held by the US 1st Marine Division, Chinese shelling continued sporadically, while at 13:30 the US 1st Marine Regiment assumed operational control of the right sector.|$|E
5|$|Duval and Abt {{made the}} best starts in the field, gaining two {{positions}} {{by the end of}} the first lap while Piquet lost three positions over the same distance. At the end of the first lap, Turvey led from López, who in turn, was followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird, Félix da Costa, Rosenqvist, Buemi, Carroll, Evans, Gutiérrez, Engel, Prost, di Grassi, Frijns, Abt, d'Ambrosio, Duval, Piquet and Sarrazin. The stewards deployed the safety car on the second lap to allow marshals to clear debris in the chicane. Prost made a pit stop for a <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> replacement while Sarrazin elected to switch into his second car. Di Grassi rejoined the race on the same lap as the leading drivers but was now at the back of the field. Turvey led the field back up to speed at the lap-five restart, closely followed by López. Buemi immediately attacked Rosenqvist and passed him for sixth place and started to draw closer to Bird. López began to pressure Turvey for the lead with Heidfeld and Vergne close in arrears. Jaguar teammates Evans and Carroll began battling for eighth while Gutiérrez lost tenth to both Andretti cars of Félix da Costa and Frijns with Abt gaining further positions to run in 12th. At the entry to turn 13, Turvey had power issues with his car, and slowed on the start/finish straight, handing the lead to López. Turvey stopped at the turn one exit.|$|E

The FW30's front wing is one {{area in which the}} design of the FW29 was not followed. In place of the older car's two-element wing a three-element design was introduced, similar to that used on the 2007 McLaren MP4-22. As with the McLaren design the Williams wing's upper element features a central section that is raised up and passes over the tip of the car's, slightly lower, <b>nose</b> <b>cone.</b> However, unlike the McLaren, the FW30's front wing is suspended from the <b>nose</b> <b>cone</b> using the forward element.|$|E
