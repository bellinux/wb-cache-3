40|$|These {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to determine the}} effects of liming on certain groups of soil bacteria in a typical Wisconsin drift soil. They justified the following general conclusions: 1. Applications <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> up to three tons per acre lead to an increase in the numbers of bacteria developing on 2 ̆ 2 modified synthetic 2 ̆ 2 agar. They also produce an increase in ammonification, nitrification, and in nitrogen fixation when these processes are tested by the beaker method. These increases are in all cases almost proportionate to the amount <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> applied. 2. Natural increases in numbers of bacteria tend to obscure the effects <b>of</b> applications <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> while natural decreases make them more pronounced. 3. Peptone solutions do not permit of the determining of the largest number of bacteria which will destroy humus with the production of ammonia. 4. The beaker method, with dried blood or cottonseed meal for ammonification, with ammonium sulfate or dried blood for nitrification, and with mannite for nitrogen fixation, is eminently satisfactory. 5. The ammonification of dried blood or of cottonseed meal runs parallel with the numbers of bacteria while there is very little relation between the ammonification of peptone solutions and numbers. 6. Increased nitrification leads to slight accumulations <b>of</b> <b>nitrates</b> in the soil. 7. Natural accumulations <b>of</b> <b>nitrates</b> in the soil tend to obscure the differences due to the lime treatment. 8. The solution method for nitrogen fixation is quite unreliable. 9. Applications <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> increase the yield of oats; one-half and one ton per acre very slightly, but two and three tons to quite a large extent. 10. Applications <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> up to three tons per acre increase the nitrogen content of the oats crop more rapidly than the yield itself...|$|R

The survival <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> renders is owed to its ability, acting like a sponge, to absorb moisture then allow it to evaporate slowly over time. The purpose of this dissertation is to show that <b>lime</b> renders <b>of</b> plasters cannot be easily replaced with modern Portland cement without having a major consequence to old and traditional buildings. This dissertation was compiled from an extensive literature review under three specific headings; 1) Formation <b>of</b> <b>Lime</b> 2) Conservation Guidelines and Legislation and 3) Repair & Maintenance <b>of</b> <b>Lime.</b> A case study was undertaken on the restoration <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> render and plaster to a protected structure. The case study showed that unless there is a good commitment and understanding from the outset by the property owners, lime has to be treated differently to ordinary Portland cement, to allow conservation and restoration of the render and plaster. An interview was held with a professional who is heavily involved in conservation <b>of</b> buildings using <b>lime.</b> The interview was carried out so as to gain a clear understanding of the main conservation methods <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> plastering. The information that was gathered during this interview was compiled in order to add further weight to the case study and assess the techniques used in restoration <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> plasters and renders to old buildings...|$|R
40|$|The loess {{deposits}} of the Port Hills, Canterbury, {{are subject to}} erosion by natural processes. Urban development of the Port Hills has encountered difficulties due to loess erosion, and in some instances, contributed to erosion. Lime stabilisation is one remedial method {{that can be used}} to reduce erosion problems. This necessitates investigation of the changes to soil properties and strength gains that occur to the loess with the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> An erodible loess colluvium, from a subdivision with a history of erosion problems, was stabilised with 1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, and 10 % hydrated lime, and cured under various laboratory conditions. Pinhole erodibility, uniaxial swelling strain, Atterberg limits, grainsize analysis, Proctor compaction testing and a slaking test were used to determine the improvements to soil properties with the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Unconfined compressive strength was tested to determine strength gains <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> stabilised soil. The addition <b>of</b> 1 % <b>lime</b> to the soil produced a non-erodible, non-dispersive material. Slaking and swelling were minimised with the addition of higher percent ages <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> (5 %- 7. 5 % respectively). The effective grainsize of the soil was increased on the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> and plasticity was increased with the addition of up to 5 % lime. Optimum moisture content increases, and dry density decreases with increasing amounts <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Strength gains <b>of</b> the <b>lime</b> stabilised loess, varied from 3 – 14 times the strength of the untreated soil depending on the curing method. Strength gains were greatest for air dried samples, although the untreated soil cured in the same manner had a higher dry strength than the lime stabilised soil. Strength gains are optimised at and above 7. 5 % lime with significant strength losses recorded between 2 % and 5 % lime. Strain deformation is reduced with the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> and the modulus of deformation is increased significantly indicating that lime stabilised loess acts as a brittle material on deformation. The addition <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> to loess in low percentages (1 %), has the effect of producing a non-erodible, non-dispersive material that resists erosion. However, it would appear that to achieve maximum strength <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> stabilised loess, 7. 5 % lime or more must be added to the soil...|$|R
40|$|Curative and {{preventive}} efficacy and phytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sulphur spray schedules, {{based on a}} warning system, were evaluated in the Netherlands during two growing seasons under field conditions. In most cases, lime sulphur treatments applied either curatively or preventively resulted in significantly lower scab damage on both the leaves and fruits compared to wettable sulphur treatments. However, all lime sulphur treatments showed high phytotoxicity values, reduced leaf size and {{had a tendency to}} a reduced yield quality compared to all other treatments. For curative schedules <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sulphur on scab control, phytotoxicity and yield did not differ significantly from preventive schedules <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sulphur. However, the use of a warning system combined with curative schedules <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sulphur saved one and two lime sulphur sprays in 2000 and 2001, respectively, compared to the preventive treatments <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sulphur. Our results demonstrated that a curative spray programme with lime sulphur at 0. 75 - 2 %, applied 35 - 45 h after predicted infection periods, can provide effective primary apple scab control, but no benefit in either yield or fruit quality was reached under organic growing conditions. Moreover, research herein clearly showed that organic growers are forced to find a balance between good efficacy and phytotoxic effects <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sulphur...|$|R
40|$|Lime sludge, an inert {{material}} mostly composed of calcium carbonate, {{is the result}} of softening hard water before distribution as drinking water. A large city such as Des Moines, Iowa, produces about 32 000 tons <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sludge (dry-weight basis) annually. This is about half <b>of</b> the <b>lime</b> sludge produced in Iowa per year in eight different cities, and these cities currently have 371 800 tons (dry-weight basis) stockpiled. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources directed those cities using lime softening in drinking-water treatment to stop digging new lagoons to dispose <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sludge. The situation in surrounding Midwestern states is similar, and there will be millions <b>of</b> tons <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sludge in stockpiles. Five Iowa water-treatment plants, all producers <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sludge, funded the research. The research goal was to find useful and economical alternatives for the disposal <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> sludge. Feasibility studies tested the efficacy <b>of</b> using <b>lime</b> sludge in cement production, power-plant SOx control, dust control on gravel roads, wastewater neutralization, and infill materials for road construction. All the potential applications were demonstrated to be at least feasible, except for dust control. Fill material from admixture with fly ash showed the most promise as a bulk, if variable, demand application...|$|R
40|$|Lime {{stabilization}} {{has been}} widely used in civil engineering to improve soils properties. A major shortcoming <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> is that it increases the soil brittleness. Thus, {{the aim of this}} research is to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> along with geogrids on unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and modulus of elasticity (Es) of the stabilized soil. Atterberg limits, XRF, and pH tests were performed to determine the optimal percentage <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Then, different percentages <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> were added to the soil to study strength, stress, and strain of specimens using UCS tests. Also, the effect of inclusion of geogrid on the lime stabilized soil was studied by adding four layers of geogrid in the soil at constant intervals. By increasing the percentages <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> brittleness index, UCS, and Es increased and deformability index decreased. Moreover, applying geogrids led to increasing deformability and failure strain. Based on SEM tests, an addition <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> caused fewer voids led to increasing UCS and Es. A phenomenological model was used to develop equations for predicting UCS, Es, brittleness, and deformability indexes for the stabilized soil. The results showed that there was a good correlation between the measured values and the estimated values given by the predicted equations...|$|R

Lime which is formed by the calcining <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> stone (CaCO 3) at 1000 oC is of great importance. As, it is used in laboratory as reagent, {{in the manufacture of}} bleaching powder, glass & steel making, in agriculture as source of calcium and in water treatment, neutralization of soil acidity etc. More than 72 % <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> stone is used in the manufacture of cement. Though free lime does not found in properly made Portland cement (generally found in its hydrated form) but it {{plays an important role in}} the setting of cement. Sometimes fast reactivity <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> decreases the strength of set cement due to false setting. By adding certain chemicals (retarders), the hydration <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> can be slowed down and it may help in overall increase in setting time as well as strength of set cement. Various additives –called retarders- are added to inhibit the setting of cement such as gypsum, sucrose etc...|$|R
