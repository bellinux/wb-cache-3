500|$|While the {{presentation}} was received positively, the gameplay received criticism from multiple reviews. [...] More specifically, the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were cited as weak. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker argued the cinematic portions were underpinned by the gameplay, believing that players would more likely {{want to finish}} the game for its storyline than the fun they'll have playing it. Game Revolution's AA White stated [...] "Clock Tower 3 is ultimately one of those games whose cinemas are {{more interesting than the}} actual gameplay and from a gamer's standpoint, that's <b>never</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing."

500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death.

[...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is <b>never</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> explanation about why people die.|$|E

Convection gradually increased as the day went on, while the system slowed and became nearly stationary over the western Caribbean. By 1500UTC on October22, surface observations and satellite imagery, which indicated the system had developed enough organized convection to be classified as Tropical Depression Eighteen. At {{the time of the}} upgrade, the system was situated about 320mi (515km) south of Kingston, Jamaica The environment around the newly formed depression was characterized by an area of weak steering currents south of a ridge extending eastward from the Gulf of Mexico. Low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures were conducive for strengthening, and perhaps rapid deepening. Late on October22, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of [...] in a rainband well removed from the center of circulation, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Sandy. Outflow increased, while moist air helped the convection organize further. The NHC noted that [...] "remaining nearly stationary over the warm waters of southwestern Caribbean Sea is <b>never</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sign for this time of year." [...] Still, the cloud pattern initially remained largely unchanged. Early on October24, an eye began developing, as observed on microwave imagery, and Sandy was moving steadily northward, drawn by a trough approaching from the northwest.

Although he did poorly in many subjects, {{he did well}} in history and French, and showed a clear talent for writing. He helped set up the school's drama club, taking on his first stage roles with great enthusiasm. He wrote short stories, poems, and essays. In 1944, {{at the age of}} 15, Jacques began playing the guitar. The following year he formed his own theatre group with friends and began writing plays. In the spring of 1947, during his final year at Saint-Louis, Jacques wrote a short story titled [...] "Frédéric" [...] for a school magazine Le Grand Feu (The great fire). Published pseudonymously, the story is about a man on his death bed who encourages his grandson to run away {{while the rest of the}} family makes arrangements for his funeral.

2500|$|In 2008, Northwestern University {{professor}} of clinical medical humanities and bioethics Alice Dreger commented on Bailey's {{response to the}} negative reactions: [...] "Bailey may claim he was not insensitive, but {{given the number of}} people he offended with his prose, he is obviously, objectively wrong—being perceived as insensitive by this many people surely means you have been insensitive. (Especially if you don’t get that.)" [...] Physician Charles Allen Moser, though, believes that Bailey caused his own controversy by being mean spirited. [...] "To call a transsexual who denies Autogynephilia vigorously autogynephilic or an autogynephile-in-denial is also inflammatory and inappropriate. One can convey the same point with more cautious language. In general, researchers should avoid inciting hostility from their subjects. Stating that a subject is in denial or misleading the researcher usually leads to an angry reaction. Ridiculing someone for their beliefs, religious, political, or gender identification is <b>never</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> strategy. Ignoring these common courtesies will probably lead to an ugly confrontation, such as this “controversy.” Being a researcher does not confer immunity from the consequences of incivility." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1990, Wang {{announced}} their first personal computers running Unix. Previously, Wang's {{presence in the}} UNIX and open systems markets had been modest. In 1987, Wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with Arlington MA-based Texet Corp. The system used Xerox printers and UNIX workstations from Sun, but the product vanished before coming to market, partially because few Wang employees could use or support UNIX. UNIX ran on the VSInteractive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran [...] "native" [...] on the VS hardware soon thereafterbut performance was always sub-par as UNIX was <b>never</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fit for the inherently batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to {{be sent back to}} the host when running UNIX so that [...] "tty" [...] style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its data dictionary, excellent referential integrity, and speedy application development, {{was in the process of}} being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A client server RDBMS model, built on the original product's ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wang's original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were simply abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|On February 25, 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an American-born Israeli {{member of}} Kach, {{who in his}} youth was a JDL activist, opened fire on Muslims {{kneeling}} in prayer at the revered Cave of the Patriarchs mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron, killing 29 worshippers and injuring 125 before {{he ran out of}} ammunition and was himself killed. The attack set off riots and protests throughout the West Bank and 19 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli Defense Forces within 48 hours of the massacre. On its website, the JDL described the massacre as a [...] "preventative measure against yet another Arab attack on Jews" [...] and noted that they [...] "do not consider his assault to qualify under the label of terrorism". Furthermore, they noted that [...] "we teach that violence is <b>never</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> solution but is unfortunately sometimes necessary as a last resort when innocent lives are threatened; we therefore view Dr. Goldstein as a martyr in Judaism's protracted struggle against Arab terrorism. And we are not ashamed to say that Goldstein was a charter member of the Jewish Defense League." [...] In a similar attack nearly twelve years earlier, on April 11, 1982, an American-born JDL member and immigrant to Israel, Allan H. Goodman, opened fire with his military-issue rifle at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the sacred Temple Mount in Jerusalem, killing one Palestinian Arab and injuring four others. The 1982 shooting sparked an Arab riot in which another Palestinian was shot dead by the police. In 1983, Goodman was sentenced by an Israeli court to life in prison (which usually means 25 years in Israel); he was released after serving 15 1/2 years on the condition of returning to the United States.|$|E
