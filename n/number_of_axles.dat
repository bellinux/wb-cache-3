25|$|Vehicles are {{classified}} electronically at the toll booths {{according to their}} number of wheels, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> and height at first axle. Thus vehicles with trailers are charged extra and some large models of 4x4 {{are classified}} as vans.|$|E
25|$|The United States Federal Highway Administration has {{developed}} a classification scheme used for automatically calculating road use tolls. There are two broad categories {{depending on whether the}} vehicle carries passengers or commodities. Vehicles that carry commodities are further subdivided by <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> and number of units, including both power and trailer units.|$|E
25|$|Double-stacking {{containers}} {{greatly improved}} operating efficiency by reducing train length and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> per container, thus saving fuel per ton-mile. Another benefit {{was created by}} permanently joining five cars in a set. This {{reduced the number of}} couplers, which reduced slack action. Slack is created in any train by the couplers between the cars being stretched and compressed, and in long, heavy trains this can be quite a powerful force. By reducing slack action, the damage caused to the freight transported in containers is also reduced.|$|E

25|$|As {{locomotive}} types {{began to}} diverge {{in the late}} 19th century, freight engine designs at first emphasised tractive effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, freight locomotive size increased, and the overall <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a single axle, but a trailing truck was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer fit between or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit {{the speed at which}} the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2005, a {{new system}} came into effect for {{mandatory}} tolls (Mautpflicht) on heavy trucks (those weighing more than 12 t) while using the German autobahn system (LKW-Maut). The German government contracted with a private company, Toll Collect GmbH, to operate the toll collection system, which has involved the use of vehicle-mounted transponders and roadway-mounted sensors installed throughout Germany. The toll is calculated depending on the toll route, as well as based on the pollution class of the vehicle, its weight and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> on the vehicles. Certain vehicles, such as emergency vehicles and buses, are exempt from the toll. An average user is charged €0.15 per kilometre, or about $0.31 per mile (Toll Collect, 2007).|$|E
25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> required was {{dictated by the}} maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum axle loading. A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{unification}} decree of 1937, which required manufacturer to standardize certain properties (weight, capacity, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axle,</b> speed) {{in relation to}} any requisition for the war effort, in 1939 the Milanese house changed the rules thus allowing unified production of Isotta Fraschini D80 CO (civilian version) and D80 COM (military version) both known as the [...] 2nd series.|$|R

25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels {{is derived from the}} adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the Bissel bogie in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the lateral displacement of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the first}} new {{locomotive}} series following {{the development of the}} first draft revised system, the Re 450 series was classified partially in accordance with that draft; what would have been the locomotive numbers under the old system (10500ff) were replaced by sequential numbers (000 ff), and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> was still prepended to the vehicle number in the old fractional form (Re 4/4 450000 ff). [...] Upon the delivery of the first Re 460 locomotives in 1991, [...] a corresponding classification style was used.|$|E
50|$|With {{electric}} and diesel vehicles include DMUs a letter A-B-C-D replaces 1-2-3-4 for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> powered <b>axles,</b> and each bogie is grouped separately.|$|R
30|$|In {{the future}} research, a multi-axle active {{steering}} will be studied. The trajectory tracking based on DB and AS {{will also be}} considered. Moreover, {{the states of the}} truck such as roll angle, roll angle rate, yaw rate, and accelerations are assumed partially known from sensors. Thus, the estimation method will be considered as well. The ultimate objective is to develop an integrated control system that is suitable for trucks with different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> and tractor semitrailers with a minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sensors.|$|R

2500|$|The {{speed of}} the cars rolling down from the hump into the {{classification}} bowl must be regulated according to whether they are full or empty, heavy or light freight, varying <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles,</b> whether there are few or many cars on the classification tracks, and varying weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed and direction. As concerns speed regulation, {{there are two types}} of hump yards—without or with mechanisation by retarders. In the old non-retarder yards braking was usually done in Europe by railroaders who laid skates onto the tracks. The skate or wheel chock was manually (or, in rare cases, mechanically) placed on one or both of the rails so that the treadles or rims of the wheel or wheels caused frictional retardation and resulted in the halting of the railway car. In the United States this braking was done by riders on the cars. In the modern retarder yards this work is done by mechanized [...] "rail brakes" [...] called retarders, which brake the cars by gripping the wheels. They are operated either pneumatically or hydraulically. [...] Pneumatic systems are prevalent in the United States, France, Belgium, Russia and China, while hydraulic systems are used in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.|$|E

50|$|Vehicles are {{classified}} for toll purposes in six categories {{based on the}} wheelbase and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles.</b> If the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> of a vehicle {{is less than the}} maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> -because some axles of a truck are lifted up or a tractor is running without its trailer-, the integrated automated vehicle classification system changes the vehicle category read in to the actual one during the passage allowing a lower toll tariff. The bridge toll is fixed for each vehicle category, and is charged only once in eastward direction on the two bridges in Istanbul. The road toll is rated further depending on the distance driven between the entry and the exit of motorway for each vehicle category. For this reason, a signal has to be initiated on the KGS-lane by entering the motorway.|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of {{a bridge to}} a pre-weighed truck can be measured on site. This paper describes a mathematical method for converting the measured {{response of}} a load effect into an influence line for that effect. One influence ordinate is calculated for each scan of the data acquisition system. The vector of ordinates is found by solving a large set of simultaneous equations expressed in matrix form. The general form of the matrices is described, and the particular matrices for a three-axle truck are given. The technique is demonstrated using measured strain on two bridges using pre-weighed trucks with different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles...</b>|$|R

50|$|Bavaria's {{state-owned}} railway chose {{a different}} way: They also used P, S, or G {{to indicate the}} train type, but combined with the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> driving <b>axles</b> and <b>of</b> the <b>axles</b> in total, separated by a slash (similar to the Swiss system). E. g., the famous S 3/6 was a 2'C1' or 4-6-2 Pacific, meaning that of a total <b>of</b> 6 <b>axles,</b> 3 were driving axles.|$|R

40|$|Rail {{operating}} risks {{have been}} increasing due to increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axle</b> passes, steeper curves, wear-out of rails and wheels and inadequate rail-wheel grinding, poor lubrication and reduced maintenance. In 2000, the Hatfield accident in UK killed 4 people and injured 34 people and has {{lead to the}} cost of £ 733 million (AUD$ 1. 73 billion) for repairs and compensations. In 1977, the Granville train disaster in Australia killed 83 people and injured 213 people. These are related to rolling contact fatigue, wear and poor maintenance. This paper focuses on development of a conceptual integrated model for rail grinding, lubrication and inspection maintenance decisions. Risk based cost benefit model is developed for optimal inspection intervals...|$|R
