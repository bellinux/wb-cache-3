30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that rank{Q̂_v}= 1 {{according}} to Proposition 6. Thus, the solution, {Q̂_v,Q̂_J}, {{is indeed a}} tight approximation of (32). Moreover, f̅(τ)=g̅(τ).|$|R

50|$|To be fair, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that Lu’s {{critique}} {{applied to}} other big {{names in the}} field of BW including Mike Rose (see below).|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> {{that for}} the {{disease-free}} case (i.e. W_ 3 = 0), if d is a linear function, then the total population has logistic growth.|$|R

30|$|To get the {{solution}} for gluon densities, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that {{in almost all}} parts of the calculations we would encounter matrix form. This section involves three steps.|$|R

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that {{according}} to the non-negative constraint, only the rows and columns of the matrices (WA)T(WA) and L T L corresponding to f >  0 {{will be involved in}} the calculation.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> at {{this point}} that {{hyperbolic}} geometry and SL_ 2 -invariance 9 have been used by Chossat and Faugeras for a different purpose [59]; the same basic ingredients will appear here.|$|R

30|$|<b>Nonetheless,</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> still {{investigate}} what {{characteristics of}} {{this early stage}} of development are driving the result. The openness could work the other way around. Latin American countries {{are known for their}} protectionist policies and the overall degree of openness is low when compared to industrialized countries in our sample, though it seems not strong enough to offset the other forces driving the Latin American effect.|$|R
50|$|Kingroup-exogamous {{systems have}} the four classes whereas kin-group endogamous systems have only three (first three) classes. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that the {{features}} such as relative age, gender, generation etc. are also responsible for numerical variations.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> {{that in our}} {{proposed}} method, {{the improvement}} of classification accuracy on difficult classes {{is the result of}} calculating the local weights for kernels which could address the problem of high intra class variance.|$|R
3000|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> here that, in general, (21) and (23) do not {{represent}} a probability distribution, and was therefore referred to as “score". In {{the rest of the}} article, we refer to this method by [...]...|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that in {{the study}} area (5 [*]×[*] 5  μm 2, Fig.  4), the maximum {{diameter}} of protruding crystallites constitutes less than 450  nm and the maximum height of the protruding crystallites is 180  nm.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that <b>we</b> never {{experienced}} {{the problems with}} delamination of the films deposited on the adhesive layer of niobium during anodic oxidation of aluminum films on glass, as it is indicated by some authors [23].|$|R

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> {{that the}} {{aforementioned}} software packages are being assessed {{only for their}} calculative accuracy. Other criteria, such as the user interface, features and support, are {{beyond the scope of}} this study. The final selection of a commercial software package should be a process based on multiple criteria.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that, to date, SED/TOI {{observations}} {{during the}} March 2015 storm {{have been reported}} only for the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we present the first observations of the much more intense SED/TOI structures in the Southern Hemisphere, which were detected mainly due to a fortunate Swarm position.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> {{that the}} OFDM scheme has some {{additional}} complexities {{that depend on}} various parameters and that are {{beyond the scope of}} this paper, e.g., the complexity at the receivers due to the operation of successive decoding. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>note</b> that if we only consider cases 2 and 5, there is no need of successive decoding at the destination since each transmitted codeword is decoded at the destination in a different time slot. Thus, in general, the complexity of OFDM scheme can be decreased at the expense of lower sum-rate which is still larger than the one obtained using OFDMAscheme.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that Theorem  19 is the {{generalization}} of Theorem  11 in [9], where {{the case for}} r∈R is mainly considered. In both theorems, the even powers of δ^'(x) {{turn out to be}} zero, while the odd powers are expressible as a constant multiple of a derivative of δ(x).|$|R
30|$|From the {{activity}} analysis, {{we found that}} {{the activity}} per group member was similar for all projects (about 20 % per group member). This indicates that the projects are comparable with respect to scale. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that not all group members were similarly active on the platform (symmetry of participation).|$|R
3000|$|... 1 {{is added}} too (red lines in Fig. 2). <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>note</b> that {{dispersion}} of lower p-mode (black solid lines) is more linear than the “conventional” one-interface SPP {{that may be}} associated with SPP hybridization. Also, we can see from Fig. 2 that p-polarized GM are blueshifted in comparison with s-polarized GM.|$|R
