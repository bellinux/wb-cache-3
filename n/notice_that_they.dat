5|$|Barbara and Adam Maitland {{decide to}} spend their {{vacation}} decorating their idyllic Connecticut country home. As the two are driving home {{from a trip to}} town, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog and the car plunges into a river. After they return home, Adam decides to retrace their steps as they can't recall how they got home. Upon stepping outside he's taken to a desert world with monstrous sandworms before being pulled back in by Barbara. Even though he had been gone for less than a minute Barbara claims he had been gone for over an hour. She and Adam <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> now lack reflections and they discover a Handbook for the Recently Deceased and realize they did not survive the crash.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{scheduled}} release date for Apartment Life, Ivy scheduled a promotional radio {{tour in the}} United States to take place during September 1997. During a separate tour where Ivy and the Space Monkeys co-headlined, Ivy received <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been dropped from the roster of Atlantic Records' current artists. It was during this time that Ivy's management team struck a joint deal with Sony Music Entertainment and 550 Music which {{they went on to}} accept.|$|E
25|$|In November 1872 {{the company}} issued <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{intended}} {{to submit a}} Bill to Parliament for the operation of tramways in Nottingham. The proposed network {{made no mention of}} Arnold or Beeston but comprised a line from a terminus on Forest Rd at its junction with Mount Hooton Rd, east along Forest Rd, then Mansfield Rd, Melbourne St, Milton St, Upper Parliament St, Market St, Wheeler Gate, Albert St, and then Carrington St to the junction with Station St. From this junction one line would run along Station St and across London Rd into the forecourt of the Great Northern Railway station and another along Arkwright St to Trent Bridge.|$|E

25|$|On November 17, 2011, Swartz {{was indicted}} by a Middlesex County Superior Court grand jury on state charges of {{breaking}} and entering with intent, grand larceny, and unauthorized access to a computer network. On December 16, 2011, state prosecutors filed a <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were dropping the two original charges; the charges listed in the November 17, 2011, indictment were dropped on March 8, 2012. According to {{a spokesperson for the}} Middlesex County prosecutor, the state charges were dropped to permit a federal prosecution headed by Stephen P. Heymann and supported by evidence provided by Secret Service agent Michael S. Pickett to proceed unimpeded.|$|E
25|$|For instance, an {{individual}} {{keeping track of}} the amount of mail they receive each day may <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> receive an average number of 4 letters per day. If receiving any particular piece of mail does not affect the arrival times of future pieces of mail, i.e., if pieces of mail {{from a wide range of}} sources arrive independently of one another, then a reasonable assumption is that the number of pieces of mail received in a day obeys a Poisson distribution. Other examples that may follow a Poisson include the number of phone calls received by a call center per hour and the number of decay events per second from a radioactive source.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} winter made life more {{difficult}} for the insurgents hiding in the mountains. Moreover, since October, the financial situation had been worrisome. In order to sustain the insurgents’ war effort, Venizelos had to take out loans. Thus, he borrowed 100,000 francs in obligations of 5 francs each in Greece. October also saw the first defections. Rebel bands from around Sitia laid down their arms and were granted an amnesty. In mid-October, Venizelos and his comrades recognised that {{it would be difficult to}} maintain the revolt, all the more so as the latest military operations had been directly aimed at them, notably by the Russians. They gave <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were ready to entrust the island's fate to the Great Powers. Venizelos participated in new negotiations with the consuls, seeking to obtain a maximum of concessions regarding the island's internal affairs. In a letter addressed to the Great Powers, he stated his intention to lay down arms in exchange for honourable conditions. Most of the insurgents were ready to hand over their weapons and, for those who refused to lay down arms, it was proposed that they be transported to Greece without being disarmed. In exchange for 800 guns and the same number of cartridges, an amnesty would be possible for the insurgents, except for the gendarmes who had deserted. With these conditions, Venizelos accepted surrender. Several days later, he obtained the right to have the deserting gendarmes transported to Greece. On 25 November, the Theriso camp was broken up and an amnesty proclaimed.|$|E

500|$|A National Labor Relations Board {{hearing to}} confirm or {{invalidate}} the vote was scheduled for January 5, 2005, but then postponed until February 16, 2005. [...] On February 1, 2005 the company and UFCW settled their dispute. [...] UFCW withdrew its objections, and West Liberty Foods posted a <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not close the plant or fire workers if employees unionized. [...] This resulted in a final vote count of 303 to 308 against union representation.|$|E
500|$|A {{key figure}} {{in the end of}} the blacklisting of McCarthyism was John Henry Faulk. Host of an {{afternoon}} comedy radio show, Faulk was a leftist active in his union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. He was scrutinized by AWARE, Inc., one of the private firms that examined individuals for signs of communist [...] "disloyalty". Marked by AWARE as unfit, he was fired by CBS Radio. Almost uniquely among the many victims of blacklisting, Faulk decided to sue AWARE in 1957 and finally won the case in 1962. With this court decision, the private blacklisters and those who used them were put on <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were legally liable for the professional and financial damage they caused. Although some informal blacklisting continued, the private [...] "loyalty checking" [...] agencies were soon a thing of the past. Even before the Faulk verdict, many in Hollywood had {{decided it was time to}} break the blacklist. In 1960, Dalton Trumbo, one of the best known members of the Hollywood Ten, was publicly credited with writing the films Exodus and Spartacus.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan, as {{had been}} {{arranged}} with Carte and Gilbert, gave notice to the partners of the Comedy Opera Company in early July 1879 that he, Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing the contract to produce Pinafore with them {{and that he would}} be withdrawing his music from the Comedy Opera Company on 31 July. In return, the Comedy Opera Company gave <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> intended to play Pinafore at another theatre and brought a legal action against Carte and company. They offered the London and touring casts of Pinafore more money to play in their production, and although some choristers accepted their offer, only one principal player, Mr Dymott, accepted. They engaged the Imperial Theatre but had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to seize the scenery and props during Act II of the evening performance at the Opera Comique. Gilbert was away, and Sullivan was recovering from an operation for kidney stones. Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery, although the stage manager, Richard Barker, and others, were injured. The cast went on with the show until someone shouted [...] "Fire!" [...] George Grossmith, playing Sir Joseph, went before the curtain to calm the panicked audience. The police arrived to restore order, and the show continued. Gilbert sued to stop the Comedy Opera Company from staging their rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore. The court permitted the production to go on at the Imperial, beginning on 1 August 1879, and it transferred to the Olympic Theatre in September. Pauline Rita was {{one of a series of}} Josephines. The production received good notices and initially sold well but was withdrawn in October after 91performances. The matter was eventually settled in court, where a judge ruled in Carte's favour about two years later.|$|E

2500|$|Arne Jacobsen {{is noted}} for {{his sense of}} proportion. Indeed, he himself saw this {{as one of the}} main {{features}} of his work.

Here is the basic thing".|$|E
2500|$|Given this {{astonishing}} {{display of}} official indifference, Falk and Partners gave <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{could not provide}} funding beyond £5,000. Nevertheless, the team pressed ahead, and the W.U. (Whittle Unit) engine ran successfully on 12 April 1937. Tizard pronounced it [...] "streaks ahead" [...] of any other advanced engine he had seen, and managed to interest the Air Ministry enough to fund development with a contract for £5,000 to develop a flyable version. However, {{it was a year}} before the funds were made available, greatly delaying development.|$|E
