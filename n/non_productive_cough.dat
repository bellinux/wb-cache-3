40|$|Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{is common}} in chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) and is, as <b>productive</b> <b>cough,</b> related to poorer prognosis in COPD. Central arterial stiffness is a marker of early atherosclerosis, but the association between COPD, <b>productive</b> <b>cough,</b> and arterial stiffness as a possible indicator of CVD is unclear. Objectives: To compare both arterial stiffness among subjects with and without COPD and the impact of <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> in a population-based cohort. Methods: A population-based cohort, including 993 COPD and 993 non-COPD subjects, has been invited to annual examination since 2005. In 2010, 947 subjects, of which 416 had COPD (according to the GOLD spirometric criteria), participated in examinations including structured interview, spirometry, and measurements of central arterial stiffness as pulse wave velocity (PWV). Results: PWV was higher in GOLD 3 – 4 compared to non-COPD (10. 52 vs. 9. 13 m/s, p= 0. 042). CVD and age ≥ 60 were both associated with significantly higher PWV in COPD as well as in non-COPD. In COPD, those with <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> had higher PWV than those without, significantly so in GOLD 1 (9. 59 vs. 8. 92 m/s, p= 0. 024). In a multivariate model, GOLD 3 – 4 but not <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> was associated with higher PWV, when adjusted for sex, age group, smoking habits, blood pressure, CVD, and pulse rate. Conclusions: GOLD 3 – 4, age ≥ 60, and CVD were associated with increased arterial stiffness, and also increased in COPD subjects with <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> compared to those without. Of importance, GOLD 3 – 4 but not <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> remained associated with increased central arterial stiffness when adjusted for confounders...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Bronchial {{localization}} of Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is rare. The precise {{nature of}} these neoplasms {{is not yet clear}} and little is known on the histogenesis and pathogenesis of the disease. Here we present a case of a bronchial MEC with a detailed pathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis. Presentation of a case: A 46 years old Caucasian male patient was referred to our Unit for fever, <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> and dyspnea lasting for two months. The chest CT scan evidenced an 8 -mm intraluminal lesion in the left main bronchus, in correspondence of the origin of the lingular segmental bronchus. Multiple biopsies were performed through bronchoscopy, and the diagnosis of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the lung was obtained. A left upper lobectomy was performed. The histopathological examination confirmed the preoperative diagnosis and stage (pT 1 N 0 M 0). No further therapies were employed, given the stage of the disease. The patient is presently free of disease, approximately three years after surgery. Discussion: The treatment of MECs is usually surgical by traditional or sleeve lobectomy, performed with an open or video-assisted technique, with the aim of an R 0 resection. In this stage the prognosis is excellent. Conversely, high grade tumors seems to be particularly aggressive, even more than other NSCLC. Conclusions: Low grade type of Bronchial MEC, as our case, is often characterized by an optimal clinical management and prognosis. The lack of EGFR sensitizing mutations does not preclude the use of TKIs, which may be extremely useful in patients non responsive to other therapies...|$|E

He had been asymptomatic until the age of 62, when he started to experience increasing exertional dyspnoea. One year later he had an episode of fever, productive cough and myalgias. Digital clubbing was noticed and bibasilar crackles were present on chest auscultation. Thoracic CT scan obtained at that time, were compatible with Usual Interstitial Pneumonia and bronchoalveolar lavage excluded other diseases. Pulmonary function studies: restriction and decreased DLco. Deflazacort, acetylcysteine and azathioprine were administered. Azathioprine was then switched to cyclophosphamide because of clinical and functional deterioration. Two years later he began Interferon Gamma 1 b, with clinical and functional improvement lasting one year. He was then diagnosed Polymyositis and received Immunoglobulin. Twelve months later he was admitted to the hospital with intermittent fever, <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> <b>cough,</b> worsening exertional dyspnoea and myalgias.

40|$|Mucormycosis is an {{increasingly}} recognized invasive fungal infection (IFI) {{in patients with}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and after allogeneic (allo) stem cell transplantation (HSCT); it is mainly due to the severe and prolonged neutropenia related to high-dose chemotherapy. Here we report a case of 32 -year-old AML who developed ten days after the onset of neutropenia during induction therapy, clinical and radiological findings of a possible IFI, such as a <b>non</b> <b>productive</b> <b>cough,</b> broad spectrum antibiotic resistant fever, prolonged neutropenia associated to a rapidly progressive peripheral pleural-based nodule with surrounding groundglass halo and a slight pleural effusion detected by high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT). During febrile neutropenia, serum aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigens, tested twice a week, were not detected. Empirical treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (LamB, 3 mg/kg/day for 21 days) was started; three days later, fever disappeared concomitantly with the achievement of complete disease remission. Pulmonary HCRT scans sequentially performed 30, 37, and 45 days after starting induction chemotherapy showed at beginning an increase of nodular lesion (4. 5 cm) and then a progressive infiltrate regression. At this time, a CT-guided fine needle biopsy of the pulmonary lesion and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens, tested for aspergillus GM antigen, failed to document any fungal infection. As HRCT scan 45 days after first induction did not shown fully regression of lung nodule (2 cm), 7 days later, the patient underwent a limited toracothomy, leading to a complete surgical removal of the lung infiltrate. Fungal culture of lung specimens remained negative, but histological examination established a mucormycosis. Three weeks after surgery, the patient performed consolidation chemotherapy, and 98 days after first induction therapy, the patient received a myeloablative allo HSCT from a sibling HLA-matched related donor. Secondary prophylaxis with LamB, applied during both consolidation therapy and myeloablative sibling allo HSCT, was effective to prevent IFI recurrence despite the development of grade II acute graftversus- host disease (GVHD) and limited chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppressive treatment.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cough is {{a common}} symptom that affects a large {{proportion}} of the general population. The aim of this investigation was to identify determinants of nocturnal, nonproductive and <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> in population samples from different countries. In a cross-sectional international population survey, 18, 277 subjects (20 – 48 yrs) from 16 countries answered an interview-led questionnaire. Total and specific immuno-globulin-E was measured and spirometry was performed. Three types of cough were defined: nocturnal, nonproductive and <b>productive</b> <b>cough.</b> The relation of the independent variables to cough was estimated by means of logistic regression for each centre or country and combined across centre or country by random-effects meta-analysis. The median prevalence of nocturnal, nonproductive and <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> in the different centres was 30. 7 %, 10. 2 % and 10. 2 %, respectively. Nocturnal and non-productive cough were related to female sex (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2. 08 and 1. 27, respectively), while nocturnal and <b>productive</b> <b>cough</b> were related to rhinitis (OR= 1. 46 and 1. 61, respectively).
