50|$|These are sets of thin {{lines of}} a {{complicated}} geometry (<b>guilloché</b> <b>patterns)</b> drawn with high resolution. The technology allows continuous visual changes of colour along each separated lines.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Belize began issuing {{passports}} in {{the common}} CARICOM design, with additional security features such as intaglio printing of certain text, a <b>guilloché</b> <b>pattern</b> on the inside pages, and a [...] "ghost image" [...] on the biodata pages.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth floor}} begins the {{transition}} to the high-rise portion of the building. Stone panels with a similar relief accent the corners and separate the bays. Above the windows of the fourth floor is another projecting element, a stringcourse that is ornamented with a <b>guilloche</b> <b>pattern</b> in relief.|$|R
50|$|While the {{interior}} of the cathedral has a deliberately 'restrained' feeling to it, richness {{is to be found in}} the ceiling. The Roman key pattern and the double <b>guilloche</b> <b>pattern,</b> picked out in gold leaf, are dominant here. All the round-headed windows are in the Classical-Wren style, with clear leaded lights of hand-made glass.|$|R
50|$|The {{rectangular}} plaques {{exist in}} two formats. In one, the long vertical sides are turned back, creating a small edge that {{is decorated with}} an incised <b>guilloche</b> <b>pattern.</b> In the other format, which is much narrower, the turned-back edges are missing and {{the design of the}} plaque background ends abruptly, as if cut off. These variations probably reflect {{the size and shape of}} the palace pillars and the arrangement of the plaques on them. The plaques are generally about 1/8 inch thick.|$|R
5000|$|Cosmatesque work is {{also known}} as opus alexandrinum. [...] Definitions of this term, and the {{distinction}} between it and opus sectile, vary somewhat. Some restrict opus alexandrinum to the typical large designs, especially for floors, using white <b>guilloche</b> <b>patterns</b> filled in with roundels and bands in coloured designs using small pieces. [...] Others include any geometric design including large pieces, as in the picture from Spoleto (right side) below, whereas opus sectile also includes figurative designs made in the same technique.|$|R
40|$|Computer {{simulations}} of a nonlinear planar system of first-order ODEs which we developed {{from a simple}} assumption that biological swarming is an outcome of aggregative behavior of the individuals in the swarm showed a surprising and novel outcome; the emergence of uniquely structured patterns that are intriguingly intricate, exquisite, symmetrical and regular. Some patterns look like flowers; others look like Spirograph curves and <b>Guilloché</b> <b>patterns</b> but with more intricate variations. Unlike Spirograph curves though, the swarm-induced patterns cannot be reproduced by any closed-form formula or by another pattern subjected to some resizing, translation, rotation and/or reflection...|$|R
5000|$|The Imperial Red Cross Easter Egg {{is made of}} silver, {{with the}} shell {{surrounded}} {{by a series of}} horizontal bands edged in gold. The bands each have a different <b>guilloche</b> <b>pattern</b> and are covered in white enamel. Two red crosses, made of enamel, are {{on either side of the}} egg. One includes the date [...] "1914" [...] and the other [...] "1915." [...] Inscribed on the outside of the egg are the words, [...] "Greater Love hath no man than this, to lay down his life for his friends". Dowager Empress Maria Fedorovna's monogram is displayed on the top of the shell.|$|R
40|$|Pendant compact of {{sterling}} silver and enamel. The small, circular compact has plain silver sides and base; the lid embellished with pale blue enamel over engraved <b>guilloche</b> <b>patterns.</b> Plain silver circle at center, surrounded by blue circular field with engraved pinwheel design; the outer border with silver edges, {{divided into four}} arcs, and with 4 "keystone" or "T" shapes at cardinal points, the fields enameled pale blue over engraved ground. Pressure clasp opens to reveal interior, plain, with circular mirror in lid. On outside at hinge is loop to suspend from a chain or ribbon. Stamped on base: "Sterling" Contains small circular "puff" of dense beige felt-like material...|$|R
5000|$|They {{were among}} the most {{important}} symbols in ancient Greece; and perhaps symbolized infinity and unity; many ancient Greek temples incorporated the sign of the meander. Greek vases, especially during their Geometric Period, were probably the main reason for the widespread use of meanders; alternatively, very ocean-like patterns of waves also appeared in the same format as meanders, which can also be thought of as the <b>guilloche</b> <b>pattern.</b> The shield of Philip II of Macedon, conserved in the museum of Vergina, is decorated with multiple symbols of the meander. Meanders are also prevalent on the pavement mosaics found in Roman villas throughout the Roman empire. A good example is at the Chedworth Roman Villa in England, leading many historians to believe that the pattern was part of the original inspiration for the Latin [...] "G" [...] character.|$|R
50|$|The {{decoration}} of the Cathach {{is limited to}} the initial letter of each Psalm. Each initial is in black ink and is larger than the main text. They are decorated with trumpet, spiral and <b>guilloche</b> <b>patterns</b> and are often outlined with orange dots. These patterns are not merely appended to the letters or used to fill spaces. They instead distort the shape of the letters themselves. The letters following the enlarged initials gradually reduce in size until they reach {{the same size as the}} main text. Although the motifs of the Cathach decoration are not similar to decorations in later manuscripts, such as the Book of Durrow (which followed the Cathach by as many as seventy years), the ideas of decoration which distorts the shape of the letters and the diminution of initial letters are ideas which are worked out in great detail in later Insular art.|$|R

It is carved with simple moldings, consisting of a guilloche of alternating large and small circles filled with assorted motifs, including palmettes, whirls, and rosettes. At the left {{end of the block}} is a galloping griffin with a small head and curved wings. Both the griffin and the <b>guilloche</b> <b>pattern</b> are widely used in Byzantine architectural carving. ** Also, in back garden of this house are a column base with unfinished moldings (Base Diam. 0. 34 m, H: 0. 33 m) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{ornaments}} that chiefs wear {{over their}} left hip most often depict the human face but {{are different in}} form from the pectorals. They have a decorative flange around the lower portion of the face, usually representing either coiled mudfish, an openwork lattice or <b>guilloche</b> <b>pattern,</b> or a fluted collar, with a row of small loops directly below or behind it. A collar of coral beads is depicted below the face, and above the face is a latticework coral-beaded cap with clusters of coral beads at the edges. The face has three raised keloid scarification marks (ikharo) above each eye. Some masks are inlaid with a strip of metal down the forehead and/or nose. The most likely explanation for this marking is that it indicates urebo, a protective mixture of herbs and chalk, which was rubbed on the nose and forehead to ward off danger during festivals. Earlier scholarship suggested that sacrificial blood was also in this mixture.|$|R
5000|$|The Marble Hall: This is {{the grandest}} and most complex {{room in the}} House. Rising the full height of the house the room is nearly 50 ft high, the main body being 46 ft square, at the upper floor level taking {{up most of the}} south wall is a large apse, which in turn has a coffered-exedra in its centre. The ground floor is a rectangle, it being {{surrounded}} by walls to the east, west and south sides, which support a Colonnade of eighteen full columns and two matching pilasters on the north wall 20 ft high of the Ionic order, which in turn are surrounded by a passageway. There are six columns down each flank of the room, with two more at the end, the remaining four columns follow the curve of the apse. The apse contains a wide flight of white marble steps that rises to the upper level at the southernmost columns. The columns have an extremely rich plaster entablature, the soffit has richly decorated plaster panels edged in egg and dart, the frieze has bucrania and putti between festoons of fruit, the cornice in turn supports the deep coffered cove of the ceiling that rises to the flat centre over both the apse and {{the main part of the}} room, which is enriched with molded plaster beams also richly decorated with rosettes and other decoration. The fluted columns are of pink-veined Derbyshire alabaster, with white marble capitals. The walls surrounding the ground floor are also faced in the same alabaster, there are two arched doorways at the northern end of the walls leading to the service areas. These walls have a skirting of black marble decorated with a white marble meander, there is also a band of black marble decorated with a white marble scroll pattern just below the bases of the columns. The floor is white marble edged with grey marble. Between the columns is an elaborate black painted s-scroll wrought iron balustrade, supporting a mahogany hand rail. The upper corridor behind the columns is more restrained in its decoration, the alabaster is restricted to the skirting and door frames, with a white marble floor, the flat ceilings having simple large coffers between each column, separated by a rich band of <b>guilloche</b> <b>patterned</b> plasterwork, the walls like the ceiling being white plaster. The east and west walls of the upper level have four plain statue niches alternating with three doors, the southern apse is flanked by doors with windows above, then within the apse are two more statue niches flanking the central exedra with its hexagonal coffering, this contains two more statue niches flanking the doorway into the Saloon with its alabaster door surround with rich entablature and brackets, these like all the doors in the state rooms are of panelled mahogany. All the statue niches are semicircular in plan and rise from dado level to a half domed termination. The northern wall continues the alabaster and marble decoration across the ground floor, above is a Venetian window framed in white plaster, consisting of Corinthian pilasters and matching entablature, this is flanked by two sash windows. Beneath the central window is the main entrance which is flanked by black marble Ionic engaged-columns, supporting an alabaster pediment in the frieze of which is this inscription: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{lobby is}} divided into two areas: a postal lobby in the {{original}} portion of the building and a public lobby {{that is part of the}} 1934 addition. In the postal lobby, verde (green) marble pilasters (attached columns) with scrolled Ionic capitals decorate the walls. The floors are terrazzo with brass dividers and verde marble borders. The same marble is used for the wainscot. Heavily veined white marble veneer covers the upper portions of the walls. The ornate ceiling is executed in plaster and features beams that divide the ceiling into distinct panels. Each panel is outlined with a dentil course and egg-and-dart decorative molding. A decorative band called a <b>guilloche</b> with floral <b>patterns</b> also defines each panel. The centers each have a plaster medallion outlined with an acanthus leaf design. Cylindrical brass light fixtures descend from the centers of the panels. Original octagonal postal tables that sit upon verde marble bases remain in the lobby. Decorative finishes and details in the public lobby are similar to those in the postal lobby and provide continuity to the interior. However, ceiling panels in the public lobby are less ornate.|$|R
