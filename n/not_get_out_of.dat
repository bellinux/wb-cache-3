5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
5|$|Labradors have a {{reputation}} as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines, particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it does <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand—an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic. Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often mislabelled as being hyperactive. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball).Although they will sometimes bark at noise, especially noise from an unseen source ("alarm barking"), Labradors are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.|$|E
5|$|The 1946 Philadelphia Athletics {{season began}} with Christopher {{the subject of}} a {{possible}} trade. The Athletics tried to obtain Johnny Lindell from the Yankees, but they wanted Christopher in return. Mack refused to give him up, and as a result the trade never materialized. He began the season in the starting rotation, and was the opening day starting pitcher in a 5–0 loss against the Yankees. Over {{the first part of the}} season, Christopher again split time between the rotation and the bullpen. In a 7–3 loss to the Indians on July 18, Christopher could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the second inning, allowing five earned runs. After this, he did not pitch for a month, and spent the rest of the season as an occasional reliever. He finished the season with five wins, seven losses and a 4.30 ERA. After the season ended, Christopher began contemplating retirement from baseball. He had lost 10 pounds in the final months of the season and was light to begin with, and decided that he would retire if he could not gain the weight back over the winter.|$|E

Thus, they are balancing good economic policy, so they do <b>not</b> <b>get</b> voted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> office because of slow growth, and bad economic policy, so they do <b>not</b> <b>get</b> voted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> office because of unpopular policies.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Jackson covered American Football League games. In 1970, {{he was chosen}} {{to be the first}} play-by-play {{announcer}} on Monday Night Football covering the NFL, but he remained in that capacity only for the program's first season. Frank Gifford was ABC's initial target, but could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his CBS contract until after the 1970 season. In 1971, however, Gifford landed the job. Jackson found out that he had been taken off the Monday Night package from 38 messages, not from Roone Arledge himself. This incident led to some contention between Jackson and the brass at ABC. With Gifford's death in August 2015, Jackson became the last surviving member of the broadcast teams which called MNF games from the early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|After forming {{partnerships}} with multinational corporations such as Sprint, ITT and Telenor, these firms now offer the cheapest and clearest phone calls in Africa. These Somali telecommunication companies also {{provide services to}} every city, town and hamlet in Somalia. There are presently around 25 mainlines per 1,000 persons, and the local availability of telephone lines (tele-density) is higher than in neighbouring countries; three times greater than in adjacent Ethiopia. Prominent Somali telecommunications companies include Golis Telecom Group, Hormuud Telecom, Somafone, Nationlink, Netco, Telcom and Somali Telecom Group. Hormuud Telecom alone grosses about $40 million a year. Despite their rivalry, several of these companies signed an interconnectivity deal in 2005 {{that allows them to}} set prices, maintain and expand their networks, and ensure that competition does <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control.|$|E
25|$|As soon as {{the troops}} on the outside {{were aware of the}} trap into which they had fallen, the Spanish enraged by this refused to abandon the attack. They threw down the palisades and began a {{vigorous}} attack on the fortifications. At the same time the portucllis was swung wide open and a furious onslaught was made by the garrison upon the Spaniards. In the confusion the two English prisoners were able to escape unhurt. There was a fierce struggle, the Spanish could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trap; some were killed under the walls and the rest were soon speedily driven back. As they did so the Spanish were assailed on their retreat by an ambush on the dyke and the rest were hunted into the waters. They were utterly routed; a great number were killed or wounded and several high-ranking officers were taken prisoner.|$|E

The team wore a black patch with his former jersey number, 24, in current team numbering. The Ducks started the season with NHL Premiere games in Helsinki and Stockholm. This was the third time in {{franchise}} history that they started the regular season with games in Europe. They lost 4–1 to the Buffalo Sabres in Helsinki but defeated the New York Rangers 2–1 after a shootout in Stockholm. After a slow start to the season, the Ducks replaced head coach Randy Carlyle with former Washington Capitals head coach Bruce Boudreau. The rest of the season was mostly forgettable, as the Ducks could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the hole they dug themselves in the first half of the season, and ultimately failed to reach the playoffs in the 2011–12 season.|$|E
25|$|King {{suffered}} a surprise 3–2 defeat to German teenager Max Hopp {{in the first}} round of the 2015 World Championship. He lost 10–3 {{in the first round}} of the Masters to James Wade. King showed his best battling abilities at the UK Open to defeat Gary Anderson 9–8 after being 8–4 down and surviving 13 match darts from Anderson. He then overturned an 8–5 deficit against Nathan Derry to win 9–8 and emerged successfully from a deciding leg for the third game in a row by beating Kyle Anderson 9–8 to reach the quarter-finals. He met Stephen Bunting and the first 12 legs went on throw, before Bunting took four unanswered legs to inflict a 10–6 defeat on King. The rest of 2015 proved to be disappointing for King as he was eliminated at the first round stage of the World Matchplay, World Grand Prix, European Championship and Players Championship Finals and could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his group at the Grand Slam.|$|E
25|$|Márquez {{moved up}} to the welterweight {{division}} and fought undefeated pound for pound champion Floyd Mayweather Jr.. The fight was scheduled to take place at 144-pound catch weight on July 18, 2009 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena; but was postponed due to a rib injury sustained by Mayweather. The bout was rescheduled and held on September 19, 2009. During the official weigh in, Márquez weighed in at 142lbs and Mayweather weighed in at 146lbs, thereby incurring a financial penalty as he was 2 pounds over the catchweight. It was later discovered that both parties had agreed just before the weigh-in to allow Mayweather fight over the catchweight with Mayweather paying additional $600,000 due to arriving two pounds over the 144lbs weight limit. Mayweather controlled the action in the fight. Márquez struggled to conquer Mayweather's defense and could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the way of his}} counter punches. Márquez landed only 19% of his punches according to Compubox punch stats. Mayweather knocked Márquez down in the 2nd round. Mayweather won the fight by unanimous decision.|$|E
