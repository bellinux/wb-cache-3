5|$|Seattle in {{this period}} {{attracted}} widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, {{as well as through}} the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999—garnered visibility, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself. The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Two so {{dissimilar}} {{painters and}} tempers as Einar Jolin and GAN were both called Expressionists. During {{most of the}} 1910s this term was used {{in a number of}} contexts in Sweden. In 1915, the Herwarth Walden gallery Der Sturm in Berlin, a venue for Expressionists, presented an exhibition, Schwedishe Expressionisten (Swedish Expressionism), with works by Swedish artists. Jolin participated with six paintings, three of these were vistas from Stockholm. The rest of the participants were Isaac Grunewald, Edward Hald, GAN and Sigrid Hjertén. In the autumn of 1915, Jolin and GAN held a joint exhibition in Lund University's art museum. Despite their differences, their friendship continued during GAN's years in Stockholm (1916–1919). Jolin was tired of Isaac Grünewalds increasingly dominant role among the young Swedish artists at that time, a sentiment shared by GAN. Expressionism never became a dominant style for Jolin, <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> GAN {{and other members of the}} group embraced it. GAN always objected to Jolin's choice to include colors such as pearl gray and light purple or violet in his paintings.|$|E

Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the i. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (érg koud for very cold) or for disambiguation between a number of words that are spelled the same when context doesn't indicate the correct meaning (één appel = one apple, een appel = an apple; vóórkomen = to occur, voorkómen = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on {{a very small number of}} words, mostly loanwords. The ç also appears in some loanwords.|$|E

[...] In response to the question, [...] "how do you follow Christ without a church?" [...] Rice replied: [...] "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings." [...] In 2011, Rice participated in the [...] "I Am Second" [...] project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey.

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{was more}} {{critical}} of the episode, {{and gave it a}} D. He called the visual effects [...] "hilariously bad," [...] likening the CGI to [...] "a '90s computer game." [...] Sava added, [...] "As mediocre as the series has been, it was on a bit of an upswing with the last few episodes, but 'True North' is a big step backwards... The problem isn’t that these kids can’t act (although that might be the problem), it’s that the writing for their characters is horrible... This week’s episode is straight-up children’s television, and <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that it can be enjoyed by all ages. You need to be a child to suspend your disbelief long enough to watch 'True North.'" [...] Despite the critique, Sava did enjoy Caulfield's scenes, as well as Emma and Mary Margaret's conversation concerning motherhood. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Gwen Orel opined that the Hansel and Gretel [...] "parallel is clear and rather sweet, with touches of the ongoing story of Emma and Snow White, too." [...] Orel felt the episode seemed [...] "like a demented episode of Chopped," [...] and called the gingerbread house [...] "just like it should , colorful and candylike." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{producer}} Eric Buchman, while filmmaker Michael Grossman directed it. Buchman explained how his main concept for the episode was to describe O'Malley's grieving {{in a different way}} than depicted for Stevens, but in a manner that would be both bothering to her and painful for his partner, Torres. However, he stated that Torres' emotional state during the mourning was also significant to the episode: [...] "We wanted Callie to feel some remorse. She finally got George, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she wanted. She's gotten his body, but the underlying relationship isn't there anymore." [...] Buchman disclosed that one of the story lines he had originally intended to include in the scrip was Yang and Burke's cold relationship being [...] "kept alive" [...] by having silent sex, which ultimately did not occur, due to being looked upon as [...] "boring, neither dramatic, nor comedic", and also as not being descriptive of the character's feelings. The story line involving the four attending physicians fighting for the title of chief of surgery, was described by Buchman as a comic relief, used to emphasize a childish side of the characters' personalities which had not been previously developed. In addition, Buchman described Webber's retirement as an attempt to reconcile with his estranged wife, but leads to emotional devastation at the realization that she had moved on with a different man.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Thomas Sutcliffe for The Independent writes that: [...] "while flight is the sustaining theme, the film never soars. The characterisation is Cluedo with pretensions, and the dialogue suspends the actors in that ungainly, undignified dangle which you associate with stage flying, the wires robbing them of all powers of independent movement." [...] While {{he describes the}} scene which culminates the lesbian storyline as [...] "radiant" [...] and [...] "beautifully acted by Vanessa Redgrave and Dorothy Tutin", he opines of the acting in general that [...] "for the most part, these people are simply Winterson's puppets, jerked around by the symbolic demands of the plot." [...] He deems Kidron's directing [...] "a kind of surrender, dutifully supplying visual equivalents for Winterson's sterile symmetries but despairing of any greater vivacity", and is particularly critical of Winterson's screenplay, noting that: [...] "everything unrolls at the same stately pace, a religious procession bearing the reliquaries of Winterson's prose. It's as though the author thinks every word is infinitely precious. She's right, though perhaps <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she imagines." [...] Variety′s David Rooney agrees the film's coming-out scene is a [...] "potential jewel" [...] and [...] "captivatingly played", however, in line with Sutcliffe's criticisms, opines that the film's pacing means that [...] "the scene is lobbed in and robbed of its impact". He summarises the film as [...] "a willfully theatrical, sporadically magical romantic comedy embracing three barely compatible narrative strands, not one of which ever gets full flight clearance". Rooney deems the film [...] "Damaged beyond repair by a mannered scripting style and evident recutting", and opines that [...] "Jeanette Winterson's preposterous dialogue and comic mistiming serves up more misses than hits". Of the film's major themes, he writes that: [...] "Questions about the line between truth and falsehood, genuine and fake, are too flimsily voiced to mean much. Likewise, the intro of race issues in the closing voiceover only makes the haphazard mix even more lumpy".|$|E

2500|$|The term noun has a {{narrower}} purview and is detached from {{any notion of}} entity description. For instance, the words bit/bits {{in a bit of}} time, a little bit of peanut butter, and bits of information can be understood as a noun, but they can hardly be understood as representing some entity on its own. In that sense, these words shall be understood as being the head of a [...] "noun phrase" [...] in a formalist account of grammar, but as a portion of some unbounded entity in a nominal group. Since formal linguists are interested in the recurring patterns of word classes such as [...] "a" [...] + [...] "" [...] and <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> humans describe entities, they recruit the term [...] "noun phrase" [...] for their grammatical descriptions, a structure defined as a pattern around a noun, and not as a way of describing an entity such as the [...] "nominal group".
