5|$|Alterations in the {{distribution}} of different <b>neurotrophic</b> factors and in the expression of their receptors such as the brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (BDNF) have been described in AD.|$|E
5|$|In the RMS, {{vascular}} {{cells are}} arranged {{parallel to the}} route of the migrating cells and provide a scaffolding. Glial cells are also associated with the blood vessels; communication between these cells may be important for RMS migration, for example, in BDNF (brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor), a growth factor that is thought to module RMS migration.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all animals}} {{are capable of}} modifying their {{behavior}} {{as a result of}} experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like Santiago Ramón y Cajal argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the synaptic plasticity hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo published a paper on a phenomenon now called long-term potentiation: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (BDNF) and physical activity appear to play a beneficial role in the process.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
25|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that interactions between <b>neurotrophic</b> factors could alter the optimal concentrations of each factor. While cell survival and phenotype maintenance are important, the emphasis of evaluation was on neurite extension. A combination of NGF, glial cell-line derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (GDNF), and ciliary <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (CNTF) was presented to Dorsal root ganglion cultures in vitro. One factor from each <b>neurotrophic</b> family was used. It was determined {{that there is not}} a difference in individual optimal concentration and combinatorial optimal concentration; however, around day 5 or 6 the neurites ceased extension and began to degrade. This {{was hypothesized}} to be due to lack of a critical nutrient or of proper gradients; previous studies have shown that growth factors are able to optimize neurite extension best when presented in gradients. Future studies on <b>neurotrophic</b> factor combinations will need to include gradients.|$|E
25|$|Like other neurons, α-MNs send axonal {{projections}} {{to reach}} their target extrafusal muscle fibers via axon guidance, a process regulated in part by <b>neurotrophic</b> factors released by target muscle fibers. <b>Neurotrophic</b> factors also ensure that each muscle fiber is innervated by the appropriate number of α-MNs. As with most types of neurons in the nervous system, α-MNs are more numerous in early development than in adulthood. Muscle fibers secrete {{a limited amount of}} <b>neurotrophic</b> factors capable of sustaining {{only a fraction of the}} α-MNs that initially project to the muscle fiber. Those α-MNs that do not receive sufficient <b>neurotrophic</b> factors will undergo apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.|$|E
25|$|Different {{mechanisms}} regulate PCD in {{the peripheral}} nervous system (PNS) versus {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). In the PNS, innervation of the target is proportional to the amount of the target-released <b>neurotrophic</b> factors NGF and NT3. Expression of neurotrophin receptors, TrkA and TrkC, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in the absence of their ligands. Therefore, it is speculated that PCD in the PNS is dependent on the release of <b>neurotrophic</b> factors and thus follows the concept of the <b>neurotrophic</b> theory.|$|E
25|$|Niacin {{also appears}} to upregulate brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (BDNF) and {{tropomyosin}} receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression.|$|E
25|$|Currently, <b>neurotrophic</b> {{factors are}} being {{intensely}} studied {{for use in}} bioartificial nerve conduits because they are necessary in vivo for directing axon growth and regeneration. In studies, <b>neurotrophic</b> factors are normally {{used in conjunction with}} other techniques such as biological and physical cues created by the addition of cells and specific topographies. The <b>neurotrophic</b> factors {{may or may not be}} immobilized to the scaffold structure, though immobilization is preferred because it allows for the creation of permanent, controllable gradients. In some cases, such as neural drug delivery systems, they are loosely immobilized such that they can be selectively released at specified times and in specified amounts. Drug delivery is the next step beyond the basic addition of growth factors to nerve guidance conduits.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, honokiol saw a revival in {{interest}} as a potent and highly tolerable antitumorigenic and <b>neurotrophic</b> compound.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{levels of}} quinolinic acid might {{contribute}} to the apoptosis of astrocytes and certain neurons, resulting in decreased synthesis of <b>neurotrophic</b> factors. With less <b>neurotrophic</b> factors, the astrocyte-microglia-neuronal network is weaker and thus {{is more likely to}} be affected by environmental factors such as stress. In addition, increased levels of quinolinic acid could play a role in impairment of the glial-neuronal network, which could be associated with the recurrent and chronic nature of depression.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that local delivery of soluble <b>neurotrophic</b> factors {{at the site of}} autologous nerve grafting may enhance axon regeneration within the graft and help expedite functional recovery of a paralyzed target. Other {{evidence suggests}} that gene-therapy induced expression of <b>neurotrophic</b> factors within the target muscle itself can also help enhance axon regeneration. Accelerating neuroregeneration and the reinnervation of a denervated target is critically important {{in order to reduce the}} possibility of permanent paralysis due to muscular atrophy.|$|E
25|$|ECT {{appears to}} work in the short term via an {{anticonvulsant}} effect mostly in the frontal lobes, and longer term via <b>neurotrophic</b> effects primarily in the medial temporal lobe.|$|E
25|$|The <b>neurotrophic</b> {{theory is}} the leading {{hypothesis}} used to explain the role of programmed cell death in the developing nervous system. It postulates {{that in order to}} ensure optimal innervation of targets, a surplus of neurons is first produced which then compete for limited quantities of protective <b>neurotrophic</b> factors and only a fraction survive while others die by programmed cell death. Furthermore, the theory states that predetermined factors regulate the amount of neurons that survive {{and the size of the}} innervating neuronal population directly correlates to the influence of their target field.|$|E
25|$|Because they {{innervate}} many muscles, some {{clusters of}} α-MNs receive {{high concentrations of}} <b>neurotrophic</b> factors and survive this stage of neuronal pruning. This {{is true of the}} α-MNs innervating the upper and lower limbs: these α-MNs form large cell columns that contribute to the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord. In addition to receiving <b>neurotrophic</b> factors from muscles, α-MNs also secrete a number of trophic factors to support the muscle fibers they innervate. Reduced levels of trophic factors contributes to the muscle atrophy that follows an α-MN lesion.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} {{idea that}} target cells secrete attractive or inducing factors {{and that their}} growth cones have a chemotactic sensitivity was first put forth by Santiago Ramon y Cajal in 1892. Cajal presented the idea as {{an explanation for the}} “intelligent force” axons appear to take when finding their target but admitted that he had no empirical data. The theory gained more attraction when experimental manipulation of axon targets yielded death of all innervating neurons. This developed the concept of target derived regulation which became the main tenet in the <b>neurotrophic</b> theory. Experiments that further supported this theory led to the identification of the first <b>neurotrophic</b> factor, nerve growth factor (NGF).|$|E
25|$|PEDF also {{displays}} <b>neurotrophic</b> functions. Retinoblastoma cells differentiate into neurons due to {{the presence}} of PEDF. Expression of PEDF in the human retina is found at 7.4 weeks of gestation, suggesting it {{may play a role in}} retinal neuron differentiation.|$|E
25|$|As with {{anorexia}} nervosa, {{there is}} evidence of genetic predispositions contributing to the onset of this eating disorder. Abnormal levels of many hormones, notably serotonin, {{have been shown to be}} responsible for some disordered eating behaviors. Brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (BDNF) is under investigation as a possible mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms <b>neurotrophic</b> infections, and is {{the black}} yeast that most {{commonly}} causes life-threatening phaeohyphomycosis. Conditions that might predispose people towards an invasive opportunistic infection include diabetes mellitus, lymphocytic leukemia, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and catheterization. Systemic infections are often reported to be without cutaneous or subcutaneous involvement.|$|E
25|$|Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) {{also known}} as serpin F1 (SERPINF1), is a {{multifunctional}} secreted protein that has anti-angiogenic, anti-tumorigenic, and <b>neurotrophic</b> functions. Found in vertebrates, this 50 kDa protein is being researched as a therapeutic candidate for treatment of such conditions as choroidal neovascularization, heart disease, and cancer. In humans, pigment epithelium-derived factor is encoded by the SERPINF1 gene.|$|E
25|$|Cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs) and <b>neurotrophic</b> factors embedded {{together into}} biocompatible matrices {{is a relatively}} new concept being investigated. CAMs of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), which includes L1/NgCAM and neurofascin, are particularly promising, because they are expressed in the developing nervous system on neurons or Schwann cells. They are known to serve as guidance cues and mediate neuronal differentiation. <b>Neurotrophic</b> factors such as NGF and growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5), however, are well established as promoters of regeneration in vivo. A recent study by Niere, Brown et al. investigated the synergistic effects of combining L1 and neurofascin with NGF and GDF-5 on DRG neurons in culture; this combination enhanced neurite outgrowth. Further enhancement was demonstrated by combining L1 and neurofascin into an artificial fusion protein, which improves efficiency since factors are not delivered individually. Not only can different cues be used, but they may even be fused into a single 'new' cue.|$|E
25|$|This protein may {{function}} in neurite extension, proliferation of melanoma cells, stimulation of Ca2+ fluxes, inhibition of PKC-mediated phosphorylation, astrocytosis and axonal proliferation, and inhibition of microtubule assembly. In the developing CNS {{it acts as}} a <b>neurotrophic</b> factor and neuronal survival protein. In the adult organism it is usually elevated due to nervous system damage, {{which makes it a}} potential clinical marker.|$|E
25|$|One {{mechanism}} for preserving the dynamic {{range of a}} neuron is synaptic scaling, the homeostatic form of plasticity that restores neuronal activity to its normal 'baseline' levels by changing the postsynaptic response of all the synapses of a neuron {{as a function of}} activity. This means that the same scaling is done to each synapse, to either strengthen or weaken all of a neuron’s connections. Scaling can be multiplicative (multiplying or dividing the strength of each synapse by a constant number) or additive (adding or subtracting the same value from the synaptic weight). Homeostatic mechanisms go beyond the synapse. Modulation of the intrinsic excitability of a neuron is a way to maintain stability despite changing numbers and strengths of synapses. Cultured cortical pyramidal neurons maintain stability through the regulation of ionic conductances. The regulation of ionic conductances is achieved through the controlled release of brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (BDNF). BDNF has also been found to influence synaptic scaling, suggesting that this <b>neurotrophic</b> factor may be responsible for the coordination of synaptic and nonsynaptic mechanisms in homeostatic plasticity.|$|E
25|$|On the {{molecular}} level, calcium influx {{is not the}} only factor responsible for apoptosis induced by excitoxicity. Recently, it has been noted that extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, triggered by both glutamate exposure or hypoxic/ischemic conditions, activate a CREB (cAMP response element binding) protein shut-off, which in turn caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis. On the other hand, activation of synaptic NMDA receptors activated only the CREB pathway, which activates BDNF (brain-derived <b>neurotrophic</b> factor), not activating apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Soft lenses {{are often}} used in the {{treatment}} and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens protects an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids thereby allowing it to heal. They {{are used in the}} treatment of conditions including bullous keratopathy, dry eyes, corneal abrasions and erosion, keratitis, corneal edema, descemetocele, corneal ectasis, Mooren's ulcer, anterior corneal dystrophy, and <b>neurotrophic</b> keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.|$|E
25|$|Synergism often {{occurs when}} two {{elements}} are combined; {{it is an}} interaction between two elements that causes an effect greater than the combined effects of each element separately. Synergism {{is evident in the}} combining of scaffold material and topography with cellular therapies, <b>neurotrophic</b> factors, and biomimetic materials. Investigation of synergism is the next step after individual techniques have proven to be successful by themselves. The combinations of these different factors need to be carefully studied in order to optimize synergistic effects.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) have the {{capability}} to self-renew and to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineages. Many culture methods have been developed for directing NSC differentiation; however, the creation of biomaterials for directing NSC differentiation is seen as a more clinically relevant and usable technology. One approach to develop a biomaterial for directing NSC differentiation is to combine extracellular matrix (ECM) components and growth factors. A very recent study by Nakajima, Ishimuro et al. examined the effects of different molecular pairs consisting of a growth factor and an ECM component on the differentiation of NSCs into astrocytes and neuronal cells. The ECM components investigated were laminin-1 and fibronectin, which are natural ECM components, and ProNectin F plus (Pro-F) and ProNectin L (Pro-L), which are artificial ECM components, and poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI). The <b>neurotrophic</b> factors used were epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and ciliary <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (CNTF). The pair combinations were immobilized onto matrix cell arrays, on which the NSCs were cultured. After 2 days in culture, the cells were stained with antibodies against nestin, β-tubulin III, and GFAP, which are markers for NSCs, neuronal cells, and astrocytes, respectively. The results provide valuable information on advantageous combinations of ECM components and growth factors as a practical method for developing a biomaterial for directing differentiation of NSCs.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of artificial conduits {{is also known}} as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials. Whether the conduit {{is in the form of}} a biologic tube, synthetic tube or tissue-engineered conduit, it should facilitate neurotropic and <b>neurotrophic</b> communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap, block external inhibitory factors, and provide a physical guidance for axonal regrowth. The most basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical, chemical, and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formation.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{that have}} been used to make {{biologic}} tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles, while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectively. Tissue-engineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements: scaffold structure, scaffold material, cellular therapies, <b>neurotrophic</b> factors and biomimetic materials. The choice of which physical, chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment, which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regeneration. The factors that control material selection include biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical integrity, controllability during nerve growth, implantation and sterilization.|$|E
25|$|Systemic E. dermatitidis infections {{can include}} {{cerebral}} metastases. The fatality rate for such infections {{is reported to}} be over 90%. Central nervous system phaeohyphomycosis is rare, and for unknown reasons primarily arise in East Asia, despite a cosmopolitan distribution of the fungus. Within East Asian populations, young and otherwise healthy people have developed cerebral infections. Lung infections in European CF patients and neurotropic mycosis in East Asia are caused by E. dermatitidis strains that are genetically similar, and host factors such as immunological differences may be responsible for the different infection patterns. Exophiala dermatitidis occurs at very high frequency in both Asian and European saunas, and absence of <b>neurotrophic</b> mycosis in Europe isn't explained by reduced exposure to the fungus.|$|E
25|$|A {{scleral lens}} is a large, firm, oxygen {{permeable}} contact lens that {{rests on the}} sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses {{may be used to}} improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, aniridia, <b>neurotrophic</b> keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.|$|E
25|$|Schwann cells (SC) {{are crucial}} to {{peripheral}} nerve regeneration; they play both structural and functional roles. Schwann cells are responsible for taking part in both Wallerian degeneration and bands of Bungner. When a peripheral nerve is damaged, Schwann cells alter their morphology, behavior and proliferation {{to become involved in}} Wallerian degeneration and Bungner bands. In Wallerian degeneration, Schwann cells grow in ordered columns along the endoneurial tube, creating a band of Bungner (boB) that protects and preserves the endoneurial channel. Additionally, they release <b>neurotrophic</b> factors that enhance regrowth in conjunction with macrophages. There are some disadvantages to using Schwann cells in neural tissue engineering; for example, it is difficult to selectively isolate Schwann cells and they show poor proliferation once isolated. One way to overcome this difficulty is to artificially induce other cells such as stem cells into SC-like phenotypes.|$|E
25|$|Ciliary <b>neurotrophic</b> factor (CNTF) is a cytosolic {{protein that}} is not secreted. CNTF {{has been shown to}} promote the {{survival}} of neuronal cultures in vitro, and it can also act as a differentiator and trophic factor on glial cells. Further, CNTF has been previously shown to affect the differentiation of glial precursor cells in vitro; however, the influence of CNTF in the in vivo setting has only recently been determined. Winter et al. used CNTF over-expressing transgenic mice as well as wildtype controls that had CNTF levels artificially elevated via injection, were subjected to neuronal damage using ZnSO4 (a known neuronal degenerative factor), which was injected intranasally in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory bulb was then assessed for the expression of GFAP mRNA- a common marker for the glial scar. It was determined that mice with elevated levels of CNTF increased their GFAP mRNA expression two-fold. This data suggests that CNTF may mediate glial scar formation following CNS damage.|$|E
25|$|A recent study, done in November 2010 and {{published}} March 2011, {{was done by}} a team of scientists from the University of Rochester and University of Colorado School of Medicine. They did an experiment to attempt to repair trauma to the Central Nervous System of an adult rat by replacing the glial cells. When the glial cells were injected into the injury of the adult rat’s spinal cord, astrocytes were generated by exposing human glial precursor cells to bone morphogenetic protein (Bone morphogenetic protein is important because it is considered to create tissue architecture throughout the body). So, with the bone protein and human glial cells combined, they promoted significant recovery of conscious foot placement, axonal growth, and obvious increases in neuronal survival in the spinal cord laminae. On the other hand, human glial precursor cells and astrocytes generated from these cells by being in contact with ciliary <b>neurotrophic</b> factors, failed to promote neuronal survival and support of axonal growth at the spot of the injury.|$|E
25|$|Nervous system repair: Upon {{injury to}} nerve cells within {{the central nervous}} system, astrocytes fill up the space to form a glial scar, and may {{contribute}} to neural repair. The role of astrocytes in CNS regeneration following injury is not well understood though. The glial scar has traditionally been described as an impermeable barrier to regeneration, thus implicating a negative role in axon regeneration. However, recently, it was found through genetic ablation studies that astrocytes are actually required for regeneration to occur. Even more exciting, these authors found that the astrocyte scar is actually essential for stimulated axons (that axons that have been coaxed to grow via <b>neurotrophic</b> supplementation) to extend through the injured spinal cord. Interestingly, astrocytes that have been pushed into a reactive phenotype (termed astrogliosis, defined by upregulation of GFAP expression, a definition still under debate) may actually be toxic to neurons, releasing signals that can kill neurons. Much work, however, remains to elucidate their role in nervous system injury.|$|E
25|$|PCD in the {{developing}} nervous system has been observed in proliferating as well as post-mitotic cells. One theory suggests that PCD is an adaptive mechanism to regulate the number of progenitor cells. In humans, PCD in progenitor cells starts at gestational week 7 and remains until the first trimester. This process of cell death has been identified in the germinal areas of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord among other regions. At gestational weeks 19-23, PCD is observed in post-mitotic cells. The prevailing theory explaining this observation is the <b>neurotrophic</b> theory which states that PCD is required to optimize the connection between neurons and their afferent inputs and efferent targets. Another theory proposes that developmental PCD in the nervous system occurs in order to correct for errors in neurons that have migrated ectopically, innervated incorrect targets, or have axons that have gone awry during path finding. It is possible that PCD during {{the development of the}} nervous system serves different functions determined by the developmental stage, cell type, and even species.|$|E
