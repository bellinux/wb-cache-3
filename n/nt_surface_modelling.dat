The hardness on <b>NT</b> <b>surfaces</b> remains constant at 7. 9 and 8. 5 GPa indented at 1 and 7 N under 0 - 100 cycles respectively, which are {{about three times}} that of their pristine surfaces. This {{is different from the}} NT metals and nonmetallic materials, on which the hardness is about two times that of their pristine counterparts. Moreover, NT metals usually consist of randomly oriented twin and grain boundaries, making it difficult to control the uniform mechanical property. Here, novel nt structure is proposed on an fcc metal, in which all the twin boundaries are along (- 1 - 11) orientation, forming bundles of nanotwins to several micrometers in length.

Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism of interaction between dislocations and a single nanotwin is not understood. In this study, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) nanoindentation is performed, on a specimen-of a nickel (Ni) alloy containing a single nanotwin of 89 nm in thickness. The specimen is prepared using focused ion beam (BIB) technique from an <b>nt</b> <b>surface,</b> which is formed by a novel approach-tinder indentation using a developed diamond panel with tips array. The stiffness of the specimen is ten times that-of the pristine counterparts during loading. The ultrahigh stiffness is attributed, to the generation of nanotwins and the impediment of the single twin. to the dislocations. Two peak loads-are induced by the activation of a new slip system and the penetration of dislocations over the single nanotwin, respectively.
