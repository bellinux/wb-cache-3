In <b>No</b> <b>Good</b> Deed, Wade Wilson tries to save an old man from a mugger, but chooses to change into his Deadpool costume first.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> {{evidence}} aloe vera is of use {{in treating}} wounds or burns. There is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> evidence that topical application of aloe vera is effective for treating genital herpes or psoriasis. A 2014 Cochrane review found no strong {{evidence for the}} value of topical application of aloe vera to treat or prevent phlebitis caused by intravenous infusion.|$|E
5|$|In 1628, an ecclesiastical case {{related to}} a game at East Lavant, near Chichester in West Sussex, being played on a Sunday.

It did him <b>no</b> <b>good</b> as he was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance.|$|E

5|$|Miličević {{has also}} {{worked as a}} {{collaborator}} and music producer. Throughout the 2010s, he was featured on a recording with Dommin and collaborated with Ivy Levan {{on a number of}} releases, including Introducing the Dame (2013) and <b>No</b> <b>Good</b> (2015). Miličević has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style.|$|E
5|$|<b>No</b> <b>Good</b> Deed was {{released}} in front of Logan on March 3, 2017. The next day, Reynolds released an alternate version of the short online. Responses to the short praised it as a tease for Deadpool 2 and for showing that Leitch understands the character ahead of directing that film. Its humor was also highlighted by many critics.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> {{biography}} of Trimmer. Many {{of the same}} details of her life, drawn primarily from the account of her life attached to her journal, written by one of her children, are repeated in Balfour, Grenby, Rodgers, Schnorrenberg, Wills and Yarde.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> evidence to support this view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall {{got off to a}} good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was <b>no</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{example in}} the Alekhine variation, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ng4 4.e4 Nxe5 5.f4 Ng6 6.Nf3, the move 6...Bb4+ (see diagram at right) is good because White has <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reply apart from 7.Nc3. Indeed, 7.Nbd2? just loses a pawn after 7...Nxf4 whereas 7.Bd2?! Qe7! causes White great problems: both the pawn f4 and e4 pawns are attacked, and 8.Bxb4 Qxb4+ results in a double attack against b2 and f4. After 7.Nc3 Black can either answer with 7...Bxc3+ 8.bxc3 or with 7...Qf6, {{simultaneously}} attacking c3 and f4.|$|E

5|$|Having {{regained the}} ball, Wake Forest {{answered}} Georgia Tech's drive {{with one of}} their own. Several Wake running backs rushed with the ball, but it was Wake Forest quarterback Riley Skinner who advanced the ball the most. He completed a 24-yard pass to Willie Idlette, then an eight-yard toss to Nate Morton. Inside Tech territory, Wake's offense stumbled. Skinner was sacked by a Tech defender, and kicker Sam Swank was sent into the game to attempt a 45-yard field goal. Swank's kick was <b>no</b> <b>good,</b> and with 7:26 remaining in the second quarter, Georgia Tech still had a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|Texas scored {{first when}} Selvin Young ran {{the ball in}} for a touchdown. The extra point attempt by Richmond McGee was <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> The Cajuns were able to score threepoints on a field goal by Sean Comiskey making the score Texas 6, Louisiana Lafayette 3. Texas replied with 54unanswered points {{to win the game}} 60–3. With the win, Texas {{improved}} its record in season-opening games to 93–17–3 and 72–2–2 when they open the year at home. That figure includes 11straight wins and victories in 30of their last 31games at home. Their home record under Mack Brown improved to 39wins and 3losses.|$|E
5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only because there is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> {{evidence}} it works, {{but also because it}} can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E

5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason to doubt {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read {{in the context of the}} Christian belief in miracles, and it shows at the very least that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's <b>no</b> <b>good,</b> but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
50|$|The Milngavie branch (as {{the line}} had become) was {{electrified}} {{as part of}} the North Clyde modernisation scheme in 1960. There are <b>no</b> <b>goods</b> facilities on the line now. The line was partly singled under the Yoker Area Resignalling in 1990.|$|R

5|$|A one-yard rush was {{followed}} by a pass to running back Ken Oxendine that lost three yards. Following the negative-yardage play, North Carolina committed a five-yard penalty that gave the Hokies a third down and seven. Despite the extra yardage provided by the penalty, Clark's pass attempt on third down was incomplete and the Hokies again prepared to punt. During the kick, however, North Carolina defender Quinton Savage broke through the Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the punt by Jimmy Kibble. Tar Heels' defender Dre Bly picked up the loose ball and ran into the end zone for North Carolina's second touchdown of the game. Following the play, North Carolina was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration and the resulting 35-yard extra point kick was <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> Despite the missed kick, North Carolina extended its lead to 160 with 1:03 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} a news {{report on the}} cause of the explosion, Alex realizes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the plane. He deduces that Ms. Lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety. Thinking Alex is up to <b>no</b> <b>good,</b> Ms. Lewton calls the FBI agents, who take him in for questioning. Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening they decide to let him go. Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled and killed by a falling kitchen knife.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% {{of individuals}} with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is <b>no</b> <b>good</b> evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.|$|E
50|$|The later station had {{a single}} short {{platform}} that was accessed off the A706 on the Longridge side and appears to only have had a pedestrian access with <b>no</b> <b>goods</b> yard or sidings. In 1905 the platform and access are still marked.|$|R
50|$|The goods {{yard was}} {{situated}} on the down side of the line, comprising a single siding linked by trailing connections to {{the up and down}} main lines. Although Kimberley had <b>no</b> <b>goods</b> shed or crane, it was provided with loading docks and a cattle pen.|$|R
