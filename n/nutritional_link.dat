40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} {{evidence of a}} coral (Oulastrea crispata) ingesting and assimilating seagrass material. Tropical seagrass meadows export {{a substantial portion of}} their productivity and can provide an important source of nutrients to neighbouring systems such as coral reefs; however, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms of this link. To investigate whether seagrass nutrient uptake via coral heterotrophy is possible, we conducted a feeding experiment with seagrass particulate and dissolved organic matter. Using gut extractions and stable isotope analyses, we determined that O. crispata ingested 15 N-enriched seagrass particles and assimilated the nitrogen into its tissue at a rate of 0. 75 µg N cm- 2 h- 1. Corals took up nitrogen from dissolved matter at a comparable rate of 0. 98 µg N cm- 2 h- 1. While other ecological connections between seagrass meadows and reef ecosystems are well known, our results suggest a previously unstudied direct <b>nutritional</b> <b>link</b> between seagrasses and corals...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{influence}} of the Western Iberian upwelling system, the Iberian Atlantic coast holds important hatcheries and recruitment areas for Octopus vulgaris. Recently identified as an octopus hatchery, the Ría de Vigo harbors an important mesozooplankton community that supports O. vulgaris paralarvae during the first days of their planktonic stage. This study represents a preliminary approach to determine the <b>nutritional</b> <b>link</b> between wild O. vulgaris hatchlings, paralarvae and their zooplankton prey in the Ría de Vigo, by analyzing their lipid class content and fatty acid profiles. The results show that octopus hatchlings are richer in structural lipids as phospholipids and cholesterol, while the zooplankton is richer in reserve lipids like triacylglycerol and waxes. Zooplankton samples are also particularly rich in C 18 : 1 n 9 and 22 : 6 n 3 (DHA), that seem to be successfully incorporated by O. vulgaris paralarvae thus resulting in a distinct fatty acid profile to that of the hatchlings. On the other hand, content in C 20 : 4 n 6 (ARA) is maintained high through development, even though the zooplankton is apparently poorer in this essential fatty acid, confirming its importance for the development of O. vulgaris paralarvae. The content in monounsaturated fatty acids, particularly C 18 : 1 n 7, and the DHA: EPA ratio are suggested as trophic markers of the diet of O. vulgaris paralarvae...|$|E

We found that egg size varied among local populations, an unexpected result at such a small spatial scale.

40|$|Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone/cytokine that <b>links</b> <b>nutritional</b> {{status with}} neuroendocrine and immune functions.

40|$|International audienceFatty acid {{acylation}} {{of proteins}} {{corresponds to the}} co- or post-translational covalent linkage of an acyl-CoA,derived from a fatty acid, to an amino-acid residue of the substrate protein. The cellular fatty acids which are involved in protein acylation are mainly saturated fatty acids. Palmitoylation (S-acylation) corresponds to the reversible attachment of palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) via a thioester bond to the side chain of a cysteine residue. N-terminal myristoylation refers to the covalent attachment of myristic acid (C 14 : 0) by an amide bond to the N-terminal glycine of many eukaryotic and viral proteins. Octanoylation (O-acylation) typically concerns {{the formation of an}} ester bond between octanoic acid (caprylic acid, C 8 : 0) and the side chain of a serine residue of the stomach peptide ghrelin. An increasing number of proteins (enzymes, hormones, receptors, oncogenes, tumor suppressors, proteins involved in signal transduction,eukaryotic and viral tructural proteins) have been shown to undergo fatty acid acylation. The addition of the acyl moiety is required for the protein function and usually mediates protein subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction or protein-membrane interaction. Therefore, through the covalent modification of proteins, these saturated fatty acids exhibit emerging specific and important roles in modulating protein functions. This review provides an overview of the recent findings on the various classes of protein acylation leading to the biological ability of saturated fatty acids to regulate many pathways. Finally, the <b>nutritional</b> <b>links</b> between these elucidated biochemical mechanisms and the physiological roles of dietary saturated fatty acids are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Sequence {{variants}} in {{the first}} intron of FTO are strongly associated with human obesity and human carriers of the risk alleles show evidence for increased appetite and food intake. Mice globally lacking Fto display a complex phenotype characterised by both increased energy expenditure and increased food intake. The site of action of FTO on energy balance is unclear. Fasting reduces levels of Fto mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus, a site where Fto expression is particularly high. In this study, we have extended this <b>nutritional</b> <b>link</b> by demonstrating that consumption of a high fat diet (45 %) results in a 2. 5 fold increase in Arc Fto expression. We have further explored the role of hypothalamic Fto in the control of food intake by using stereotactic injections coupled with AAV technology to bi-directionally modulate Fto expression. An over expression of Fto protein by 2. 5 -fold in the ARC results in a 14 % decrease in average daily food intake {{in the first}} week. In contrast, knocking down Arc Fto expression by 40 % increases food intake by 16 %. mRNA levels of Agrp, Pomc and Npy, ARC-expressed genes classically associated with the control of food intake, were not affected by the manipulation of Fto expression. However, over expression of Fto resulted in a 4 -fold increase in the mRNA levels of Stat 3, a signalling molecule critical for leptin receptor signalling, suggesting a possible candidate for the mediation of Fto’s actions. These data provide further support for the notion that FTO itself can influence key components of energy balance, and is therefore a strong candidate for the mediation of the robust association between FTO intronic variants and adiposity...|$|E
40|$|The Placenta is an {{essential}} organ for all mammalian embryonic development as it provides the <b>nutritional</b> <b>link</b> between maternal and foetal blood streams. The cells which go on to proliferate and contribute to all the major cell types of the embryo derived placenta have been located to the trophoblast (TE) cells overlying the Inner Cell Mass (ICM) of the embryo. Immortal cell lines have been subsequentially derived from this tissue and called Trophoblast Stem (TS) cells. In parallel with their in vivo counterparts they are also reliant on Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FgF 4) (Tanaka et al., 1998) and Activin/Nodal signalling (Guzman-Ayala et al., 2004). The Ets family transcription factor, Elf 5, {{has been shown to}} be specifically expressed in the early placental trophoblast and subsequent derived tissues. Mice deficient in Elf 5 failed to form a placenta post implantation. Furthermore TS cells were unable to be derived from Elf 5 knockout embryos (Donnison et al., 2005). This work suggested that Elf 5 plays {{an essential}} role in TS cells and their differentiation. The aim of this study was to determine the downstream target genes of Elf 5 in mouse TS cells. The target genes of Fgf 4 and Activin/Nodal signalling in TS cells were also investigated. This work is hoped to contribute to an overall greater understanding of the molecular networks underlying TS cell maintenance and to contribute to our knowledge of early placental development. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted reduction of Elf 5 mRNA expression in mTS cells was achieved using two independent siRNAs; with Elf 5 reduction exceeding 80 %. The resulting changes in gene expression were measured in order to determine the downstream targets of Elf 5. Selected genes known to be important for trophoblast differentiation and maintenance were measured using real-time PCR in a candidate gene approach. Global changes in gene expression as a consequence of Elf 5 silencing were measured using an Affymetrix microarray. Global changes in gene expression due to growth factor (Fgf 4 and/or Activin) removal were also measured. Expression of 22 genes was changed using either of the Elf 5 siRNA oligonucleotides. Of these, 9 were also significantly changed by growth factor removal. Included in this set were Synopl, Hst 3 st 3 b 1, Cyr 61 and Sox 2. In the overall analysis, many genes whose expression changed upon loss of Elf 5 are known to play important roles in trophectoderm cell specification. Real-time PCR validation agreed closely with the up or down regulation measured using the microarray. This work has thus led to the discovery of sets of Elf 5 target genes potentially involved in trophoblast stem cell function and has provided the foundation for future work exploring the molecular pathways of trophoblast development...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{molecular}} pathways that <b>link</b> <b>nutritional</b> cues to developmental {{programs are}} poorly understood. Caenorhabditis elegans hatchlings arrest in a dormant state termed “L 1 diapause” until food is supplied. However, {{little is known}} about what signal transduction pathways mediate nutritional status to control arrest and initiation of postembryonic development. We report that C. elegans embryonic germline precursors undergo G 2 arrest with condensed chromosomes and remain arrested throughout L 1 diapause. Loss of the DAF- 18 /PTEN tumor suppressor bypasses this arrest, resulting in inappropriate germline growth dependent on the AGE- 1 /PI- 3 and AKT- 1 /PKB kinases. DAF- 18 also regulates an insulin/IGF-like pathway essential for longevity and dauer larva formation. However, DAF- 16 /FoxO, which is repressed by this pathway, is not required for germline arrest in L 1 diapause. Thus, these findings indicate that quiescence of germline development during L 1 diapause is not a passive consequence of nutrient deprivation, but rather is actively maintained by DAF- 18 through a pathway distinct from that which regulates longevity and dauer formation...|$|R

The results showed that organic food production methods resulted in: (a) higher levels of nutritionally desirable compounds (e. g., vitamins/antioxidants and poly-unsaturated fatty acids such as omega- 3 and CLA); (b) lower levels of nutritionally undesirable compounds such as heavy metals, mycotoxins, pesticide residues and glyco-alkaloids {{in a range of}} crops and/or milk; (c) a lower risk of faecal Salmonella shedding in pigs.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{pathways}} through which individual and household factors {{are associated with}} temporal changes in child nutritional status. In this study the concept of nutrition deprivation is used in two ways: firstly {{as indicated by the}} child's anthropometric measures, and secondly in terms of food consumption. The thesis also explores how <b>nutritional</b> deprivation is <b>linked</b> with economic deprivation. The main objectives of the study are: to examine the physical growth trajectories of children, to investigate the household's economic and nutritional (food) deprivations, to explore the determinants of child malnutrition, and finally to investigate the relationship between temporal changes in the poverty status of households and temporal changes in child nutritional status. The study uses the Pakistan Panel Data collected by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) from 1986 - 89, covering four rural districts of Pakistan. The study employs a comprehensive child health framework to establish the mechanism of child <b>nutritional</b> status by <b>linking</b> the various factors at child, household and community levels. This framework specifies poverty as the root cause of malnutrition. The basic need absolute poverty approach is used to work out the incidence and the dynamic nature of poverty. Various statistical modelling techniques for analysing the longitudinal data are used in this study. For example, to study the height and weight growth traectories of children a growth curve modelling technique is employed, and to study the determinants of child malnutrition a three-level hierarchical linear model for longitudinal data is used. The predicted average growth velocities indicate a slower growth during first year of child's life in comparison with the usual growth velocities amongst the normal children. However, in a particular cohort of children some evidence of growth acceleration is found during the third year of a child's life after a growth deceleration during the second year. Child level factors, such as breastfeeding and the incidence of diarrhoea and morbidity, are found to explain most of the variability in child nutritional status. The results reveal dissimilarities in nutritional status between children in a household. The results also indicate associations between poverty and stunting while chronic poverty is found to be associated with wasting. The results indicate that caloric and protein consumption amongst the study households was notably high. However, food consumption patterns mostly revolve around the staple food, and even in the top expenditure quintile this pattern remains persistent.

Anti-Vi antibody levels and antibodies against 4 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 5, 14 and 23 F) were measured in serum samples collected at baseline and then 14 days following vaccination and compared to data available from birth and early infancy. Post-vaccination antibody titres to serotype 14 of the pneumococcal vaccine were negatively associated with rate of growth from birth to three months of age, infant weight at 12 months of age and season of birth, but no other associations were observed with early-life exposures. The strongest predictor of antibody levels was pre-vaccination antibody titres, with adult height and serum neopterin levels at time of vaccination also implicated. The current study {{does not support the}} hypothesis that nutritional exposures {{early in life}} consistently compromise antibody response to polysaccharide vaccines administered in young adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{disruption}} of energy balance, where energy intake exceeds expenditure, {{is a major}} risk factor {{for the development of}} metabolic syndrome. The latter is charac-terized by a constellation of symptoms including obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Altered expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism as well as mito-chondrial oxidative phosphorylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g coactivator- 1 (PGC- 1) family of transcriptional coactivators is emerging as a hub <b>linking</b> <b>nutritional</b> and hormonal signals and energy metabolism. PGC- 1 a and PGC- 1 b are highly responsive to environmental cues and coordinate metabolic gene pro-grams through interaction with transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling proteins. PGC- 1 a has been impli-cated in the pathogenic conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cardiomyopathy, whereas PGC- 1 b {{plays an important role in}} plasma lipoprotein homeostasis and serves as a hepatic target for niacin, a potent hypotriglyceridemic drug. Here, we review recent advances in the identification of physiologi-cal and pathophysiological contexts involving PGC- 1 coactivators, and also discuss their implications for thera-peutic development...|$|R
40|$|The {{past few}} years of {{research}} on leptin have provided important information on the link between metabolism and immune homeostasis. Adipocytes influence not only the endocrine system but also the immune response through several cytokine-like mediators known as adipokines, which include leptin. It is widely accepted that leptin can directly <b>link</b> <b>nutritional</b> status and pro-inflammatory T helper 1 immune responses, and that a decrease of leptin plasma concentration during food deprivation can lead to an impaired immune function. Additionally, several studies have implicated leptin in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation, and the elevated circulating leptin levels in obesity appear {{to contribute to the}} low-grade inflammatory background which makes obese individuals more susceptible to increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes, or degenerative disease including autoimmunity and cancer. Conversely, reduced levels of leptin such as those found in malnourished individuals have been linked to increased risk of infection and reduced cell-mediated immune responses. We discuss here the functional influences of leptin in the physiopathology of inflammation, and the effects of leptin in the modulation of such responses. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{past twenty}} years of {{research}} on leptin has provided crucial information on the link between metabolic state and immune system function. Adipocytes influence not only the endocrine system but also the immune response, through several cytokine-like mediators known as adipokines, which include leptin. Initially described as an antiobesity hormone, leptin has subsequently been shown also to influence hematopoiesis, thermogenesis, reproduction, angiogenesis, and more importantly immune homeostasis. As a cytokine, leptin can affect thymic homeostasis and the secretion of acute-phase reactants such as interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) and tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Leptin <b>links</b> <b>nutritional</b> status and proinflammatory T helper 1 (Th 1) immune responses and the decrease in leptin plasma concentration during food deprivation leads to impaired immune function. Conversely, elevated circulating leptin levels in obesity appear {{to contribute to the}} low-grade inflammatory background which makes obese individuals more susceptible to increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or degenerative disease including autoimmunity and cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances on the role of leptin in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune disorders that may be of particular relevance in the modulation of the autoimmune attack through metabolic-based therapeutic approaches...|$|R
40|$|All {{living organisms}} conduct protein {{synthesis}} {{with a high}} degree of accuracy maintained in the transmission and flow of information from a gene to protein product. One crucial “quality control ” point in maintaining a high level of accuracy is the selectivity by which aminoacyltRNA synthetases furnish correctly activated amino acids, attached to tRNA species, as the building blocks for growing protein chains. When differences in binding energies of amino acids to an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase are inadequate, editing is used as a major determinant of enzyme selectivity. Some incorrect amino acids are edited at the active site before the transfer to tRNA (pretransfer editing), while others are edited after transfer to tRNA at a separate editing site (post-transfer editing). Access of natural non-protein amino acids, such as homocysteine, homoserine, or ornithine to the genetic code is prevented by the editing function of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Disabling editing function leads to tRNA mischarging errors and incorporation of incorrect amino acids into protein, which is detrimental to cell homeostasis and inhibits growth. Continuous homocysteine editing by methionyl-tRNA synthetase, resulting in the synthesis of homocysteine thiolactone, is part of the process of tRNA aminoacylation in living organisms, from bacteria to man. Excessive homocysteine thiolactone synthesis in hyperhomocysteinemia caused by genetic or <b>nutritional</b> deficiencies is <b>linked</b> to human vascular and neurological diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunological}} processes {{involved in}} the collaborative defence of organisms are affected by nutritional status. Thus, a positive chronic imbalance between energy intake and expenditure leads to situations of obesity, which may influence unspecific and specific immune responses mediated by humoral and cell mediated mechanisms. Furthermore, several lines of evidence have supported a link between adipose tissue and immunocompetent cells. This interaction is illustrated in obesity, where excess adiposity and impaired immune function have been described in both humans and genetically obese rodents. However, limited and often controversial information exist comparing immunity in obese and non-obese subjects as well as about the cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated. In general terms, clinical and epidemiological data support {{the evidence that the}} incidence and severity of specific types of infectious illnesses are higher in obese persons as compared to lean individuals together with the occurrence of poor antibody responses to antigens in overweight subjects. Leptin might {{play a key role in}} <b>linking</b> <b>nutritional</b> status with T-cell function. The complexities and heterogeneity of the host defences concerning the immune response in different nutritional circumstances affecting the energy balance require an integral study of the immunocompetent cells, their subsets and products as well as specific and unspecific inducer/regulator systems. In this context, more research is needed to clarify the clinical implications of the alterations induced by obesity on the immune function...|$|R
40|$|Leptin is a 16 kDa adipocyte-secreted {{hormone that}} regulates weight {{centrally}} and <b>links</b> <b>nutritional</b> status with neuroendocrine and immune function. Since its cloning in 1994, leptin’s role in regulating immune and inflammatory response {{has become increasingly}} evident. Actually, the increase of leptin production that occurs during infection and inflammation strongly suggests that leptin {{is a part of}} the cytokines loop which governs the inflammatory-immune response and the host defence mechanism. Indeed, leptin stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from cultured monocytes and enhances the production of Th 1 type cytokines from stimulated lymphocytes. Several studies have implicated leptin in the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammatory conditions such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic bowel disease. Obesity is characterized by elevated circulating leptin levels which might contribute significantly to the so called low-grade systemic inflammation, making obese individuals more susceptible to the increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, type II diabetes or inflammatory articular degenerative disease such as osteorathritis (OA). As a matter of fact, a key role for leptin in OA has been recently demonstrated since leptin exhibits, in synergy with other pro-inflammatory cytokines, a detrimental effect on articular cartilage cells by promoting nitric oxide synthesis. This review will focus prevalently on the complex relationships existing among leptin, inflammatory response and immunity, trying to provide surprising insights into leptin’s role and to discuss challenges and prospects for the future.
