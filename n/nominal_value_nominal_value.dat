40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{tolerance}} synthesis, which involves {{the allocation of}} the specified assembly tolerances among the component dimensions of an assembly to ensure a specified yield. Even though the issue of tolerance synthesis has been discussed widely, most research often assumes that component alternatives have equal <b>nominal</b> <b>values.</b> Therefore, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are negligible. However, there may be situations where the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> are different. In such cases, the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> should be considered. This paper attempts to include stackup and component <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> to the deterministic tolerance synthesis.

Once the nominal model was obtained, then the tightest intervals around each coefficient of the nominal transfer functions was created while satisfying the membership and frequency response requirements.

Copper coins of the smallest <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> of half kopeck were minted in 1925 - 1928.In 1923, the first Soviet gold coin (1 chervonets in <b>nominal</b> <b>value)</b> was minted. This conformed in all its features to the gold coin worth of 10 rubles of Russian Empire. It almost never appeared in circulation and was only used in foreign trade transactions.Starting from 1926, coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3 and 5 were made of bronze; starting from 1931, coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 10, 15 and 20 kopecks were made of cuprum-nickel alloy.There has been a great variety of the first Soviet banknotes. In circulation were the Soviet chervonets (10 rubles) and the rubles designed to portray the symbols of the Soviet ideology. The types of banknotes of this period were often replacing each other.A monetary reform was passed in 1947 with a key objective to promote to a quick recovery of the war-suffered economy, withdrawal of counterfeit money from circulation and replacement of the old samples with new ones.The monetary reform of 1961 was aimed to change the price scale (10:1), improve the money cycle and issue banknotes of new design. New series of coins in <b>nominal</b> <b>value</b> 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 kopecks and 1 ruble {{were put into}} circulation.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the relative permeability and conductivity of thin materials that could not be found using traditional methods, we constructed a shield box and developed a measuring system to estimate the unknown electric parameters of exotic shielding materials such as thin cloths. Thin electromagnetic shielding sheets of both nonmagnetic materials and ferromagnetic materials were used. The shielding effectiveness of the materials was measured as a function of frequency, and the results were compared with the calculated solutions for a multilayered model that was evaluated using the Sommerfeld integral that expresses near-field spherical waves by a composition of cylindrical waves. In these calculations, the relative permeability and conductivity were varied to determine the solution closest to the measured results. The least squares method was used to determine the best fitted <b>values.</b> Initially the <b>nominal</b> <b>values</b> of relative permeability were assumed, and the conductivity was found using the fitting technique. Then this determined value of the conductivity was assumed, and the relative permeability was found using the fitting technique.

Under the assumption that all devices in the network always have data to transmit, we show that work from network engineering can be adapted to calculate the total transmitted power, accounting for the possibility of multiple devices transmitting at the same time. The paper focuses on total transmitted power as it gives an upper bound on exposure and makes the impact of multiple devices clear.
