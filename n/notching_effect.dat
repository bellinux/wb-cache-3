40|$|In {{order to}} protect the {{patterned}} mask from contamination during lithography process, pellicle has become a critical component for Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology. According to EUV pellicle requirements, the pellicle should have high EUV transmittance and robust mechanical property. In this study, silicon nitride, which is well-known for its remarkable mechanical property, was used as a pellicle membrane material to achieve high EUV transmittance. Since long silicon wet etching process time aggravates <b>notching</b> <b>effect</b> causing stress concentration on the edge or corner of etched structure, the remaining membrane is prone to fracture at the end of etch process. To overcome this <b>notching</b> <b>effect</b> and attain high transmittance, we began preparing a rather thick (200 nm) SiNx membrane which can be stably manufactured and was thinned into 43 nm thickness with HF wet etching process. The measured EUV transmittance shows similar values to the simulated result. Therefore, the result shows possibilities of HF thinning processes for SiNx EUV pellicle fabrication. ? ??? ?? ??

The <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> is analysed through the evolution of the apparent fracture toughness and the application of the Theory of the Critical Distances.

40|$|Charging and {{topography}} evolution simulations during {{plasma etching}} of high aspect ratio line-and-space patterns reveal that electron shadowing of the sidewalls critically affects charging damage. Decreasing {{the degree of}} electron shadowing by using thinner masks decreases the potentials of the etched features with a concomitant reduction in catastrophic tunneling currents through underlying thin gate oxides. Simultaneously, the potential distribution in the trench changes, significantly perturbing the local ion dynamics which, in turn, cause the <b>notching</b> <b>effect</b> to worsen. Since the latter can be reduced independently by selecting an appropriate etch chemistry, the use of thinner (hard) masks is predicted to be advantageous {{for the prevention of}} gate oxide failure...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDeep {{reactive}} {{ion etching}} (DRIE) of silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer has become a popular method to build microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) because it is versatile and simple. However when the devices using this technology become large in size or have compliant beams, the stiction occurring during the HF wet release is a serious problem. We have observed that some structure patterns could be wet released more easily than others. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between structure patterns and their stiction property, and describe the <b>notching</b> <b>effect,</b> which {{is found to be}} the mechanism behind this dependence. We finally provide simple mask layout design rules to utilize this effect to our advantage. These rules allow etching the structure and releasing it with the same DRIE step, without any wet process. Alternatively, this method will completely remove the stiction appearing during wet release or other further wet processes. We show the application of these rules on the fabrication of a large moving stage...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{charging}} {{effect in}} hybrid dc/rf capacitively coupled plasmas is investigated by particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo simulations with an equivalent-circuit module. When {{the thickness of}} the dielectric is fixed, the self-bias dc voltage induced by the charge accumulated in the dielectric first increases and then decreases with increased dc voltage. The ratio of electron-to-ion charge flowing into the dielectric increases from − 1. 195 to − 2. 582. Increasing the dc voltage results in the number of high-energy ions bombarding the dielectric decreasing. The average electron energy at the dielectric decreases to the minimum value at the biggest self-bias dc voltage in the beginning and then rapidly increases. While fixing the dc source with thickening the dielectric, the self-bias dc voltage rises, but the charge ratio decreases. The average electron energy decreases monotonically and the ion-energy distributions (IEDs) at the dielectric are shifted toward the higher energy region. The results imply that the applied dc voltage may increase the electron flux and average energy to the dielectric at the cost of reduced etching rate, which may mitigate the <b>notching</b> <b>effect.</b> The applied dc voltage can also serve as a tool to modulate the ion IEDs. At the same time, a thicker dielectric will require higher applied dc voltage. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presented}} an enhancement solution for transdermal drug delivery using microneedles array with biodegradable tips. The microneedles array was fabricated by using deep {{reactive ion etching}} (DRIE) and the biodegradable tips were made to be porous by electrochemical etching process. The porous silicon microneedle tips can greatly enhance the transdermal drug delivery in a minimum invasion, painless, and convenient manner, at the same time; they are breakable and biodegradable. Basically, the main problem of the silicon microneedles consists of broken microneedles tips during the insertion. The solution proposed is to fabricate the microneedle tip from a biodegradable material - porous silicon. The silicon microneedles are fabricated using DRIE <b>notching</b> <b>effect</b> of reflected charges on mask.

40|$|AbstractEmpirical notch {{sensitivity}} factors q {{have been used}} {{for a long time to}} account for <b>notch</b> <b>effects</b> in fatigue design. This old concept has been recently modeled using sound mechanical principles to properly quantify the influence of the stress gradient around the notch tip on the fatigue behavior of mechanically short cracks.

This model predictions have been validated by proper tests, and based on this experimental evidence a criterion to accept tolerable short cracks has been proposed.

40|$|While a long stable crack {{propagation}} phase was observed during experiments of complex welded components, very conservative {{assessments of the}} fatigue life were achieved in the past.

The analyses aim to investigate how the crack propagation is altered if the structural configuration gets more complex. In conclusion, the stress gradient over the plate thickness, the apparent plate thickness and the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> slows down the crack propagation rate if the same stress value being effective for fatigue appears at the weld toe.

The wave-like distribution of the load amplitude along the longitudinal axis of the UFTS specimens with a maximum in the minimum cross-section (at about the half length) of the sample permits a selective testing of the different weld zones (weld seam, heat-affected zone and base metal). In addition, the influence of microscopic and macroscopic <b>notch</b> <b>effects</b> on the VHCF behaviour was analysed systematically for a precipitation-hardened Al-alloy in different heat-treatment conditions, representing the different zones of a welded joint. “Artificially” notched and heat-treated samples with the same notch factor compared to the weld reinforcement represent the macroscopic <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> of the welded joint. A comparison of VHCF results of the welded samples with those based on notched specimens is presented and discussed. The weld metal with its various welding defects proved to be the weakest link of the joint structures, provided the reinforcement is trimmed.

40|$|Austenitic steels {{are among}} the {{stainless}} steels the most common used type of material to produce sheet metal parts which can be manufactured by laser beam cutting in a useful manner. However, {{the use of this}} technique to manufacture structural thick parts is restricted due to the creation of macroscopic defects and the lack of reliable fatigue strength data. In this context, the fatigue behavior of sheet-like samples made of metastable austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 cut by laser beam is discussed in this paper. The analyses showed that laser beam cutting creates three kinds of macroscopic defects, which are a pronounced relief-like structure along the cut surface, burr in the underside of the cut edge and pores in the interface between the recast layer and base material or inside the recast layer. As a consequence, the fatigue strength of parts cut by laser beam is 40 % lower in comparison to specimens in a macroscopically quasi defect-free state. An evaluation of the fatigue results based on comprehensive fractographic analyses allows to explain the reasons for distinct differences between the aforementioned influence factors. The most significant reduction of fatigue life is attributed to the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> of the burr, followed by the <b>notch</b> <b>effect</b> created by pores, while the influence of the surface relief is of minor significance...|$|R
