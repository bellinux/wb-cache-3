50|$|The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis blocked Ultronics {{from winning}} a {{historic}} first. In July 1962 AT&T launched {{the first commercial}} satellite (Telstar) to transmit television and telephone voice channels between the U.S. and England and France. This was a <b>non-synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> which circled the earth in an elliptical orbit of about 2.5 hours, such that it gave only about 20 minutes of communication between the U.S. and Europe on each pass. Ultronics arranged with AT&T {{to use one of}} its voice channels to transmit U.S. stock prices to Paris in October 1962. All of the arrangements were made-a Stockmaster unit was installed in the Bache brokerage office on Rue Royale and all of the American Stockbrokers and the press and television were ready for this historic event. About two hours before the pass the stock transmission was cancelled because U.S. president John Kennedy was going to use the pass to send his speech to France concerning the Cuban missile crisis.|$|E
40|$|VHF {{amplitude}} transmissions, from a {{large number}} of <b>non-synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> passes, were recorded to deduce ionospheric scintillation occurrences from low to auroral latitudes during a geomagnetically quiet period. An intense region of random scintillationproducing irregularities was centred near a mid-latitude station. Simultaneously, the records obtained from satellites moving in meridional planes indicated the presence of pronounced, regular fading, or quasiperiodic (QP) scintillations, at large zenith angles and equatorwards of the station. Other stations, positioned away from scintillationproducing irregularities, recorded signals which were free of QP scintillations. It is suggested that reflection and interference of the transmitted radio waves, due to the presence of tilted ionization surfaces embedded in the random scintillation-producing structure, are responsible for the preferential occurrence pattern of the regular fading...|$|E
