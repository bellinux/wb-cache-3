25|$|Maslow's {{hierarchy}} of <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pyramid depicting {{the levels of}} human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends {{the steps of the}} pyramid, he reaches self-actualization. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi.|$|E

After his terms as vice president, he opened an Indianapolis law practice, where he authored several legal books and his memoir, Recollections. He continued to travel and speak publicly.

500|$|Marshall's wit is {{best remembered}} for a phrase he {{introduced}} to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator Joseph L. Bristow in which the senator provided {{a long list of}} what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over and muttered to one of his clerks, [...] "What this country needs is more of this; what this country needs is more of that" [...] and quipped loudly enough others to overhear, [...] "What this country <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> really good five-cent cigar." [...] Marshall’s remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times [...] and [...] "buckling down to thrift and work." ...|$|E

30|$|We {{found that}} special <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{ineffective}} euphemism {{regardless of whether}} the persons being described by the euphemism are children, college students, or middle-age adults. Special <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> ineffective euphemism even in the eyes of people who have a personal connection to disability, such as parents of children with a disability or professionals who work with disabled children or adults. Even for people with a personal connection to disability, the euphemism special <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> no more effective than the non-euphemized term disability.|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{characters}} {{described as}} having special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> most frequently chosen last, indicating that special <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> ineffective euphemism.

If special <b>needs</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> effective euphemism, then we would have observed that characters described as having special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> chosen last less often than characters described as having a disability or a certain disability.
