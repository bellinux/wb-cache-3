40|$|Thermoelectric {{materials}} have attracted enormous academic and industrial interest recently {{due to the}} fact that they can be used in solid state devices for power generation and cooling applications. It is expected that such thermoelectric applications will eventually contribute to meet the energy challenge in the future if the performance of the current devices can be further promoted through an increase in thermoelectric efficiency of the materials. Structural <b>nano-engineering</b> of conventional thermoelectric materials has lately shown its potential in improving the efficiency. However, <b>nano-engineering</b> especially for top-down techniques for thin film materials often involves complicated preparation processes and expensive equipment. In contrast, electrochemical deposition provides an easy-to-handle and inexpensive bottom-up method for <b>nano-engineering.</b> It requires a complete understanding of the fundamental processes regarding electrochemical interfaces between liquid and solid phases, electron transfer involving reduction and oxidation reactions, and electro-crystallization and deposition mechanism, etc. This thesis concerns thin film fabrication of the thermoelectric materials bismuth telluride (Bi 2 Te 3) and its derivatives using electrochemical deposition. Systematic investigations of the deposition mechanisms were first carried out using a variety of analytical electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and combined electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Different mechanisms were found for Bi 2 Te 3 deposition on stainless steel substrates and gold-coated silicon substrates. A follow-up study revealed a complex underpotential deposition and nucleation process of the deposition on the gold surface. Based on the mechanistic studies, thin films (< 1 μm) of binary Bi 2 Te 3 and Sb 2 Te 3 and ternary Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 and Bi 2 Te 2. 7 Se 0. 3 were prepared using continuous and pulse electrodeposition. Comparison of film composition, surface morphology, and crystal structure for the two deposition approaches and for different deposition parameters was made and correlated to the thermoelectric and transport properties which were measured after the films were transferred to non-conducting substrates. It was found that the thermoelectric properties of the as-deposited thin film materials studied are generally lower than their bulk counterparts due to factors such as unusual high carrier concentration, presence of grain boundaries and low crystallinity. Adjustment of the deposition conditions did not provide an effective improvement of the thermoelectric properties of the as-deposited films. However, for Bi 2 Te 3 -based films, annealing of the as-deposited films at elevated temperate resulted in significant reduction of carrier concentration with an accompanying increase in Seebeck coefficient...|$|E

Besides tunable IR absorption, QD structures offer wide flexibility for <b>nano-engineering</b> of electron processes via the built-in-dot charge, correlation of dot positions, and selective doping.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the performance of current trends in high speed, highly controllable anisotropic plasma etching of silicon for its use in micro- and <b>nano-engineering.</b> Optimisation rules for tuning the equipment are formulated to enable maximum results with respect to etch rate, etch selectivity, and profile control (e. g. anisotropy). The optimisation process uses the black silicon method to allow for an easy to use design-of-experiment method. After optimisation, etch rates of silicon up to 15 μm/min were obtained at a relatively high pressure (4 Pa = 30 m Torr and ICP power (2 kW), while keeping the anisotropy high. At the same time, the erosion rates of thermal silicon dioxide and ordinary photoresist (Shipley S 1805) were around 7 nm/min (i. e. selectivities up to 2000). Increasing the pressure to 20 Pa, the selectivity increased to 10, 000, although bottling became more pronounced. The high etch rate and high selectivity are especially important in the case of micro-engineering, where wafer through etching with the help of plasmas become a standard in the near future. In the case of <b>nano-engineering,</b> however, profile control is the main concern. To prevent undercut in such cases, in particular, bottling due to a broad ion angular distribution, the pressure should be sufficiently low. The best results were found at pressures below 0. 2 Pa = 1. 5 mTorr and at a low ICP power of 350 W to prevent a too strong mask erosion caused by the low pressure. The silicon etch rate decreased to 1 μm/min and the erosion rate of the oxide and resist were both approximately 20 nm/min, giving a selectivity of 50. Reproducibility (wafer-to-wafer) and uniformity were also output factors of prime concern. Surprisingly enough, for two different equipment manufacturers the results were almost identical when using the same parameter setting. This indicates that the SF 6 /O 2 -based chemistry was optimised rather than the equipment itself...|$|E

While the Fermi surface observed at the (001) termination is isotropic, the 2 DEG at the (101) termination is anisotropic and shows a charge carrier density three times larger than at the (001) surface. Moreover, we demonstrate that intense UV synchrotron radiation can alter the electronic structure and stoichiometry of the surface up to the complete disappearance of the 2 DEG.
