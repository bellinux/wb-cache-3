25|$|The German Eighteenth Army and the Sixteenth Army {{successfully}} {{conquered the}} remaining parts of Estonia, seizing Chudovo, north of Novgorod, which severed {{one of the}} two main supply lines from Leningrad to Moscow. In support of these operations, Richthofen's Corps dropped 3,351 tons of bombs in 4,742 attacks from 10 to 20 August 1941. On 20 August Richthofen moved strike and fighter aircraft to Spasskaya Polist, 40km north-east of Novgorod, to support an attack that would encircle Leningrad, and cut it off from Murmansk. German XXXXI Panzer Corps sealed in Soviet forces in the Lake Ilmen-Luga-Novgorod sector. The Leningrad Front attempted to relieve them, and Richthofen was ordered to blunt the attack. The Soviets were supported by strong air units, and large air battles broke out. During the course of them Fliegerkorps VIII lost one of its most able Stuka aces, Anton Keil. The Germans succeeded in maintaining their lines, and could <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> capturing Leningrad.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors {{announced}} that, since {{church members}} had repeatedly violated previous agreements, {{it would no}} longer negotiate with the church to try to prevent vicarious baptism. Speaking on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, Ernest Michel, a Holocaust survivor who reported on the Nuremberg Trials, speaking as the honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, called on the LDS Church to [...] "implement a mechanism to undo what [...] have done", and declared that the LDS Church had repeatedly violated their agreements, and that talks with Mormon leaders were now ended. Jewish groups, he said, would <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the court of public opinion}} for justice. Michel called the practice a revision of history that plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers, stating: [...] "They tell me, that my parents' Jewishness has not been altered but ... 100 years from now, how will they be able to guarantee that my mother and father of blessed memory who lived as Jews and were slaughtered by Hitler for no other reason than they were Jews, will someday not be identified as Mormon victims of the Holocaust?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama's {{decision}} to allow the violation of a red line he himself had drawn to go unpunished is widely criticised by the U.S. political establishment, {{as well as the}} allies, as detrimental to America's international credibility. However, in early 2016, Obama said he was [...] "proud" [...] of his decision, which repudiated what he referred to as the [...] "Washington playbook" [...] and avoided entangling the US in yet another [...] "unfixable" [...] situation in the Middle East. More broadly, regarding Obama's lack of meaningful support to the Syrian anti-government rebels, in 2015, The Economist opined, [...] "Rarely has an American president so abjectly abandoned his global responsibility", adding in 2016, [...] "The agony of Syria is the biggest moral stain on Barack Obama's presidency. And the chaos rippling from Syria—where many <b>now</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> al-Qaeda, not the West, for salvation—is his greatest geopolitical failure." [...] In 2016, Nicholas Kristof described inaction in Syria as [...] "Obama's worst mistake", while Jonathan Schanzer said [...] "the White House Syria policy has been an unmitigated dumpster fire." [...] Michael Mullen, {{former chairman of the joint}} chiefs of staff, described the conflict in Syria as [...] "Obama's Rwanda".|$|E
