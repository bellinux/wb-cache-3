5|$|The {{building}} of the railways in the early 1840s introduced <b>new</b> <b>employment</b> <b>opportunities</b> for people {{in places such as}} Stockport and Manchester, as well as an influx of people coming to live in the area. In the mid-19th century, one of the earliest shops was opened in the Smithy Green area, selling groceries, sweets and other provisions. As people settled in the area, more shops were opened and new houses were built, many of which still stand. During the early 20th century Cheadle Hulme experienced a rapid growth in population, mostly due to an influx of people from Manchester and other large towns and cities coming to live in the area, and it gradually became more suburban. In the 1930s more houses were built around the Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, Gill Bent Road, Hulme Hall Road and Cheadle Road areas, and new roads replaced old farms. In the 1960s the Hursthead estate was built on land that was once Hursthead Farm. By 2009 the only farm remaining was Leather's Farm on Ladybridge Road.|$|E

This plan included a pilot growth centre in the Bathurst-Orange area and was known as the Bathurst Orange Development Corporation (BODC). Initially 13 areas were proposed, however only four were established with Bathurst-Orange and Albury-Wodonga the only in rural regional NSW. The project would comprise domestic, commercial and industrial developments and would develop the area economically, raise new capital investment, bring population to the region and create <b>new</b> <b>employment</b> <b>opportunities.</b> A statutory body was established by Act of Parliament to manage the BODC. The Act was effective from 1 July 1974. A key focus for the BODC was the purchase of land and to that end it purchased 209 properties around Bathurst valued at $22million. A decline in regional trade as a result of changing global trends and the international depression and the oil shock during the mid-70s resulted in a declining interest by developers in new facilities. The BODC progressively received less and less government support and suffered liquidity problems. Several large new employers moved to Bathurst as part of the BODC initiative, including Devro, Uncle Bens (now Mars), and Omya Minerals.|$|E

The volume of chip material was ranged up to 56 000 m 3 in a model area. The results showed that the annual labor cost of the proposed system was higher than that of the conventional system because the utilization ratio of chipper of the proposed system was also higher. The chip supply cost of the proposed system became lower than that of the conventional system because of its proper productivity and machine price. The utilization ratio of machine used in this study will be an important indice for creating employments when establishing chip supply chain. The benefits of the proposed system using multiple chippers are not only creating employments in local community but also bringing flexibility to a stable chip supply system and avoiding the risk of machine workouts and troubles. Therefore, the proposed system that introduces multiple lines using low price chippers will be useful for cost efficient management of small scale forestry and for providing sustainable bioenergy business...|$|R
