50|$|In {{relation}} to the Uzamnica camp, the evidence showed that both Milan <b>Lukić</b> and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> were opportunistic visitors to the camp, although <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> came to the camp less frequently than Milan Lukić. When at the camp, both Milan <b>Lukić</b> and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> severely and repeatedly kicked and beat the detainees with their fists, truncheons, sticks and rifle butts. Several victims testified before the Trial Chamber about these brutal beatings and the grave and permanent injuries they sustained and the suffering they endured.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Milan <b>Lukić,</b> <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> and Mitar Vasiljević {{were indicted}} by the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia in The Hague for persecution's as a crime against {{humanity}} and the [...] "extermination of a significant number of civilians, including women, children and the elderly." [...] In his sentence the tribunal concluded that Lukić and his troops may have killed thousands of people in the period between 1992 and 1993.|$|R
50|$|On 20 July 2009 {{judgment}} was handed down in Case IT-98-32 against <b>Lukić</b> and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> by the International Criminal Tribunal's Trial Chamber III, judges Patrick Robinson (Presiding), Christine Van Den Wyngaert and Pedro David.|$|R
50|$|The {{crimes of}} which Lukić was convicted include murder, torture, assault, looting, {{destruction}} {{of property and}} the killing of at least 132 identified men, women and children. <b>Lukić's</b> cousin, <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić,</b> and a close family friend Mitar Vasiljević were convicted by the ICTY and sentenced to 30 years and 15 years in prison, respectively.|$|R
50|$|On 20 July 2009 Milan <b>Lukić</b> and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> {{were sentenced}} to life in prison and 30 years’ {{imprisonment}} respectively, for crimes that included the Pionirska Street fire and the murder of at least 60 Bosniak civilians in the Bikavac fire on 27 June 1992, when the civilians were forced into a house, all exits were blocked and several explosive devices and petrol were thrown in, setting the house on fire.|$|R
50|$|The Association of Women Victims of War, {{representing}} Višegrad rape victims, expressed {{anger at}} the ICTY's failure to prosecute Milan Lukić for rape and rapes committed under his authority. The Association's head, Bakira Hasečić, who has described how she herself was raped at knifepoint by Lukić in a basement of the Višegrad police station, claimed rape victims were let down {{by the failure of}} the ICTY to charge either Milan <b>Lukić</b> or <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> with rape or sexual abuse.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> (born 5 April 1961, Rujiste, Višegrad, Bosnia and Herzegovina) is a Bosnian Serb war criminal.|$|R
50|$|The Trial Chamber found <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> {{guilty of}} war crimes and crimes against {{humanity}} and sentenced him to 30 years imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|Before the war, 63% of {{the town}} {{residents}} were Bosniak. In 2009, {{only a handful of}} survivors had returned to what is now a predominantly Serb town. On 5 August 2001, survivors of the massacre returned to Višegrad for the burial of 180 bodies exhumed from mass graves. The exhumation lasted for two years and the bodies were found in 19 different mass graves. The charges of mass rape were unapproved as the prosecutors failed to request them in time. Cousins Milan <b>Lukić</b> and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> were convicted on July 20, 2009, to life in prison and 30 years, respectively, for a 1992 killing spree of Muslims.|$|R
5000|$|In {{relation}} to the Uzamnica camp, the evidence showed that Milan <b>Lukić</b> and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> were opportunistic visitors to the camp, which Sredoje visited less frequently than Milan. They both severely and repeatedly kicked and beat detainees with fists, truncheons, sticks and rifle butts. As opportunistic visitors to the camp, they came {{for no other reason}} than to inflict violence on the detainees. The extraordinary brutality with which they behaved towards the detainees caused them serious and permanent damage. The ICTY's Trial Chamber observed that the Pionirska street fire was an example of the worst acts of inhumanity that a person was capable of inflicting upon others and [...] "ranked high in the long, sad and wretched history of man's inhumanity to man".|$|R
5000|$|Lukić {{was sentenced}} to life imprisonment. <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> was found guilty of crimes {{including}} aiding and abetting the murders at Pionirska Street and {{was sentenced to}} 30 years imprisonment.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić's</b> defence team filed {{a notice}} of appeal and its appeal brief. The {{prosecution}} has also filed a motion of appeal and its appeal briefs, requesting that Lukić's sentence be reviewed and lengthened.|$|R
50|$|He {{was charged}} with six counts of crimes against {{humanity}} and four counts of violations of the customs of war, all of which he pleaded not guilty to. While he was originally scheduled to be tried along with Milan and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić,</b> his case proceeded on its own as the others were still at large at the time.|$|R
50|$|On 20 July 2009 Milan and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> {{were sentenced}} to life in prison and 30 years’ {{imprisonment}} respectively, for crimes that included the Bikavac fire and the murder of 59 Bosniak civilians in the Pionirska Street fire on 14 June 1992, which occurred after the civilians were locked into one room of a house that was then set on fire.|$|R
50|$|Bakira Hasečić campaigned {{prominently}} to have rape charges {{included in}} the indictment against Milan and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> (cousins) before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) at The Hague. She challenged the ICTY's Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte's assertion that the prosecution did not have evidence for such charges when it drew up the indictment as no witnesses would come forward. She insisted that she and other women had previously made statements to officials that were available to Hague investigators.|$|R
50|$|The ICTY's initial joint {{indictment}} against Milan and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> and Mitar Vasiljević {{stated that}} Vilina Vlas {{had been used}} to incarcerate prisoners who were tortured, beaten up and sexually abused, though none of the original 20 counts specifically mentioned rape. Witnesses at Vasiljević's subsequent separate trial spoke about the mass rapes that had occurred in Višegrad. Vasiljević told the Tribunal how he had heard that Milan Lukić raped, robbed and murdered many of his victims, including a number of girls Lukić raped after capturing the village of Musici.|$|R
50|$|It {{was found}} that on 14 June 1992, during the ethnic {{cleansing}} of the Drina Valley by the Bosnian Serbs, 70 Bosniak women, children and elderly men, most {{of them from the}} village of Koritnik, were confined in a house in Pionirska Street, Višegrad by cousins Milan and <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić.</b> They were locked into one room of the house, which was then set on fire. Milan Lukić was found to have thrown an explosive device into the room, setting the house ablaze. 59 of the occupants died. Lukić shot at people trying to escape from the burning house. All the survivors that were still alive testified at the trial.|$|R
50|$|When Judge Patrick Robinson, presiding, {{summed up}} the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia's {{findings}} following the trial of Milan Lukić and his cousin <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić,</b> he observed that: In the all too long, sad and wretched history of man’s inhumanity to man, the Pionirska street and Bikavac fires must rank high. At {{the close of the}} twentieth century, a century marked by war and bloodshed on a colossal scale, these horrific events stand out for the viciousness of the incendiary attack, for the obvious premeditation and calculation that defined it, for the sheer callousness and brutality of herding, trapping and locking the victims in the two houses, thereby rendering them helpless in the ensuing inferno, and for the degree of pain and suffering inflicted on the victims as they were burnt alive.|$|R
50|$|In May 2011, a {{green area}} in Block 8-a was <b>named</b> Lukićev gaj (<b>Lukić's</b> grove) {{after one of}} the most famous Serbian children's poet, Dragan Lukić, who lived nearby and died in 2006. Area was reconstructed and new Lombardy poplars were planted. Mini park covers and area of 500 m2.|$|R
50|$|The kukovi {{group has}} around 40 summits {{exceeding}} 1600 m. The area around Hajdučki kukovi has a complex underground drainage system. The terrain is much wilder than around Rožanski kukovi, {{and there are}} parts where even today no human foot has ever trod. Lukina jama, the deepest mountain cave in Croatia {{and one of the}} deepest in southeast Europe, with a depth of 1392 m, was discovered in 1992 by a local caving enthusiast <b>named</b> Ozren <b>Lukić.</b> Lukić joined a mountain division during the war (1991-95) as a volunteer and was killed by a sniper in 1992. Lukina jama was named after him.|$|R
50|$|He was {{returned}} to The Hague. On 24 February 2006, he made his initial appearance before the Tribunal and {{pleaded not guilty to}} twelve counts of crimes against humanity (persecution, murder counts, inhumane acts counts, extermination counts) and nine counts of violations of the laws or customs of war (murder counts, cruel treatment counts). A request by the Prosecution to have Lukić's case referred to the national authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina was ultimately denied by the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY. On Friday, 20 July 2007, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) decided to revoke the referral of the <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> case to Bosnia and Herzegovina, clearing the way for it to be tried jointly in The Hague with the case of Milan Lukić. The Lukićs' co-indictee, Mitar Vasiljević, had already been convicted and sentenced for his part in crimes committed in association with Lukić.|$|R
50|$|He {{was found}} to have {{substantially}} contributed to the deaths of 59 people trapped in the Pionirska Street fire. He had been present at Jusuf Memić's house, and carrying arms, while the robbery and the strip searches were taking place inside and when the women were removed. He was also present during the transfer of victims to Adem Omeragić's house. The ICTY Trial Chamber concluded that there was no reliable evidence he had set the house on fire or shot at the windows as people tried to escape. Nevertheless, although he did not set Adem Omeragić's house on fire himself, he knew {{what would happen to the}} group of victims that he helped to herd there. Judge Patrick Robinson dissenting, the Trial Chamber found that by his presence and by being armed, <b>Sredoje</b> <b>Lukić</b> substantially contributed to the deaths of the 59 people trapped in the house and that he had aided and abetted the cruel treatment and inhumane acts committed against all the members of the group.|$|R
