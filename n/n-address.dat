40|$|Abstractâ€”In {{this work}} we extend the FSMD (Finite-State Machine with Datapath) model to {{encompass}} synchronous memory accesses, intermodule communication and hardwareoptimizing transformations. A lightweight typed assembly language, <b>N-Address</b> Code (NAC), {{is used as}} a designerfriendly representation of FSMDs, simplifying the adaptation of hardware synthesis with existing frontends. The quality (computation time, chip area) of the generated FSMDs has been evaluated on modern FPGAs. Our approach overcomes the C code limitations of four HLS tools while maintaining a good speed/area balance. I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK The annual increase of chip complexity is 58 %, while human designers productivity increase is limited to 21 % 1. A drastic increase in designer productivity is only possibl...|$|E
