40|$|Inhibition of {{proteoglycan}} (P) synthesis by β-D xylosides (Xyl) {{is associated}} with growth inhibition in several cultured vascular cell lines. We {{examined the effects of}} <b>naroparcil</b> (an orally active Xyl) on intimal hyperplasia induced by balloon iliac injury in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. 36 rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet were randomly assigned to either placebo or 300 mg/kg <b>naroparcil.</b> After 14 days, iliac injury was induced by bilateral endothelial abrasion using a 4 F latex balloon. Eight weeks later, serum cholesterol levels did not differ between groups. Quantitative angiography as well as quantitative histomorphometry, with immunostaining of smooth muscle cells (HHF- 35). macrophages (RAM- 11) and proteoglycans (PG- 6 S) were performed. Results are (mean±SD) :ControlsNaroparcilpAngiography (mm) Minimal lumen diameter: 0. 45 ± 0. 070. 75 ± 0. 06 < 0. 05 Histomorphometry (mm 2) Lumen area: 0. 47 ± 0. 180. 87 ± 0. 33 < 0. 05 Intimal thickness (mml) 0. 61 ± 0. 040. 40 ± 0. 03 < 0. 01 Media area: 0. 76 ± 0. 230. 65 ± 0. 18 NSMedia HHF- 35 -stained area (%) 22 ± 643 ± 7 < 0. 01 Media RAM-l 1 -stained area (%) 12 ± 229 ± 9 < 0. 01 Media PG 6 S-stained area (%) 13 ± 214 ± 3 NSThere was no difference in immunostaining of the intima. In this model, treatment with <b>naroparcil</b> resulted in decreased intimal thickening and preserved vascular lumen. The mechanism of this effect is probably not linked to PG metabolism but to medial preservation...|$|E
