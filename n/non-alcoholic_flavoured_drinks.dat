40|$|An {{exposure}} assessment {{was performed to}} estimate the daily intake of benzoates for the Flemish population. Three age groups were considered: preschool children (n = 697; age 2 - 6; 3 -day estimated dietary record), adolescents (n = 341; age 14 - 18; 7 -day estimated dietary record) and women (n = 641; age 18 - 40; 2 -day estimated dietary record). In {{a first step in}} the risk evaluation process as proposed by the European Union, the individual food consumption data were multiplied with the maximum permitted use levels for benzoates per food group. The median (interquartile range) estimated daily intake is, respectively, 2. 0 (1. 0 - 3. 2) mg/kg bw, 1. 7 (1. 1 - 2. 7) mg/kg bw and 1. 92 (1. 3 - 3. 0) mg/kg bw for preschool children, adolescents and adult women. In all age groups, the greatest potential contributor to the total estimated benzoate intake was the group of <b>non-alcoholic</b> <b>flavoured</b> <b>drinks.</b> At respectively the 92 nd percentile (children), the 97 th percentile (adolescents) and the 94 th percentile (women), the accepted daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg bw/day is exceeded slightly. However, this approach, in which the maximum permitted use levels are used is known to overestimate the intake, since not all food items in which benzoates are allowed, contain (the maximum permitted use level of) benzoates. A more precise estimation, using actual levels, is recommended. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Due to {{increased}} consumption of pre-packaged drinks, tap water {{may no longer}} be the principal source of water intake and consequently fluoride intake. Little is known about the importance of solid foods as fluoride sources and how the relative contribution of foods/drinks to fluoride intake is affected by residing in fluoridated or non-fluoridated areas. This study investigated the relative contributions of different dietary sources to dietary fluoride intake and compared this in children residing in optimally artificially fluoridated, sub-optimally artificially fluoridated, and non-fluoridated areas. Methods: Thirty-three healthy children aged 6 years were recruited from fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities and categorised into three groups based on fluoride content of home tap water: optimally fluoridated (≤ 0. 7 mgF/L), sub-optimally fluoridated (≥ 0. 3 to ≤ 0. 7 mgF/L) and non-fluoridated (≤ 0. 3 mgF/L) drinking water. A 3 -day dietary diary collected dietary information. Samples of foods/drinks consumed were collected and analyzed for fluoride content. Results: Drinks provided 59 %, 55 % and 32 % of dietary fluoride intake in optimally, sub-optimally and non-fluoridated areas respectively. Tap water, fruit squashes and cordials (extremely sweet <b>non-alcoholic</b> fruit <b>flavoured</b> <b>drink</b> concentrates) prepared with tap water, as well as cooked rice, pasta and vegetables were important sources of fluoride in optimally and sub-optimally fluoridated areas. Carbonated soft drinks and bread were the most important contributors to dietary fluoride intake in the non-fluoridated area. Conclusion: The main contributory sources to dietary fluoride differ between fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas. Estimating total fluoride intake from levels of fluoride in tap water alone is unlikely to provide a reliable quantitative measure of intake. Studies monitoring dietary fluoride exposure should consider intake from all foods and drinks...|$|R
40|$|Osgoode’s Oxford International Intellectual Property Moot team {{recently}} met Madam Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella at the Supreme Court of Canada on February 22, 2017. During the meeting, Madam Justice Silberman Abella (named Global Jurist of the Year) {{offered the}} team a once-in-a-lifetime experience {{to present their}} oral arguments {{to her from the}} Supreme Court podium and was very generous in her comments and feedback. (Pictured, from left, are Colin Lyon, Madam Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella, Aviv Gaon and Jordan Fine.) The moot is held annually at Oxford. Osgoode’s team qualified for the oral rounds for the third consecutive year. The 2017 moot problem concerns a fictitious case, Whispering Gums Winery v Loddon River Vineyards, between two alcohol manufacturers from a fictitious country named “Erehwon”. The case raises several novel IP issues. Whispering Gums owns a patent on a bottle that enhances the effervescence of sparkling wines and sells a brand of local sparkling wine called “Wizard’s Wizz Erewine” that is contained in their patented bottle. The dispute is over Loddon River’s use of the mark “Erewine” for two of its products, a sweet apple cider and a <b>non-alcoholic</b> elderflower <b>flavoured</b> <b>drink.</b> Whispering Gums is accusing Loddon River of patent infringement and extended passing off of “Erewine”, while Loddon River argues that Whispering Gum’s patent is invalid {{on the grounds that it}} contravenes public policy or morality. Osgoode’s team is mentored by IP Osgoode’s Professor David Vaver and Aviv Gaon, a PhD Candidate at Osgoode. They are coached by leading IP lawyers, Stephen Selznick and Stephen Henderson from Cassels Brock 2 ̆ 6 Blackwell LLP, and Jennifer R.

Osgoode then placed first among all 24 teams participating in those oral rounds—thus winning the Allen 2 ̆ 6 Overy award—and was one of eight teams to advance to the next round. The finalists – Bucerius Law School of Germany and University of Toronto – argued in front of the Supreme Court of Erehwon. After a heated debate, the panel of three highly esteemed IP experts – The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Floyd, Mr. Justice Sir Birss and Judge Clarke – ruled for Bucerius.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the implications of substituting citric acid with other acidulants; malic acid, fumaric acid and tartaric acid and a combination thereof (Fruitaric® acid), in a <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink.</b> A trained sensory panel (n= 10) compared the sourness intensity of the acidulants at both equal sour and equal weight concentrations in water and in a Grape and a Lemon&Lime <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink.</b> The sensory panel compared the temporal character of the acidulants at equal sour concentrations in water and both sports <b>drink</b> <b>flavours.</b> This included determining the rate, onset, duration and maximum intensity parameters of the perceived sourness. To determine if repeated exposure testing of sports drinks with the different acidulants added at equal sour concentrations would lead to hedonic adjustment, consumers (n= 128) were repeatedly exposed to a Lemon&Lime <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink</b> {{over a period of}} 22 days. Citric acid, the acidulant currently used in the sports drinks, served as a reference in all the comparisons. Previously determined equal sour concentrations of tartaric and Fruitaric® acids as determined in water was found to be equally sour to citric acid when applied to water and a Lemon&Lime <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink</b> but less sour than citric acid when compared in the Grape <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink.</b> Malic and tartaric acids were found to be equal sour to citric acid in water and both sports <b>drink</b> <b>flavours.</b> The application of equal sour concentrations seemed to be flavour specific. Sourness of water and more complex solutions, such as <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drinks,</b> seemed to be dependant on multiple factors including pH, titratable acidity, molecular weight, acidulant concentration and oBrix. The results from this study rejected anecdotal reports that acidulants differ in their temporal sensory profiles, although the lack of significant differences may be a function of the specific concentration level (0. 2 %) used. Repeated exposure testing of Lemon&Lime <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drinks</b> with different acidulants resulted in hedonic adjustment. Consumer preferences post exposure could not have been predicted with a traditional consumer taste test {{at the start of the}} study. The findings of this study surely challenge the validity of sensory evaluation test strategies that rely on single exposure testing to predict long term consumer preferences.

40|$|A within-subject {{design was}} used to test whether {{repeatedly}} drinking a novel-flavoured and coloured drink while thirsty would influence subsequent liking for or consumption of that drink, compared to a different <b>flavoured</b> and coloured <b>drink</b> repeatedly consumed while less thirsty. Each participant was given 300 ml of one <b>flavoured</b> <b>drink</b> (H) after consuming a high salt meal (5. 27 g of salt), and 300 ml of another <b>flavoured</b> <b>drink</b> (L) after consuming a low salt meal (1. 27 g of salt). Participants had 4 sessions with each meal-type/drink combination, in an intermixed order. Pre- and post-training assessments of the drinks were conducted to determine the impact of the training regime on pleasantness and perceived thirst-quenching effect of the drinks. The final session included a choice test, and ad libitum access to the chosen drink, after either a high or low salt meal. In this final choice session, people drank almost twice as much H as L; however, there were no differential effects of past training on rated liking or choice. The increased consumption of H might reflect greater liking for H which was not detected by the rating scales; or it might reflect the learning of greater "conditioned thirst" in response to the flavour of H. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
