5|$|Each {{team had}} to {{progress}} through six knockout rounds playing 12 matches in total {{to reach the}} final. Liverpool's matches were mainly close affairs, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ties were won by more than two goals. The semi-final tie against Barcelona was won 1–0. In contrast, Alavés ties ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They won their first round tie against Gaziantepspor by one goal, whereas they beat Kaiserslautern 9–2 in the semi-final.|$|E

After destroying the CAMS central core, Vanessa encounters a digital projection of the client, whose appearance is identical to her own. She speculates {{that she is a}} clone of the client, but the client counters that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> memories may be real. Vanessa debates whether to continue her work as a mercenary as the game ends.|$|E

5|$|Many Somerset {{soldiers}} {{died during}} the First World War, with the Somerset Light Infantry suffering nearly 5,000 casualties. War memorials were put up {{in most of the}} county's towns and villages; only nine, described as the Thankful Villages, had <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> residents killed. During the Second World War the county was a base for troops preparing for the D-Day landings. Some of the hospitals which were built for the casualties of the war remain in use. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to repel a potential German invasion. The remains of its pill boxes can still be seen along the coast, and south through Ilminster and Chard.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1927, Joseph Berchtold {{transferred}} {{leadership of}} the SS to Heiden, who was his acting deputy. Berchtold had become disillusioned by the SA's authority over the SS. As head of the SS, Heiden also {{found it difficult to}} function under the larger and more powerful SA. Under Heiden's leadership a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA ranks. Heiden further demanded that the men under his command were not to be involved in party matters which were <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> concern. His intention was to create a small elite unit and obtain higher quality recruits.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of the 9th, Crowe met with the {{committee}} and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5p.m. to vacate the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their paychecks and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931.|$|E

50|$|Continuing a theme {{present in}} many of Herbert's other works, the novel is principally {{concerned}} with the problems inherent in or caused by the inflexibility of a static system.

5|$|The {{universe}} {{continued to}} decrease in density {{and fall in}} temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10−11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators. At about 10−6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Tigers' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. Parrish and Kirk Gibson (1978) won a World Series title on the 1984 championship team. Justin Verlander (2004) {{is the only}} first-round pick of the Tigers to win the Rookie of the Year Award, taking the honor in 2006. Two Tigers first-round picks have won the Cy Young Award, both in the American League; Verlander won the award in 2011 with the Tigers and 2007 pick Rick Porcello won in 2016 with the Boston Red Sox. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first-round picks have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Justin Verlander became the first player who was drafted in the 1st round of the draft to win the Most Valuable Player award while with the Tigers in the 2011 season. Gibson won the MVP award {{in his first year}} with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Twins' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. Willie Banks (1987) and Chuck Knoblauch (1989) won a World Series title on the 1991 championship team.

Catcher Joe Mauer (2001) won the 2009 American League Most Valuable Player award, the only first-round pick of the Twins to win the award.

5|$|York {{produced}} {{some of their}} best football in a decade in 1964–65, winning 20 league matches at home—a club record—and ending the season in third place to gain promotion, one point behind champions Brighton & Hove Albion. The following season, {{they were in the}} bottom four by late December 1965. They finished the season in bottom place and were relegated back to the Fourth Division, having conceded a club-record 106 goals. After the season ended, York released Norman Wilkinson, who had scored a club-record 143 goals. York struggled throughout 1966–67 and finished 22nd after a club-record eight successive defeats. The club was forced into its third re-election bid, which was successful with 45 votes. Kitchin resigned the chairmanship in June 1967 and was succeeded by Derrick Blundy, who held the position for 16 months, after which Eric Magson took over. York started 1967–68 winning <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first 13 matches. Their first win came in late October 1967, by which time Lockie had become the first manager to be dismissed by the club. Former Sheffield United player Joe Shaw took charge in November 1967, and York rose from bottom place to 14th by late March 1968. However, they won <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> last eight matches and finished 21st. Another application for re-election was made, which was successful with 46 votes. Shaw resigned for personal reasons a week into 1968–69, and former Huddersfield Town manager Tom Johnston succeeded him in October 1968. Poor away form led to York finishing 21st, and the club's application for re-election was successful with 45 votes. The team reached the FA Cup third round, and were beaten 2–0 at home by First Division team Stoke City.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 on 9 May 1857 {{a parade}} of the entire Meerut Division took place, to {{announce}} the sentences of the convicted men. The troops present included the 60th Rifles, 6th Dragoon Guards, and batteries of Bengal Artillery, {{as well as the}} 11th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, the 20th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry and, dismounted, the remainder of the men of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. The sentences were read, and the men stripped of their uniforms, then placed in shackles, while the Meerut Division watched. Despite pleas from the condemned men, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fellow soldiers came to their assistance. The entire process took around two hours to complete, following which the convicted soldiers were handed over to the civilian authorities and taken to the local jail under armed escort. After the parade, Hewitt communicated to his headquarters that all was calm, but during the night various junior officials received warnings of impending trouble from concerned sepoys or members of their household staff.|$|E
5|$|During dinner, {{the family}} is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an {{argument}} about {{what they should be}} doing with them. Aliens Kang and Kodos see {{this as an opportunity to}} strike Earth, and an alien invasion unfolds. Realizing <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E

5|$|On lap 48, Mercedes changed strategies, {{bringing}} in both drivers for another tyre stop, {{much to the}} dismay of Lewis Hamilton, who complained to his team over the radio. Meanwhile, a fight developed between Massa and Ricciardo for fifth place, with the latter making the pass at the beginning of lap 53. On the same lap, Sebastian Vettel spun once more at turn seven, this time hitting the barriers, ending his race and bringing out the safety car. The double retirement marked {{the first time since the}} 2006 Australian Grand Prix that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cars were classified. During the caution period, the order stood as: Rosberg, Hamilton, Kvyat, Bottas, Ricciardo, Massa, Hülkenberg, Pérez, Verstappen and Grosjean. At the restart at the beginning of lap 58, Bottas made a move on Kvyat into turn one, taking third place. Over the last laps of the race, Hamilton was able to close on Rosberg, as was Massa on the two Red Bull drivers ahead of him. However, neither were able to overtake, and Rosberg crossed the finish line to take victory, followed by Hamilton and Bottas.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Marlins' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. Charles Johnson (1992) won a World Series title on the 1997 championship team and Josh Beckett (1999) won with the 2003 team. Beckett also {{went on to}} be a part of the Boston Red Sox 2007 World Series championship team. Chris Coghlan (2006) is the only first-round pick of the Marlins to win the Rookie of the Year Award, taking the honor in 2009. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first-round picks have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame or won the Most Valuable Player or Cy Young Award. The Marlins have made three selections in the supplemental round of the draft and have made the first overall selection once (2000). They have also had five compensatory picks since their first draft in 1992. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Marlins have never failed to sign a first-round pick.|$|E
5|$|Dolan was {{dismissed}} in May 2003, the new board citing financial {{reasons for his}} departure. At 27 years, York player Chris Brass was appointed player-manager in June 2003, which made him the youngest Football League managerial appointment since 1946. The club's lease of Bootham Crescent was extended to May 2004, and plans proceeded to develop Huntington Stadium ahead of a possible move, but problems bringing the ground to Football League standards were encountered. The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent, and they bought the site in February 2004 {{after six months of}} negotiations. The deal came after York were lent £2million by The Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF), with which they bought 75.89% of BCH shares and all of the 20,000 shares owned by Persimmon. Once plans for a new stadium were settled, the loan would be converted a grant to help fund the move. York equalled a club record by winning the first four matches of 2003–04, and by mid January 2004 were 10th in the table. They won <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> final 20 fixtures, garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division. York were relegated to the Conference National after 75 years of Football League membership. Beck renounced his title of chairman in September 2004 because he favoured a more democratic approach for a fan-owned club. The board was restructured and Jason McGill became the managing director.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, Simpson {{took over}} as coach of an Australian team which was young, demoralised and {{regarded}} as soft. A considerable turnover of players due to constant failure in the past eighteen months had seen the likes of Steve Waugh, David Boon, Dean Jones, Craig McDermott and Geoff Marsh all make their debuts under captain Allan Border. Prior to his first series, the tour of New Zealand, Australia had not won a series for two years. In that period they managed three wins, 11 losses and eight draws. His appointment bore little initial fruit. They won <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> eleven Tests in 1986, and lost three. By {{the end of the}} 1986–87 Australian season, Australia had only won two of their last 22 Tests, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> last 14.
