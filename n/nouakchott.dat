5|$|There is {{a mosque}} donated by Saudi Arabia {{in the city}} centre and a Moroccan mosque further south. Although Islam is the state {{religion}} in Mauritania, <b>Nouakchott</b> includes the Catholic Cathedral of St. Joseph. It {{is home to the}} Roman Catholic Diocese of <b>Nouakchott,</b> founded in 1965.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} primary and {{secondary}} schools, among the most prominent are the American International School of <b>Nouakchott</b> and the Lycée Français Théodore Monod.|$|E
5|$|Formerly a district, in 1990 <b>Nouakchott</b> {{became a}} region of Mauritania. On 25 November 2014, it was split into the three current regions and its {{governor}} Mahi Ould Hamed became the first governor of Nouakchott-Nord.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nouakchott</b> was a {{small village}} of little {{importance}} until 1958, when it {{was chosen as the}} capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. It was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people, but droughts and increasing desertification since the 1970s have displaced a vast number of Mauritanians who resettled in <b>Nouakchott.</b> This caused massive urban growth and overcrowding, with the city having an official population of just under a million as of 2013. The resettled population inhabited slum areas under poor conditions, but the living conditions of a portion of these inhabitants have since been ameliorated.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{the hub of}} the Mauritanian {{economy and}} is home to a {{deepwater}} port and one of the country's two international airports. It hosts the University of <b>Nouakchott</b> and several other more specialized institutes of higher learning.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nouakchott</b> is {{the center}} of the Mauritanian economy, with three-quarters of service sector {{enterprises}} located in the city as of 1999 with 90% of the city's economic activity consisting of informal transactions. Some inhabitants have multiple addresses and maintain strong ties with their regions of origin, at times returning for labor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nouakchott</b> was a tiny, {{fortified}} {{fishing village}} (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital {{city and the}} area of present-day <b>Nouakchott</b> was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of modernity and national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village {{was selected as the}} capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is home to}} the University of <b>Nouakchott,</b> {{which is}} the only {{university}} in Mauritania and was opened in 1981. As of 1995, it had 70 professors and 2800 students. Other higher education facilities include the National School of Administration and the Higher Scientific Institute.|$|E
5|$|Located on the Atlantic {{coast of}} the Sahara Desert, it lies {{on the west coast}} of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. <b>Nouakchott</b> is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nouakchott</b> {{is built}} around a large tree-lined street, Avenue Gamal Abdel Nasser, which runs {{northeast}} through the city centre from the airport. It divides the city into two, with the residential areas {{in the north and}} the medina quarter, along with the kebbe, a shanty town formed due to the displacement of people from other areas by the desert. Other major streets are named (in French) for notable Mauritanian or international figures of the 1960s: Avenue Abdel Nasser, Avenue Charles de Gaulle, Avenue Kennedy, and Avenue Lumumba, for example.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} March 1958 {{to enlarge the}} village to house a {{population}} of 15,000 and the basics were completed {{by the time that}} the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. <b>Nouakchott</b> was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième Quartier (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.|$|E
25|$|All state {{television}} and radio stations in <b>Nouakchott</b> reportedly ceased broadcasting as the coup began. The <b>Nouakchott</b> International Airport was also closed.|$|E
25|$|Police {{reportedly}} fired {{tear gas}} at about 50 {{people who had}} gathered near the main market of <b>Nouakchott.</b> Otherwise, the city remained calm.|$|E
25|$|Important cities {{located in}} the Sahara include <b>Nouakchott,</b> the capital of Mauritania; Tamanrasset, Ouargla, Béchar, Hassi Messaoud, Ghardaïa, and El Oued in Algeria; Timbuktu in Mali; Agadez in Niger; Ghat in Libya; and Faya-Largeau in Chad.|$|E
25|$|Mauritania has the University of <b>Nouakchott</b> {{and other}} {{institutions}} of higher education, {{but the majority of}} highly educated Mauritanians have studied outside the country. Public expenditure on education was at 10.1% of 2000–2007 government expenditure.|$|E
25|$|Mauritania: The second Festival des musiques nomades ("Festival of Nomadic Music") of <b>Nouakchott</b> {{was held}} in the Mauritanian capital from 4 to 8 April 2005 with among others Aïcha Mint Chighaly (Mauritania) and of Baaba Maal (Senegal).|$|E
25|$|Abdullah al-Senussi, Gaddafi's {{intelligence}} chief, {{was arrested}} at <b>Nouakchott</b> International Airport in Mauritania upon arrival from Mohammed V International Airport in Casablanca, Morocco, by Mauritanian police on 17 March 2011. France, Libya, and the International Criminal Court have all {{expressed an interest in}} trying Senussi.|$|E
25|$|On 6 March 2009, the Israeli {{diplomatic}} {{delegation to}} Mauritania left {{after nine years}} of diplomatic ties, following a demand from the Mauritanian authorities to close the Israeli embassy in <b>Nouakchott</b> within 48 hours. The Mauritanian delegation to Israel left earlier without sending official notice to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
25|$|The country's first {{deepwater}} port opened near <b>Nouakchott</b> in 1986. In recent years, {{drought and}} economic mismanagement {{have resulted in}} a buildup of foreign debt. In March 1999, the government signed an agreement with a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund mission on a $54million enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). The economic objectives have been set for 1999–2002. Privatization remains one of the key issues. Mauritania is unlikely to meet ESAF's annual GDP growth objectives of 4%–5%.|$|E
25|$|Changes to the {{demographic}} and political makeup of Mauritania in the 1970s heavily {{contributed to the}} growth of Islamism within Mauritanian society. Periods of severe drought resulted in urbanization, as large numbers of Mauritanians moved from the countryside to the cities, particularly <b>Nouakchott,</b> to escape the drought. This sharp increase in urbanization resulted in new civil associations being formed, and Mauritania's first Islamist organisation, known as Jemaa Islamiyya (Islamic Association) was formed by Mauritanians sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August 2008, {{the head}} of the presidential guards took over the president's palace in <b>Nouakchott,</b> a day after 48 lawmakers from the ruling party {{resigned}} in protest of President Abdallahi's policies. The army surrounded key government facilities, including the state television building, after the president fired senior officers, one of them {{the head of}} the presidential guards. The President, Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed Waghef, and Mohamed Ould R'zeizim, Minister of Internal Affairs, were arrested.|$|E
25|$|Mauritania {{is nearly}} 100% Muslim, with most {{inhabitants}} {{adhering to the}} Sunni denomination. The Sufi orders, the Tijaniyah and the Qadiriyyah, have great influence {{not only in the}} country, but in Morocco, Algeria, Senegal and other neighborhood countries as well. The Roman Catholic Diocese of <b>Nouakchott,</b> founded in 1965, serves the 4,500 Catholics in Mauritania (mostly foreign residents from West Africa and Europe). There are extreme restrictions on freedom of religion and belief in Mauritania; it is one of thirteen countries in the world which punishes atheism by death.|$|E
25|$|The four-party {{alliance}} {{opposing the}} coup, called the National Front for the Defence of Democracy, {{held a press}} conference on August 8, and this developed into a protest rally against the coup in the Tevragh Zeina section of <b>Nouakchott,</b> with several hundred people participating. This rally included calls for the soldiers to return to their barracks and for the international community to pressure the junta. APP spokesman Alkhalil Ould Teyib vowed that they would continue their struggle until Abdallahi was restored to the presidency. The National Front for the Defence of Democracy also announced plans for more demonstrations and activities opposing the coup, while also stating that they would only hold protests with the junta's permission.|$|E
25|$|The Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa {{was founded}} in 1810 as {{a branch of the}} École normale supérieure by Napoleon and later gained independence. ENS and its Italian twin have {{retained}} very close links since this time and since 1988 a special partnership has 80 normaliens going to Pisa every year while half the class of the SNS spend a year at the Paris school. During its history and due to the far reach of the French Empire during the colonial era, many schools have been created around the world based on the ENS model, from Haiti (in Port-au-Prince) to Vietnam (in Hanoi) to the Maghreb (in Tunis, Casablanca, Oran, and Rabat to name but a few) and Subsaharan Africa (in <b>Nouakchott,</b> Libreville, Yaoundé, Dakar, Niamey, Bangui for example). ENS maintains good relations and close links with these institutions. In 2005, ENS opened a branch at the East China Normal University (ECNU) in Shanghai, whose French name was changed to École normale supérieure de l'Est de la Chine to reflect the agreement, and a joint doctoral program between the two institutions was launched.|$|E
