25|$|An {{engineer}} who {{is often seen}} hanging out with Wally. He is referenced by name more often in older comics, {{but he is still}} seen occasionally <b>now.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> been accepted into Dilbert's clique. He has been fired and killed numerous times (for example, being pushed {{down a flight of stairs}} and becoming possessed), so it is likely that he is rehired and brought back to life in a similar way to the other main characters who die and come back. In addition to this, he is often promoted and given benefits over the other employees. Ted has a wife and kids who are referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion. Adams refers to him as Ted the Generic Guy because whenever he needs to fire or kill someone he uses Ted, but slowly over time Ted has become his own character.|$|E

25|$|Amodini {{was made}} in 1996. It was a one-hour forty five minutes family comedy. Casting {{included}} Aparna Sen, Rachana Banerjee, Anusree Das and Pijush Ganguly, among others. A satirical Indian fairy tale, it {{is set in the}} perspective of 18th century, when traditional social customs were strictly enforced and complied. The storyline is about the exploits of a pretty and spoiled daughter of a rajah (king) who is forced to become the bride of her 15-year-old Brahmin houseboy after the man she was supposed to marry jilts her on her wedding day. If she does not marry before sunset, something horrible will happen to her; therefore she must marry the servant boy. After the ceremony, the boy is exiled and the union remains unconsummated. Years pass and tragedy befalls the rajah who loses all his wealth.

[...] Nevertheless, as dusk came the Allied commander was anxious for a quick conclusion. The French infantry fought tenaciously to hold on to their position in Blenheim, but their commander was nowhere to be found. Clérambault's insistence on confining his huge force in the village was to seal his fate that day. Realising his tactical mistake had contributed to Tallard's defeat in the centre, Clérambault deserted Blenheim and the 27 battalions defending the village, and reportedly drowned in the Danube while attempting to make his escape.|$|E

500|$|Though an {{accomplished}} comic, Hardee was arguably more highly {{regarded as a}} [...] "character", a compère and talent-spotting booker at his own clubs, particularly The Tunnel Club in Greenwich, South East London, which gave vital and early exposure to up-and-coming comedians {{during the early years}} of British alternative comedy. In its obituary, The Times opined that [...] "throughout his life he maintained a fearlessness and an indifference to consequences" [...] and one journalist claimed: [...] "To say that he has no shame is to drastically exaggerate the amount of shame that he has". In a publicity quote printed in Hardee's autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake, Arthur Smith wrote that Hardee had [...] "led his life as though for the perfect autobiography and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> paid himself the compliment of writing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Protagonist Andrew [...] "Ender" [...] Wiggin is born a [...] "Third": a rare {{exception}} to Earth's two-child policy, {{allowed by the}} government due to the promise shown by his two older siblings. The eldest, Peter, is a highly intelligent sociopath who sadistically bullies Ender, while Valentine is more sympathetic towards him. The I.F. remove Ender's monitoring device at six years old, seemingly ending his chances of Battle School, and he gets teased by a fellow student, Stilson. Ender beats up Stilson before the fight is broken up; unknown to Ender, the fight was fatal to Stilson. When explaining his actions to I.F. Colonel Hyrum Graff, Ender states his belief that, by showing superiority <b>now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> prevented future struggle. Graff, on hearing of this, offers Ender {{a place in the}} Battle School, situated in Earth's orbit.|$|E

500|$|In 2015, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Tyrion's {{meeting with}} Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) an [...] "iconic meetup" [...] that [...] "delighted fans, who were universally {{enthusiastic}} (for once!) about the showrunners making a narrative move not yet found in George R.R.

He’s been to The Wall and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to find the dragons." [...] Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a [...] "lot of empathy" [...] toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had [...] "terrible fathers". Tyrion realized that Varys might be right about Daenerys being the [...] "last hope for Westeros". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him [...] "back into power".|$|E
500|$|Bennett {{had been}} at first {{slightly}} in awe of Mendelssohn, but no such formality ever attached to Bennett's friendship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night. Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his Symphonic Studies to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication {{a few weeks later}} with his Fantasie, Op. 16. Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett's music; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, praising amongst other works Bennett's Op. 10 Musical Sketches for piano, [...] "three of Bennett's loveliest pictures". The essay ends: [...] "For some time <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been peering over my shoulder, and for the second time he has asked 'But what are you writing?' Dear friend, I shall write no more than: 'If only you knew!'" [...] Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann's music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought [...] "rather too eccentric".|$|E

The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews. Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode an 8.4/10 and called it [...] "a well-written, fascinating character piece that does {{an excellent job of}} bringing Sawyer into the spotlight", later praising Josh Holloway's performance, writing that [...] "The success of this episode begins and ends with Josh Holloway. So far, we know that he's good at playing Sawyer: The Tough Guy, but <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> to sell a multilayered fragment of a human being who hates himself for becoming the man who destroyed his family. Holloway succeeds in creating a character that quickly unravels throughout the episode as his terrible secret is revealed." [...] The website later ranked [...] "Confidence Man" [...] the 47th best episode of Lost, praising how it [...] "change your entire perspective of a character" [...] in revealing how Sawyer came to be, which made a starting point for [...] "one of the greatest character arcs not only in Lost, but in all of modern television." ...|$|E

[...] "He accepts his injury, he accepts his compromised status in society ... Peggy says, 'Forget this. I'm Peggy Carter. I'm going to do something else.' I think that's the difference between the two of them." [...] Considering a potentially romantic relationship between Sousa and Carter, Gjokaj said, [...] "I think there’s definitely a situation where … if she hadn't dated Captain America, he might ask her out for a drink. It’s like if your new girlfriend dated Ryan Gosling. It’s going to make you sweat a bit." [...] For the second season, Gjokaj said, [...] "you’ll see him deal with actually being part of the machine. Not trying to get [...] the machine, but being the boss. The first season was him trying to be listened to, and now he’s being listened to by a lot of people." [...] The costumes for the SSR agents in the series are meant to be distinctive to help explain their characters: Sousa wears [...] "sweater vests under his sport coats and pleated pants".|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell {{said that this is}} the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E

Artist and critic Ai Weiwei said that, although the regime ought to feel the most ashamed, [...] "intellectuals who had drifted away from their public responsibilities" [...] should bear some of that burden for betraying values they once strove for. Ai said that the Prize was a message from the international community to the Chinese government to respect universal human values, notwithstanding China's economic performance.
