40|$|Objectives. Those {{exposed to}} more {{degrading}} sexual references in popular music {{are more likely}} to initiate intercourse at a younger age. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform a content analysis of contemporary popular music with particular attention paid to the prevalence of degrading and <b>non-degrading</b> sexual references. We also aimed to determine if sexual references of each subtype were associated with other song characteristics and/or content. Methods. We used Billboard magazine to identify the top popular songs in 2005. Two independent coders each analyzed all of these songs (n 5279) for degrading and <b>non-degrading</b> sexual references. As measured with Cohen's kappa scores, inter-rater agreement on degrading vs. <b>non-degrading</b> sex was substantial. Mentions of substance use, violence, and weapon carrying were also coded. Results. Of the 279 songs identified, 103 (36. 9 %) contained references to sexual activity. Songs with references to degrading sex were more common than songs with references to <b>non-degrading</b> sex (67 [65. 0 %] vs. 36 [35. 0 %], p < 0. 001). Songs with degrading sex were most commonly Rap (64. 2 %), whereas songs with <b>non-degrading</b> sex were most likely Country (44. 5 %) or Rhythm & Blues/Hip-Hop (27. 8 %). Compared with songs that had no mention of sexual activity, songs with degrading sex were more likely to contain references to substance use, violence, and weapon carrying. Songs with <b>non-degrading</b> sex were no more likely to mention these other risk behaviors. Conclusions. References to sexual activity are common in popular music, and degrading sexual references are more prevalent than <b>non-degrading</b> references. References to degrading sex also frequently appear with references to other risky behaviors. © 2008 Association of Schools of Public Health...|$|R

50|$|Determination of {{geographic}} origin: Determining {{the origin of}} a certain species aids research in population numbers and lineage data. Phylogenetic studies are most often used to find the broad geographic area of which a species reside. For example, in California seahorses were being sold for traditional medicinal purposes and the phylogenetic data of those seahorses led researchers to find their origin and from which population they came from and what species they were. In addition to phylogenetic data, assignment tests are used to find {{the probability of a}} species belonging to or originating from a specific population and genetic markers of a specimen are utilized. These types of tests are most accurate when all potential population's data have been gathered. Statistical analyses are used in assignment tests based on an individual's microsatellites or Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs). Using microsatellites in these studies is more favorable than AFLPs because the AFLPs required <b>non-degraded</b> tissue samples and higher errors have been reported when using AFLPs.|$|E
50|$|As a CBTC {{system is}} {{required}} to have high availability and particularly, allow for a graceful degradation, a secondary method of signaling might be provided to ensure some level of <b>non-degraded</b> service upon partial or complete CBTC unavailability. This is particularly relevant for brownfield implementations (lines with an already existing signalling system) where the infrastructure design cannot be controlled and coexistence with legacy systems is required, at least, temporarily. For example, the New York City Canarsie Line was outfitted with a backup automatic block signaling system capable of supporting 12tph, compared with the 26tph of the CBTC system. Although this is a rather common architecture for resignalling projects, it can negate some of the cost savings of CBTC if applied to new lines. This is still a key point in the CBTC development (and is still being discussed), since some providers and operators argue that a fully redundant architecture of the CBTC system may however achieve high availability values by itself.|$|E

50|$|As RNA {{integrity}} {{has long}} been known to be a problem in molecular biology studies, there are a few methods that have been used historically to determine the integrity of RNA.

While this method is very cheap and easy, there are several issues with this method, primarily its subjectivity, leading to inconsistent, non-standardized RNA quality assessments, and the large amounts of RNA that are needed to visualize it on an agarose gel, which can be problematic if there is not much RNA to work with. There are also a number of different problems that can arise from agarose gel electrophoresis, such as poor loading, uneven running, and uneven staining that lead to increased variability in the accuracy of using agarose gel electrophoresis to determine RNA integrity. Clearly, a standardized, repeatable, objective method of determining RNA integrity was needed.|$|E

40|$|The simple study {{discussed}} in this paper compared different procedures to obtain sets of spectral matching accelerograms for nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures in terms of inelastic seismic response. Six classes of records were considered: original (unscaled) real records, real records moderately linearly scaled, real records significantly linearly scaled, real records adjusted by wavelets, and artificial accelerograms generated by two different procedures. The study is spectral shape-based; that is, all the considered sets of records, generated or selected, match individually (artificial and adjusted) or on average (real records) the same design spectrum for a case-study site in Italy. This is because spectral compatibility is the main criterion required for seismic input by international codes. Three kinds of single degree of freedom (SDOF) system, <b>non-degrading</b> and non-evolutionary, <b>non-degrading</b> and evolutionary, and both degrading and evolutionary, were {{used to evaluate the}} nonlinear response to the compared records. Demand spectra in term of peak and cyclic responses were derived for different strength reduction factors. Results of the analysis show that artificial or adjusted accelerograms may underestimate, in some cases, and at high nonlinearity levels, the displacement response, if compared to original real records, which are considered as a benchmark herein. However, this conclusion {{does not seem to be}} statistically significant. Conversely, if the cyclic response is considered, artificial record classes show a significant overestimation of the demand, which does not show up for wavelet-adjusted records. The two classes of linearly scaled records do not show systematic bias with respect to those unscaled for both types of response considered, which seems to confirm that amplitude scaling is a legitimate practice...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{polymeric}} scaffolds play a {{key role}} in most tissue-engineering strategies. A series of <b>non-degrading</b> porous scaffolds was prepared, based on bulk-copolymerisation of 1 -vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NVP) and n-butyl methacrylate (BMA), followed by a particulate-leaching step to generate porosity. Biocompatibility of these scaffolds was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the scaffold materials were studied using the so-called demineralised bone matrix (DBM) as an evaluation system in vivo. The DBM, which is essentially a part of a rat femoral bone after processing with mineral acid, provides a suitable environment for ectopic bone formation, provided that the cavity of the DBM is filled with bone marrow prior to subcutaneous implantation in the thoracic region of rats. Various scaffold materials, differing with respect to composition and, hence, hydrophilicity, were introduced into the centre of DBMs. The ends were closed with rat bone marrow, and ectopic bone formation was monitored after 4, 6, and 8 weeks, both through X-ray microradiography and histology. The 50 : 50 scaffold particles were found to readily accommodate formation of bone tissue within their pores, whereas this was much less the case for the more hydrophilic 70 : 30 counterpart scaffolds. New healthy bone tissue was encountered inside the pores of the 50 : 50 scaffold material, not only at the periphery of the constructs but also in the center. Active osteoblast cells were found at the bone-biomaterial interfaces. These data indicate that the hydrophobicity of the biomaterial is, most likely, an important design criterion for polymeric scaffolds which should promote the healing of bone defects.
