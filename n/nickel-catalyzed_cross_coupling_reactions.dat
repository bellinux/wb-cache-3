40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} heterloptic bisterpyridine ruthenium(II) complexes as building blocks, including the first dinuclear ‘expanded ligand’ which can self-assemble into large structures. In Chapter One presents {{a brief overview of}} previously reported molecular cages, the concept of expanded ligands, applications of ruthenium polypyridyl complexes and how they are used for building large structures. Chapter Two covers investigations into the synthesis of bromo functionalized and boronic acid functionalized ruthenium(II) mononuclear complexes with pendent pyridine sites. The functionalized ruthenium(II) complexes are suitable for Sonogashira <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction</b> and Suzuki <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction.</b> In Chapter Three, the first bimetallic expanded ligand is reported via Suzuki <b>cross</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction</b> where partners are 1, 3 -dibromobenzene and the boronic acid functionalized ruthenium(II) mononuclear complex. Some of these structural isomers could be used for the construction of large supramolecular structures.
