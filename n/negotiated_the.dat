40|$|This {{qualitative}} study>addresses {{the question}} of how Ontario elementary school principals negotiate their varied work roles, through interviews with and observations of 6 principals. Using inductive data analysis, principals' negotiations were divided into 5 categories: <b>negotiating</b> priorities, <b>negotiating</b> <b>the</b> process, <b>negotiating</b> constraints, <b>negotiating</b> <b>the</b> roles of others, and <b>negotiating</b> <b>the</b> self. These principals worked within these categories simultaneously, emphasizing some more than others, dependent on the circumstances. For these principals, the time they spent with people in the school and the resulting relationships that enabled them to build were a first priority, and a large part of how each principal chose to <b>negotiate</b> <b>the</b> demands of their role arose from their personality and their personal values...|$|R
