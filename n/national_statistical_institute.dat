Traditional {{data collection methods}} such as censuses or household surveys impose great financial and organizational bur- dens on <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>institutes.</b> The rise of new information and communication technolo- gies offers promising sources to mitigate these shortcomings. We propose a unified approach for <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>institutes</b> in developing countries based on small area estimation that allows for the estimation of sociodemographic indicators by using mobile phone data. In particular, the methodology is applied to mobile phone data from Senegal for deriving subnational estimates of the share of illiterates disaggregated by gender. The estimates are used to identify hotspots of illiterates with a need for additional infrastructure or policy adjustments.

40|$|An {{important}} quality {{aspect of}} official statistics produced by <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>institutes</b> is comparability over time. To maintain uninterrupted time series, surveys conducted by <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>institutes</b> are often kept unchanged {{as long as}} possible. To improve the quality or efficiency of a survey process, however, it remains inevitable to adjust methods or redesign this process from time to time. Adjustments in the survey process generally affect survey characteristics such as response bias and therefore have a systematic effect on the parameter estimates of a sample survey. Therefore, {{it is important that}} the effects of a survey redesign on the estimated series are explained and quantified. In this paper a structural time series model is applied to estimate discontinuities in series of the Dutch survey on social participation and environmental consciousness due to a redesign of the underlying survey process.

Thus, credible statistics and reliable <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>institutes</b> and other members of the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> system are vital assets since they are essential to the design, formulation, monitoring and assessment of Government plans and programmes. This credibility is a value that gains strength over time thanks to the generation of quality statistics that comply with standards, principles and norms relating to the production process and statistical activity as a whole. International recommendations and guidelines have been drawn up in order to build more robust <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>institutes</b> within the <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> system and apply fundamental principles and good practices which will result in qualitative improvements. International guidelines have been adapted and compiled into a draft Code of Good Practice in Statistics in Latin America and the Caribbean, the aim being to improve the quality of statistical output and build trust in <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>institutes</b> and enhance the comparability of regional statistics. 1 The draft Code seeks to strengthen the institutional framework and the procedures and products necessary for obtaining quality statistics. Once the Code of Good Practice has been adopted, the Working Group on Institution-building shall disseminate it and assist all the institutes in the region in implementing it, with a view to ensuring overall compliance with all the basic requirements for the {{production of}} reliable, quality regional statistics. This report is divided into five sections. The first presents the background to the preparation of the Code of Good Practice in Statistics in Latin America and the Caribbean; the second describes the ambit, scope and objectives of the Code; the third examines the methodology used in the design and formulation process; the fourth lists the principles and criteria for compliance and the last section sets out the proposal for the strategic implementation plan...|$|R
