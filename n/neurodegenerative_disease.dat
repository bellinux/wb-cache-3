5|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare human <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease,</b> {{is caused by a}} misfolded version of a protein called alpha-synuclein, and is therefore also classifiable as a prion disease.

5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention {{among those who}} study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E

50|$|Due to its {{association}} with the MPTP, PPIF is also involved in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s <b>disease.</b> For <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> treatment of reperfusion events with CsA, a PPID inhibitor, prevents cytochrome C release and significantly reduces cell death in neurons.

50|$|Certain <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> such as Alzheimer's {{have been}} found to have {{defective}} endosomal trafficking. Therefore, the involvement of RUFY2 protein domains, RUN and FYVE, may possibly play a role in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> such as Alzheimer's.|$|R
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> which most often affects {{the elderly and}} {{accounts}} {{for more than half of}} all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E

40|$|The {{ubiquitin}} proteasome system (UPS) {{is crucial}} for intracellular protein homeostasis and for degradation of aberrant and damaged proteins. The accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is a hallmark of many <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, leading to the hypothesis that proteasomal impairment is contributing to these diseases. So far, most research related to the UPS in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> {{has been focused on}} neurons, while glial cells have been largely disregarded in this respect. However, glial cells are essential for proper neuronal functioning and adopt a reactive phenotype in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> thereby contributing to an inflammatory response. This process is called reactive gliosis, which in turn affects UPS functioning in glial cells. In many <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> mostly neurons show accumulation and aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting that glial cells may be better equipped to maintain proper protein homeostasis. During an inflammatory reaction, the immunoproteasome is induced in glia, which may contribute to a more efficient degradation of disease-related proteins. Here we review the role of the UPS in glial cells in various <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> and we discuss how studying glial cell functioning might provide essential information in unraveling mechanisms of <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
25|$|Apoptosis {{plays an}} {{important}} role in regulating a variety of diseases. For example, schizophrenia is a <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> that may result from an abnormal ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors. Some evidence suggests that this may result from abnormal expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of caspase-3.|$|E
25|$|Citicoline is {{approved}} for treatment {{in cases of}} head trauma, stroke, and <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> in Japan and Europe.

It has been claimed that citicoline reduces rates of death and disability following an ischemic stroke.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{depressed}} {{mood and}} PBA may co-exist. In fact, depression {{is one of}} the most common emotional changes in patients with <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> or post-stroke sequelae. As a result, it is often comorbid with PBA. Comorbidity implies that depression is distinct from PBA and is not necessary for, nor does it exclude, a diagnosis of PBA.|$|E
40|$|<b>Neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), are {{characterized}} by progressive loss (and even death) of structure and function of neurons, and have created great burden to {{the individual and the}} society. The actual cause of various <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> still remains a mystery in healthcare. Some of the commonly studied environmental factors causes for <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> are protein degradation, oxidative stress, inflammation, environmental factor, mitochondrial defects, familial history, and abnormal protein accumulation in neuron. However ageing plays a very important role in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases.</b> Medicinal plants and natural compounds, such as Withania somnifera (ashwagandha), Ginseng, curcumin, resveratrol, Baccopa monnieri, Ginkgo biloba, and Wolfberry have been applied to prevent or alleviate neurological diseases and relief of neurological symptoms reported in in vivo or in clinical trails. Natural compounds in nanosize range as a therapeutic agent possess the same activity as in native state. Nanodrug delivery helps to increase the bioavailability of the drug and thereby specifically target cells and tissues. Nanoparticles, polymeric nanomicelles, complex polymers nanocrystal, and nanofibers are used to carry the medicinal plants for drug delivery system in the treatment of <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases.</b> Especially, electrospinning and electrospraying as straightforward yet versatile techniques for the production of nanosized fibers and particles possess huge potential in encapsulation of natural compounds for the <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases.</b> This review is a study to understand the role of nanotechnology and natural compounds in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> associated with ageing...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{association}} of the apolipoprotein (Apo E) -epsilon 4 allele to <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been analyzed in several studies.

40|$|Cytoplasmic stress {{granules}} (SGs) {{are critical}} for facilitating stress responses and for preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. SGs, however, {{have been linked to}} the pathogenesis of <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> in part because SGs share many components with neuronal granules. Oxidative stress is one of the conditions that induce SG formation. SGs regulate redox levels, and SG formation in turn is differently regulated by various types of oxidative stress. These associations and other evidences suggest that SG formation contributes to the development of <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases.</b> In this paper, we review the regulation of SG formation/assembly and discuss the interactions between oxidative stress and SG formation. We then discuss the links between SGs and <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> and the current therapeutic approaches for <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> that target SGs...|$|R
25|$|Individuals who are {{carriers}} of premutation alleles {{are at risk}} for developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a progressive <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease.</b> It is seen in approximately half of male carriers over the age of 70, while penetrance in females is lower. Typically, onset of tremor occurs in the sixth decade of life, with subsequent progression to ataxia (loss of coordination) and gradual cognitive decline.|$|E
25|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} the most common <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> and {{is the most}} common form of {{dementia}} in the elderly. The disorder is characterized by progressive loss of memory and various cognitive functions. It is hypothesized that the deposition of amyloid-β peptide (40-42 amino acid residues) in the brain is integral in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulation is purported to block hippocampal long-term potentiation. It is also possible that a receptor for amyloid-β oligomers could be a prion protein.|$|E
25|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{also known}} simply as Alzheimer's, is a <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> {{characterized}} by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining {{activities of daily living}} and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory (amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and recognition (agnosia), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.|$|E
40|$|The most {{prominent}} changes in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> are protein accumulation and inclusion formation. Several <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> including Alzheimer’s, the Synucleinopathies and Tauopathies share several overlapping clinical symptoms manifest in Parkinsonism, cognitive decline and dementia. As degeneration progresses in the disease process, clinical symptoms suggest convergent pathological pathways. Biochemically, protein cleavage, ubiquitination and phosphorylation seem to {{play fundamental roles}} in protein aggregation, inclusion formation and inflammatory responses. In the following we provide a synopsis of the current knowledge about protein accumulation and astrogliosis as a common denominator in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> and we propose insights into protein degradation and anti-inflammation. We review the E 3 -ubiquitin ligase and other possible functions of parkin as a suppressant of inflammatory signs and a strategy to clear amyloid proteins in <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Neurodegenerative</b> <b>{{diseases}}</b> affect {{not only}} the life quality of aging populations, but also their life spans. All forms of <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> have a massive impact on the elderly. The major threat of these brain diseases includes progressive loss of memory, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), impairments in the movement, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and the inability to walk, talk, and think, Huntington’s disease (HD). Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are highlighted as a central feature of brain degenerative diseases. Oxidative stress, a condition that occurs due to imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant status, {{has been known to}} {{play a vital role in}} the pathophysiology of <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> including AD, PD, and HD. A large number of studies have utilized oxidative stress biomarkers to investigate the severity of these <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> and medications are available, but these only treat the symptoms. In traditional medicine, a large number of medicinal plants have been used to treat the symptoms of these <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases.</b> Extensive studies scientifically validated the beneficial effect of natural products against <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> using suitable animal models. This short review focuses the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AD, PD, and HD and the protective efficacy of natural products against these diseases...|$|R
25|$|In {{his book}} The Island of the Colorblind Sacks wrote about an island where {{many people have}} {{achromatopsia}} (total colourblindness, very low visual acuity and high photophobia). The second section of this book, entitled Cycad Island, describes the Chamorro people of Guam, who have {{a high incidence of}} a <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> locally known as Lytico-Bodig disease (a devastating combination of ALS, dementia and parkinsonism). Later, along with Paul Alan Cox, Sacks published papers suggesting a possible environmental cause for the disease, namely the toxin beta-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA) from the cycad nut accumulating by biomagnification in the flying fox bat.|$|E
25|$|In various {{models of}} <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease,</b> {{minocycline}} has demonstrated neurorestorative {{as well as}} neuroprotective properties.

Current research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline against the progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. As mentioned above, minocycline harms ALS patients.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} the second most common <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> after Alzheimer's disease. It is a hypokinetic {{movement}} basal ganglia disease caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the human brain. The inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia is thus not decreased, and so upper motor neurons, mediated by the thalamus, are not activated in a timely manner. Specific symptoms include rigidity, postural problems, slow movements, and tremors. Blocking GABA receptor input from medium spiny neurons to reticulata cells, causes inhibition of upper motor neurons similar to the inhibition that occurs in Parkinson's disease.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, Cash was {{diagnosed}} with the <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> Shy–Drager syndrome, a form of multiple system atrophy; according to biographer Robert Hilburn, the disease was originally misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and Cash even announced to a concert audience that he had Parkinson's during a show in Flint, Michigan, on October 25, 1997, after he nearly collapsed on stage; soon after his diagnosis was changed to Shy–Drager and Cash was told he had approximately 18 months to live. The diagnosis was later again altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. The illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs.|$|E
25|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), {{commonly known as}} mad cow disease, is a transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} and fatal <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> in cattle that may be passed to humans who have eaten infected flesh. BSE causes a spongiform degeneration {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. BSE has a long incubation period, of 2.5 to 5 years, usually affecting adult cattle at a peak age onset of four to five years. BSE is caused by a misfolded protein—a prion. In the United Kingdom, more than 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered during the eradication program. In France, the country worst affected overall, over 300,000 cases were identified, although most were not recorded at the time.|$|E
25|$|Another {{gene therapy}} of PD {{involved}} insertion of the {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} (GAD) into the subthalamic nucleus. GAD enzyme controls GABA productions. In Parkinson’s disease, the activity of both GABA efferents to the subthalamic nucleus and its target within the basal ganglia circuity are affected. This strategy used andeno-associated viral vectoe (AAV2) to deliver GAD to the subthalamic nucleus. The trial was done to compare the effect of bilateral delivery of AAV2-GAD into the subthalamic nucleus with bilateral sham surgery in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. The study showed the first success of randomised, double-blind gene therapy trial for a <b>neurodegenerative</b> <b>disease</b> and justified the continued development of AAV2-GAD for treatment of PD.|$|E
