5000|$|... the Tribunal's {{finding of}} fact that the NGC failed to bargain in good faith was <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable,</b> and, under Khosa, {{it was not for}} courts to reweigh the {{evidence}} considered by it.|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} {{occupied}} with this story, during many working hours of two years. I {{must have been}} very ill employed, if I could not leave its merits and demerits as a whole, to express themselves on its being read as a whole. But, as it is <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> to suppose that I may have held its threads with a more continuous attention than anyone else can have given them during its desultory publication, it is <b>not</b> <b>unreasonable</b> to ask that the weaving may be looked at in its completed state, and with the pattern finished.|$|R
