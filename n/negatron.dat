The calculations are performed for the solar modulation level of 1968 and geomagnetic cutoff values of zero and 4. 5 Gv.

40|$|The cosmic-ray {{positron}} and <b>negatron</b> spectra between 11 and 204 MeV {{have been}} measured {{in a series}} of 3 high-altitude balloon flights launched from Fort Churchill, Manitoba, on July 16, July 21, and July 29, 1968. The detector system consisted of a magnetic spectrometer utilizing a 1000 -gauss permanent magnet, scintillation counters, and a lucite Čerenkov counter. Launches were timed so that the ascent through the 100 g/cm 2 level of residual atmosphere occurred after the evening geomagnetic cutoff transition. Data gathered during ascent are used to correct for the contribution of atmospheric secondary electrons to the flux measured at float altitude. All flights floated near 2. 4 g/cm 2. A pronounced morning intensity increase was observed in each flight. We present daytime positron and <b>negatron</b> data which support the interpretation of the diurnal flux variation as a change in the local geomagnetic cutoff. A large diurnal variation was observed in the count rate of positrons and negatrons with magnetic rigidities less than 11 MV and is evidence that the nighttime cutoff was well below this value. Using nighttime data we derive extraterrestrial positron and <b>negatron</b> spectra. The positron-to-total-electron ratio which we measure indicates that the interstellar secondary, or collision, source contributes ≾ 50 percent of the electron flux within this energy interval. By comparing our measured positron spectrum with the positron spectrum calculated for the collision source we derive the absolute solar modulation for positrons in 1968. Assuming negligible energy loss during modulation, we derive the total interstellar electron spectrum as well as the spectrum of directly accelerated, or primary, electrons. We examine the effect of adiabatic deceleration and find that many of the conclusions regarding the interstellar electron spectrum are not significantly altered for an assumed energy loss of up to 50 percent of the original energy. ...|$|E

We have measured the differential energy spectra of cosmic-ray positrons and <b>negatrons</b> with energies between 11 and 1500 MeV {{during the period}} 1968 - 1971 using a balloon-borne magnetic spectrometer. These measurements fill {{a gap in the}} previously existing data and permit us to determine, within quantitative limits, the interstellar spectra of cosmic-ray positrons and electrons [ [...] . ]. Knowledge of these spectra provides a crucial tool for studies of the distribution and density of matter and magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and the origin and dynamics of energetic particles contained in the fields. From a study of the near-Earth electron spectra and their relationship to the interstellar spectrum derived from the galactic non-thermal-radio-background emission, and from a study of the near-Earth positron spectra and their relationship to the interstellar positron spectrum calculated from collisions of cosmic-ray nuclei with the interstellar matter, we have found that the differential energy spectrum of interstellar electrons may be represented as a power-law, [ [...] . ] for 100 MeV [ [...] . ] GeV, but must flatten considerably at lower energies. From the measured electron charge composition, which we find to be little affected by solar modulation, we have concluded that the majority of cosmic-ray electrons with energies above 10 MeV are not the result of nuclear collisions in the galaxy but presumably originate in "primary" sources. In the energy range of our measurements the near-Earth intensities of cosmic-ray positrons and electrons, as well as the intensity of cosmic-ray nuclei, are significantly lower than their interstellar intensities because the particles are scattered by magnetic irregularities imbedded in the outward-flowing plasma of the solar wind. Long-term changes in the scattering properties of the interplanetary medium, i. e. in the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient, [ [...] . ], are responsible for the observed long-term variations in the near-Earth cosmic-ray intensities which are as large as a factor of 10 from "solar minimum" to "solar maximum". We have used the cosmic-ray positron and electron spectra as tools to study the solar modulation mechanism. By using numerical solutions of the cosmic-ray transport equation to relate the near-Earth electron spectra to the interstellar electron spectrum, we have found that the magnetic rigidity dependence of the interplanetary cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient at rigidities from 100 MV to 10 GV may be represented as [ [...] . ] with b increasing from 0 to 1 - 2 with increasing rigidity. However, from a comparison of the near-Earth and interstellar positron spectra we find that below 60 MV the diffusion coefficient must increase with decreasing rigidity. The magnitude of the diffusion coefficient at 1 AU derived from the electron and positron modulation studies depends on the assumed radial dependence of [ [...] . ]. In order to place limits on this radial dependence and to make estimates {{of the size of the}} solar modulation region, we have also evaluated diffusion coefficients from measurements of the power spectrum of the interplanetary magnetic field near 1 AU. Assuming [ [...] . ], we have found that [ [...] . ] in order that the calculated modulation beyond 1 AU agrees with the observed modulation. For K independent of radius, we obtained consistency between the diffusion coefficients derived by the two methods for boundary distances of the solar modulation region in the range of 6 - 25 AU. These diffusion coefficients derived from the electron modulation study must also apply to the cosmic-ray nuclei. As a consistency check, we have used the electron diffusion coefficients to calculate solutions of the transport equation for cosmic-ray protons and He nuclei for four different time periods from 1965 to 1970. Assuming a particular, time-independent form for the interstellar spectra of these particles, we have derived spectra at l AU which are consistent with the observations over the full range of intensity variations observed during this solar half cycle...|$|R
