40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a <b>new</b> image <b>coding</b> using wavelet transform and adaptive block truncation coding. Images are first pre-processed by the wavelet transform and then coded by the adaptive block truncation coding. Algorithms for both monochrome and color images are proposed and experimentally studied. The adaptive block truncation coding is also modified to achieve better performance. For coding monochrome images at the bit-rate region between 0. 8 to 1. 2 bits/pixel, {{the performance of}} the <b>new</b> <b>coding</b> is comparable to the ones of subband codings and other image codings using the wavelet transform; however, the <b>new</b> <b>coding</b> offers less computational load. The <b>new</b> <b>coding</b> also gives a good reconstruction of a color image at the bit-rate of 1. 0 bit/pixel. The comparison between the <b>new</b> <b>coding</b> and the original adaptive block truncation coding is also given. The discussion on effects of a filter and a number of decomposition levels used for an implementation of the wavelet transform is included in this thesis, as well...|$|R

5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a <b>new</b> <b>code</b> based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{the society}} {{presented}} a <b>new</b> <b>code</b> and system of bylaws {{for the government}} of the Romney Classical Institute, which reserved to the society the power to appoint assistant teachers, fix the amount of salaries, and provide the conditions and manners of payment and reimbursement. Foote differed with the society over these matters, and he ultimately declined to accept the new bylaws and resigned his leadership position in October 1849; in 1850, he established a rival institution known as the Potomac Seminary. Rather than falling under the patronage of the society, Foote's new institution fell {{under the control of the}} Presbyterian church. Following Foote's departure, the society selected Professor E. J. Meany to head the Romney Classical Institute. Despite the schism, the society also provided financial support from the lottery to the Potomac Seminary.|$|E

5|$|On November 23, 1876, {{representatives from}} Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia {{met at the}} Massasoit House in Springfield, Massachusetts to {{standardize}} a <b>new</b> <b>code</b> of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. The rules were based largely on the Rugby Football Union's code from England, though one important difference was the replacement of a kicked goal with a touchdown as the primary means of scoring (a change that would later occur in rugby itself, favoring the try as the main scoring event). Three of the schools—Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton—formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, {{as a result of}} the meeting. Yale did not join the group until 1879, because of an early disagreement about the number of players per team.|$|E

5|$|Larrea's {{prestige}} as {{an influential}} businessman promoted his appointment as {{member of the}} Primera Junta. However, as with the other members, the precise reasons for his inclusion are unclear. The Junta's membership has been considered a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists. Larrea resigned his wages from his position as Junta member, and organized the resources for the upcoming war of independence. Together with Manuel de Sarratea he drafted a <b>new</b> <b>code</b> regulating business in Argentina, and he also secured the exile of former viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros by bribing {{the captain of the}} ship carrying him, the Dart, to avoid any landfall until reaching the Canary Islands {{on the far side of}} the Atlantic. He supported the execution of Liniers after the defeat of his counter-revolution, and supported the secretary Mariano Moreno against the president Cornelio Saavedra. Larrea voted for the incorporation of deputies from other cities into the Junta, although he had previously indicated his opposition to the proposal. It was intended by Saavedra that this change would reduce Moreno's influence within the Junta.|$|E
