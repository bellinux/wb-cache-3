25|$|A {{number of}} other CYP enzymes are implicated as minor {{pathways}} of DXM metabolism. CYP2B6 is actually more effective than CYP3A4 at <b>N-demethylation</b> of DXM, but, since the average individual has a much lower CYP2B6 content in his/her liver relative to CYP3A4, most <b>N-demethylation</b> of DXM is catalyzed by CYP3A4.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{rifampicin}} pre-treatment (600 mg daily for 6 days) on theophylline disposition at steady state {{was investigated in}} six healthy males. Following rifampicin treatment total plasma clearance of theophylline increased by 82 %. Theophylline clearance through each metabolic pathway was increased, 1 -demethylation by (116 +/- 34 %) (mean +/- s. e. mean), 3 -demethylation by (91 +/- 16 %) and 8 -oxidation by (81 +/- 17 %). Renal clearance of unchanged drug was not altered. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} two forms of cytochrome P- 450 are involved in theophylline metabolism, one mediating the <b>N-demethylations</b> and the other 8 -oxidation. Thus, unlike the selective inductive effect of rifampicin on antipyrine metabolic pathways, rifampicin does not differentially affect those forms of cytochrome P- 450 involved in theophylline metabolism. The extent to which theophylline metabolism is induced by rifampicin is likely to have important clinical consequences...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cytochrome P 450 enzymes {{are capable}} of catalyzing {{a great variety of}} {{synthetically}} useful reactions such as selective C−H functionalization. Surrogate redox partners are widely used for reconstitution of P 450 activity {{based on the assumption that}} the choice of these auxiliary proteins or their mode of action does not affect the type and selectivity of reactions catalyzed by P 450 s. Herein, we present an exceptional example to challenge this postulate. MycG, a multifunctional biosynthetic P 450 monooxygenase responsible for hydroxylation and epoxidation of 16 -membered ring macrolide mycinamicins, is shown to catalyze the unnatural <b>N-demethylation(s)</b> of a range of mycinamicin substrates when partnered with the free Rhodococcus reductase domain RhFRED or the engineered Rhodococcus-spinach hybrid reductase RhFRED-Fdx. By contrast, MycG fused with the RhFRED or RhFRED-Fdx reductase domain mediates only physiological oxidations. This finding highlights the larger potential role of variant redox partner protein−protein interactions in modulating the catalytic activity of P 450 enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons present in cigarette smoke induce cytochromes P 4501 A 1 and P 4501 A 2. These isozymes are of toxico-logical importance because they convert several environmental pol-lutants to reactive intermediates that form covalent adducts with cellular DNA resufting in mutations and/or malignant transformations. The aim {{of our research}} was to investigate whether theophylline metabolites {{could be used as}} probes for P 4501 A 1 and P 4501 A 2. It is known that at least two human P 450 isozymes are involved in theophylline metabolism. The <b>N-demethylations</b> of theophylline to 3 -methylxanthine (3 -MX) and 1 -methylxanthine (1 -MX) appear to be mediated by P 4501 A 1 and/or P 4501 * 2 and the 8 -hydroxylation by different isozymes. Theophylline metabolism was measured in liver microsomes from control, benzo(a) pyrene (BP) -, and isosafrole (ISO) -induced rats. Theophylline was also incubated in microsomes prepared from cells expressing high levels of human P 4501 A 1 an...|$|R

40|$|A soil {{bacterium}} (designated strain SRS 2) able to metabolize the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon, 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (IPU), {{was isolated}} from a previously IPU-treated agricultural soil. Based on a partial {{analysis of the}} 16 S rRNA gene and the cellular fatty acids, the strain {{was identified as a}} Sphingomonas sp. within the α-subdivision of the proteobacteria. Strain SRS 2 was able to mineralize IPU when provided as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Supplementing the medium with a mixture of amino acids considerably enhanced IPU mineralization. Mineralization of IPU was accompanied by transient accumulation of the metabolites 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1 -methylurea, 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) -urea, and 4 -isopropyl-aniline identified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, thus indicating a metabolic pathway initiated by two successive <b>N-demethylations,</b> followed by cleavage of the urea side chain and finally by mineralization of the phenyl structure. Strain SRS 2 also transformed the dimethylurea-substituted herbicides diuron and chlorotoluron, giving rise to as-yet-unidentified products. In addition, no degradation of the methoxy-methylurea-substituted herbicide linuron was observed. This report is the first characterization of a pure bacterial culture able to mineralize IPU...|$|R
40|$|A {{bacterial}} consortium, {{isolated from}} a French agricultural soil, {{was shown to}} rapidly mineralize the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon (3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea). Study of the mineralization kinetics by ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) had shown the transitory accumulation and degradation of the three known isoproturon metabolites 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) - 1 -methylurea, 3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) -urea, and 4 -isopropylaniline, thus indicating a metabolic pathway initiated by two successive <b>N-demethylations,</b> followed by cleavage of the urea side chain. This bacterial consortium did not degrade other phenylurea herbicides like diuron, linuron, monolinuron and chlorotoluron suggesting the existence of pathway specific for IPU. Six bacterial strains were isolated from the consortium by successive inoculations on mineral salt medium {{but none of them}} was able to degrade isoproturon in isolated form. Based on partial sequencing of the 16 S rDNA sequence, the isolated bacterial strains were found to be belonging to genera Ancylobacter, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Methylobacterium, variovorax and Agrobacterium. A BAC genomic library was established and is currently under functional screeing searching for BAC clone harbouring IPU-degrading capability. positive BAC clone will then be fully sequenced for identifying gene coding for the enzyme responsible for IPU transformation which up to now remains unknown...|$|R

The application of computational chemistry {{has a wide}} scope of utility. From large systems such as proteins or metal-organic frameworks down {{to the understanding of}} individual bonding patterns between atoms, there are endless opportunities to explore. Further utility is gained when the insights and resources of computational chemists can be applied to systems under investigation by experimental chemists The combined information of computational details with experimental findings can lead to new understanding of the systems being investigated. The ring-opening transesterification polymerization of caprolactone with an aluminum- salen catalyst is a useful reaction for the conversion of caprolactone to polyester. Mechanistic understanding of this reaction was gained through the interrogation of this process with density functional theory. Further, the origins for rate-enhancement through modification of electron-withdrawing groups was explained through the analysis of partial atomic charges. A rate enhancement observed by altering the backbone of the catalyst was also explained through the development of a distortion framework analysis. Rieske oxygenase are a class of protein that executes a variety of chemical reactions such as oxygenations, O- and <b>N-demethylations,</b> oxidations, and C–C bond formations en route to the formation of medically relevant natural products. The continued elucidation of the mechanism, including the characterization of reactive species was persued. Computational work to understand the impact partial atomic charge on the aromatic system (by inclusion of fluorine substituents) had on the rate constant demonstrated a clear correlation between the partial atomic charge on the C(2) position and the rate constant for a variety of substrates. A new reaction, the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder (HDDA) reaction takes a diyne and a diynophile to create a reactive benzyne intermediate. A series of six intramolecular HDDA substrates were found to undergo this transformation at relatively similar rates. Analysis of transition state geometries, investigation of both closed-shell and diradical mechanistic pathways, as well as insight from high-level calculations provide information about the nature of this intramolecular reaction. Extension of the mechanism led to predictive capability in good agreement with a new set of substrates as well...|$|R
25|$|Theophylline is metabolized {{extensively}} in the liver (up to 70%). It undergoes <b>N-demethylation</b> via cytochrome P450 1A2. It is metabolized by parallel zero order and Michaelis-Menten pathways. Metabolism may become saturated (non-linear), even within the therapeutic range. Small dose increases may result in disproportionately large increases in serum concentration. Methylation to caffeine is also important in the infant population.

25|$|The {{first pass}} through the hepatic portal vein results {{in some of the}} drug being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active {{metabolite}} of dextromethorphan called dextrorphan (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan also undergoes <b>N-demethylation</b> (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM), and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. Hours after dextromethorphan therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is {{extensively}} metabolized by {{the liver}} via oxidation and <b>N-demethylation.</b> Based on in vitro research, the major enzymes {{involved in the}} metabolism of doxepin are the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, with CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 also involved to a lesser extent. The major active metabolite of doxepin, nordoxepin, is formed mainly by CYP2C19 (>50% contribution), while CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 are involved to a lesser extent, and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are not involved. Both doxepin and nordoxepin are hydroxylated mainly by CYP2D6, and both doxepin and nordoxepin are also transformed into glucuronide conjugates. The elimination half-life of doxepin is about 15–18hours, whereas that of nordoxepin is around 28–31hours. Up to 10% of Caucasian individuals show substantially reduced metabolism of doxepin that can result in up to 8-fold elevated plasma concentrations of the drug compared to normal.|$|E
40|$|Elimination of Caffeine Metabolites in Man Nikolaos Rodopoulos Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Clinical Chemistry, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Plasma, saliva and urinary {{caffeine}} (CA), paraxanthine (PX), theobromine (TB), theophylline (TP) {{and their}} metabolites were, after separation into fractions by reversed-phase {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC), quantitated by capillary electrophoresis (CE). In healthy adults, 96 % of {{the total amount of}} excreted compounds derived from CA were dimethylxanthines (DMXs) and metabolites, the remainder 4 % being nonmetabolized CA and its nondemethylated urate. The PX pathway accounted for 78 % of the excreted DMXs and metabolites, with the TB pathway accounting for 14 % and TP pathway for 8 %, 24 h after CA ingestion. The percent of the area under the curve (AUC) for PX was lower than the percent excreted metabolites corresponding to the PX pathway, whereas the AUC for TB was higher than the TB pathway value and the percent of AUC for TP was similar to the TP pathway value. The high urinary-to-plasma concentration ratios of 7 -U after TB ingestion, and 1, 3 -U and 1 -U after TP ingestion, suggest their high excretion by the kidneys. The reactions involved in metabolism of DMXs remained constand during the load, suggesting that <b>N-demethylations</b> and C 8 -oxidations of DMXs occur simultaneously and not sequentially. The distribution of urinary metabolites suggests large differences in excretion of 1 -X, 1 -U and 1, 3 -U depending on whether the metabolites are formed after CA ingestion or after ingestion of PX and TP, respectively. The intestinal absorption of monomethylxanthines (MMXs) is high and rapid, whereas the absorption of monomethylurates (MMUs) is low and slow as judged from urinary excretion of metabolites and unchanged compounds. Prior to excretion all of 1 -X and approximately 25 % of 7 -X were oxidized to the corresponding urates, whereas essentially all of 3 -X was excreted as nomnetabolized compound. The distribution of urinary metabolites suggests large differences in excretion of 1 -X and 1 -U depending on whether the metabolites are formed after ingestion of MMXs or after ingestion of CA and DMXs. In liver cirrhosis the metabolism through the PX pathway was decreased, whereas the metabolism through the TB + TP pathways was increased. In liver cirrhosis the total N 3 - and N 7 -demethylations were decreased, whereas total N 1 -demethylations were increased. The major C 8 -oxidation reaction, oxidation of 1 -methylxanthine, was increased in liver cirrhosis.

25|$|Ketamine is {{absorbable}} by intravenous, intramuscular, oral, and topical routes due to {{both its}} water and lipid solubilities. When administered orally, it undergoes first-pass metabolism, {{where it is}} biotransformed in the liver by CYP3A4 (major), CYP2B6 (minor), and CYP2C9 (minor) isoenzymes into norketamine (through <b>N-demethylation)</b> and finally dehydronorketamine. Intermediate in the biotransformation of norketamine into dehydronorketamine is the hydroxylation of norketamine into hydroxynorketamine by CYP2B6 and CYP2A6. Dehydronorketamine, followed by norketamine, is the most prevalent metabolite detected in urine. As the major metabolite of ketamine, norketamine is one-third to one-fifth as potent as an anesthetic, and plasma levels of this metabolite are three times higher than ketamine following oral administration. Bioavailability through the oral route reaches 17–20%; bioavailability through other routes are: 93% intramuscularly, 25–50% intranasally, 30% sublingually, and 30% rectally. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within a minute intravenously, 5–15 min intramuscularly, and 30 min orally.
