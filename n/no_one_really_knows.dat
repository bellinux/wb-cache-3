500|$|The {{government}} decided {{to close a}} number of government libraries without consultation on the closings or the process involved. [...] The {{manner in which it}} was done received significant criticism because it has resulted in the remaining information being put into a disarray, rendering it inaccessible for research, and in a loss of information of a magnitude as of yet unknown. [...] This is because no significant effort was made to inventory the material, to determine what should be preserved, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> what was discarded. [...] Much material was simply given away, thrown away, or lost in process, very likely including valuable data and historical documents.|$|E

In order to safeguard operations, UP converted the 800s to oil burning, and a [...] tank was fitted in the bunker space. Otherwise, few modifications were needed to insure years of mainline service. These were the last steam locomotives delivered for the UP. 844, the last of the FEF-3 class, is the longest continuously operating 4-8-4 engine in the world, and the only one never retired by a Class I railroad.

2500|$|The network's {{ability to}} {{exercise}} power is based partly on Bhumibol's popularity and strict control of Bhumibol's popular image. According to Jost Pachaly of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, Bhumibol [...] "plays {{an important role}} behind the scenes. But the role is difficult to assess because nothing is reported about it and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> anything specific", due to lese majeste laws forbidding discussion about Bhumibol's political activities. Bhumibol's popularity was demonstrated following the 2003 Phnom Penh riots in Cambodia, when hundreds of Thai protesters, enraged by rumors that Cambodian rioters had stomped on photographs of Bhumibol, gathered outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok. Photographs of the stomping were not published in Thailand, but were available on the internet. The situation was resolved peacefully only when Police General Sant Sarutanonda told the crowd that he had {{received a call from}} royal secretary Arsa Sarasin conveying Bhumibol's request for calm. The crowd dispersed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{previous}} year a perfume created for Hobson had been marketed as [...] "Great Expectations" [...] {{to coincide with}} her role as Estella Havisham in David Lean's film of that name, based on Charles Dickens' 1861 novel. In England, this attracted the custom of [...] then-Oxford University undergraduate Margaret Roberts, later British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who, a little daringly for the time, also shopped for [...] "push-up" [...] pink brassieres. In 1953, when Hobson starred in the musical The King and I in London, {{it was apparent that}} she had retained a Parisienne mix of chic and Boheminism. A Daily Mirror journalist described her [...] "pale, ladylike looks, her well-bred clothes ... she likes embroidery and painting", while a young Etonian who visited her dressing room recalled that [...] "it had been freshly painted pink and white for her, and was like entering a risqué French apartment". Ten years later, when Hobson's husband, the politician John Profumo, was involved in a sex scandal that threatened to destabilise the British government, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote that [...] "his [...] wife is very nice and sensible. Of course, these people live in a raffish, theatrical, bohemian society where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> anyone and everyone is [...] "darling"".|$|E
2500|$|In late 2009, Raven-Symone {{announced}} that she {{would return to the}} studio to record her next album.

I'd love to find the next Timbaland or the next someone who's coming up and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> yet. At the same time, I'd love to work with the Clutch and the J.A.M. again". In January 2011, she told to OnTheRedCarpet.com that she has been working on her fifth album. Da Beat Kadetz formerly known as The TriGz may be working on the project, with Manny Streetz (from Da Beat Kadetz) as executive producer. Raven revealed to Billboard that she would like to work with Sean Garrett again and that it will be R with an [...] "alternative base for lyrics". In an interview with Broadway.com in March 2012, she confirmed that she has no plans to release a new album, saying that she [...] "couldn't quite get it together" [...] and that the music she had been working on [...] "wasn't going to be something sellable."

2500|$|The March 1918 {{confrontation}} {{was triggered}} by an incident with the steamship Evelina. On 27 March 1918, fifty former Savage Division servicemen arrived in Baku on this ship to attend the funeral of their colleague Mamed Tagiyev, son of a famous Azerbaijani oil magnate and philanthropist, Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev. M. Tagiyev {{had been killed in}} a skirmish by Russian-Armenian forces in Lenkoran. Some sources state that when the soldiers got back on board the Evelina to sail out of Baku on 30 March 1918, the Soviet received information that the Muslim crew of the ship was armed and waiting for a signal to revolt against the Soviet. While the report lacked foundation, the Soviet acted on it, disarming the crew which tried to resist. Other sources claim that [...] Azerbaijanis were alarmed by the growing military strength of the Armenians in Baku, and called for the help of the Savage Division units in Lenkoran. Their arrival caused great concern among both Bolsheviks and Armenians, and when officials were sent down to the dockside to try to discover what their intentions were, they were driven back by gunfire, a number of them being killed. Eventually these newcomers were disarmed by a stronger Bolshevik force, but when more units of the Savage Division arrived on April 1, in MacDonell's words, [...] "the Baku cauldron boiled over". <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> who fired the first shot, but very soon Baku became a battlefield, with trenches and barricades being hastily prepared throughout the city.|$|E
2500|$|More significantly, {{living and}} working {{conditions}} in East Germany were rapidly worsening under Communist rule. Tensions finally reached breaking point and a Workers’ Uprising took place on 17 June 1953, to be quickly and brutally crushed when Soviet tanks rolled in, {{and some of the}} worst violence occurred around Potsdamer Platz, where several people were killed by the Volkspolizei. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knows</b> how many people died during the uprising itself, or by the subsequent death sentences. There are 55 known victims, but other estimates state at least 125. West German estimates were much higher: in 1966 the West German Ministry for Inter-German Affairs claimed that 383 people died in the uprising, including 116 [...] "functionaries of the SED regime", with an additional 106 executed under martial law or later condemned to death, while 1,838 were injured and 5,100 arrested, 1,200 of these later being sentenced to a total of 6,000 years in penal camps. It was also claimed that 17 or 18 Soviet soldiers were executed for refusing to shoot demonstrating workers, but this remains unconfirmed by post-1990 research. Whatever the casualty figures, {{for the second time in}} eight years, the [...] "busiest and most famous square in Europe" [...] had been transformed into a bloody battleground. Columbushaus, with its H.O. store on the ground floor and military police station above, had been a prime target in the insurrection and been burnt out yet again, along with the Haus Vaterland and other premises. This time, they were not rehabilitated.|$|E

50|$|The Stevens {{brothers}} selected {{their family}} estate in Hoboken, New Jersey, as {{the construction site}} for the ship. They {{had to have a}} drydock dug out of solid rock there, and then install large pumps to keep the drydock from flooding, and delays occurred {{from the very beginning of}} the project. The budget for the ship was set at $600,000 (USD), based on vaguely similar earlier ships, but in fact the new ship was revolutionary in concept and design that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> how to build her or how much she would cost.|$|R

But let trouble come, and all too often these seeming friends disappear as if by magic, until only a few, sometimes a very few, are left. These are the real friends, the true friends, and they are worth more than all the others put together. Remember that if you are a true friend to any one, you will stand by him and help him, no matter what happens. Sometimes it is almost worth while getting into trouble just to find out who your real friends are.|$|E
