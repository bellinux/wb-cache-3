30|$|As predicted, we {{also found}} ERP signs of a process {{preceding}} mental updating—namely, an anterior negativity (over prefrontal sites) that was larger for conjunctions than nonconjunctions, regardless of congruity. We take this as an index of combinatorics, which we argue is, like mental updating, {{part and parcel of}} visual narrative comprehension. As noted in the introduction, anterior negativities have been seen in response to violations of structural expectations in visual narratives (Cohn et al., 2014; Cohn, Paczynski, et al., 2012 a) and syntactic structure in sentences (i.e., the LAN; e.g., Friederici, 2011; Hagoort, 2003; Neville et al., 1991) and music (i.e., the RAN; Koelsch et al., 2005; Patel et al., 1998). Our observed anterior negativity was insensitive to unexpected character changes, consistent with our linking hypothesis that it reflects structural processing (i.e., the conjunction schema) and not updating of semantic information. It seems, then, that panels involved in conjunctions are more structurally costly than those in <b>nonconjunction</b> sequences.|$|E
30|$|Visual {{narratives}} sometimes depict successive {{images with}} different {{characters in the}} same physical space; corpus analysis has revealed that this occurs more often in Japanese manga than American comics. We used event-related brain potentials to determine whether comprehension of “visual narrative conjunctions” invokes not only incremental mental updating as traditionally assumed, but also, as we propose, “grammatical” combinatoric processing. We thus crossed (non)/conjunction sequences with character (in)/congruity. Conjunctions elicited a larger anterior negativity (300 – 500  ms) than <b>nonconjunctions,</b> regardless of congruity, implicating “grammatical” processes. Conjunction and incongruity both elicited larger P 600 s (500 – 700  ms), indexing updating. Both conjunction effects were modulated by participants’ frequency of reading manga while growing up. Greater anterior negativity in frequent manga readers suggests more reliance on combinatoric processing; larger P 600 effects in infrequent manga readers suggest more resources devoted to mental updating. As in language comprehension, it seems that processing conjunctions in visual narratives is not just mental updating but also partly grammatical, conditioned by comic readers’ experience with specific visual narrative structures.|$|R
