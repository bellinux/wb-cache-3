40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} nature of Australian bank {{prudential}} regulation before and after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). It begins by providing a detailed conceptual framework for understanding the functions of banks and deposit-takers, the theory of what can go wrong with the operation of these institutions, and the logic of prudential regulation. It then traces developments in Australian prudential regulation from {{the introduction of the}} formal capital-based framework in the 1980 s to the implementation of the Basel III regime after the GFC. The paper concludes that the introduction of the Financial Claims Scheme was clear a change compared with pre-GFC arrangements and one to be welcomed but one that constituted a clarification and formalisation of an existing perception suggested by the depositor protection provisions of the Banking Act rather than a fundamental change. The paper also concludes that the introduction of the Basel III liquidity regime did constitute a more fundamental modification. Requiring banks to hold enough liquidity to manage <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> over a thirty day period in stressed conditions, engenders confidence in deposit-takers and provides a backstop to the effectiveness of capital measures designed to reduce the likelihood of financial instability. Changes to authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) capital regulation that lie {{at the core of the}} Basel III regime also represent positive and desirable developments in the Australian context. In particular, enhancing the quality of ADI capital to ensure that it provides a cushion of instruments genuinely available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio and related exposures, and ensuring that securitisation arrangements do not leave residual credit exposures unaccounted for in the provision of this protective cushion, enhance the safety of Australian ADIs. That these represent fundamental changes in philosophy compared to pre-GFC arrangements is less clear. Their importance is unquestionable but the paper concludes that they are better characterised as significant refinements to the risk-based calculation of capital than as fundamental changes to regulatory philosophy. The paper also argues that while Australia’s adoption of Basel III’s macroprudential apparatus appears on the surface to constitute a genuine innovation in prudential regulation, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) had been practising macroprudential regulation before the GFC and there is a longer tradition of thinking about such regulation in Australia dating back to the Napier Royal Commission of 1935 - 37. It is, however, argued that the explicit recognition of macroprudential regulation represents an important and positive development. The paper lastly argues that the importance of financial stability as a policy objective and {{the nature of}} macroprudential regulation which has the potential to address this objective, raise questions about the wisdom of having split monetary policy and prudential regulation functions in  1998 and recommends revisiting this question and reassessing the institutional structure within which prudential regulation is conducted in Australia...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{unconstrained}} project scheduling problem with discounted cash flows where the <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> flows {{are assumed to}} be linear dependent on the completion times of the corresponding activities. Each activity of this unconstrained project scheduling problem has a known deterministic <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> flow which is linear and non-increasing in time. Progress payments and <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> occur at the completion of activities. The objective is to schedule the activities in order to maximize the net present value (npv) subject to the precedence constraints and a fixed deadline. Despite the growing amount of research concerning the financial aspects in project scheduling, little research has been done on the problem with time-dependent cash flows. Nevertheless, this problem gives an incentive to solve more realistic versions of project scheduling problems with financial objectives. We introduce an extension of an exact recursive algorithm which has been used in solving the max-npv problem with time-independent cash flows and which is embedded in an enumeration procedure. The recursive search algorithm schedules the activities as soon as possible and searches for sets of activities to shift towards the deadline in order to increase the net present value. The enumeration procedure enumerates all sets of activities for which such a shift has not been made but could, eventually, have been advantageous. The procedure has been coded in Visual C++ version 4. 0 under Windows NT and has been validated on a randomly generated problem set.
