5|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, Duchess appears at Ribby's {{door and the}} party begins. Distracted for a moment, Duchess does not see which oven Ribby opens to remove the pie. Duchess eats greedily, believing she is eating her ham and veal pie. She wonders {{what has happened to}} the patty-pan she put in her pie, and, <b>not</b> <b>finding</b> it under the crust, is convinced she has swallowed it. She sets up a howl; Ribby is perplexed and annoyed but leaves to find Dr. Maggoty, a magpie.|$|E

Just before he heads in, he is called by the Smoking Man, {{who is able to}} trace Mulder's location through the call. Mulder heads inside the boxcar, finding a pile of the dead creatures, each with smallpox vaccination scars on their arms. The Smoking Man arrives by helicopter with eight armed commandos and, <b>not</b> <b>finding</b> Mulder inside, orders the boxcar to be burned.|$|E
5|$|That {{night the}} Americans began to {{withdraw}} silently from the battlefield. Indian sentries detected {{the movement and}} attacked, creating confusion. Many volunteers became lost in the dark, separating into small groups. Crawford became concerned about his family members — his son John, his son-in-law William Harrison, and his nephew, also named William Crawford. With Dr Knight, Crawford remained near the battlefield as his men passed, calling for his missing relatives and <b>not</b> <b>finding</b> them. Crawford became angry when he realized the militia, despite his orders, had left some of the wounded behind. After all the men had passed, Crawford and Knight, with two others, finally set off, but were unable to find {{the main body of}} men.|$|E

5|$|Vaughan Williams {{was born}} to a well-to-do family with strong moral views and a {{progressive}} social outlook. Throughout his life he sought to be of service to his fellow citizens, and believed in making music as available as possible to everybody. He wrote many works for amateur and student performance. He was musically a late developer, <b>not</b> <b>finding</b> his true voice until his late thirties; his studies in 1907–08 with the French composer Maurice Ravel helped him clarify the textures of his music.|$|E
5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft {{in front of the}} Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over <b>not</b> <b>finding</b> any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids display {{high levels}} of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the {{tendency}} of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, {{not the least of}} which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of <b>not</b> <b>finding</b> a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.|$|E

Despite grant and scholarship offers from a number of schools, and a tuition fund left by his grandmother, Corgan decided to pursue music full-time. <b>Not</b> <b>finding</b> the Chicago music scene to his liking, he moved from Chicago to St. Petersburg, Florida in 1985 with his first major band, The Marked (so named for the conspicuous birthmarks of both Corgan and drummer Ron Roesing). <b>Not</b> <b>finding</b> success in St. Petersburg, the band dissolved; Corgan moved back to Chicago to live with his father.|$|E

Subsequently, motivations of the said staff have been measured in accordance with both inner and external motivation tools {{in order to determine}} whether there is an effect of sociotropical-autonomic personality traits on inner and external motivation, or <b>not.</b> <b>Findings</b> demonstrate that personal success, which can be identified as the subordinate dimension of the autonomic personality traits, effects both inner and external motivation directly and in the positive direction...|$|R

Fifty-two participants completed a computerized IAT and provided measures of fruit consumption and related habit strength. Implicit attitudes moderated the habit strength—fruit consumption relationship; stronger relationships were observed when implicit attitudes were more positive. Amongst those with strong fruit habits, more positive associations with fruit were found {{for those who had}} recently consumed sufficient fruits compared to those who had <b>not.</b> <b>Findings</b> demonstrate the relevance of implicit positive associations in understanding the relationship between fruit consumption habits and subsequent fruit consumption...|$|R

However, diseases they introduced decimated the native population over the ensuing decades, leading to the near-total collapse of every established culture across peninsular Florida. Between this depopulation and the indifference of its colonial owners, the Tampa Bay region would be virtually uninhabited for almost 200 years.|$|E

Thus, state antidiscrimination laws prohibited the group from recruiting at schools, and Bunn was ordered to alter the policy that allowed the Boy Scouts to recruit in schools.|$|E

This study examines the mediating and moderating effect of sense of control {{in the relationship between}} financial strain and depressive symptoms. The data came from a survey of a representative community sample of 411 elderly respondents in Hong Kong. Using multiple regression models, the authors found that generalized sense of control mediated and moderated the linkage between financial strain and depressive symptoms even after controlling socio-demographic variables but sense of control over finances did <b>not.</b> <b>Findings</b> suggest that generalized sense of control should be enhanced to protect older people under chronic financial strain from depression. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
