50|$|Participatory {{culture has}} been an {{encompassing}} concern of much of Jenkins' scholarly work which has focussed on developing media theory and practice principles by which media users are primarily understood as active and creative participants rather than merely as passive consumers and simplistically receptive audiences. This participatory engagement is seen as increasingly important given the enhanced interactive and <b>networked</b> <b>communication</b> capabilities of digital and internet technologies. Jenkins has described the creative social phenomena arising from as participatory culture and {{is considered one of}} the main academics specializing in this topic - see, for instance, his 2015 book Participatory Culture in a Networked Era: A Conversation on Youth, Learning, Commerce, and Politics co-authored with Mimi Ito and danah boyd.

50|$|The social layer {{refers to}} people and the various social {{structures}} with which they identify themselves, ranging from informal personal networks to formal institutions. For example, this may include groups of friends, formal community organisations and companies. The discursive layer refers to the themes or content of both mediated and unmediated communication. The technological layer comprises communication media and technologies. This includes both traditional media, such as newspapers and television, and new media including mobile phones and social networking sites. The devices and applications within this layer are differentiated according to the communication model they facilitate. For example, collective communication is made possible through one-to-many or many-to-many forms of media, such as television or online discussion boards, whereas <b>networked</b> <b>communication</b> can be enabled through one-to-one or peer-to-peer media, including instant messaging or SMS (Foth & Hearn, 2007).|$|E
50|$|Forest went on {{to create}} a number of {{important}} online works including “Time Out” (1998, for the inaugural Fête de l’Internet), “The Time Processing Machine” (1998), “The Techno-Wedding” (1999), “The Center of the World” (1999), “Territorial Outings” (2001), “Networked Color” (2000), “Meat: The Territory of the Body and the Networked Body” (2002), “Memory Pictures” (2005), “The Digital Street Corner” (2005), and “Biennale 3000” (2006). Many of these works are concerned with developing new anthropological models for a world in which both individual and community have {{had to deal with the}} dual effects of dematerialization and deterritorialization, processes accelerated by the new digital technologies of <b>networked</b> <b>communication.</b> Some of the works literally constitute rites of passage. This is certainly true of “The Techno-Wedding,” a collaborative project of Forest and fellow digital media artist Sophie Lavaud. The work was in fact the real-life wedding of Forest and Lavaud, which was webcast live alongside a virtual reality variant of the ceremony. Another example is to be found in “The Center of the World,” which offered the public an opportunity to make a physical or telepresent pilgrimage to a shrine-like installation containing a digital relic of the old territorially centered world.|$|E

5000|$|Jan Van Dijk (2006) {{defines the}} network {{society as a}} [...] "social {{formation}} with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)" [...] (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links {{the concept of the}} network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. Darin Barney uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: [...] "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated - almost exclusively digital - technologies of <b>networked</b> <b>communication</b> and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations".|$|E
5000|$|Mechanisms {{are given}} as {{conceptual}} {{elements of a}} <b>networked</b> <b>communication</b> system and are linked to specific functional units, for example, as a service or protocol component. In some cases, a mechanism can also comprise an entire protocol. For example on the transmission layer, LTE {{can be regarded as}} such a mechanism. Following this definition, there exist numerous communication mechanisms that are partly equivalent in their basic functionality, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee for local wireless networks and UMTS and LTE for broadband wireless connections. For example, LTE and Wi-Fi have equivalent basic functionality, but they are technologically significantly different in their design and operation. Mechanisms affected by transitions are often components of a protocol or service. For example, in case of video streaming/transmission, the use of different video data encoding can be carried out depending on the available data transmission rate. These changes are controlled and implemented by transitions; A research example is a context-aware video adaptation service to support mobile video applications. Through analyzing the current processes in a communication system, it is possible to determine which transitions need to be executed at which communication layer {{in order to meet the}} quality requirements. In order for communication systems to adapt to the respective framework conditions, architectural approaches of self-organizing, adaptive systems can be used, such as the MAPE cycle [...] (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute). This central concept of Autonomic Computing can be used to determine the state of the communication system, to analyze the monitoring data and to plan and execute the necessary transition(s). A central goal is that users do not consciously perceive a transition while running applications and that the functionality of the used services is perceived as smooth and fluid.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Examine the {{effectiveness}} and {{impacts of the}} <b>networked</b> <b>communication</b> technologies used by health care professionals {{for the treatment of}} adolescents/young adults with mental health disorders. Methods: Nine electronic databases were searched. Quantitative and qualitative study designs were included, technologies were described and a narrative synthesis of all included studies was undertaken. Results: 20, 925 papers were identified from which 12 interventions met the inclusion criteria. Three categories of <b>networked</b> <b>communication</b> were identified: email and/or web-based electronic diary (n = 6); videoconference (n = 5); and virtual reality (n = 1). Three studies reported statistically significant improvements in symptoms post intervention; all involved email communication.

Conclusions: <b>Networked</b> <b>communication</b> technologies can increase the opportunity for communication between patient and health care professionals.
