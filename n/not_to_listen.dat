5|$|Members of {{the faith}} are {{defensive}} {{of the fact that}} some practices seem to restrict women and make gender equality in leadership impossible. They are only permitted to enter special sections of the temple reserved for women or have to go to separate women's temples. As with practices of niddah in Orthodox Judaism, concepts of pollution associated with the menstrual cycle lead to the exclusion of women from the temples and daily worship during the affected time. Swaminarayan also directed male devotees <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to religious discourses given by women.|$|E

When she chooses <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to his advice, he creates the conditions for a shipwreck where she is returned to the sea. When Ondine once again finds Palemon and realises how he has betrayed her, Tirrenio exacts a terrible revenge with his fellow Undines by causing death and destruction for all Palemon's guests.|$|E

Anne drew criticism from the Kirk for keeping Henrietta Gordon, wife of the exiled Catholic George Gordon, Marquess of Huntly, as a confidante; after Huntly's return in 1596, the St Andrews minister David Black called Anne an atheist and remarked in a sermon that [...] "the Queen of Scotland was a woman for whom, for fashion's sake, the clergy might pray but from whom no good could be hoped." ...|$|E

500|$|Marcos strategists took {{advantage}} of [...] Imelda's exceptional charm and youth by incorporating these and her other striking qualities into the presidential candidate's overall tone for the Marcos-led Nacionalista campaign. They {{were able to use}} her by attracting normal folk from their daily activities to attend a Marcos rally to see the [...] "beautiful wife of Marcos" [...] themselves. The mere mention of Imelda attending a rally would make people attend the rally and scamper for a place near the stage, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to the speeches, but rather just to see the lovely wife of Ferdinand Marcos. She was asked by the Marcos aides to always appear in public at all times at her best regardless of the [...] type of audience. An integral part of their strategy was for Imelda to wear her standard ternos as part of the campaign design.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{classified}} Fantasy Black Channel {{into the}} British New Rave genre and musical scene. Others {{claimed that they}} could hear impressions of Roxy Music frontman Bryan Ferry and musician Gary Numan in the recording. Pitchfork Media's Adam Moerder commented that it contains several New Rave compositions which are aesthetically dubious. Chris Baynes of PopMatters claimed that the band members [...] "wear their influences pretty much inked onto their sleeves", but concluded that the album is exciting and excitable in equal measure. According to Late of the Pier, comparisons to Klaxons and New Rave are the results of lazy journalism, especially for a scene the band has never been in. Eastgate has explained that musical influences are often subconscious, even though the band members tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to anything but their own work while recording the album. Nick Mitchell of The Skinny {{pointed out that the}} record is [...] "an unrestrained, unclassifiable, unexpectedly triumphant romp through blaring influences and genres, from the 70s camp rock of Queen and Bowie to the primitive electronics of Gary Numan, with echoes of 90s computer games and snatches of modern house".|$|E

2500|$|Discussing the {{influences}} behind the album and performances, Perri listed [...] "love" [...] as the album's major inspiration. She added that she tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> {{to any other}} music other her current projects to stay inspired and not get distracted. She continued, [...] "Because I write with piano or guitar, I would come in with vocals and one instrument and we'd start {{from the ground up}} and add things." [...] Additional influences of the album include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, James Taylor, Elton John, and The Beatles. Perri [...] "mushed it all together in my brain and made Lovestrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{not seen}} Stanton's {{dispatch}} to the press, Sherman wrote Stanton a conciliatory letter, calling his agreement [...] "folly" [...] and saying that, though he still felt his deal with Johnston and Breckinridge was solid, {{it was not}} his place to contest his superior's decision and that he would follow orders. Meantime, Maj. Gen. Halleck, at Grant's request, communicated to several of Sherman's subordinates that they were to move their forces to North Carolina, regardless of what Sherman said. Halleck sent another dispatch to Sherman's generals telling them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to Sherman's edicts at all. After Halleck's order, and reading Stanton's message to the press in a newspaper, Sherman's fury reached a dizzying, explosive tenor. Sherman thought Stanton had unjustifiably characterized him as a disloyal pariah. [...] "I respect [...] office but I cannot him personally, till he undoes the injustice of the past", Sherman said to Grant. Sherman's brother, Senator John Sherman, wanted the general censured for his actions, but still treated fairly. Sherman himself, and his wife's powerful family, the Ewings, wanted Stanton to publicly take back his statements. Stanton characteristically refused.|$|E

2500|$|Director Louis Leterrier's {{first choice}} for {{composer}} on The Incredible Hulk was Craig Armstrong, once the arranger for Massive Attack, a band Leterrier {{was fond of}} and had collaborated with on the 2005 film Unleashed; this choice had surprised Marvel, who often had directors asking {{for the likes of}} John Williams or Danny Elfman, and the studio was hesitant due to Armstrong's lack of experience writing for action films. Leterrier listened to Armstrong's previous music while planning and editing the film, and music editor Peter Myles used Armstrong's work and similar music by others in the film's temp score. Armstrong chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to the temp, or watch Ang Lee's Hulk, before composing the score, which he begun in his home in Glasgow, Scotland, before moving to Remote Control in Los Angeles to be closer to the production. The score was recorded in four days, resulting in little time for adjustments on the day, forcing Armstrong to [...] "create very specific demos" [...] that were [...] "completely accurate" [...] for Matt Dunkley to [...] Leterrier favored an orchestral sound over electronics, [...] "because he didn’t want the work to sound dated so quickly", though Armstrong did electronically enhance a lot of the orchestral recordings. Additionally, [...] "about half the score" [...] features various ethnic instruments performed by Pete Lockett.|$|E
