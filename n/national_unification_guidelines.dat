5000|$|On 27 February 2006, Chen {{dismantled}} the <b>National</b> <b>Unification</b> Council and <b>Guidelines</b> {{saying they}} [...] "will cease functioning {{and the budget}} no longer be appropriated", effectively breaking the promises made in 2000 if 'cease functioning' {{is considered to be}} synonymous with 'abolishing'. However, as the People's Republic of China has threatened to use military force against Taiwan by passing the Anti-Secession Law in March 2005 and continuing the buildup of missiles opposite the Taiwan Strait, the no intent of aggression provision may have long been violated. It is noteworthy that the 2004 referendum called by President Chen Shui-bian held in tandem with the presidential election used the 'emergent threat' stipulation in Taiwan's Referendum Law, thereby implying the provision had already been breached by China's imminent threat and missile buildup. Nevertheless, this move drew sharp rebuke from the United States, with the State Department insisting that the Taiwanese government clarify that the <b>National</b> <b>Unification</b> Council has not been abolished. However, in a TV interview days later, Chen stated that 'ceasing to function' is the same as having been 'abolished'.|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of the}} Four Noes and One Without pledge, President Chen Shui-bian {{had promised}} not to {{formally}} abolish the <b>National</b> <b>Unification</b> <b>Guidelines</b> or the National Unification Council despite his party's supportive stance on Taiwan independence. In his Chinese New Year address on January 29, 2006, President Chen Shui-bian proposed abolishing the <b>National</b> <b>Unification</b> <b>Guidelines</b> and the National Unification Council. On February 27, 2006, Chen formally announced that the guideline would [...] "cease to apply" [...] and the council would [...] "cease to function". The United States initially warned Chen not to abolish either the council or the guidelines, but later refused to condemn him because it believed {{the absence of the}} term [...] "abolish" [...] was not a breach of the status quo. However, Chen was widely condemned by the People's Republic of China, which warned that Chen [...] "would bring disaster to Taiwan society." [...] The Pan-Blue Coalition also condemned the move as unnecessarily provocative, arguing that Chen needed to focus on economic issues {{in the face of a}} growing unemployment and suicide rate, and some legislators started a petition to have Chen impeached. Chen defended his action as a response to the military threat from mainland China. Without the legal constraints of the NUG, Chen's successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, has been able to usher in an era of unprecedented exchanges between Mainland China and Taiwan since 2008.|$|E

In 1997,"To meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification", the Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed and then the former [...] "constitution of five powers" [...] turns to be more tripartite. In 2000, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second and last term since 2004. Polarized politics has emerged in Taiwan with the formation of the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties led by the KMT, favouring eventual Chinese reunification, and the Pan-Green Coalition of parties led by the DPP, favouring an eventual and official declaration of Taiwanese independence. In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian remarked:“The National Unification Council will cease to function.
