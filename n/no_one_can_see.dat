5|$|The {{ghost of}} Zero (Normand Fauteux) materializes {{at a local}} gay bathhouse. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> or hear him, until Zero runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero's friend George. Zero realizes that Burton can see him, {{although}} Zero does not show up on Burton's video camera. The two strike a deal; Zero agrees to help Burton with his Patient Zero exhibit if Burton {{finds a way to}} make Zero appear.|$|E
5|$|In the present, {{during the}} re-dedication ceremony, Mulder realizes that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> Teager {{if they are}} in his line of sight. Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to the motorcade, where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound. Teager is shot in turn by the agents as he tries to escape. As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin was a {{different}} person—which Mulder denounces as a lie. He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the Vietnam War as he looks upon Teager's name on the memorial wall.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, it is ragged enough,' {{answered}} they, 'but it {{was left}} us by our father, and if any man wraps it round him <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> him; and we each want it for our own.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A few outrageous-looking acts of giddiness {{that are}} so much grieved over, may not be half so bad as the {{hundreds}} of wandering thoughts that <b>one</b> forgets, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>can</b> <b>see</b> them!" [...] said Ethel.|$|R
60|$|So now Hapley is {{spending}} {{the remainder of}} his days in a padded room, worried by a moth that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>can</b> <b>see.</b> The asylum doctor calls it hallucination; but Hapley, when he is in his easier mood, and can talk, says it is the ghost of Pawkins, and consequently a unique specimen and well worth the trouble of catching.|$|R

6000|$|... "You see I {{have been}} scalped," [...] the hunter said. [...] "I don't suppose you noticed it--few people do. You see, I never takes off my fur cap night or day, so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> as I wears a wig." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shut {{the shutter}} behind you. Then <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the light. You are quite safe. The {{servants}} all {{sleep in the}} other wing. I can show you where all the most valuable things are. You cannot carry them all, so we must pick the best." ...|$|E

50|$|At first, {{he is able}} {{to escape}} the creatures, which <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> but <b>one</b> night they destroy his car and break into his apartment, {{surrounding}} him. Rockne asks what they want from him, and the creatures inform him that they want to be written about. If Rockne will write a story about them, they will leave him alone and never return. Presented with the story idea he had been so desperate for, Rockne begins writing, and as he puts words on paper, the creatures begin to vanish, one by one.|$|R
5000|$|The general {{plot was}} of the three members of a fictional band called [...] "The Problem", who find a magical amulet {{that allows them to}} see and talk to ghosts. Each episode {{featured}} the trio helping the ghosts that they encountered in order for the ghosts {{to move on to the}} next world - much to their annoyance. Much of the humour of the series came from the Problem wanting to develop their career instead of helping ghosts. Since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>can</b> <b>see</b> them, they often come across as insane.|$|R

6000|$|Maxwell {{did not say}} anything; {{he looked}} at Louise again, {{and it seemed to}} her that he meant her to speak.

5000|$|Quote from Alex Mendelssohn in Big Planet: [...] "Most {{of my work}} is spiritual. The {{spirits are}} {{definitely}} around us. And that drives us into a direction. When I am working on a spiritual painting, the spirit does the work. It is like someone having a vision that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>can</b> <b>see.</b> I <b>can</b> even talk to people while I am painting, {{but it is not}} me that is painting, I am only holding the brush. This does not happen every day. When it happens, the spirits and art become one." ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{maintain}} {{the privacy of}} the information in the forms, each form is “shredded” into distinct fields and each field is verified by one or more different people. [...] Captricity claims that since <b>no</b> <b>one</b> person <b>can</b> <b>see</b> more than <b>one</b> field from a document, privacy is maintained. Captricity uses Amazon's Mechanical Turk System to perform this human verification step. [...] For example, a worker may see a stream of 4-digit numbers, not knowing that it is the last portion of a collection of US social security numbers.|$|R

"At any rate, in {{the dark}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> we are strangers, Ulf, and though I should not {{think there would be}} robbers on the road so near to York, these Danes are rough folk, and I want to meet none of them. One man, or even two, I in no ways fear, {{but when it comes to}} half a dozen even the best sword-player may wish himself out of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Another company (I) gets only 70 cents. The sullen, lowering, {{disappointed}} look is general. Half refuse {{it in this}} case. Company G, in full dress, with brass {{scales on}} shoulders, look'd, perhaps, {{as well as any}} of the companies--the men had an unusually alert look. These, then, are the black troops,--or the beginning of them.

50|$|A young woman, Melissa Sanders (Amy Irving), goes to {{the theatre}} to see the classic film His Girl Friday. She sees scenes from her own past {{involving}} her fiancé, James (Gary Cole). <b>No</b> <b>one</b> else <b>can</b> <b>see</b> these scenes. At first Melissa thinks it's a practical joke plotted by James, but when she returns to the theatre, she sees scenes of her future, in which she is killed by a bus on March 20. When she tells James about it, he assures her it will never happen. After it does happen, James visits the theatre and sees scenes from his own life.|$|R
50|$|The girls all {{celebrate}} Hyeon-su's {{party and}} Su-kyoung gives her an expensive doll for a present. When lighting the cake, the same ghost girl that Su-kyoung saw appears next to Hyeon-su, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>can</b> <b>see</b> her except Su-kyoung. The candles go out. In a hasty panic, Su-kyoung {{gets in the}} way of the cake (which was to be thrown at Hyeon-su) and then goes to the bathroom to wash her face. Su-kyoung admires her face for a second before she sees her face shredded in the reflection. She screams and runs from Hyeon-su's house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off in the}} future( [...] 25 March 2063 [...] ), a grandma is passing away, her family {{surrounding}} her.

"Well, you and I will go there, and we'll {{get some}} of the big monkeys, and you will make them small--just three inches high--by means of your magic, and we'll put the little monkeys all in a basket and bring them home with us.

40|$|One curious feature {{about the}} debate on {{globalization}} is that those who favor it see no negative fallout from globalization and those who oppose it <b>see</b> <b>no</b> silver lining. <b>One</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> what lies behind this polarization.
