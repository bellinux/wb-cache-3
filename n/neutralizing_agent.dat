40|$|Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{environmental}} impacts caused by mining. Thus, innovative mitigation strategies should be exploited, to neutralize acidity and prevent mobilization of trace elements in AMD. The use of industrial byproducts has been considered an economically and environmentally effective alternative to remediate acid mine drainage. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of steel slag to mitigate acid mine drainage in a sulfidic material from a uranium mine, as an alternative to the use of limestone. Thus, increasing doses of two <b>neutralizing</b> <b>agents</b> were applied to a sulfidic material from the uranium mine Osamu Utsumi in Caldas, Minas Gerais State. A steel slag from the company ArcelorMittal Tubarão and a commercial limestone were used as <b>neutralizing</b> <b>agents.</b> The experiment was conducted in leaching columns, arranged in a completely randomized, &# 91;(2 x 3) + 1 &# 93; factorial design, consisting of two <b>neutralizing</b> <b>agents,</b> three doses and one control, in three replications, totaling 21 experimental units. Electrical conductivity (EC), pH and the concentrations of Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, S, Se, and Zn were evaluated in the leached solutions. The trace element concentration was evaluated by ICP-OES. Furthermore, the CO 2 emission was measured at the top of the leaching columns by capturing in NaOH solution and titration with HCl, in the presence of BaCl 2. An increase in the pH of the leachate was observed for both <b>neutralizing</b> <b>agents,</b> with slightly higher values for steel slag. The EC was lower at the higher lime dose at an early stage of the experiment, and CO 2 emission was greater with the use of limestone compared to steel slag. A decrease in trace element mobilization in the presence of both <b>neutralizing</b> <b>agents</b> was also observed. Therefore, the results showed that the use of steel slag is a suitable alternative to mitigate AMD, with the advantage of reducing CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere compared to limestone...|$|R

METHODS: Magnetically sorted peripheral blood memory B cells from 15 healthy subjects were cocultured with RASFib. RESULTS: RASFib constitutively expressed membrane IL- 15. Survival of isolated B cells cultured for 6 days, below 5 %, was extended in coculture with RASFib to 52 +/- 8 % (p< 0. 001). IL- 15 <b>neutralizing</b> <b>agents</b> but not isotype controls, reduced this rate to 31 +/- 6 % (p< 0. 05). Interestingly, rhIL- 15 had no effect on isolated B cells but significantly increased their survival in coculture with RASFib. In parallel, B cell IL- 15 R chains were upregulated in cocultures. BAFF and VCAM- 1, that are expressed on RASFib, were tested as potential candidates involved in upregulating B cell IL- 15 R. Culture of B cells in the presence of rhBAFF or rhVCAM- 1 resulted in significantly increased survival, together with upregulation of all three IL- 15 R chains; in parallel, rhIL- 15 potentiated the anti-apoptotic effect of BAFF and VCAM- 1. Both BAFF and VCAM- 1 <b>neutralizing</b> <b>agents</b> downmodulated the effect of RASFib on B cell survival and IL- 15 R expression. In parallel, rhIL- 15 had a lower effect on the survival of B cells cocultured with RASFib in the presence of BAFF or VCAM- 1 <b>neutralizing</b> <b>agents.</b> Peripheral blood B cells from 15 early RA patients demonstrated an upregulated IL- 15 R and increased survival in cocultures.

The effects of pH, temperature, seed addition, types of neutralizing agents (i. e.
