5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> hinge. The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
5|$|From Beckford's {{house in}} Lansdown Crescent {{to the tower}} a series of {{interlinked}} gardens were laid out which became known as Beckford's Ride. <b>Nearest</b> <b>the</b> crescent was a terraced Italianate garden and then a plantation of conifers. Above the plantation was a quarry garden and dyke garden before entering a grotto tunnel under a track. The tunnel lead into the tower garden. Specialist planting included: Pinus arborea, Royal Fern (Osmunda regalis) and Cistus alpina. These were to encourage bird species including nightingales, linnets and thrushes. The old quarry {{was made into a}} walled garden with fruit and vegetables.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Mormon {{farmers from}} the Salt Lake area {{became the first}} people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region. In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City, Utah areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses. They prospected for mineral deposits, and {{diverted}} Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area Kolob—in Mormon scripture, the heavenly place <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> residence of God.|$|E

30|$|Other endwall suction schemes {{minimally}} {{influence the}} distribution of exit flow angles. The variations are mainly <b>near</b> <b>the</b> endwall. The overturning of flow angles <b>near</b> <b>the</b> endwall decreases because these endwall suction schemes decrease the cross-passage pressure gradient <b>near</b> <b>the</b> end wall, especially between the suction surface and the suction slot. ESB increases the exit flow angles <b>near</b> <b>the</b> endwall most.|$|R
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
5|$|On Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, {{units of}} the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army seized several {{prominent}} buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the General Post Office (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> Pillar. They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government. One of the first recorded actions of the Easter Rising occurred near the Pillar when lancers from the nearby Marlborough Street barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired on from the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead.|$|E

5|$|Prior to restoration, {{of all the}} {{paintings}} in the Sistine Chapel, the lunettes and spandrels were the dirtiest. Added to this, {{there has always been}} a problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> windows because of halination. Consequently, they were the least well known of all Michelangelo's publicly accessible works. The recent restoration has made these masterly studies of human nature and inventive depiction of the human form known once more.|$|E
5|$|The ground floor, {{accessed}} {{directly from}} the outside courtyard, led into a portcullis-protected, vaulted passage, eleven feet wide and extending {{the depth of the}} building. On either side of the passage were two vaulted rooms. The room <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> entrance on the right was a guardroom or the porter's room, which housed a well; the back-right room, with a garderobe located in the south west turret (accessed via a passage running along the south wall), was for an official. The other two rooms to the left were used to house staff or storage.|$|E

5|$|A white dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass {{is comparable to}} that of the Sun, while its volume is {{comparable to that of}} Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E
5|$|According to Home Office statistics, an {{estimated}} 400businesses within {{half a mile}} (0.8km) of the blast were affected, 40% of which did not recover. The heaviest damage was sustained by the three buildings <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> bomb: Michael House, comprising a Marks & Spencer store and a six-storey office block; Longridge House, offices for Royal and Sun Alliance, an insurance company; and the Arndale Centre, a shopping mall. Michael House was deemed beyond economic repair and demolished. Marks & Spencer {{took the opportunity to}} acquire and demolish the adjacent Longridge House, using the enlarged site for the world's biggest branch of the store. The company's fortunes changed during construction, and Selfridges subsequently co-occupied the building; Marks & Spencer leased part of the Lewis's store in the interim. The frontage of the Arndale was badly damaged and was removed in a remodelling of that part of the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid shrimps Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon cockle, the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little whirlpool ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the Pogonus species, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E

5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when {{relative}} humidity approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} be relatively inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray zone of the Falls. However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
5|$|Later in 227 BC, Cleomenes bribed the ephors {{to allow}} him to {{continue}} his campaign against the Achaeans. Having succeeded with his bribe, Cleomenes advanced into the territory of Megalopolis and captured the village of Leuctra. In response, an Achaean army arrived, relieved the city and inflicted a minor defeat on the Spartan army based <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> city walls. Cleomenes was therefore obliged to retreat with his troops across a series of ravines. Aratus ordered the Achaeans not to pursue the Spartans across the ravine, but Lydiadas of Megalopolis disobeyed the order and charged with the cavalry in pursuit of the Spartans. Taking advantage of the difficult terrain and the scattered cavalry, Cleomenes sent his Cretan and Tarentine soldiers against Lydiadas. They routed the cavalry, and Lydiadas was amongst the dead. The Spartans, encouraged by these events, charged against the main Achaean forces and defeated the entire army. The Achaeans were so outraged and demoralized by Aratus' failure to support Lydiadas that they made no further attacks in that year.|$|E
5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> tip is orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.|$|E
