5|$|Bulgaria is {{a country}} in southeastern Europe {{situated}} entirely in the Balkan peninsula. Bulgaria is inhabited by 20 amphibian species, which makes the amphibians the least diverse class of vertebrates in the country. They include seven species of <b>newts</b> <b>and</b> <b>salamanders</b> from a single family, Salamandridae, as well as 13 frog and toad species from five families—Bombinatoridae, Bufonidae, Hylidae, Pelobatidae and Ranidae. The most recently classified species are the northern crested newt, identified in 2005, and the Macedonian crested newt, identified in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In <b>newts</b> <b>and</b> <b>salamanders,</b> {{metamorphosis}} is {{less dramatic}} than in frogs. This {{is because the}} larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land. Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, prolactin is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{at least}} half the prey biomass is made up from small rodents from the Cricetidae (voles, lemmings) and Murinae (Eurasian mice and {{sometimes}} young Eurasian rats). Shrews, songbirds, lizards, and frogs and toads (typically as tadpoles) make up most of the remaining vertebrate prey. Birds are generally of little importance however, except in spring when male songbirds are engaged in courtship display and often rather oblivious of their surroundings, in late summer when inexperienced fledglings abound, and in winter when most small mammals hibernate. Occasionally bats, <b>newts</b> <b>and</b> <b>salamanders,</b> and even fish are eaten. Prey animals may exceptionally be almost as large as the birds themselves, for example chicks of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) or a young stoat. Large arthropods are the second-most important prey by quantity, though not by biomass; in the latter respect they are only a bit more important than birds, except as food for nestlings where they usually form a substantial part of the diet. Most important among invertebrate prey are insects, especially beetles, crickets and grasshoppers, and bumblebees and wasps. Invertebrate prey of minor importance are spiders and scorpions, crayfish and isopods, snails, and oligochaete worms. Carrion and berries are rarely if ever eaten; though it might occasionally plunder songbird nests this is not well documented and it is not known to eat eggs.|$|E

40|$|Muse {{cells are}} a novel {{population}} of nontumorigenic pluripotent stem cells, highly resistant to cellular stress. These cells {{are present in}} every connective tissue and intrinsically express pluripotent stem markers such as Nanog, Oct 3 / 4, Sox 2, and TRA 1 - 60. Muse cells are able to differentiate into cells from all three embryonic germ layers both spontaneously and under media-specific induction. Unlike ESCs and iPSCs, Muse cells exhibit low telomerase activity and asymmetric division and do not undergo tumorigenesis or teratoma formation when transplanted into a host organism. Muse cells have a high capacity for homing into damaged tissue and spontaneous differentiation into cells of compatible tissue, leading to tissue repair and functional restoration. The ability of Muse cells to restore tissue function may demonstrate the role of Muse cells in a highly conserved cellular mechanism related to cell survival and regeneration, in response to cellular stress and acute injury. From an evolutionary standpoint, genes pertaining to the regenerative capacity of an organism have been lost in higher mammals from more primitive species. Therefore, Muse cells may offer insight into the molecular and evolutionary bases of autonomous tissue regeneration and elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that prevent mammals from regenerating limbs and organs, as planarians, <b>newts,</b> zebrafish, <b>and</b> <b>salamanders</b> do...|$|R
50|$|These larvae {{are used}} {{extensively}} as live food for terrarium pets and some pet birds, mostly {{due to their}} high fat content, their ease of breeding, {{and their ability to}} survive for weeks at low temperatures. Most commonly, they are used to feed reptiles such as bearded dragons (species in the genus Pogona), the neon tree dragon (Japalura splendida), geckos, brown anole (Anolis sagrei), turtles such as the three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis), and chameleons. They can also be fed to amphibians such as Ceratophrys frogs, newts such as the Strauch's spotted <b>newt</b> (Neurergus strauchii), <b>and</b> <b>salamanders</b> such as axolotls. Small mammals such as the domesticated hedgehog can also be fed with waxworms, while birds such as the greater honeyguide can also appreciate the food. They can also be used as food for captive predatory insects reared in terrarium, such as assassin bugs in the genus Platymeris, and are also occasionally used to feed certain kinds of fish in the wild, such as bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus).|$|R

5000|$|Loss of {{the eastern}} and Carolina hemlock from hemlock woolly adlegid {{infestation}} will likely result in many ecological shifts in eastern North America. The understory of hemlock forests is characterized as dark, damp, and cool and is an ideal habitat to various other organisms. [...] The moist environment is preferred by many native amphibian species, particularly <b>newts</b> <b>and</b> <b>salamanders.</b> [...] Some species of birds have close association with the hemlock, especially during mating and nesting periods. [...] Aquatic systems adjunct to hemlock stands are also impacted by the trees' decline. Brook trout is a native fish species to the eastern United States and is known to prefer the cool, shaded streams of hemlock forests during spawning events. [...] Vulnerable animal populations are expected to diminish {{as a result of}} loss of hemlock habitat to the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{characteristics}} from fossil {{evidence of}} Doleserpeton {{indicate that they}} resembled modern <b>newts</b> <b>and</b> <b>salamanders.</b> The overall size of Doleserpeton was relatively small in size, with an estimated body length of 55 mm(2.165 inches) from snout to tail. Morphological features of Doleserpeton {{indicated that they were}} quadrupedal with elongate bodies and a lizard-like appearance. Their overall body morphology included short limbs protruding from a 90 degree angle, long tails, and flattened skulls with blunt snouts. Doleserpeton may have had smooth, grandular skin to adapt to the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments. Fossil evidence and classification of Doleserpeton predicted that they transitioned through metamorphic stages throughout their life, but lived primarily on terrestrial land during juvenile and adult stages. Like their modern amphibious relatives Lissamphibia, Doleserpeton may have had to rely on the availability of a nearby water source during reproduction and larval stages.|$|E

50|$|Benedict Canyon is {{also part}} of the Pacific Flyway. As a result, the {{resident}} Southern California bird species often share company with neo-tropical migrants and other unique species, such as Canadian geese. There are over eighteen species of snakes and eight species of lizards. The most common snakes are pacific rattlesnake, gopher snake, California king snake, and California striped racer. The rattlesnake is the only venomous snake in California. They seek shade during the hottest summer afternoons and hibernate during the winter. The zone supports five species of frogs, three species of toads, and five species of <b>newts</b> <b>and</b> <b>salamanders.</b> As {{in most parts of the}} world, frog populations have declined, probably due to climate change and pollution. The widely scattered perennial streams still support unique populations of native fish. Topanga and Malibu Creeks contain tidewater gobies, arroyo chub, and the endangered Southern California Distinct Population Segment of steelhead. The Santa Clara River supports these species as well as the federally listed endangered, unarmored three spine stickleback.
