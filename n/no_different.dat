5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it should be considered valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E

5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He argues {{that there is a}} duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially <b>no</b> <b>different</b> to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E
5|$|Hume criticised {{the view}} that we cannot speak about God, and {{proposed}} that this view is <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from the skeptical view that God cannot be spoken about. He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, the Dominion is {{invaded by}} the United Earth Directorate and Mengsk {{narrowly}} escapes capture with the reluctant help of Raynor. Faced with execution {{and the destruction}} of the Dominion as alternatives, Mengsk allies with Kerrigan and Raynor to defeat the UED, but Kerrigan eventually betrays their alliance and delivers a crippling blow to Mengsk's forces. Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the Dominion remains the dominant Terran power. In Frontline, many of the stories in the anthology paint Mengsk and the Dominion overall as tyrannical and corrupt, <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from the Confederacy.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the first}} half was {{dominated}} by both defenses, the second was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> with both Alabama and LSU only managing a pair of field goals. Alabama's came in the third on a 46-yard Cade Foster score and LSU's came in the fourth on a 30-yard Alleman score. In the overtime period, Foster missed a 52-yard field goal attempt and Alleman connected on a 25-yard attempt to give the Tigers the 9–6 victory. Both defenses held each offense to less than 300 yards of total offense with each having a pair of interceptions. With the loss, Alabama dropped to 4–8 all-time in overtime games and brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 45–25–5.|$|E
5|$|King {{argues that}} enslaved {{children}} {{did not have the}} opportunities for childhood and thus, did not have childhoods. Slave children instead worked as soon as they could, were often separated from caregivers and family, and were subject to punishment of many sorts, sometimes <b>no</b> <b>different</b> than those levied on adults. The children's trauma was compared to that of war—enduring abuses, sexual exploitation, inability to protect themselves—and they aged prematurely through these experiences.|$|E
5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a direct connection, {{arguing that it}} would be <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from a typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely to}} exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E

5|$|The actors {{began working}} on the game in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they considered their performances were <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from those of film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted so {{that it did not}} allow the actors to ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with approval from the directors.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand was <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> Oddly housing was built {{right into the}} stand itself (as shown on old {{photographs}} of Goodison and in programmes). The club had previously owned many of the houses {{on the road and}} rented them to players. One of the players to live there, Dixie Dean later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} Cameroon contain {{some of the}} highest {{population}} density of forest elephants of any nation, and Nki is <b>no</b> <b>different,</b> with an elephant density of roughly 2.5 per square kilometer for Boumba Bek and Nki combined. The population has been steadily rising, from 1,547 in 1998 to 3,000 in 2006. Gorillas are also reported to abundant; there are an estimated 6,000 adults in Nki. The park is also home to diurnal primates, such as the threatened crested monkey, De Brazza monkey, and the black colobus, who reportedly only live east of the Dja River.|$|E

5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike {{anywhere else in the}} archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from those lower down. The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, clubmosses and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He finds that the people, under the guidance of missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the babirusa (pig-deer) and the rare sapiutan (midget buffalo).|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the 2005–06 season there were some roster changes. Two of the team's top players, Song Dong-hwan and Jang Jong-moon, had to report for compulsory military service. Starting goaltender, Kim Sung-Bae, retired after the previous season. Even though they were missing these players they were noted for having more players with more than 10 goals and 10 assists than in the previous season. With the departure of Song offensive output dropped slightly, the team's top offensive player finished 7th overall in goals with 21. However Martinec won the assists race with 53 and the overall points total with 71. The team shared top spot in the short-handed goals with 2 other teams, scoring 10 {{over the course of the}} season. With a further shortened season of only 34 games the team finished in 5th place and faced the other Korean team, Kangwon Land in the quarter finals. During the regular season Kangwon won 6 of 7 meetings, and the quarter finals were <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> Kangwon swept Halla in 3 games, the final game ending in 3–2 with a last minute desperate bid by Halla to tie the game.|$|E
5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame that {{surrounds}} the 11th New York is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> than many regiments, North and South.|$|E

5|$|Homophile organizations—as {{homosexual}} {{groups were}} called—grew {{in number and}} spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. Frank Kameny founded the Mattachine of Washington, D.C. He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at mental health professionals, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal. In 1965, Kameny, inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, organized a picket of the White House and other government buildings to protest employment discrimination. The pickets shocked many gay people, and upset some of the leadership of Mattachine and the DOB. At the same time, demonstrations in the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War all grew in prominence, frequency, and severity throughout the 1960s, as did their confrontations with police forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Congress {{passed the}} Line Item Veto Act, which allowed the {{president}} to cancel items from an appropriations bill (a bill authorizing spending) once passed into law. The statute was challenged the following year. The matter rapidly reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law as violating the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which governs {{what the president is}} permitted to do with a bill once it has passed both houses of Congress. Scalia dissented, seeing no Presentment Clause difficulties and feeling that the act did not violate separation of powers. Scalia indicated he felt that authorizing {{the president to}} cancel an appropriation was <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from allowing him to spend an appropriation at his discretion, which had long been accepted as constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose was <b>no</b> <b>different,</b> with some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had been expelled returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation of teaching in the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E
