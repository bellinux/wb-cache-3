30|$|Exploring {{materials}} on, {{with and}} through the body in context can allow meaning to emerge directly from interaction with the material if one remains open to the unexpected, looking to perceived “missteps” as inspiration. This approach can allow designers to design for the senses from the senses, opening the door for multisensory interactive qualities and complex interrelations between the senses. In the presented cases, in the shift from iteration 1 to 2, Open Up (which neither used the body nor context to frame the design process) lost its relation to the body entirely, shifting the focus from feeling the air around the wearer to reliance on a sensor that measured proximity to others to activate the <b>nets.</b> <b>Sound</b> Embracers (which used the body’s engagement with materials, not the context, to frame the design process) switched the focus from the touch of the fingers, to the space the knitted collar created between the arms and the body as it is stretched.

This thesis report on work that {{has been carried out}} to investigate normal incidence sound absorption coefficient, (Î±n) characteristics of wood circular perforated panel (WCPP) using Boundary Element Method. The perforation ratios investigated are 20 %, 30 % and 40 %. The panel perforation ratio is ranging in number of apertures, diameter, and distance between apertures.

40|$|Wood Perforated Panels (WPP) {{has been}} used as part of wall {{partition}} of an enclosed room particularly in mosques. Wood Circular Perforated Panels (WCPP) is the simplest form of WPP. Due to non-existence of reliable normal incidence sound absorption coefficient (n ï?¡) for WCPP, the consideration of WCPP as a sound absorption material cannot be ignored. It is believe that the WCPP can act as sound absorption material as it has inherent capability to allow sound waves to pass through easily. This research investigate the normal incidence sound absorption coefficient (n ï?¡) of WCPP due to resonance frequencies using numerical modelling technique. The numerical experiments are conducted using Boundary Element Method (BEM) since it is a powerful computational method. It is among the most recent tool and providing numerical solutions for Acoustic Engineering design. The complexity of the design and simulation of WCPP is then resolved using quarter modelling technique. The perforation ratios investigated are 30 % and 40 %. The aperture creation begins with the calculation of aperture dimension. This dimension was calculated to resonate at 1 kHz, 2 kHz and 4 kHz with n = 1, 2 and 3. Then it is followed by modeling and compilation process for room with WCPP and empty room. n ï?¡ of WCPP due to resonance frequencies was calculated by dividing <b>net</b> <b>sound</b> intensity value in front of the circular panel with incident sound intensity obtained in empty room. From the numerical simulation result, it was found that n ï?¡ from 250 Hz to 500 Hz is mainly due to mass transfer. Whereas, from 2 kHz to 4 kHz, the n ï?¡ are contributed by its resonance frequency. At 1 kHz, it is shown that n ï?¡ value is in the transition state, between mass transfer and resonance frequency effect. The electroacoustics calculation of R,L,C of WCPP at 30 % and 40 % perforation ratio also shown that the RLC values are reasonably small and shall not affect to the n ï?¡ significantly...|$|R

Especially dependencies between events are not modeled adequately which can result in misinterpretations with risk assessment. In this article a model for risk assessment using the theory of Bayesian Networks is presented. The risk model is relatively easy to generate. First of all, the relevant potential failure events and their interactions have to be determined. Afterwards the frequencies of occurrence of the respective failures as well as the strength of the failure relations, i. e. how certain does a failure cause result in a specific failure effect, have to be specified.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the notion of}} AND-OR reduction, which reduces a WF net to a smaller net by iteratively contracting certain well-formed subnets into single nodes until no more such contractions are possible. This reduction can reveal the hierarchical structure of a WF net, and since it preserves certain semantical properties such as soundness, it can help with analysing and understanding why a WF <b>net</b> is <b>sound</b> or not. The reduction {{can also be used}} to verify if a WF net is an AND-OR net. This class of WF nets was introduced in earlier work, and arguably describes nets that follow good hierarchical design principles. It is shown that the AND-OR reduction is confluent up to isomorphism, which means that despite the inherent non-determinism that comes from the choice of subnets that are contracted, the final result of the reduction is always the same up to the choice of the identity of the nodes. Based on this result, a polynomial-time algorithm is presented that computes this unique result of the AND-OR reduction. Finally, it is shown how this algorithm can be used to verify if a WF net is an AND-OR net...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Business {{processes}} play {{a central}} role in the reorganization of a company and the (re) design of the respective information system(s). Typically the processes are described with the help of a semiformal, graphical language such as the Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs) by Scheer. This approach provides a suitable medium for the communication between the participants: the domain experts and the IT specialists. But these models leave room for interpretation and hence ambiguities which makes them less suitable as a basis for the design of information systems. To remedy this we suggest to transform the EPCs into a formal representation (Petri nets) preserving the ambiguities, i. e. all possibly intended behaviour. Now formal techniques can be used to find out whether the possible behaviours comprise sensible behaviour. If so, we call the <b>net</b> relaxed <b>sound.</b> By not limiting the modeler compared to previous ways (e. g. [8], [3]) we take a pragmatic approach to correctness which only requires that the net represents some valid behaviour. This allows us to draw conclusions on mistakes in the original EPC and to make suggestions for its improvement thereby enhancing both the model’s quality and its suitability for software engineering. ...|$|R

40|$|Each year, ringers using sound lures {{mark and}} {{recapture}} immature Storm Petrels Hydrobates pelagicus prospecting potential breeding colonies. Attempts {{have been made}} to estimate the size of this population, but a full demographic model has not been possible since the age structure of this population has not been determined. To address this, between 1990 and 2004, 799 Storm Petrel chicks were ringed at the breeding colony on the Island of Mousa, Shetland, to establish a sample of marked known-age birds. There were 39 subsequent recaptures of these individuals, mainly by using sound lures at sites away from breeding colonies. Only one recapture related to a first-year bird: the largest cohort was of second-year birds and the relative frequencies of third-year and fourth-year cohorts progressively diminished as birds entered the breeding population and ceased responding to sound lures. These data provide demographic information to facilitate the construction of population models. Given the difficulty in determining the size of breeding populations of Storm Petrels and in long-term annual monitoring of breeding productivity, there may be considerable conservation benefit from ringing and recapture of Storm Petrels each year to monitor the size of the pre-breeding population. The ringing of adult Storm Petrels Hydrobates pelagicus at colonies has been undertaken since the 1950 s at many sites throughout northern Britain (Mainwood 1976).
