2500|$|During a {{moose test}} (swerving {{to avoid an}} obstacle), which became famous in Germany as [...] "the elk test", the Swedish {{journalist}} Robert Collin of Teknikens Värld (World of Technology) in October 1997 rolled a Mercedes A-Class (without ESC) at 78km/h. Because Mercedes-Benz promotes a reputation for safety, they recalled and retrofitted 130,000 A-Class cars with ESC. This produced {{a significant reduction in}} crashes and the number of vehicles with ESC rose. Today, virtually all premium brands have made ESC standard on all vehicles, and the number of models with ESC continues to increase. The availability of ESC in small cars like the A-Class ignited a market trend thus ESC became available for all models at least as an option. Consequently, the European Union decided in 2009 to make ESC mandatory. [...] Since November 1, 2011, EU Type Approval is only granted to models equipped with ESC. By November 1, 2014, ESC is required on all <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> <b>cars</b> in the EU.|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{empirical}} evaluation of the German Accelerated Vehicle Retirement program, that was implemented in January 2009 to stimulate automobile consumption. In order to adress this question a unique monthly dataset of new car registrations owned by private consumers from March 2001 until October 2011 is created. Especially small and upper small car segments seem to have profited from the scrappage program as they make up 84 % of the <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> <b>cars</b> during the program. Using uni- and multivariate time-series models counterfactual car registrations are estimated for vehicles from the small and upper small car segment. Results suggest that the policy has been successful in creating additional demand for new cars during the policy period. We also find a small contraction in the year {{after the end of the}} policy for the small market segment. For upper small cars the pull-forward could only be identified for the last quarter of the ex-post period. So in summary, the overall effect of the German car scrappage program is positive for the two market segments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{trends in}} the technological profile of the Austrian personnel vehicle fleet from 1990 to 2007. This includes the parameters of power, engine size and weight, which beyond the technological efficiency of the motor engine itself, {{are considered to be}} the main determinants of the fuel efficiency of the average car stock. Investigating the drivers of ever rising transport related greenhouse gas emissions is crucial in order to derive policies that strive towards more energy-efficient on-road passenger mobility. We focus on the efficacy of technological efficiency improvements in mitigating climate-relevant emissions from car use in light of shifting demand patterns towards bigger, heavier and more powerful cars. The analysis is descriptive in nature and based on a bottom-up database that was originally collated for {{the purpose of the present}} study. Technological data on car models, which includes tested fuel consumption, engine size, power and weight, is related to <b>registered</b> <b>car</b> stock and, in parts, to <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> <b>cars.</b> From this, we obtain an original database of the Austrian passenger car fleet, i. e. information on consumer choice of specific car models, segregated by gasoline and diesel fuelled engines. Conclusions are derived for policies aimed at reducing the fossil fuel consumption of the moving vehicle fleet in order to contribute to a low carbon society.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the cost of rear-end collisions in Denmark, and to define the potential financial benefits of a high, center-mounted auxiliary brake light for automobiles. The study was limited to passenger cars struck from behind. The annual cost of two different preventive programs involving auxiliary brake lights was compared to the annual cost of the accidents expected to be prevented in each program. The finding was that rear-end collisions cost on average over 13, 700 1980 Danish kroner (approx. US$ 2300), 70 % of which was property damage. There are so many rear-end collisions that even if the new brake-light configuration were only one-third as effective in Denmark as it has been in U. S. field trials the mounting of required auxiliary lights would be a sound investment. Substantial savings would be anticipated whether the auxiliary brake lights were required on all passenger cars as of a particular date, or only on <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> passenger <b>cars,</b> although the former preventive program is preferable by usual cost benefit criteria.

40|$|A core {{political}} strategy for reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} from road transportation in Germany is to incentivize the purchase of motor vehicles with relatively low tailpipe CO 2 emissions. Consequently, since mid- 2009, owners of new cars in Germany face an annual vehicle circulation tax that is partially levied according to vehicles' CO 2 emission index. In this paper, I estimate the effect of CO 2 -based vehicle circulation taxation in Germany on annual CO 2 combustion emissions from passenger cars and CO 2 climate costs using a nested logit approach on a novel panel-dataset containing registration, cost and vehicle characteristic information on approximately 7, 000 unique vehicle models and approximately 19. 5 million new vehicle registrations in Germany from 2007 to 2013. This approach first yields vehicle model specific estimates for the elasticity of new vehicle registrations {{with regard to the}} circulation tax. These elasticities are used to estimate changes in new vehicle registrations by model, which are then combined with model-specific CO 2 emission factors and segment-specific annual distances driven to yield total emission changes attributable to the change in vehicle circulation tax. Finally, physical changes in emissions are converted into changes in monetary climate damages. Uncertainty in the elasticity of new vehicle registrations by segment with regard to vehicle circulation tax, the fuel economy and corresponding CO 2 emission indices of vehicles, distances traveled by market segment, and in the monetary damages resulting from CO 2 emissions are propagated through the analysis. Overall I find statistically significant, but relatively small reductions in CO 2 emissions and climate costs due to the change in taxation: When simulating the ceteris paribus effect of the most stringent taxation regime implemented in 2014 on the pre-tax change models available in 2008, median registrations are estimated to decrease by approx. 9, 500 vehicles, or 0. 3 per cent of total new registrations. In addition, changes in registrations of individual vehicle models within each market segment lead to a relatively small reduction of segment- specific CO 2 emission indices (0. 03 to 0. 1 per cent across segments). The reduction in new registrations and reduction in CO 2 emission indices decrease median CO 2 combustion emissions from <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> vehicles by 35, 000 t (90 per cent confidence interval: 31. 000 to 39. 000 t), and climate costs by 2 ̆ 0 ac 1. 1 Million (90 per cent confidence interval: 2 ̆ 0 ac 0. 1 to 2. 2 Million), or 0. 4 per cent of total CO 2 emissions and climate costs from <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> <b>cars...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dhaka, {{the capital}} city of Bangladesh and the home of more than 15 million people, is {{subjected}} to severe traffic congestion on a regular basis resulting in lost productivity, fuel wastage, commuter frustration and environmental degradation. The problem is getting more acute day by day due to alarming increase in car usage. According to Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the number of <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> private <b>cars</b> per year in the city has more than quadrupled between 2004 and 2015. Congestion pricing schemes, which have been successful {{in many parts of the}} world, have a good potential to minimize the number of cars on the roads and reduce traffic congestion in Dhaka. This paper investigates the potential response to congestion pricing in Dhaka using Stated Preference (SP) surveys where users are presented with hypothetical choice scenarios involving varying amounts of congestion charges and travel time savings alongside improved public transport options. Two case studies have been conducted in this regard focusing on shopping and work trips respectively. Discrete choice models have been developed to model the sensitivity towards congestion pricing and to quantify the potential effectiveness of this measure in different trip contexts. Results indicate that car users, especially those having lower incomes (less than 50, 000 BDT/month), have significant sensitivity towards congestion charge and have a substantial chance of shifting to improved public transport and/or park-and-ride facilities. The findings of the study can help in formulating effective congestion reduction policies in Dhaka...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and problem}} discussion: Since {{the law of}} audit {{exemption}} was introduced 2010, some companies have appointed an auditor voluntarily. These companies must balance {{the costs and benefits}} of auditing; various indicators affect the decision. In addition, the characteristics and needs of <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> companies and mature companies differ. These determinants can affect the decision to choose an auditor. Purpose: The main purpose of this report is to investigate if there is a difference in to what extent small <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> limited companies in comparison with small mature limited companies choose to appoint an auditor voluntarily and which determinants affect <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> limited companies’ respectively mature limited companies’ decision to appoint an auditor voluntarily. Limitations: This bachelor thesis is only investigating Swedish private limited companies, small enough to be included by the Swedish voluntary audit requirements. The selections are limited to two specific groups of enterprises that presented a financial statement 31 st of December 2011. <b>Newly</b> <b>registered</b> companies are limited to those companies registered during 2011 respectively mature companies registered before 1993. Method: The empirical data was assembled through a quantitative document study and tested via hypotheses. The hypotheses were rejected or confirmed. Conclusions: We can conclude that there is a greater proportion of small <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> companies that appoint an auditor and that the determinants differ in relation to small mature limited companies. The <b>newly</b> <b>registered</b> companies are affected by total assets and solidity and if the company belonged to the retail industry and health care industry whereas the determinants of mature companies were solely the two industries of construction, design and interior design respectively hotels and restaurants. Proposal for future studies: It would be interesting to investigate other type of businesses’ attitude towards the voluntary audit or to conduct a qualitative survey equivalent to this study. Another possibility would be to investigate companies’ included in the statutory law of Personalliggare attitude towards voluntary audit...|$|R
