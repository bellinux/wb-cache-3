25|$|A linear {{amplifier}} responds to different frequency components independently, {{and does not}} generate harmonic distortion or intermodulation distortion. No amplifier can provide perfect linearity (even the most {{linear amplifier}} has some <b>nonlinearities,</b> since the amplifying devices—transistors or vacuum tubes—follow nonlinear power laws such as square-laws and rely on circuitry techniques to reduce those effects).|$|E

25|$|It is now {{possible}} to use computers to search for routes using the <b>nonlinearities</b> in {{the gravity of the}} planets and moons of the Solar System.

Collectively referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network, these highly perturbative, even chaotic, orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the Lagrange point (in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections). The biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow, taking many years. In addition launch windows can be very far apart.|$|E

Four-segment polynomial approximations are investigated for the nonlinear part of the Wiener systems and are shown to perform better than global and two-segment approximations. A special type of polynomial expression is also proposed that makes the analytical inverse of the <b>nonlinearity</b> possible.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} features of any VECSEL is the small thickness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100nm. In contrast, a conventional in-plane semiconductor laser entails light propagation over distances of from 250µm upward to 2mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it causes the effect of [...] "antiguiding" [...] <b>nonlinearities</b> in the diode laser gain region to be minimized. The result is a large-cross-section single-mode optical beam which is not attainable from in-plane ("edge-emitting") diode lasers.|$|E
2500|$|The upper {{arguments}} were valid {{up to the}} late 1990s. However, recent advances in numerical computing have shown a come back of the force method, {{especially in the case}} of nonlinear systems. New frameworks have been developed that allow [...] "exact" [...] formulations irrespectively of the type or nature of the system <b>nonlinearities.</b> The main advantages of the flexibility method is that the result error is independent of the discretization of the model and that it is indeed a very fast method. For instance, the elastic-plastic solution of a continuous beam using the force method requires only 4 beam elements whereas a commercial [...] "stiffness based" [...] FEM code requires 500 elements in order to give results with the same accuracy. To conclude, one can say that in the case where the solution of the problem requires recursive evaluations of the force field like in the case of structural optimization or system identification, the efficiency of the flexibility method is indisputable.|$|E
