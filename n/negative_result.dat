5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals for communication. Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel Telescope {{to search for}} such signals from the nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same <b>negative</b> <b>result.</b> Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E
5|$|Gourcuff {{made his}} debut for the under-21 team on 18 May 2006 in a preparatory {{friendly}} {{match for the}} 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship against Croatia. In the tournament, Gourcuff was the team's lone underage player and played in {{all four of the}} team's matches as France reached the semi-finals losing in extra time to the Netherlands. On 5 September 2006, Gourcuff scored his first under-21 goal in a 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification match against Slovenia. France, however, failed to qualify for the tournament. On 27 March 2007, Gourcuff captained the under-21 team {{for the first time in}} a 1–0 defeat to Norway. Due to injury, he missed the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs against Germany. France lost the tie 2–1 on aggregate. The <b>negative</b> <b>result</b> ended Gourcuff's under-21 career.|$|E
50|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>results</b> {{are more}} reliable. Statistical power of 0.8 {{produces}} 875 <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> of which only 20 are false, giving an accuracy of over 97%. <b>Negative</b> <b>results</b> however {{account for a}} minority of published results, varying by discipline. A study of 4,600 papers found {{that the proportion of}} published <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> dropped from 30% to 14% between 1990 and 2007.|$|R
40|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>results</b> are {{not popular}} to disseminate. However, their {{publication}} {{would help to}} save resources and foster scientific communication. This study analysed the bibliometric and semantic nature of <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> publications. The Journal of <b>Negative</b> <b>Results</b> in Biomedicine (JNRBM) {{was used as a}} role model. Its complete articles from 2002 - 2009 were extracted from SCOPUS and supplemented by related records. Complementary <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> records were retrieved from Web of Science in “Biochemistry” and “Telecommunications”. Applied bibliometrics comprised of co-author and co-affiliation analysis and a citation impact profile. Bibliometrics showed that authorship is widely spread. A specific community for the publication of <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> in devoted literature is non-existent. Neither co-author nor co-affiliation analysis indicated strong interconnectivities. JNRBM articles are cited by a broad spectrum of journals rather than by specific titles. Devoted <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> journals like JNRBM have a rather low impact measured by the number of received citations. On the other hand, only one third of the publications remain uncited, corroborating their importance for the scientific community. The semantic analysis relies on negative expressions manually identified in JNRBM article titles and abstracts and extracted to syntactic patterns. By using a Natural Language Processing tool these patterns are then employed to detect their occurrences in the multidisciplinary bibliographical database PASCAL. The translation of manually identified negation patterns to syntactic patterns and their application to multidisciplinary bibliographic databases (PASCAL, Web of Science) proved to be a successful method to retrieve even hidden <b>negative</b> <b>results.</b> There is proof that <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> are not only restricted to the biomedical domain. Interestingly a high percentage of the so far identified <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> papers were funded and therefore needed to be published. Thus policies that explicitly encourage or even mandate the publication of <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> could probably bring about a shift in the current scientific communication behaviour...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> {{arising from}} the use of a commercial kit to detect antibody to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 between July 1995 and March 1996. DESIGN: The 56 laboratories in the United Kingdom that were using the assay were asked to retrieve and retest specimens with an alternative assay for HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. Details of false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> were obtained and these serum samples further investigated. SUBJECTS: 24, 181 patients tested with the assay who were reported as being negative for HIV antibody. An additional 497 patients were confirmed as HIV positive with the assay. RESULTS: Serum samples of 20, 973 of the patients were retested, and four patients were found to have had false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> with the kit; three further patients were found to have had false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> in the course of other laboratory testing. The seven patients with false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> with the kit were of diverse risk group and HIV- 1 subtype. Four had evidence of recent HIV infection. CONCLUSION: The commercial kit had a sensitivity of 99. 2 % (497 / 501), or less if the additional three patients with false <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> were taken into account...|$|R
5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a <b>negative</b> <b>result</b> from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E

40|$|In an {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for {{detection of}} IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, sera from individuals with <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> in the Sabin-Feldman dye test (DT) and sera from individuals with chronic toxoplasma infection all yielded <b>negative.</b> <b>results,</b> even when tested undiluted.

Thus, the IgM-ELISA is more sensitive than the IgM-IFA test in the diagnosis of recently acquired infection with T. gondii. Moreover, sera that gave <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> in the DT but that contained either antinuclear antibodies or rheumatoid factor and thus caused false-positive results in the IgM-IFA test all yielded <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> in the IgM-ELISA, probably because serum IgM and IgO fractions were separated during the initial step.

40|$|Studies with {{positive}} results are greatly more represented in literature than studies with <b>negative</b> <b>results,</b> producing so-called publication bias. This review aims to discuss occurring problems around <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> and {{to emphasize the}} importance of reporting <b>negative</b> <b>results.</b> Underreporting of <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> introduces bias into meta-analysis, which consequently misinforms researchers, doctors and policymakers. More resources are potentially wasted on already disputed research that remains unpublished and therefore unavailable to the scientific community. Ethical obligations need to be considered when reporting results of studies on human subjects as people have exposed themselves to risk with the assurance that the study is performed to benefit others. Some studies disprove the common conception that journal editors preferably publish positive findings, which are considered as more citable. Therefore, all stakeholders, but especially researchers, need to be conscious of disseminating negative and positive findings alike...|$|R

However, articles with <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> may not provide sufficient information to allow physicians to properly assess validity.

Secondary outcomes were to quantify the proportion of these studies with a specified effect size and a defined primary outcome. Stratified analyses by study design were also performed. Results Only 30 % of the articles with <b>negative</b> <b>results</b> comment on power. The reporting of power (range: 15 %- 52 %) and confidence intervals (range: 55 – 81 %) varied significantly among journals.
