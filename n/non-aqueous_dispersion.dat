INTRODUCTI ON Polymer colloids are polymer particles, ranging in size from tens of Angstroms to tens of microns, dispersed in a liquid medium (Ref. 1). They comprise a broad spectrum of materials, with industrial applications primarily in the coatings field (inks, waxes, paints, toners). Some of these materials are quite complex, containing several different incompatible polymers (Ref. 2). Others are seemingly quite simple, such as the monodisperse polystyrene latexes, which one considers to be homogeneous isotropic plastic spheres. These systems have been studied extensively by electron microscopy. Nonetheless, very little is known of their morphology, particularly in multicomponent particles. Eve...|$|R

For many examples of these colloidal suspensions, the solvent is water, which hinders most electro-optic applications. Here, for goethite (α-FeOOH) nanorod dispersions, we show that water can be replaced by polar aprotic solvents, such as N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), without loss of colloidal stability.

40|$|Abstract: Microgels, or intramolecularly {{crosslinked}} macromolecules (ICMs), {{have been}} known {{for a number of}} years. They are formed during the polymerization of polyfunctional precursors en-route, but at incomplete reaction, to the macrogelation predicted by the theories of gelation initially propounded by Carothers and Flory. These gelation theories did not predict that such microgels made in solution could be prepared from such polyfunctional reactive solutions at complete reaction and high concentrations, without gelation. Microgels have been successfully and usefully prepared, however, at complete conversion of their contained reactive groups by the use of either aqueous or <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>dispersion</b> polymerization in which surface active agents are utilized to contain the polymerization to isolated submicron-size domains. The progression towards macrogelation is constrained to the maximum size of the dispersed domains. This paper demonstrates the contrasting general observation that macrogelation in solvents of such polyfunctional reactive precursors cannot occur below a Critical Gelation Concentration (CGC) if a carefully selected match of solvent solubility parameters for the polymerization solvent and the formed polymer is made. In some cases the addition of only ca. ten percent wlw of solvent is required to completely prevent macrogelation at complete conversion. In addition polymerization the molecular weight of the produced ICMs may be varied in a simple controllable manner from the low thousands (nanogels) to many millions (microgels) simply by the choice of concentration at which they are prepared. The products are a distinct form of polymer which is quite different to the linear analogue and almost certainly these solution-prepared products are different to the microgels formed by aqueous dispersion polymerization techniques. This new solution technique provides a simple and general new method for the ready synthesis and design of an enormous range of bespoke globular polymers having both fundamental academic interest and potential commercial utility...|$|E
40|$|<b>Non-aqueous</b> {{colloidal}} <b>dispersions</b> {{form the}} basis of many real-world applications, including electro-rheological fluids in automotive assemblies and inks in printing devices. The dispersion of particles within the non-aqueous liquid is typically stabilised by the use of dispersants, which adsorb to the particle/liquid interface and provide steric and/or electrical forces to prevent their aggregation. Importantly, the selection of the dispersant influences not only the inter-particle forces, but also their summation across many particles then defines the bulk properties of the suspension. Tailoring of these bulk properties is important in an industrial context, as each application will demand different bulk properties. In this study, the adsorption of three dispersants onto a polyester resin surface from a simple alkane is investigated. It is shown that the competition between the rates of adsorption from the bulk relative to that of the internal relocation of the functional groups of already adsorbed material defines the total adsorbed mass and structure of the film. Dispersants that have a slow rate of adsorption and a relatively fast rate of internal reorganisation produce soft visco-elastic layers with less total adsorbed mass. Conversely, dispersants with fast rates of adsorption and relatively low rates of reorganisation produce stiffer more elastic films and a greater total adsorbed mass...|$|R

Dispersions of polyurethane and polyurea porous particles for polymer compositesrn 2. 	Dispersions of PMMA and PU particles with PDI dye for study of Single Molecule Spectroscopy Detectionrn 3. 	Dispersions of graphene nanosheets for polymer compositesrnrnIn the first study, highly porous polyurethane and polyurea particles were prepared in a non-aqueous emulsion. The preparation of porous particles consisted of two parts: At first, a system was developed where the emulsion had high stability for the polymerization among diisocyanate, diol and water. In the second part, porous particles were prepared by using two methods fission/fusion and combination by which highly porous particles were obtained. In this study, the applications of porous particles were also investigated where polyurethane particles were tested as filling material for polymer composites and as catalyst carrier for polyethylene polymerization. rnrnIn the second study, PMMA and PU particles from one non-aqueous emulsion were investigated via single molecule fluorescence detection. At first the particles were loaded with PDI dye, which were detected by fluorescence microscopy. The distribution and orientation of the PDI molecules in the particles were successfully observed by Single Molecule Fluorescence Detection. The molecules were homogenously distributed inside of the particles. In addition they had random orientation, meaning that no aggregations of dye molecules were formed. With the results, it could be supposed that the polymer chains were also homogenously distributed in the particles, and that the conformation was relatively flexible. rnrnIn the third part of the study, graphene nanosheets with high surface area were dispersed in an organic solvent with low boiling point and low toxicity, THF, stabilized with a block copolymer PI-b-PMMA. The dispersion was used to prepare polymer composites. It was shown that the modified graphene nanosheets had good compatibility with the PS and PMMA matrices. rnDas amphiphile Blockcopolymer Polyisopren-b-PMMA (PI-b-PMMA) ist ein Emulgator für nicht-wässrige Emulsionen.

Copolymerization is typically ''living'' and yields copolyesters of perfectly controlled molecular weight and composition. Diblock molecular weight (Mn-PGA+Mn-PCL) ranges from 5700 to 42000 and the rho = Mn-PCL/Mn-PGA ratio varies from 1. 5 to 13. 1. Due to the inherent insolubility of the polyglycolide (PGA) segment in common organic solvent, the diblock copolyesters form stable <b>non-aqueous</b> colloidal <b>dispersions</b> e. g. in toluene, {{the stability of}} which results from the soluble poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) block. Combining all the experimental observations (PCS, TEM, WAXS, SAXS, AFM), a micelle model has been proposed which consists of a polyglycolide core surrounded with a corona of polycaprolactone (PCL). Both constituents are semi crystalline. From SAXS observations, the PGA core is better described by two concentric spheres. The internal sphere of a 5 - 6. 7 nn diameter would essentially contain crystalline PGA. The diameter of the external sphere, D-PGA, is {{in the range from}} 6. 2 to 9. 6 nm, at least for the investigated diblock copolymers. As a rule, this diameter increases as rho decreases at constant molecular weight and as the diblock molecular weight increases at constant rho. A scattering peak (weak) is observed in the range from 10. 8 to 15. 5 nm and the Bragg distance is close mu D-PGA, where mu is equal to (1 + 3 rho/ 2) (1 / 3). From steric considerations, mu is the ratio between the diameter of the micelle and the diameter of the PGA core, so that this peak has been assigned to the characteristic intermicellar distance. At very small angles, several additional peaks are the signature of a hyperstructure which is possibly lamellar. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Traditionally these displays have shown high resolution, increased battery life and excellent readability in sunlight, when compared with more commonly used displays, such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs). However, commercially available examples have only demonstrated black and white displays, or screens with coloured filters over the black and white particles, resulting in ‘washed out’ colours. The development of a full colour electrophoretic display holds great industrial potential to advance the field of electrophoretics, as well as available technology. A stabiliser is required during the synthesis of said particle dispersions, in order to control the parameters of the particles, as well as to ensure they remain stable and do not aggregate or settle out. Numerous different stabilisers have been successfully employed, although each has disadvantages and difficulties associated with it. This work describes the development of a block copolymer stabiliser of poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(octadecyl acrylate). The stabiliser itself was synthesised using controlled radical polymerisation techniques, namely atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP). ATRP allowed for the molecular weight, composition and distribution of chain lengths to be tailored to meet certain requirements.

The nature of this gelation process was investigated, before modifications were made to the structure of the stabiliser. This new stabiliser was then used in NAD polymerisations, which resulted in particles which still possessed all the desirable properties previously observed, without the gelation. These particles were then tested successfully for their application in electrophoretic displays...|$|E

Free-radical solution polymerization techniques {{have been used to}} prepare carboxyl-terminated poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(2 - ethyl hexyl acrylate) homopolymers. The molar masses of these prepolymers were readily controlled and they were found to be approximately monofunctional with respect to carboxy I groups. These carboxyl-terminated prepolymers were converted to methacrylate-terminated macromonomers via acyl chlorideterminated intermediates. The macromonomer functionalities obtained by this procedure were high, typically 0. 90 - 1. 05 methacrylate groups per molecule on average. The prepolymers and macromonomers were characterized using End-group analysis (EGA). Infra-red spectroscopy (IR), 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (lH NMR) and Gel-permeation Chromatography (GPC). Polystyrene-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate) and polystyrene-graft-poly(2 -ethyl hexyl acrylate) copolymers were prepared by the free-radical solution copolymerization of macromonomers (M 2) with styrene (M 1). A dual detector GPC method was used to estimate macromonomer conversions. Unreacted macromonomer and styrene were removed and the purified graft copolymers were characterized by Thin-layer Chromatography (TLC), GPC, IR and 1 H NMR. It was shown that efficient grafting had occurred by copolymerization of the macromonomer end-group and that ungrafted polystyrene backbone was not produced. The graft copolymer chemical compositions and physical architectures were controlled by changing the comonomer feed composition or the macromonomer molar mass. Reactivity ratios (r 1) were determined by the Jaacks, Finnemann-Ross and Kelen-TUdos methods. It was shown that the reactivities of the methacrylate-terminated macromonomers were approximately similar to conventional methacrylates and independent of the macromonomer molar mass or composition within the limits investigated.

A diblock copolymer of Poly (Styrene-b- [ethylene-co-propylene]) {{has been used as}} a stabilizer in <b>non-aqueous</b> <b>dispersion</b> polymerizations of methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate in n-heptane. The particles thus produced were stabilized by well defined surface layers of ethylene-propylene copolymer chains. The dependence of the particle size on the stabilizer, monomer and initiator concentrations was studied. Both seeded and one-shot polymerization techniques were investigated. Polymer particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy to determine particle shape and size. The long term stability of both types of polymer particles suggests that the anchoring efficiency in both systems was good. Rheological studies confirmed the sphericity of the particles and showed the particles to be non-flocculated under shear. The thickness of the surface layer was determined from viscosity studies of the dispersions at 298, 308 and 318 K. Solution viscosities dispersions at of a narrow distribution standard of ethylene-propylene copolymer in n-heptane and in a binary liquid mixture of n-heptane and n-propanol (79 : 21, v/v) at 298, 308 and 318 K were obtained in order to estimate the root-mean-square end-to-end distance of free ethylene-propylene copolymer chains. The thickness of the surface layer was observed to increase on raising the temperature and to decrease on changing the solvency of the dispersion medium from a good solvent to almost a theta solvent for the ethylene-propylene copolymer chains. The dimensions of the surface layer were slightly larger than the dimensions of the free ethylene-propylene copolymer chains in solution suggesting that long ethylene-propylene chains terminally anchored at the interface are only slightly extended over random coil dimensions. Calculations of the mean separation distance between adjacent stabilizing ethylene-propylene copolymer chains indicated close-packing of ethylene-propylene copolymer chains at the particle-liquid interface which may contribute to the slight extension of the ethylene-propylene copolymer chain conformation. The theta-conditions for ethylene-propylene copolymer in a mixture of n-heptane and n-propanol were determined using samples obtained by hydrogenating polyisoprene standards. The solvency of the dispersion medium for the stabilizing ethylene-propylene copolymer chain on the polymer particles was reduced until flocculation occurred, and this was achieved by cooling the dispersion system to find the critical flocculation temperature or by adding a non-solvent (n-propanol) for the ethylene-propylene copolymer chains at constant temperature to find the critical flocculation volume. The polymer dispersions just retained stability at theta conditions and started to lose stability when the dispersion medium was changed to slightly worse than a theta system for the ethylene-propylene chains. The close correspondence of the flocculation conditions to the theta conditions for free ethylene-propylene copolymer chains confirms that the steric stabilization mechanism is operative for these dispersions...|$|E

The vertical mode of EPD in constant current regime {{was used in}} this study. The morphology of prepared materials (image structural analysis), physical properties (EPD yields, relative density, roughness of deposit surface) and mechanical properties (hardness, fracture toughness, elastic module) were characterized on the prepared deposits from alumina (Al 2 O 3), zirconia (ZrO 2) or their composites. It was found that the surface charge of alumina or zirconia particles was opposite (inversion charge) in stabilized isopropanolic dispersions than in case of water dispersions. The model of alumina or zirconia particles “inverse” stabilization was proposed. This type of EPD was further studied in presence of different acidic stabilizers. The obtained results from the experimental work (-potential and electric conductivity of dispersions, EPD yields, relative density of deposits, roughness of deposit surface etc.) showed the monochloracetic acid as the optimal type of acidic stabilizer. The kinetic of EPD process from dispersions containing isopropanol, monochloracetic acid and Al 2 O 3 or ZrO 2 particles and its influence on the final properties of prepared deposits was studied. The new method of kinetic measurement was developed. Due to good knowledge of EPD kinetic the ceramic laminates (Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2) with optimized layer thickness were prepared.

Dispersibility behaviour of in-house synthesised conventional, nitrogen doped (N-MWCNTs), and boron doped (B-MWCNTs) MWCNTs was studied in 22 organic solvents. Based on thermodynamic theories it was suggested that doping, in particular nitrogen doping, significantly reduced the surface energy of the nanotubes. This aspect was crucial to understand the dispersibility of N-MWCNTs in low surface energy solvents and to achieve dispersions with high nanotube concentrations (0. 82 mg/ml). Also, a "destruction reduced sonication protocol" involving mild sonication was suggested for forming MWCNT dispersions in organic solvents. Dispersions formed using this protocol were homogeneous and showed high stability of at least 2. 5 years. Furthermore, the effect of ultrasonic probes on MWCNT lengths was studied and a decrease of 96 â 99 % for MWCNTs and 85 â 95 % for N-MWCNTs was observed. A numerical value for the nanotube length decrease during sonication has been reported for the first time. Preliminary studies to generate dielectric films of MWCNT/perfluoro alkoxy polymer were performed using aerosol spraying. An improvement in the dielectric constant (3. 56) with a low dissipation factor (0. 003) was observed in 0. 3 wt. % B- MWCNT/PFA composite films. Consistency in the test results from various parts of the films confirmed the uniformity of the nanotube distribution within the composite. Future work should concentrate on the effects of B-MWCNTs and N-MWCNTs at the percolation threshold due to their inherent electric properties. </p...|$|R
