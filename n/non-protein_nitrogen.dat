The study included 126 patients with CKD who attended a dedicated dietary counseling clinic in 2005 – 2009 and were systematically followed until January 2015. Of these patients, 20 (15. 9 %) had moderate or severe nutrition-related risk of geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) < 92; these patients {{were more likely to be}} older, have a greater proteinuria, and have lower body mass index and serum albumin concentration. Dietary protein intake was significantly lower in older patients (r = − 0. 33, p < 0. 001) and those with lower glomerular filtration rate (r = 0. 47, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Background and Objectives: Fast {{proteolysis}} {{of cheese}} in ripening process {{may lead to}} the premature attack of casein, release of the majority of enzymes into the whey, and loss of cheese composition from curd to whey. In this study, the effect of liposomal Flavourzyme on proteolysis of Iranian white brined cheese, {{as well as on the}} yield and composition of whey and curd was investigated. Materials and Methods: Heating method (without using any toxic, volatile organic solvent or detergent) was used to nanoliposomal encapsulation of Flavourzyme. So, 0. 15 % and 0. 3 % (w/v) Flavourzyme-loaded liposome were incorporated to pasteurized cow milk. Iranian brined cheese was produced in triplicate using a complete randomized design. Then total solids were determined by drying them in an Infrared Oven. Water soluble nitrogen/total <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>non-protein</b> nitrogen/total <b>nitrogen</b> was determined by Kjeldahl method. Results: Encapsulation efficiency of liposomal Flavourzyme was 25 %. No significant differences between chemical components of cheese curd (total solid, protein, TCA-soluble nitrogen, water soluble nitrogen) and whey (total solid, protein) were observed between encapsulated cheese and the control. Cheese production yield in experimental cheese was not different from that in the control cheese (P> 0. 05). Conclusions: The results suggest that application of liposomal Flavourzyme for acceleration of Iranian white brined cheese inhibits premature attack of casein and the release of the majority of cheese compositions into the whey.

50|$|<b>Non-protein</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (or NPN) is a {{term used}} in animal {{nutrition}} to refer collectively to components such as urea, biuret, and ammonia, which are not proteins but can be converted into proteins by microbes in the ruminant stomach.
