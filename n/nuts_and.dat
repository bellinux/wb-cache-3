5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> bolts. Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

50|$|According to {{traditional}} Ayurvedic medicine, chewing areca <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> betel leaf is {{a remedy for}} bad breath. In South Asia, it was a custom to chew areca or betel <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> betel leaf among lovers because of the breath-freshening and stimulant drug properties of the mixture. Both the <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> the leaf are mild stimulants and can be addictive with repeated use. The betel nut will also cause dental decay and red or black staining of teeth when chewed. Both areca <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> betel leaf chewing, however, can cause premalignant lesions such as leukoplakia and submucous fibrosis, and are recognised risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (oral cancer). Other traditional remedies for halitosis include guava leaves in Thailand, eggshells in China, parsley in Italy, and urine-based mouth rinse in certain European cultures.|$|R

40|$|Silicate {{is one of}} {{the most}} typical {{materials}} in both traditional and modern buildings. A comparative analysis on two silicate materials (ginger <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> Aga soil) used in the ancient buildings of China was presented. The research suggests that ginger <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> Aga soil have similar chemical composition and physical properties. After they are calcined at 700 ― 1400 ¡æ, they will have a combining characteristic of hydraulicity and nonhydraulicity. As the calcinations temperature rises, the nonhydraulic constituent is firstly increased and then decreased, and the hydraulic constituent is increasing regularly. Both chemical compositions and characteristics of the calcined ginger <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> Aga soil are similar to those of the Hydraulic lime in Europe. Thus the properties change of ginger <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> Aga soil can be used for repairing and reinforcing the stone, earthen, brick and ceramic relics...|$|R

5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> seeds. They forage for insects {{hidden in}} or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, {{but they may}} join mixed feeding flocks at other times. Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> seeds, hazel <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as fat, cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E
5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, <b>nuts,</b> <b>and</b> seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E

Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
