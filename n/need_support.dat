One feature is youth’s basic psychological <b>needs</b> <b>support.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine if differences existed between two leaders in delivery of one youth leadership programme related to programme quality and <b>needs</b> <b>support.</b> A mixed-methods approach was employed. Programme quality was assessed quantitatively from researchers' observations. Youth self-reported on <b>needs</b> <b>support</b> and participated in semi-structured interviews. Results indicated significant differences on programme quality with Leader 1 rating higher on safe and supportive environment than Leader 2. Youth perceived Leader 1 as more effective than Leader 2 in providing a psychologically safe environment and fostering <b>needs</b> <b>support.</b> Implications and future directions are discussed...|$|R

Women who use these programs often <b>need</b> <b>support</b> having experienced family violence. The Women’s House open access operates from Monday to Friday, 11:30am – 3.00pm, providing women with a lunch, shower and laundry facilities. There is a sleeping room available for women to take a rest during opening hours. Health and wellbeing activities are also organised, such as ceramics and yoga classes, provided by volunteers.|$|E
25|$|Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland {{each have}} their own {{government}} or executive, led by a First Minister (or, {{in the case of}} Northern Ireland, a diarchal First Minister and deputy First Minister), and a devolved unicameral legislature. England, the largest country of the United Kingdom, has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the UK's government and parliament on all issues. This situation has given rise to the so-called West Lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can vote, sometimes decisively, on matters that only affect England. The McKay Commission reported on this matter in March 2013 recommending that laws affecting only England should <b>need</b> <b>support</b> from a majority of English members of parliament.|$|E

2500|$|Children who {{received}} supportive responses following disclosure had less traumatic symptoms and were abused for a shorter {{period of time}} than children who did not receive support. In general, {{studies have found that}} children <b>need</b> <b>support</b> and stress-reducing resources after disclosure of sexual abuse. Negative social reactions to disclosure {{have been found to be}} harmful to the survivor’s well being. One study reported that children {{who received}} a bad reaction from the first person they told, especially if the person was a close family member, had worse scores as adults on general trauma symptoms, post traumatic stress disorder symptoms, and dissociation. [...] Another study found that in most cases when children did disclose abuse, the person they talked to did not respond effectively, blamed or rejected the child, and took little or no action to stop the abuse. Non-validating and otherwise non-supportive responses to disclosure by the child's primary attachment figure may indicate a relational disturbance predating the sexual abuse that may have been a risk factor for the abuse, and which can remain a risk factor for its psychological consequences.|$|E

40|$|Program {{quality has}} been {{outlined}} {{as an important}} predictor of positive outcomes in youth development programs; however, little evidence exists to support this, particularly within sport. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the associations between researcher- and coach-assessed program quality scores as they relate to youth volleyball athletes’ basic <b>needs</b> <b>support.</b> Design: Observational data and self-report data were gathered from coaches and youth. Researchers completed 84 observations using a measure of program quality across 14 teams. Coaches completed the same measure at the end of the season and 138 athletes (Mage = 14. 50) from the 14 teams completed a self-report questionnaire pertaining to <b>needs</b> <b>support.</b> Data were analyzed using polynomial regressions with response surface methodology. Results: Athletes’ <b>needs</b> <b>support</b> was significantly (p <. 001) associated with all domains of researcher- and coach-assessed program quality (i. e., safe environment, supportive environment, interaction, engagement), and between 20 and 35 % of the variance in athletes’ <b>needs</b> <b>support</b> was explained by these variables. The degree of discrepancy between researcher- and coach-assessed program quality increased when progressing through three domains of program quality (safe environment, supportive environment, engagement). Response surface methods indicated that as the degree of agreement increased between researchers’ and coaches’ ratings of the safety of the environment, supportiveness of the environment, and opportunities for engagement, so did athletes’ basic <b>needs</b> <b>support</b> scores in a linear fashion. Conclusions: Practical implications surrounding coach education and the importance of knowledge translation between academics and practitioners are noted, and future research directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous Social Dilemmas: The Case of Social Support” {{studies the}} level of social support between {{heterogeneous}} actors. We consider heterogeneity with respect to several individual properties: the likelihood of <b>needing</b> <b>support,</b> the costs of providing support, and the benefits from receiving support. We investigate whether more support is provided by homogeneous actors than by heterogeneous actors for different kinds of heterogeneity. Social support in dyadic relations between two actors is modeled as an Iterated Support Game. We derive hypotheses on actors' supportive behavior from game-theoretic analyses and test them with data from laboratory experiments. We find, for instance, that actors who only differ in their likelihood of <b>needing</b> <b>support</b> help each other less, the more their likelihoods of <b>needing</b> <b>support</b> differ. However, if actors also differ in their costs of providing support, this might decrease as well as increase support among the actors, depending on who has the higher costs of providing support...|$|R
