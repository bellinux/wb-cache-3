25|$|Turret deck ships had a low <b>net</b> <b>tonnage</b> (an {{approximate}} {{measure of}} cargo space) {{in comparison to}} their deadweight capacity (weight of cargo) allowing them to operate at a lower fee structure than a conventional hull. <b>Net</b> <b>tonnage</b> is a computation of volume, and the method of measurement used at the Suez Canal to determine tolls {{was based on a}} measure of <b>net</b> <b>tonnage</b> which excluded some of the cargo spaces of these unconventional hulls. Turret and trunk deck ships therefore paid less in tolls than conventional ships of the same capacity.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>net</b> <b>tonnage</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} eligibility for registering boats with the federal government.
