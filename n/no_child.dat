40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} {{women with}} <b>no</b> <b>children</b> can experience pronatalism-driven stereotyping, stigmatisation and exclusion. This cross-sectional study described the social connection and exclusion of Australian women with <b>no</b> <b>children</b> during midlife (defined as aged 45 to 64 years). A total of 294 Australian midlife women with <b>no</b> <b>children</b> completed a self-administered online questionnaire. Data {{were collected on}} indicators of exclusion in the social, civic, service and economic domains of life, and perceived stereotyping, stigmatisation and exclusion due to having <b>no</b> <b>children.</b> Data were analysed using One Way ANOVAs, Kruskal Wallis Analyses of Ranks, Chi Square Tests for Independence and descriptive statistics. The findings indicate midlife women feel negatively stereotyped due to having <b>no</b> <b>children.</b> While the extent and quality of resources and participation vary between and within the domains of life, midlife women perceive more exclusion due to having <b>no</b> <b>children</b> {{in the social and}} civic domains than the service and economic domains. There are few differences between typologies of women with <b>no</b> <b>children.</b> It is essential to challenge pronatalism in Australian society in order to ensure all women have opportunities for connection in all domains of life, regardless of their motherhood status...|$|R

5|$|Development of A.I. {{originally}} {{began with}} producer-director Stanley Kubrick, after he acquired {{the rights to}} Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, Bob Shaw, Ian Watson, and Sara Maitland. The film languished in protracted development for years, partly because Kubrick felt computer-generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed <b>no</b> <b>child</b> actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's film treatment for the screenplay.|$|E

On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, {{wrote a letter to}} the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that <b>no</b> <b>child</b> should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E

5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. <b>No</b> <b>child</b> support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child.
