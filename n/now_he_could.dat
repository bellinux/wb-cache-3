His eldest son William, Jr. was leading a dissolute life, neglecting {{his wife and}} two children, and running up gambling debts. Penn had hoped to have William succeed him in America. <b>Now</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not even pay his son's debts. His own finances were in turmoil. He had sunk over Â£30,000 in America and received little back except some bartered goods. He had made many generous loans which he failed to press.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, Donna and Ringo's {{relationship}} {{goes through}} a rocky patch and during schoolies week, Donna sleeps with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock. Robbie said that Donna begins to [...] "freak out" [...] {{because she did not}} expect to see Andrew again and <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> tell everyone what happened between them. Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, they might find a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not sure if it was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I think at the moment it's quite in the balance. It's right up to the network at the moment as to whether they'll get back together or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, during 1966 Red Guards led a {{crowd to}} break statues, burn scriptures {{and open the}} stupas {{containing}} the relics of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas, and throw them in the river. Some remains, though, were saved by locals, and in 1985, Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama, began {{the construction of a}} new stupa to house them and honour his predecessors. It was finally consecrated on 22 January 1989, just six days before he died aged fifty-one at Tashi Lhunpo. [...] "It was as if he was saying <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> rest." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 8, 2007, Ellison gave {{a speech}} in Edina, Minnesota, where he denounced Bush's {{commutation}} of Lewis Libby's sentence: [...] "If Libby gets pardoned, then {{he should not have}} the cover of the Fifth Amendment. He's {{going to have to come}} clean and tell the truth. <b>Now,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get Gonzales-itis , you know, with 71 lapses of memory within a two-hour period." [...] He also criticized Bush's White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives saying, [...] "This is basically the Department of Religious Outreach.... It's essentially a public-relations outreach arm for the Bush administration to reach out to the far right of the evangelical Christian movement. That's really all it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Tenderloin {{took its}} name from an older {{neighborhood}} in New York with similar characteristics. There are several explanations of how that neighborhood was named. Some {{said it was a}} reference to the neighborhood as the [...] "soft underbelly" [...] (analogous to the cut of meat) of the city, with allusions to vice and corruption, especially graft. Another popular explanation, probably folklore, attributes the name to a New York City police captain, Alexander S. Williams, who was overheard saying that when he was assigned {{to another part of the}} city, he could only afford to eat chuck steak on the salary he was earning, but after he was transferred to this neighborhood he was making so much money on the side soliciting bribes that <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> eat tenderloin instead. Another version of that story says that the officers who worked in the Tenderloin received a [...] "hazard pay" [...] bonus for working in such a violent area, and thus were able to afford the good cut of meat. Yet another story, also likely apocryphal, is that the name is a reference to the [...] "loins" [...] of prostitutes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob sent Judah before {{him to show}} the way to Goshen. Joseph went up to Goshen in his chariot to meet Jacob, and fell on his neck and wept. Jacob told Joseph that <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> die, since he had seen Joseph's face. Joseph told his {{brothers}} {{that he would go}} tell Pharaoh that his brothers had come, that they kept cattle, and that they had brought their flocks, herds, and all their possessions. Joseph instructed them that when Pharaoh asked them their occupation, they should say that they were keepers of cattle, for shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians. Joseph told Pharaoh that his family had arrived in the land of Goshen, and presented five of his brothers to Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked the brothers what their occupation was, and they told Pharaoh that they were shepherds and asked to live in the land of Goshen. Pharaoh told Joseph that his family could live in the best of the land, in Goshen, and if he knew any able men among them, then he could appoint them to watch over Pharaoh's cattle. Joseph set Jacob before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked Jacob how old he was, and Jacob answered that he was 130 years old and that few and evil had been the years of his life. Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left. The sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
