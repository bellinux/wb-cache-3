40|$|The Diode-Seeded Modeless Laser (DSML) {{is based}} on the pulsed {{amplification}} of a narrowband tunable diode laser using a modeless dye laser amplifier. The motivation behind its design is the need for a laser system for quantitative measurements of combustion parameters using non-linear optical techniques. Such a system needs to produce a high power, single longitudinal mode, tunable output; a stringent set of requirements and unavailable commerically. This thesis describes the improvements made to the DSML, specifically a system was designed and fabricated which provides synchronous frequency scanning of both the external-cavity diode laser and the modeless laser amplifier. The system developed in this work, SOPEC (Scanning by Optical Pickup Error Correction), actively monitors and corrects wavelength mismatchs between the diode laser and the modeless laser amplifier down to 0. 0001 nm (0. 003 cm-I) improving on the existing scanning system which was able to maintain synchronicity for only rv 1 cm-I. This active control thus provides synchronous scanning over a range limited only by the diode laser tuning range. In order to verify the effectiveness of SOPEC, a wide absorption scan was taken of molecular iodine over a total of 60 cm-I, in five short scans of rv 2 cm-I wide separated by 15 cm-I. In addition a single scan was taken spanning rv 9 em-I. The improvements to the DSML now enable it to produce up to 40 mJ in a 4 ns pulse. The current fundamental output possesses a Fourier Transform limited bandwidth of 165 MHz (0. 0055 em-I) over the wavelength ranges 623 - 639 nm (7 nm or 21 Ocm-I). Difference frequency mixing with second harmonic Nd:YAG at 532 nm produces 1 mJ, rv 3 ns pulse of mid-infared radiation from 3. 18 - 3. 36 /lm. The line width of the mid-infrared radiation was estimated to be rv 360 MHz (0. 012 cm- 1). The first application of the DSML employing SOPEC to <b>non-linear</b> spectroscopy was <b>polarization</b> spectroscopy (PS) of molecular iodine at rv 635 nm (15748 em- 1) in a cell at 1 Torr. Both co- and counterpropagating geometries gave spectra exhibiting good stability in both intensity and wavelength; signal to noise ratios of over 700 were obtained. The spectra obtained using the counterpropagating geometry, although not completely resolving the hyperfine components, clarified the underlying structure sufficiently to determine whether the J level was odd or even. The results demonstrated the highest resolution achieved so far using a pulsed laser system. Applying the DSML and SOPEC to the mid-infrared (rv 3020 cm- 1), absorption spectroscopy of V 3 band of methane in a low pressure cell at 10 Torr was peformed. The first application of the DSML to non-linear spectroscopy in the mid-infrared was demonstrated using polarization spectroscopy of methane in a low pressure cell, with signal to noise ratios of up to 1400. A high resolution scan of a single peak in the Q-branch at 6 Torr was obtained with a line width of 0. 018 cm- 1, showing the high stability of the DSML in both the itensity and wavelength. This is the highest resolution, pulsed, infrared PS spectra obtained to date. A scan over three of the most closely separated peaks showed that the DSML is capable of completely resolving features separated by rv 0. 02 cm- 1. The DSM~'s stability was tested by measuring pressure broadening of methane by nitrogen (0 - 100 Torr). 05 The measured line broadening (0. 00021 Ã‚Â± 0. 00014 em- 1 /Torr) was in agreement with literature values. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate the improved DSML, employing SOP~}o be a powerful tool for high resolution spectroscopy and for obtaining quantitative measurements using non-linear optical techniques.

When resonance occurs, the amplitude of the surface polariton mode grows linearly with distance inside the pumped region. These results concerning the surface mode are subsequently generalized to absorbing active media. In that case the existence of the resonance phenomenon allows us to define the dispersion curve of the Raman-excited surface polaritons...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a {{boundary}} element formulation is developed {{and used for}} the analysis of cathodic protection systems of buried slender structures, such as foundations of electric transmission line towers.

40|$|Controlling {{the state}} of {{polarization}} of a light beam of an optical fiber is of crucial importance. <b>Non-Linear</b> <b>Polarization</b> Pulling (NLPP) is an all-optical way to control {{the state of}} polarization of signals which has been proposed in recent years. Polarization attraction effect enables to align a generic input State of Polarization (SOP) towards a fixed one. NLPP can be induced by various nonlinear effects occurring in optical fibers, in particular by the Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS). This Thesis is propaedeutic for experiments investigating NLPP. In fact, any experiment on SRS polarization pulling needs a proper polarimeter which can analyze the signals in the wavelength range from 1550 nm to 1640 nm. It is therefore necessary to employ a suitable polarimetric technique which should also give information on the spectral composition of the signals, mainly to estimate the Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) due to the SRS. This polarimeter is tested and characterized in experimental tests performed during this Thesis. Moreover, {{there is also the}} necessity to generate depolarized signals to verify the repolarization capability of the NLPP effect. To meet this need, two different polarization scramblers have been employed and systematically tested to characterize the generated polarization scrambled signal...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The {{corrosion}} {{of stainless}} steel orthodontic wire was investigated using the electrochemical technique of polarization resistance. A potentiostat was used to apply small perturbations about the corrosion potential and the resultant current was measured. The polarization resistance is determined from {{the slope of the}} plot, and the corrosion current and rate calculated. Problems associated with the technique are <b>non-linear</b> <b>polarization</b> plots and a prior knowledge of Tafel coefficients. In the present work a non-linear optimization procedure was developed to solve the corrosion equations directly for corrosion current and Tafel coefficients. Six sample groups were investigated, the corrosion rate expressed in terms of corrosion current density (Am- 2) : 'as received ' (2. 89); heat treated (2. 49); finger springs (2. 64); finger springs sleeved (5. 78); Adams clasps (4. 32) and Adams clasps sleeved (3. 65). The results of the 'as received ' were extremely scattered reflecting the random and uncontrollable stress imposed on the wire during the drawing process. The effect of heat treatment was to reduce the scatter and to significantly reduce the corrosion rate. The finger springs did not corrode at a significantly faster rate, but when insulated by the use of heat shrink PVC tubing leaving only the highly stressed coil to corrode, there was a two-fold increase in rate. The highly stressed Adams clasps also had a high corrosion rate. Scanning electron micrographs of the wires before and after corrosion indicated minimal surface damage...|$|E
40|$|Dielectric {{properties}} of perovskites are studied both to {{gain insight into}} fundamental aspects of the freezing of polar disorder, and to investigate their technological potential. The dynamics of freezing of polar disorder is investigated in single crystals of Li-doped potassium tantalate (K 1 -xLixTaO 3) and lead magnesium niobate (pb[Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3]O 3). For the mixed crystal K 1 -xLixTaO 3, the dielectric permittivity ε (ω) is measured at various temperatures and for frequencies ω/ 2 π ranging from 2 × 10 - 4 to 109 Hz. These results are complemented by measurements of field-induced pyroelectric currents and polarization vs field loops. Further information is gained from microscopic model calculations of the Li-Li interaction energy. The present study reveals that this material can neither be described by a spin-glass model nor as a ferroelectric. In particular, the polarization of previously reported nanometer-sized clusters cannot be switched by an applied electric field. The analysis of the numerical results of the Li-Li interaction energy reveals the importance of elastic interactions. Nearest-neighbor effects are observed {{in the shape of}} the ε (ω) curves. Finally, the freezing of disorder is interpreted as a consequence of hierarchical constraints. For the "prototype" relaxor Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3, a comparison between new dielectric results and published data provides evidence of two relaxation branches. Phenomenologically, they bear strong similarities to those of glass-forming polymers and are thus labelled α- and β-type relaxations. The α branch is responsible for the characteristic peak in the temperature dependence of the permittivity. The parameters describing this relaxation show no anomalies or extrema in the investigated temperature range, and the peak is seen to be of purely dynamic origin, rather than being related to a structural phase transition. This confirms earlier claims that Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 is nontransforming in the absence of an applied electric field. Motivated by a technological interest in highly polarizable dielectric layers, epitaxial SrTiO 3 films with thicknesses between 50 and 330 nm are studied using Mg/SrTiO 3 /-SrTiO 3 :Nb heterostructures. Their low-temperature dielectric properties differ from those of single-crystal SrTiO 3 samples, but can be understood in the framework of a simple model built for this purpose. This approach takes into consideration the <b>non-linear</b> <b>polarization</b> vs field dependence of SrTiO 3 and assumes strong charge trapping at the film/substrate interface. The present films are characterized by a high permittivity: ε ≈ 100 is reproducibly obtained at 4. 2 K, corresponding to capacitances of the order of 10 nF/mm 2.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a fiber laser front end suitable for high energy petawatt laser systems on large glass lasers such as NIF. The front end includes generation of the pulses in a fiber mode-locked oscillator, amplification and pulse cleaning, stretching of the pulses to > 3 ns, dispersion trimming, timing, fiber transport of the pulses to the main laser bay and amplification of the pulses to an injection energy of 150 {micro}J. We will discuss current status of our work including data from packaged components. Design detail such as how the system addresses pulse contrast, dispersion trimming and pulse width adjustment and impact of B-integral on the pulse amplification will be discussed. A schematic of the fiber laser system we are constructing {{is shown in figure}} 1 below. A 40 MHz packaged mode-locked fiber oscillator produces {approx} 1 nJ pulses which are phase locked to a 10 MHz reference clock. These pulses are down selected to 100 kHz and then amplified while still compressed. The amplified compressed pulses are sent through a <b>non-linear</b> <b>polarization</b> rotation based pulse cleaner to remove background amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The pulses are then stretched by a chirped fiber Bragg grating (CFBG) and then sent through a splitter. The splitter splits the signal into two beams. (From this point we follow only one beam as the other follows an identical path.) The pulses are sent through a pulse tweaker that trims dispersion imbalances between the final large optics compressor and the CFBG. The pulse tweaker also permits the dispersion of the system to be adjusted for the purpose of controlling the final pulse width. Fine scale timing between the two beam lines can also be adjusted in the tweaker. A large mode area photonic crystal single polarization fiber is used to transport the pulses from the master oscillator room to the main laser bay. The pulses are then amplified a two stage fiber amplifier to 150 mJ. These pulses are then launched into the main amplifier chain. We are currently constructing a packaged prototype of this system, which will ultimately be deployed on the National Ignition Facility (NIF). In our talk we will discuss the packaged components as well as the numerous technical challenges that needed to be overcome in order to make this system possible. Of particular interest was the quality of recompressed pulses that could be achieved with a CFBG. We will show background free auto-correlation data from pulses with a dynamic range noise limited to six orders of magnitude that were stretched with a CFBG and then recompressed in a standard compressor (figure 2). We will also discuss in detail the impact of B-integral accumulation on the recompressed pulses. Our current system is projected to run at an accumulated B-integral of 7.
