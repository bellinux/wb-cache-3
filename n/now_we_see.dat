2500|$|Ian Parrott {{wrote in}} his book on Elgar that the [...] "dark saying", and {{possibly}} {{the whole of the}} Enigma, had a biblical source, 1 Corinthians 13:12, which in the Authorised Version reads, [...] "For <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> through a glass, darkly (enigmate in the Latin of the Vulgate); but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." [...] The verse is from St. Paul's essay on love. Elgar was a practising Roman Catholic and on 12 February 1899, eight days before the completion of the Variations, he attended a Mass at which this verse was read.|$|E

2500|$|King Amanullah {{objected to}} the British about the air raids on Kabul citing British {{condemnation}} of the German Zeppelin attacks on London. In his letter to the British government he said, [...] "It {{is a matter of}} great regret that the throwing of bombs by Zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation, while <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent amongst all civilized people of the West." [...] During the course of the conflict, British aircraft losses included at least one plane crashed and two shot down.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, Aleksandr Bastrykin, {{head of the}} Russia's Prosecutor General's investigative committee, has {{suggested}} that mercenaries from the Baltic states were among those known to have participated on the Georgian side during the 2008 South Ossetia war, including a female sniper from Latvia. Earlier during the conflict, Russia Today had reported the South Ossetian authorities as saying that [...] "there {{was a group of}} women snipers operating in the city [...] ", and that [...] "Ukrainians and citizens of the Baltic countries have been among the prisoners they have detained." [...] These reports have resurrected the rumours of [...] "White Tights" [...] operating in the Caucasus. A spokesman for the Latvian Ministry of Defence, Airis Rikveilis, commented Bastrykin's statements as follows: [...] "We had thought that the ghost of the 'White Tights' had died in the Russian press, but <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that it still roams Russia." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Sonya is sent {{to check}} up on the {{progress}} of Toadfish Rebecchi's (Ryan Moloney) guide dog puppy, Rocky, she [...] "soon found love" [...] with the lawyer. Sonya and Toadie began a relationship and Moloney thought that Sonya was perfect for Toadie. Moloney quipped [...] "She's funny and a little bit zany and really accepting and loving as well." [...] However, their romance comes to an end when Toadie tells Sonya that he has got back together with his ex-girlfriend, Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner). A Sunday Mail reporter said Sonya was [...] "simply heartbroken" [...] and [...] "devastated" [...] after she was told about Toadie and Steph's relationship. However, she is unaware that Toadie is pretending to be in love with Steph to help cover up the fact she is carrying Daniel Fitzgerald's (Brett Tucker) child. Toadie becomes torn when Sonya tells him she loves him, but he carries on the lie. Of the situation, Moloney said [...] "Toadie is in love with Sonya, but he's had to give up the chance to follow his heart. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that he really wants nothing more than {{to be able to tell}} her he loves her and that he wants to be with her – but he just can't." ...|$|E
