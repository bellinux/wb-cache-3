5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take on his work. Many perceived it as a subversive and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E
5|$|The bank {{building}} was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it {{and made it}} home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> empty, roofless, concrete shell.|$|E
5|$|Potter's {{adolescence}} was {{as quiet}} as her childhood. She matured into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed {{her to be a}} permanent resident and housekeeper in their home. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanized animals to a greeting card publisher. She hoped to lead a useful life independent of her parents, and tentatively considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> amateur and she abandoned fungi.|$|E

However, Data previously copied his core memories into B-4, his lost brother who is introduced in the movie.

25|$|Thus, a Lisp list is not {{an atomic}} object, as an {{instance}} of a container class in C++ or Java would be. A list is <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> aggregate of linked conses. A variable which refers to a given list is simply a pointer to the first cons in the list. Traversal of a list {{can be done by}} cdring down the list; that is, taking successive cdrs to visit each cons of the list; or by using any of several higher-order functions to map a function over a list.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{phenomena}} in quantum mechanics, such as quantum entanglement, might give the superficial impression of allowing {{communication of information}} faster than light. According to the no-communication theorem these phenomena do not allow true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without any way of controlling what either sees. Wavefunction collapse {{can be viewed as}} an epiphenomenon of quantum decoherence, which in turn is <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and all of its environment. Since the underlying behaviour does not violate local causality or allow FTL it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real or apparent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{design of the}} Altair, the parts {{needed to make a}} {{complete}} machine would not fit on a single motherboard, and the machine consisted of four boards stacked {{on top of each other}} with stand-offs. Another problem facing Roberts was that the parts needed to make a truly useful computer weren't available, or wouldn't be designed in time for the January launch date. So during the construction of the second model, he decided to build most of the machine on removable cards, reducing the motherboard to <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> interconnect between the cards, a backplane. The basic machine consisted of five cards, including the CPU on one and memory on another. He then looked for a cheap source of connectors, and came across a supply of 100-pin edge connectors. The S-100 bus was eventually acknowledged by the professional computer community and adopted as the IEEE-696 computer bus standard.|$|E
25|$|Dahn equated Chararic with Theodemar, even {{saying that}} the latter was the name he took upon baptism. It has also been {{suggested}} that Theodemar and Ariamir were the same person {{and the son of}} Chararic. In the opinion of some historians, Chararic is <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> error on the part of Gregory of Tours and never existed. If, as Gregory relates, Martin of Braga died about the year 580 and had been bishop for about thirty years, then the conversion of Chararic must have occurred around 550 at the latest. Finally, Ferreiro believes the conversion of the Suevi was progressive and stepwise and that Chararic's public conversion was only followed by the lifting of a ban on Catholic synods in the reign of his successor, which would have been Ariamir; while Theodemar would have been responsible for beginning a persecution of the Arians in his kingdom, to root out their heresy.|$|E
25|$|Roddick {{was forced}} {{to pull out of}} the 2008 French Open due to a {{shoulder}} injury. After a visit to a doctor in New York, it was determined this was <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> inflammation of the rotator cuff. His first tournament after the shoulder injury was the Artois Championship, his annual Wimbledon preparation, where he was the defending champion. Roddick defeated Mardy Fish and Andy Murray, before losing to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the semifinals. At Wimbledon, Roddick was beaten by Serbia's Janko Tipsarević. This was his earliest exit at Wimbledon. Roddick was beaten at the Rogers Cup in the third round by Marin Čilić. He was then forced {{to pull out of the}} Cincinnati Masters following a neck injury, which he said may have been caused by a poor sleeping posture. He stated in an interview that the neck injury had nothing to do with his shoulder injury. Roddick did not participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics, but chose to concentrate on the 2008 US Open. Roddick then played in the smaller hard-court tournaments in the US Open Series, including those at Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. At the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, Roddick lost to Juan Martín del Potro in the final.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{have attempted to}} meld these stories. It has been alleged that Chararic and Theodemir must have been successors of Ariamir, since Ariamir was the first Suebic monarch to lift the ban on Catholic synods; Isidore therefore gets the chronology wrong. Reinhart suggested that Chararic was converted first through the relics of Saint Martin and that Theodemir was converted later through the preaching of Martin of Dumio. Dahn equated Chararic with Theodemir, even saying that the latter was the name he took upon baptism. It has also been suggested that Theodemir and Ariamir were the same person {{and the son of}} Chararic. In the opinion of some historians, Chararic is <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> error on the part of Gregory of Tours and never existed.
