The project was conducted between 2015 - 06 - 01 - 2016 - 06 - 30. The purpose of the study is to point out potential system benets of using SiC PowerMOSFET:s instead of conventional IGBT:s in <b>nutrunner</b> systems. The study can conclude thatthe total motor-drive system weight can be more than halved by using SiC technology. The studyalso shows that blanking time and motor inductance are important parameters for optimal useof SiC Power MOSFET:s in electrical <b>nutrunner</b> systems. The project was partly funded by theSwedish Energy Agency, Energimyndigheten and Sweden's innovation agency, Vinnova. QC 20170823 </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A high {{frequency}} of radiological anomalies (vacuoles, cysts, enostoses) {{was found in}} workers exposed to vibration caused by light tools (screw drivers, nutrunners) compared with a non-exposed group. The lesions were mostly localised in the spongy carpal bones (os capitatum, os lunatum, os scaphoideum). There {{was no significant difference}} between the sexes, nor between the "active " or "passive " hand, both hands being simultaneously exposed. These findings support the need to implement preventive measures. The harmful effects of mechanical vibration on the human body are well known. Arthrosis and circulat-ory anomalies are well described. '- 5 In most cases, however, only the low frequency vibration caused by heavy tools is considered. 45 Little or no attention has been given to the possible damage caused by light tools (pneumatic screw-drivers and nutrun-ners) largely used in engine assembling factories. In our factory, where outboard motors (4 HP to 140 HP) are constructed, many workers handle these tools many times a day for short periods. During these activities, vibrations of very {{high frequency}} (up to 31 Khz) and accelerations (up to 10 -I- 102 ' 3 m/sec 2) have been measured. We describe the results of our findings by comparison with a non-exposed group. Materials and methods There are two types of pneumatic tools: the first can be used as a screw driver and as a <b>nutrunner,</b> the second only as a screw driver. The double stroke <b>nutrunner</b> causes more perceptible and higher vibra-tion frequencies than the single stroke <b>nutrunner,</b> partially due to the heavier material on which the nuts are to be fixed. Both are available in the press valve and in the pistol grip model. Table 1 summar-ises the characteristics of these tools. The exposure time varies widely in the course of a day, depending on the individual, the type of construction of the motor, and so on. All measurements of vibration were performe...|$|E

This includes electronic torque wrenches, click torque wrenches, dial torque wrenches, electric screwdrivers, air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, <b>nutrunners,</b> and torque screwdrivers. Today’s advanced torque testers include the ability to measure in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, convert to 8 engineering units (in·oz, in·lb, ft·lb, N·m, cN·m, kgf·cm, gf·cm, kgf·fm), 3 modes of operation (peak, 1st peak, track), and include a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certificate (or its domestic pendant).|$|R
40|$|In the {{production}} industry, quality control is of importance. Even though today's tools provide {{a lot of}} functionality and safety to help the operators in their job, the operators still {{is responsible for the}} final quality of the parts. Today the nutrunners manufactured by Atlas Copco use their driver to detect the tightening angle. There- fore the operator can influence the tightening by turning the tool clockwise or counterclockwise during a tightening and quality cannot be assured that the bolt is tightened with a certain torque angle. The function of orientation tracking was de- sired to be evaluated for the Tensor STB angle and STB pistol tools manufactured by Atlas Copco. To be able to study the orientation of a <b>nutrunner,</b> practical exper- iments were introduced where an IMU sensor was fixed on a battery powered <b>nutrunner.</b> Sensor fusion {{in the form of a}} complementary filter was evaluated. The result states that the accelerometer could not be used to estimate the angular dis- placement of tightening due to vibration and gimbal lock and therefore a sensor fusion is not possible. The gyroscope by itself can be used to provide the angular displacement around every axis with high accuracy without taking into account the gimbal lock phenomena or external forces in the form of vibration of the tool. The gyroscope provided data with a probability to measure ± 1 ° in future tightenings by 69, 76 %. The gyroscope provided data with high accuracy and stability and can be used in real world application and production for true angle functionality of the tools.  I produktionsindustrin är kvalitetskontroll av stor betydelse. Även om dagens verk- tyg innehåller mycket funktionalitet och säkerhet för att hjälpa operatörer i jobbet, är operatören fortfarande ansvarig för den slutliga kvaliteten. Idag använder Atlas Copcos skruvdragare motorns vridmoment för att göra den slutliga åtdragningen. Därav kan operatören påverka åtdragningen genom att vrida verktyget medurs el- ler moturs under en åtdragning och kvaliteten kan inte säkerställas att bulten dras med ett visst vridmoment.

40|$|For att noggrannare kunna bestamma SOC (State-Of-Charge) och SOH (State-Of-Health) i Atlas Copcos batteridrivna mutterdragare har en litteraturstudie over de vanligaste metoderna gjorts. Utifran litteraturstudien valdes en metod for att mata SOC och tre metoder for att mata SOH. For att metoderna ska kunna appliceras i verkligheten kravs att vissa kriterier uppfylls. Da batteriet laddas ur med hoga strompulser far matningarna inte oka serieresistansen fran batteriet. Dessutom har verktyget en {{processor}} i sig och darfor far inte strommen brytas for matningen. Matningarna far inte heller pa annat satt paverka atdragningen eller stora anvandaren. Grunden i arbetet ligger i att oka forstaelsen om litium-jon batterier genom att studera batteriers uppbyggnad och bakomliggande kemi och fysik sa som termodynamiska- och kinetiska samband. Som en fortsattning undersoks vilka fenomen som orsakar kapacitets- och energiforluster i cellen. Utifran den kunskapen gors en ekvivalent elektrisk modell som forklarar cellens beteende nar den laddas ur. I metoden for att mata SOC har det undersokts hur val vilospanningen mellan atdragningarna stammer overens med SOC. Med hjalp av algoritmer som kompenserar for hur cellen har laddats ur kan kvarvarande dragningar i procent beraknas med god noggrannhet. Dessutom har viktig information om nar en cell bor anses vara urladdad setts i matningarna. I den forsta metoden for att mata SOH undersoktes hur forandringen av impedansspektrumet beror pa cellens aktuella kapacitet. Det har aven visats att det racker med matningar vid enstaka frekvenser i impedansspektrumet for att bestamma SOH. I den andra metoden gjordes forsok dar batteriet belastades med tva strompulser och spanningsfallet vid den andra pulsen mattes. Utifran resultaten fran forsoken kan den aktuella kapaciteten raknas fram. Dessutom har det visats att spanningsfallet och intressanta delar av impedansspektrumet har ett linjart samband. Som en tredje metod undersoktes det hur val tiden som batteriet laddas med konstant spanning stammer overens med den aktuella kapaciteten. Samtliga metoder som har testats for att mata SOH fungerar. De har dock olika for- och nackdelar om de skulle implementeras i verktygssystemet. In {{order to}} determine the SOC (State-Of-Charge) and the SOH (State-Of-Health) more accurately in battery powered nutrunners made by Atlas Copco, a literature study of the most common methods has been conducted. From the literature study one method for the measurement of the SOC and three methods for the measurement of the SOH were chosen. In order to apply these methods in reality, certain criteria must be fulfilled. Since the battery is discharged with high current pulses the series resistance from the battery is not allowed to increase during the measurements. Furthermore the <b>nutrunner</b> has an integrated DSP and therefore the power can not be cut to do measurements. Also, the measurements can not in any way affect the tightening of the nut or interrupt the usage of the <b>nutrunner.</b> The fundamental part of the thesis is increasing the understanding of lithium-ion batteries by studying their inner structure and basic chemistry and physics like thermodynamic- and kinetic relations. The phenomena which cause energy- and capacity losses are also evaluated. From that knowledge an equivalent electric model explaining the behavior of the battery when charged or discharged, is made. In the method for the SOC measurements an evaluation of how well the relax potential between the tightenings correlate with the SOC. By using an algorithm which compensates for how the cell is discharged the remaining tightenings in percentage can be calculated whit high accuracy. Furthermore important information of when a cell should bee considered empty has been found. The first method for measurements of the SOH determines how the changes in the impedance spectrum correlate with the actual capacity. It has also been shown that only measurements of single frequencies are needed in {{order to determine}} the SOH. In the second method experiments were made where the battery was discharged with two current pulses and the voltage drop in the second pulse was measured. From the voltage drop measurements the actual capacity can be calculated. Furthermore it has been shown that the relation between the voltage drop and interesting parts of the impedance spectrum is linear. As a third method the correlation between the time that the battery is charged with constant voltage and the actual capacity was evaluated. All three methods for measurements of the SOH have been concluded working. They would, however, all have different pros and cons if implemented in the tool system...|$|E
50|$|A rundown fixture, {{also known}} as a joint simulator, is used during the {{calibration}} process to help test power tools (electric screwdrivers, air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, <b>nutrunners,</b> etc.). A joint simulator is placed on top of the transducers. An adapter bit is inserted into the power tool and is mated to top of the joint simulator. By using springs of different stiffness or stacking Belleville washers in set patterns, the joint simulator can replicate soft, medium, or hard joints. This is important when trying to repeat how a tool may be used on an actual process.|$|R
40|$|Atlas Copco Tools & Assembly Systems (ACTA) {{is world}} leader in {{industrial}} tools and assembly systems for safety-critical joints. One of the products the company sells is fixtured <b>nutrunners,</b> mainly to the motor vehicle industry. The margins on these highly customized products have been decreasing – much depending on changes in the purchasing behavior of the automotive industry. Traditionally, the marketing of the fixtured <b>nutrunners</b> has been concentrated to {{the parts of the}} product instead of the final product. Today, there is a belief within the organization that many of the sold customized products could be replaced by more standardized applications. There is also a wish to turn the focus of the market offer from the parts towards the final application. These beliefs and wishes resulted in this thesis, with the purpose to propose a new market offer to increase profitability and give more customer benefits. To reach this purpose we started out with theoretical studies of several different areas. Among those was mass customization, a strategy that combines the benefits of mass production with those of customization. We also performed a prestudy at the headquarters of ACTA in Sickla and visited major customers in Sweden. Using our collected knowledge from the theoretical studies and the prestudy, we conducted an in-depth case study by interviewing customers and people working at ACTA, both in Sweden and in the USA, in order to analyze today’s situation. In the analysis, we found several problems with today’s offer. For instance, we found that similar products are solved with unique solutions, which has lead to poor cost control and has made it difficult for ACTA to assure the quality of the ordered products. A further problem is the poor sales support and the lack of traceability of sold systems, which reduces sales and leads to unnecessary special solutions. A problem linked to that is the difficulties in getting accurate and sufficient information from the customer, which leads to extra errors and a lot of extra work. To solve these problems, we recommend ACTA to implement a mass customization strategy. Of course, not all of ACTA’s products can be mass customized, but to a large extent it should be possible. To implement a mass customization strategy, we argue that ACTA should take three measures, namely design standard products, modularize the products, and implement a computerized configuration tool. We also suggest that the implementation of the new market offer should be done stepwise. With the proposed new market offer, we believe that ACTA can increase profitability in the area of fixtured <b>nutrunners</b> without losing the flexibility of the products...|$|R
40|$|Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} are common among workers who use powered hand held tools in assembly industry. The {{present study was}} carried out at a bus assembly plant where pneumatic <b>nutrunners</b> are the dominant powered hand tool. The activity in five muscles was measured for different phases of the securing, comparing soft and stiff joints, three different joint positions, and two powered tools. Tne aims were to characterize the muscular load during usage of the chosen tools, {{and to be able}} to provide relevant information to the production engineers, who were to design a new production system. The variance in muscular activity was large, both within subjects and between the mean CUIV~S of different subjects. Still, it was possible to obtain characteristic shapes of EMG curves sampled under different conditions. EMG peaks were seen in the hand extensor muscles for the right-angled tool. Joint position strongly contributed to differences in muscular activity in all muscles, which together with the fmdtig that the tools made very small differences, were regarded as the most valuable results for the production engineers. 5 - 2...|$|R

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate different methods for planetary gear fault detection. An initial background study was performed to investigate previous research within the field. Then tests were performed in a test rig where the Normalised Summation of Dierence Spectrum (NSDS) and Filtered Root Mean Square (FRMS), calculated from the measured transversal andtorsional vibration, were used as indicators of the gears health state. The results from the tests indicated that the NSDS and FRMS were decient as indicators of initial gear faults. However, similar behaviour in the torsional vibration could be observed for different gears with the same fault mode, where the amplitude in one of the sidebands to the mesh frequency increased signicantly before the gears failed...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary quality {{issues in}} product design are moving from materialistic to {{emotional}} user fulfillment; comprehensive {{research is needed}} to examine quality product feelings. This research is directed toward a deeper understanding of user and customer quality feelings for different product types, including services. The quality feelings concept includes dimensions of product quality, especially functionality, ergonomics and aesthetics. The first objective of this thesis is to identify, prioritize and synthesize quality feelings into product attributes in product development applications. The second objective is to explore, test and propose methodological approaches for designing quality feelings into products. Several methods from psychology, ergonomics, statistics and probabilistic methods and heuristics were applied to achieve the objectives. From a methodological viewpoint, Likert scales, free elicitation technique and Just About Right scales were applied for data collection. Multiple Regression, Factor Analysis, Correspondence Analysis, Genetic algorithms, Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Rough Sets (RS) were applied for data analyses. For ergonomic product evaluations, direct observations, 3 D workload simulations, time and frequency analyses were conducted. Five product applications are included in this thesis: operator driver cabin design of reach trucks, steering wheel design trigger switch design in right-angled <b>nutrunners,</b> bed-making systemsproducts and waiting room environments. Heuristic methods were found effective when there is a high number of product attributes that interact to provide quality feelings. RS results are consistent with PLS attribute predictions. When the number of product attributes is large in comparison to the number of observations, PLS extracts informative results for quality feelings. The RS method is effective in identifying interactions among design attributes. Quality feelings are associated with both tangible (tactile characteristics) and intangible (quick and easy to use) product characteristics. Words such as safety, functionality, ergonomics, comfort, reliability, supportiveness, usability, feedback, pleasantness, attractiveness, durability and distinctiveness describe quality feelings from tangible products and services. Based on product type, the quality dimensions represented by these words possess different interactions and dependencies. In work environments, products act as prostheses between workers for social interaction, which need to be considered as important quality feelings dimensions. QC 2011101...|$|R
