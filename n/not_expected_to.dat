5|$|By mid-1944, {{his health}} had {{deteriorated}} {{to the extent}} that he was evacuated to Australia, and for a time was <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> live. By early 1945 he had recovered sufficiently to be appointed to command the 6th Division. While flying to assume this new command, the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft he was travelling in crashed into the sea, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Conroy delayed {{implementing}} the plan pending a 12-month review into how refused classification content was rated. The proposal is <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> go forward {{due to the}} opposition from The Coalition and the Greens. Internet service providers Telstra and Optus have both agreed to voluntarily block some content.|$|E

5|$|Ruth {{spent part}} of the offseason of 1925–26 working out at Artie McGovern's gym, where he got back into shape. Barrow and Huggins had rebuilt the team and {{surrounded}} the veteran core with good young players like Tony Lazzeri and Lou Gehrig, but the Yankees were <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> win the pennant.|$|E
5|$|The Czech Republic were <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> make {{an impact}} against the favoured Germany side in their opening match; Nedvěd missed two scoring chances {{and was one of}} ten players to receive a yellow card as Germany won 2–0. However, he contributed defensively, {{clearing}} a goal-bound shot from Christian Ziege off the line.|$|E

5|$|The small {{particles}} in the smoke contained hydrocarbons, which can be an irritant but have a low toxicity and were <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> cause any long-term harm.

The first, led by Lieutenant Colonel Carpenter in charge of Troop H & I of the 10th Cavalry Regiment, relieved Forsyth on September 25.

5|$|Training {{camp was}} <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be long if there {{ended up being}} a season. Some players {{organized}} workouts for their teams to build team chemistry.

5|$|A {{survey of}} New York {{businesses}} found {{an increase of}} 8.5 percent in health care costs, less than the prior year's survey had expected. A 10 percent increase was expected for 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to reduce their workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most of them are <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he {{would be forced to}} stop.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt was <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> {{make the}} Kansas City Royals' roster in 2002, {{but he was}} added to the bullpen after he had an 0.64 ERA and {{fourteen}} strikeouts (to go with just two walks) in fourteen innings in Spring training. His major league debut came on April 6 against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched two innings, giving up three hits and a run in a 140 loss. On April 24, Affeldt picked up his first major league win by pitching 3.2 innings of relief in an 82 win over the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{chest pains}} following the team's 27–17 {{victory over the}} New Orleans Saints on December 13, Reeves underwent quadruple bypass surgery. The team was coached by defensive coordinator Rich Brooks for the final two regular season games. Reeves was {{able to return to}} the team in time for their first playoff game, in which the Falcons beat their division rival, the San Francisco 49ers, to clinch a spot in the Conference Championship. Despite an impressive season, they were <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> match up well against the Vikings, who had beaten teams by an average of 23.22 points at home that year and were installed as 11-point favorites for the Championship Game.|$|E

5|$|After the February Revolution, the {{condition}} of the ships was assessed on 28 April 1917. The ship that was furthest along was the Ismail: her hull, engines, and boilers were around 65% complete, and her armour was 36% complete. Her turrets, however, were <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be completed until 1919. The Congress of Shipyard Workers decided to continue work on the Izmail in mid-1917, but only to provide jobs. The Provisional Government halted all work on Borodino, Kinburn, and Navarin on 24 October 1917, and the Soviet Supreme Naval College ordered work on Izmail halted on 14 December 1917.|$|E
5|$|Although the European Space Agency's current Gaia {{mission was}} <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> produce good results for stars {{brighter}} than the approximately V=6 saturation limit of the mission's instruments, actual operation has shown good performance on objects to about magnitude +3. Forced observations of brighter stars mean that final results should be available for all bright stars and a parallax for Betelgeuse will be published {{an order of magnitude}} more accurate than currently available.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, the United States National Helium Reserve {{accounted}} for 30 {{percent of the}} world's helium. The reserve was expected {{to run out of}} helium in 2018. Despite that, a proposed bill in the United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were <b>not</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> ease the shortage.|$|E
