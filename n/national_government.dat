40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{incentives}} to unbundle operations and infrastructure in the railway industry in a two-country model with international network {{effects from the}} viewpoint of <b>national</b> <b>governments.</b> The analysis shows that the decision to unbundle institutionally or organizationally with separated accounts depends crucially on the importance of cross-border transportation. For a sufficiently high importance of cross-border transportation, <b>national</b> <b>governments</b> choose accounting separation. However, <b>national</b> <b>governments</b> are stuck in a Prisoners' dilemma and would be better off coordinating on a separated industry structure. This result justifies major policy initiatives by the European Union but explains also actions of <b>national</b> <b>governments</b> in implementing these initiatives...|$|R
5|$|In 1931, the MacDonald Government faced {{a serious}} crisis, as the May Report {{revealed}} that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120million. As this information became public, there was a run on the pound, depleting the nation's gold reserves. The Labour Party refused to consider the massive cuts in unemployment compensation which {{would be needed to}} balance the budget, and Prime Minister MacDonald sought support from outside his party. With Baldwin on holiday in France, Chamberlain negotiated for the Conservatives. Chamberlain told MacDonald that the Conservatives would only join a coalition if the full recommended cuts in unemployment compensation were made. Finally, on 24 August 1931, the Labour Government resigned and MacDonald formed a <b>National</b> <b>Government,</b> supported by most Conservative and Liberal MPs and a minority of the Labour Party. Chamberlain once more returned to the Ministry of Health. The <b>National</b> <b>Government</b> was intended as only a temporary expedient, but governed Britain until Chamberlain's fall in 1940. In the ensuing General Election, the <b>National</b> <b>Government</b> won 554 of the 615seats in the House of Commons, with 473 of its supporters Conservative MPs.|$|E

40|$|General integrationist models {{underline}} {{conflicts between}} the Commission and <b>national</b> <b>governments.</b> They cite telecommunications as an exemplar of the Commission imposing its choices on unwilling member states. However, a close examination {{of the development of}} substantive EC regulation in telecommunications shows that the Commission and <b>national</b> <b>governments</b> acted in partnership. Major conflicts concerned constitutional issues rather than substantive ones. How and why the partnership came to exist is analyzed using a principalagent framework. The paper argues that formal and informal institutional controls made the Commission very sensitive to the preferences of <b>national</b> <b>governments</b> in substantive EC telecommunications regulation. Four processes of decision making whereby both formal controls and less formal institutions (norms) operated to prevent agency losses for governments are found: the participation of <b>national</b> <b>governments</b> at all stages of decision making; incrementalism; compromises and linkages; national discretion in implementation. Effective controls resulted, through these processes, in partnership between the Commission and <b>national</b> <b>governments</b> in developing substantive EC regulation...|$|R
