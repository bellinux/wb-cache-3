5|$|The {{composition}} of the striking force was broadly {{similar to that used}} in the earlier operations targeting Tirpitz. Formidable embarked No. 8 Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Wing, whose 827 and 830 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadrons each operated 12 Barracudas, as well as 1841 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron, which was equipped with 18 Corsairs. Indefatigable carried No. 9 Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Wing, which was also equipped with 24 Barracudas split between 820 and 826 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadrons, as well as the Seafire-equipped 894 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron and 1770 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron's 12 Fairey Firefly fighters. In a change from her role in the previous attacks, Furious did not embark any Barracudas during Operation Mascot, and instead operated 20 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters from 1840 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron, three Seafires assigned to 880 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron and three 842 Flight Fairey Swordfish anti-submarine aircraft.|$|E

The first production aircraft was delivered to RNAS Yeovilton in 1979 to form an Intensive Flying Trials Unit (also known as 700A <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron). In March 1980 the Intensive Flying Trials Unit became 899 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron and would act as the landborne headquarters unit for the type. The first operational squadron 800 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron was also formed in March 1980 initially to operate from HMS Invincible before it transferred to HMS Hermes. In January 1981, a second operation squadron 801 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron was formed to operate from HMS Invincible.|$|E

On completion of his basic training in November 1941, he was selected as a pilot, and moved to <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Station Atlanta, Georgia in February 1942. He was placed on active duty just before the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into World War II. Completing his initial pilot training and transferring to <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Station Jacksonville, Florida for the next phase, he started flight training in the AT-6 Texan. He also qualified to fly in the N3N Canary trainer aircraft. His final phase of flight lessons occurred in <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Station Miami in Miami, Florida, where he flew the Grumman F3F, a biplane which was the Navy's most advanced trainer at the time. Bolt completed this training on 18 July 1942, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps, receiving his aviator wings that day as well.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy {{assembled}} {{a powerful force}} for Operation Tungsten. The main striking force {{was made up of}} two wings of Barracudas: 8 Wing comprising 827 and 830 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadrons, and 52 Wing with 829 and 831 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadrons. While 8 Wing was normally based on board Furious and 52 Wing on Victorious, Moore chose to station a squadron from each of the wings on each carrier so they could launch simultaneously and go into battle as formed units. The 163 Fleet Air Arm airmen in the attacking units included 28 New Zealanders, three Canadians, two Australians, and one South African; the remainder were British.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} of {{the second}} wave took to the air at 5:25 am. One of 829 Squadron's Barracudas crashed shortly after take-off, resulting {{in the deaths of}} its crew of three, and another aircraft from this squadron was not launched due to engine problems. Only two of the Barracudas in this wave were armed with 1,600-pound bombs. As with the first strike, 40 fighters accompanied the torpedo bombers; these comprised 10 Corsairs from 1834 and 1836 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadrons, all of the 20 Wildcats assigned to 896 and 898 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadrons and 10 Hellcats from 804 <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Squadron. All aircraft were launched by 5:37 am, and the force had an uneventful flight to the Kaafjord area. While the German defences were now alert, the artificial smoke screen being generated around Kaafjord was not yet sufficient to hide Tirpitz from view.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{units in}} the Greek Armed Forces were formed in June 1912.

After participation in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) a long period of peace followed during which the <b>Naval</b> <b>Air</b> Service was reorganized and upgraded, especially with the establishment of the State Aircraft Factory, which manufactured various types of aircraft.
