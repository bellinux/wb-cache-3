40|$|Generally {{surnames}} (family name) or forenames are {{evolved over}} generations {{which can be}} used to understand population origins, migration, identity, social norms and cultural customs. These forenames or surnames may have hidden structure associated with them called communities. Each community might have strong correlation among several <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> surnames. In addition, the correlation might be across communities of forenames or surnames. Popular statistical generative model such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been developed to find topics in a corpus of documents. However, the LDA model can be proposed to identify hidden communities in names data set. This paper proposes several variants of latent Dirichlet allocation models to capture correlation between surnames <b>and</b> <b>forenames</b> within the communities and across the communities over a set of names collected at different locations. Initially, we propose surname correlated LDA model <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> correlated LDA model. These models identify communities in surnames or <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> extract corresponding correlated forenames or surnames in each community respectively. Later, we propose surname community correlated LDA model <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> community correlated LDA model. These models estimate correlation among each surname community to the communities of <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> vice versa respectively.

40|$|The article {{presents}} an exploratory {{analysis of the}} significance of personal names in contemporary Western societies, the UK in particular. Names are seen as hav-ing the dual character of denoting the individuality of the person, and also mark-ing social connections. The focus is particularly on kinship, {{and the ways in which}} <b>names</b> can be, <b>and</b> are, used to map family connections as well as to identify unique individuals. The author argues that both surnames <b>and</b> <b>forenames</b> can serve to ground the individual within family relationships, though the extent to which this is used actively can vary. In turn the way in which <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>naming</b> are used within the family context sheds light upon contemporary kinship, with its enduring and variable dimensions. Additional empirical exploration of <b>names</b> <b>and</b> <b>naming</b> could further illuminate its characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} list of <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> {{surnames}} of South Asian (SA) women {{that could be used to}} identify SA breast cancer patients within the cancer registry. This list was compiled, evaluated, and validated to ensure comprehensiveness, accuracy, and applicability of SA names. Methods: This project was conducted by Canadian researchers who are immersed in conducting behavioral studies with SA women diagnosed with cancer in the province of British Columbia. Recruiting SA cancer patients for research can be a difficult task due to social and cultural factors. Methods used by other researchers to identify ethnicity related unique names were employed to filter surnames <b>and</b> <b>forenames</b> that were not common to this ethnic group. Co-author (Gurpreet Oshan) of SA ethnicity rigorously identified and deleted multiple lists and redundant entries along with common English forenames which resulted in a list of 16, 888 SA forenames. All co-authors of Indian ethnicity (Gurpreet Oshan, Savitri Singh-Carlson, Harajit Lail) were involved in critiquing and manually reviewing the names list throughout this process. Comprehensive lists of SA surnames <b>and</b> women′s <b>forenames</b> were reviewed to identify those that were unique to SA ethnicity. Accuracy was ensured by constantly filtering the redundancy by using an Excel program which helped to illustrate the number of times each name was spelled in different ways. Results: The final lists included 9112 surnames <b>and</b> 16, 888 <b>forenames</b> of SA ethnicity. On the basis of the surname linkage only, the sensitivity of the list was 76. 6 %, specificity was 62. 9 %, and the positive predictive value was 58. 5 %. On the basis of both the surname <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> linkage, the specificity of the list was 88. 6 %. These lists include variations in spelling <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> surnames as well. Conclusions: The list of surnames <b>and</b> <b>forenames</b> can be useful tools to identify SA ethnic groups from large population database in healthcare-related research. Ethnicity-specific population research is important in order to help identify how cancer care should be delivered for the SA population, as well as for planning and provision of other related health services. We are willing to share this list upon request to the authors...|$|R

Complete and validate the Westminster Historical Database by including all extant poll book records together with selected rate book records for Westminster between 1749 and 1820; 2. Design and execute experiments on the practice of record linkage using historical sources; 3. Document the Westminster Historical Database and prepare a guide to its effective use; 4. Research and publish on voting behaviour and social structure in a pre-reform mass electorate; 5. Research and publish {{on the theme of}} continuity and change in the economy of Westminster between 1749 and 1820. Main Topics : The right of voting in Westminster constituency lay in adult male rate paying householders, and thousands of them participated in each of the 12 elections between 1749 and 1820. The database contains individual-level data on pre-reform electoral behaviour for the constituency between 1749 and 1820, and consists of 23 two-way tables in standard relational format. Of these, 12 are electronic editions of the surviving Westminster Poll Books for the years between 1749 and 1820, enhanced through the addition of supplementary <b>name</b> <b>and</b> occupational codes. A further 9 tables are versions of selected Westminster Parish Rate Books which compliment the Poll Book tables and which, through record linkage, enable a much fuller representation to be made of Westminster's voters, their social standing and political preferences. The remaining two tables contain coding schema for <b>names</b> <b>and</b> occupations respectively. Each poll book record contains data on the surname <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> of the voter, his parish and street of residence, his occupation, his vote, <b>and</b> additional <b>name</b> <b>and</b> occupational codes. Each rate book record consists of the surname <b>and</b> <b>forename</b> of the householder, together with the parish, ward and street within which the property lay, its rack rental assessment, <b>and</b> additional <b>name</b> <b>and</b> occupational codes...|$|R

40|$|Names, as proper nouns, {{are clearly}} {{important}} for the identification of individuals in everyday life. In the present article, I argue that <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> surnames need also {{to be recognized as}} “doing” words, important in the categorization of sex at birth and in the ongoing management of gender conduct appropriate to sex category. Using evidence on personal naming practices in the United States and United Kingdom, I examine what happens at crisis points of sexed <b>and</b> gendered <b>naming</b> in the life course (for example, at the birth of babies, at marriage, and during gender-identity transitions). I show how <b>forenames</b> <b>and</b> surnames help in the embodied doing of gender and, likewise, that bodies are key to gendered practices of <b>forenaming</b> <b>and</b> surnaming: we have “gendered embodied named identities. ” Whether normative and compliant, pragmatic, or creative <b>and</b> resistant, <b>forenaming</b> <b>and</b> surnaming practices are revealed as core to the production and reproduction of binary sex categories and to gendered identities, difference, hierarchies, and inequalities.
