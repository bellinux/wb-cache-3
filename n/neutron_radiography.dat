40|$|The Time-Resolved Integrative Optical Neutron (TRION) {{detector}} {{was developed}} for Fast <b>Neutron</b> Resonance <b>Radiography</b> (FNRR), a fast-neutron transmission imaging method that exploits characteristic energy-variations of the total scattering cross-section in the En = 1 - 10 MeV range to detect specific elements within a radiographed object. As opposed to classical event-counting time of flight (ECTOF), it integrates the detector signal during a well-defined neutron Time of Flight window corresponding to a pre-selected energy bin, e. g., the energy-interval spanning a cross-section resonance of an element such as C, O and N. The integrative characteristic of the detector permits loss-free operation at very intense, pulsed neutron fluxes, at a cost however, of recorded temporal resolution degradation. This work presents a theoretical and experimental evaluation of detector related parameters which affect temporal resolution of the TRION system.

40|$|Introduction: Radioactive waste has {{to undergo}} a process of quality {{checking}} in order to check its conformance with national regulations prior to its transport, intermediate storage and final disposal. Within the quality checking of radioactive waste packages non-destructive assays are required to characterize their radiotoxic and chemotoxic contents. In a cooperation framework Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH, RWTH Aachen University and Siemens AG are studying the feasibility of a compact Neutron Imaging System for Radioactive waste Analysis (NISRA) using 14 MeV neutrons. Fast neutron imaging is a promising technique to assay large and dense items providing in complementarity to photon imaging additional information {{on the presence of}} structures in radioactive waste packages. However due to the low neutron emission of neutron generators the challenging task resides in the development of an imaging detector with a high efficiency, a low sensitivity to gamma radiation and a resolution sufficient for the purpose. Setup: The setup of the experiment is shown in Figure 1. The 14 MeV neutrons are produced by a D-T neutron generator. Neutron detection is achieved using a 40 x 40 cm² amorphous silicon (aSi) flat panel detector linked to a plastic scintillator. The detector thermal noise was reduced by employing an entrance windows made of aluminium. The optimal gain and integration time were obtained by measuring the response of the detector to the radiation of a 241 Am source. Performance Tests: First test measurements were carried out with different materials made of Al, C, Fe, Pb, W, concrete and polyethylene (50 x 80 x 100 mm³). Each sample was irradiated with PE as a reference. Data analysis was performed with a homemade algorithm which allows determining a value related to the neutron absorption. Results: First <b>neutron</b> <b>radiographies</b> were successfully recorded despite the low detector efficiency and low neutron intensity. In addition the correlation between the absorption and measured signal attenuation was determined and is shown in figure 2. The measurements and results will be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{is one of}} {{the eldest}} {{crafting}} and building materials as proven by remnants in many archaeological excavations. Particularly in subjects of cultural heritage radiographic technologies are the appropriate non-destructive methods to gain insight without dissembling or even touching the specimen. X-rays or gamma radiation may be the appropriate tools, except in cases of any metal shielding or encapsulation that makes any wooden structure inaccessible to X-ray inspection. This problem has been resolved by applying <b>neutrons</b> for <b>radiography</b> and tomography. Since neutrons are prone to scattering, they need a certain minimum velocity passing straight through the sample volume. A beam-line complying with these requirements is available in the form of fission neutrons at the nuclear research reactor of the Technische Universität München in Garching/Munich (FRM II, NECTAR).

40|$|AbstractDigital <b>neutron</b> imaging (<b>radiography</b> and tomography) is a {{powerful}} non-destructive analytical tool and has demonstrated its importance in industrial and research application worldwide. The standardization process, to certify digital neutron imaging as a standard practice in industry, entails standardized test phantoms to be evaluated.

Standard test phantoms are objects with physical features designed to test the capability of an imaging setup to reveal these features without any ambiguity. The good practice enables the acceptable assessment of different international digital neutron imaging facilities for spatial resolution and contrast abilities. The purpose of this contribution is to establish good practice for the experimental setup, acquiring of 2 -D digital projections and the reconstruction process of the 3 -D digital images of standard test phantoms for spatial resolution and contrast.

In this study we have analyzed in detail, using Monte-Carlo calculations and experimentally determined parameters, all the processes that influence the signal and noise in the TRION detector. In contrast to event-counting detectors where the signal-to-noise ratio is dependent only on the number of detected events (quantum noise), in an energy-integrating detector additional factors, such as the fluctuations in imparted energy, number of photoelectrons, system gain and other factors will contribute to the noise. The excess noise factor (over the quantum noise) due to these processes was 4. 3, 2. 7, 2. 1, 1. 9 and 1. 9 for incident neutron energies of 2, 4, 7. 5, 10 and 14 MeV, respectively. It is shown that, even under ideal light collection conditions, a fast neutron detection system operating in an integrative mode cannot be quantum-noise-limited due to the relatively large variance in the imparted proton energy and the resulting scintillation light distributions.

The experiments {{have been carried out}} at the high-intensity, white-beam facility of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany, using an multi-frame, time-resolved detector developed for fast <b>neutron</b> resonance <b>radiography.</b> The results were however not fully optimal and therefore we have decided to modify the detector and optimize it for the given application, which is described in the present work. Furthermore, we managed to improve the image post-processing methodology and the noise suppression. Using the tailored detector and the improved post-processing significant increase in the image quality and an order of magnitude lower exposure times, down to 3. 33 ms, have been achieved with minimized motion artifacts. Similar to the previous study, different two-phase flow regimes such as bubbly slug and churn flows have been examined. The enhanced imaging quality enables an improved prediction of two-phase flow parameters like the instantaneous volumetric gas fraction, bubble size and bubble velocities. Instantaneous velocity fields around the gas enclosures can also be more robustly predicted using optical flow methods as previously.

40|$|AbstractFast <b>neutron</b> {{resonance}} <b>radiography</b> (FNRR) is an {{imaging method}} that exploits characteristic cross-section structures (peaks and troughs) of certainelements in the energy-range of 1 - 10 MeV to identify materials {{in a large}} volume object. In FNRR, the neutron energy spectrum transmitted through an object carries information about the elemental composition of thatobject. The principal elements present in most explosives are: carbon, oxygen, nitrogen andhydrogen. Explosives are characterized by high fractions of nitrogen and oxygen as well as low fractions of carbon and hydrogencompared to benign materials. Detection of explosives in cargo employing FNRRis based on determination of the local areal densities of these four elements and their ratios. In our measurements, the transmission spectrum is usually divided in 100 - 500 energy bins, representing 100 - 500 linear equations containing four unknown areal densities of HCNO. This is an overdetermined problem, which allows us to derive not only the fourexpectation values of their areal densitiesbut theirprobability distribution as well. For this purpose, a model was formulated and implemented within a software package which performs Bayesian analysis of complex statistical models using Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). This model was tested successfully both on simulated and experimental data.
