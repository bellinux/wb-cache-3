In this study, effect of chill formation {{on the surface of}} grey and <b>nodular</b> cast <b>irons</b> is investigated on the wear behavior, hardness, impact toughness and microstructure of grey and <b>nodular</b> cast <b>irons.</b> For this purpose, four types cam shaft made of grey cast iron with and without chill on the surfaces and <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron</b> with and without chill on the surfaces, were casted. Mechanical tests were conducted after the camshafts have been produced by casting method. Surface hardness and wear resistance of grey and <b>nodular</b> cast <b>irons</b> have been improved by chill formation on the surfaces and it is concluded that the amount of wear on the surfaces of grey cast iron with chill and <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron</b> with chill is almost the same. Maximum hardness value was obtained on the surface of grey cast iron with chill. The impact toughness has been found to decrease by chill formation. Maximum impact toughness value was obtained on <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron.</b> Microstructures of grey cast iron with and without chill and <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron</b> with and without chill were examined under optical microscope and worn surfaces of cast irons were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Wear mechanisms of the four types of cast iron were evaluated by SEM examination. Keywords:  Cam shafts, Cast irons, Chill formation, Mechanical properties, Microstructure</span...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{continuous}} demand for low-cost <b>nodular</b> cast <b>irons</b> with improved mechanical properties, this being an industrial requirement both for pearlitic {{as well as}} for ferritic grades. Developments in pearlitic <b>nodular</b> <b>irons</b> should lead to alloys with higher and higher strength while retaining some ductility in the as-cast state so as to respond to demands related to castings for high power automotive engines in competition with steel castings and ADI. According to these aims, several alloying elements have been selected and added separately or combined to standard commercial <b>nodular</b> cast <b>irons.</b> In all cases, only low-level additions were made and their effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties at room temperature have been characterized and are discussed.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the toughness of <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron,</b> the flow stress have been studied numerically by using Gurson's model considering that <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron</b> can be regarded as a porous material. The damaged zone ahead of the crack tip is studied by SEM observations on the pre-polished surface of a CT 25 specimen, before and after ductile tearing. It is shown that the damaged zone is very large in the GGG 40 <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron</b> (through almost the whole ligament ahead of the crack), so the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics is not valid in <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron</b> for small specimens. The force versus crack opening displacement curves calculated in 2 D for plane strain and plane stress conditions give respectively an upper and a lower limit as compared with the experimental curve. Only 3 D calculations lead to a good fît with the experimental curve. This result shows that the stress state ahead of the crack tip of a <b>nodular</b> cast <b>iron</b> is intermediate between plane stress and plane strain conditions, due to the high density of voids inside the damaged material...|$|R
