Other centrosaurines often {{had a pair of}} horns above the eyes and a long horn on the snout. Adult Achelousaurus instead had rough bosses in the same positions. These bumps were covered by a thick layer of keratin. According to some scientists the bosses were used in fights, with the animals butting each other's heads.|$|R

The type species, Diabloceratops eatoni, was named and described in 2010 by James Ian Kirkland and Donald DeBlieux.|$|E
50|$|Liaoceratops {{is rather}} small, with a holotype skull length of 154 millimetres, {{weighing}} an estimated seven pounds and possessing only jugal horns {{and a small}} skull frill, lacking the orbital horns and true <b>neck</b> <b>shield</b> that characterized later ceratopsians. However, these features help understand a major split {{in the evolution of}} ceratopsians. Long before the familiar Triceratops evolved in North America, the ceratopsian lineage branched into two lines: the neoceratopsians, the main lineage that includes the recognizable horned and frilled forms, and of which Liaoceratops in 2002 was the most basal known member, and the Psittacosauridae, a radiation of smaller, parrot-beaked dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} flat skull frill has {{a triangular}} profile in top view, with slightly convex sides and diverging rear corners {{separated by a}} broad notch on the rear edge. The structure is pierced by large elongated openings, the parietal fenestrae. The frill of Spiclypeus features a unique pattern of skin ossifications or osteoderms ornamenting its edge. The side bones of the <b>neck</b> <b>shield,</b> the squamosals, bear episquamosals, with the holotype individual six {{on the left side}} and seven on the right side. The front episquamosal projects into the jugal notch between the frill and the cheek elements and forms a triangle six to seven centimetres in length. More to the rear, the episquamosals gradually become wider and lower, but ultimately increase in length again.|$|E
500|$|Horned dinosaurs mainly {{differ from}} each other in their horns, which are located on the snout and above the eyes, and in the large skull frill, which covers the <b>neck</b> like a <b>shield.</b> Achelousaurus {{exhibited}} the build of derived ("advanced") centrosaurines, which are typified by short brow horns or bosses, combined with elaborate frill spikes. The general frill proportions are typically centrosaurine, with a wide rounded squamosal bone at the side, which expanded towards the rear. It also shares the typical frill curvature with a top surface that is [...] from side to side and concave from front to rear.|$|R

Clad in white armour {{that had been}} sent to him as a present from the queen, a sign and a token of her good wishes for his success in his combat with Morella, wearing the insignia of a Knight of St. James hanging by a ribbon from his <b>neck,</b> his <b>shield</b> emblazoned with his coat of the stooping falcon, which appeared also upon the white cloak that hung from his shoulders, behind him a squire of high degree, who carried his plumed casque and lance, and accompanied by an escort of the royal guards, Peter rode from his quarters in the prison to the palace gates, and waited there as he had been bidden. Presently they opened, and through them, seated on a palfrey, appeared Margaret, wonderfully attired in white and silver, but with her veil lifted so that her face could be seen. She was companioned by a troop of maidens mounted, all of them, on white horses, and at her side, almost outshining her in glory of apparel, and attended by all her household, rode Betty, Marchioness of Morella--at any rate for that present time.|$|R
5000|$|The holotype {{represents}} a rather small individual. The squamosal has, measured along the outer curve, {{a length of}} fifty-seven centimetres and a width of thirty-eight centimetres. There are six episquamosalia. The juvenile status is confirmed by the short and wide squamosal, a short snout and the epinasal not being fused. At {{the base of the}} nasal horn, in a crescent-shaped depression, the contact facet with the nasal bone is visible, seeming to imply the horn is a separate ossification that Lambe in 1915 coined the [...] "epinasal". The brow horns of Eoceratops are markedly longer than those of Chasmosaurus and with a length of 216 millimetres attaining twice their base length. The brow horns are curved to the rear. Lambe assumed that this curvature would not change during growth and thus was a valid distinguishing trait of the taxon. Today however, it is understood that the horn curvature in chasmosaurines typically reorients itself to the front when an adult age is reached. The squamosal side of the <b>neck</b> <b>shield</b> is strongly hooked in front, a basal trait.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Nodosaurinae {{was originally}} named by Othenio Abel in 1919. It originally included Ankylosaurus, from the Upper Cretaceous of North America, possibly Hierosaurus, and Stegopelta, from North America also. It {{was found to}} be very specialized and peculiar by Abel. Abel mentioned that the <b>neck</b> <b>shield</b> found in ceratopsians was very different from all nodosaurines, and that only the neck spines are present in Nodosaurinae. The body of nodosaurines is completely covered in strong armour plates, with a similar shape to tiles, and are lined up along the body. A large degree of pubic reduction was found in nodosaurines, a feature that is also found in Stegosaurus and Triceratops. Nodosaurines were all quadrupedal, and lived that way for their whole life. Quadrupedalism {{was found to be}} a feature in Stegosauridae, Ceratopsidae, and Acanthopholidae. It was unused for a long time, but in 2013 during the description of a new basal nodosaurid, Europelta, and the redefinition of Struthiosaurinae, James Kirkland and his colleagues found all North American nodosaurids to represent the derived group Nodosaurinae, while all European nodosaurids made up the basal clade Struthiosaurinae.|$|E
50|$|The snout of Eotriceratops was {{relatively}} flat and elongated. The depressions {{on the sides}} of the praemaxillae were connected through an oval fenestra interpraemaxillaris; small rounded processes pointed to above and behind into this opening, originating from the front lower edges. The strut between this opening and the nostril was narrow in side view and transversely thickened with a straight rear edge. The processes jutting into the nostrils had hollow outer sides but were far less excavated and much higher than with Triceratops or Torosaurus. The maxilla bore at least thirty-five tooth positions. The nasal horn was low, situated above the nostril and slightly recurved. It had a narrow rear edge and a transversely flattened point. The horns above the eyes were forward-curving and have been estimated at about 80 cm long. The lower base of these horns was narrow and vertically directed, which with Triceratops is a juvenile trait. Three bite marks can be observed above the eye, near the base of the left horn, which were interpreted as traces of scavenging. The squamosal shows at least five episquamosals. Little has been preserved of the parietal bones forming the centre of the <b>neck</b> <b>shield.</b>|$|E
40|$|Hip {{resurfacing}} is {{an established}} treatment for osteoarthritis in young active patients. Failure modes include femoral neck fracture and prosthesis loosening, {{which may be}} associated with medium-term bone adaptation, including femoral neck narrowing and densification around the prosthesis stem. Finite element modelling was used to indicate the effects of prosthesis sizing and positioning on the bone remodelling and fracture strength under a range of normal and traumatic loads, with the aim of understanding these failure modes better. The simulations predicted increased superior femoral <b>neck</b> stress <b>shielding</b> in young patients with small prostheses, which required shortening of the femoral neck to give an acceptable implant–bone interface. However, with a larger prosthesis, natural femoral head centre recreation in the implanted state was possible; therefore stress shielding was restricted to the prosthesis interior, and its extent was less sensitive to prosthesis orientation. With valgus orientation, the implanted neck strength was, at worst, within 3 per cent of its intact strength. The study suggests that femoral neck narrowing may be linked to a reduction in the horizontal femoral offset, occurring if the prosthesis is excessively undersized. As such, hip resurfacing should aim to reproduce the natural femoral head centre, and, for valgus prosthesis orientation, to avoid femoral neck fracture...|$|R
60|$|For awhile {{there was}} silence; then from far away, without the high fence {{of the great}} place, there came a sound of singing, and through {{the gates of the}} kraal rushed two great men, wearing black plumes upon their heads, having black shields in their left hands, and in their right, one an axe and one a club; while about their {{shoulders}} were bound wolf-skins.

There was one preserved ring of scutes around the <b>neck.</b> A sacral <b>shield</b> is absent.

40|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} spatial and numerical cognitive impairments. We hypothesized that these nonverbal cognitive impairments result from limits in spatial and temporal processing, particularly as it affects attention. To examine spatiotemporal attention in girls with Turner syndrome versus typically developing controls, we used a multiple object tracking task during functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging. Participants actively tracked a target among six distracters or passively viewed the animations. Neural activation in girls with Turner syndrome during object tracking overlapped with but was dissimilar to the canonical frontoparietal network evident in typically developing controls and included greater limbic activity. Task performance and atypical functional activation indicate anomalous development of cortical and subcortical temporal and spatial processing circuits in girls with Turner syndrome. DOI: 10. 1352 / 1944 - 7558 - 115. 2. 140 Turner syndrome occurs in approximately 1 in 2, 500 live births and results from the complete or partial deletion of an X chromosome in a phenotypic female.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the primary purpose}} was to {{evaluate}} quantitative values using 15 O-labeled gases and 3 D-mode microPET. In 3 D-mode acquisition, the scatter fractions from {{both inside and outside}} the FOV can be problematic for quantitative evaluations. The high radioactivity of 15 O-labeled gases in the face mask, which is included in the FOV, reportedly affects the PET image in clinical situations [3, 4]. Using a clinical PET scanner, Ibaraki et al. reported the influence of random events and scatter coincidences from outside the FOV when using a 3 D-mode PET scanner as well as the utility of a <b>neck</b> <b>shield,</b> which improved the noise equivalent count ratio by reducing the scatter effects [4]. Hori et al. evaluated the influence of scatter from inside and outside the FOV on PET images and demonstrated the validity of using a 3 D PET scanner for 15 O-labeled gas-inhalation PET studies [3]. When using a microPET scanner with a long axial-FOV, such as Inveon for small animals, the main scatter source is located inside the FOV. Consequently, the increase in scattered and random events because of the high radioactivity in the lung can potentially affect the quantitative values. We evaluated the influence of scattered and random events in the lung on the radioactivity in the brain and found that it was relatively small when using a 3 D-mode microPET scanner with a long axial-FOV. In the lung phantom study, the increase in the radioactivity count for the whole brain was only 0.7 – 1.1 % in the 15 O-CO 2 study and 3.1 – 3.4 % in the 15 O-O 2 study (Additional file 1 : Figure S 4). Using clinical PET, quantitative studies can be performed using a 3 D PET scanner even though the scatter coincidence is larger in 3 D-mode than in 2 D-mode [12]. The scatter fractions of clinical PET scanners have been reported for both 2 D-mode and 3 D-mode (13.1 – 21.4 % and 31.8 – 45 %, respectively) [22 – 24]. The scatter fraction of the small animal PET scanner that was used in the present study was 17.2 % for a rat-sized phantom, which was equivalent to that of a clinical PET scanner used in the 2 D-mode [25]. In another report, Konik et al. investigated the relationship between the scatter fraction and an object’s size using a Monte-Carlo-based simulation and various sizes of digital phantoms [26]. The scatter fraction ranged from 12 to 25 % for rat-sized phantoms (phantom diameters of 3 – 9  cm) and from 26 to 46 % for human-sized phantoms (phantom diameters of 10 – 56  cm). For the small animal PET scanner, the scatter fraction increased linearly with the phantom diameter. The scatter fraction for small animal PET studies is less than that for human studies since the subject size is very small. In quantitative studies using a small animal 3 D PET scanner, the scatter fraction is roughly equivalent to that of the 2 D-mode using a clinical PET scanner. In the present study, we focused on the influence of the radioactivity in the lung which was considered to be problematic in a previous clinical study. As a result, the radioactivity in the lung and the tracheal tube was found to be relatively low, as shown in Fig. 4, and uptake in the myocardium or liver was comparable to the distribution in other PET studies, such as those for FDG PET. However, the influence of high radioactivity levels in other organs should be evaluated in a future study. Figure  4 showed a higher radioactivity in the brain using OSEM 3 D-MAP, compared to that using FBP and OSEM 2 D. However, the radioactivity in the body as determined using OSEM 3 D-MAP was lower than the levels determined using FBP and OSEM 2 D. Mannheim et al. reported that differences in object size and the reconstruction method influenced the quantitative accuracy [27]. The influence arising from the difference in object size between FBP and OSEM 2 D was minimal, but OSEM 3 D and MAP showed a different tendency than that of FBP and OSEM 2 D. Therefore, the radioactivity in the brain and the body trunk as evaluated using OSEM 3 D-MAP might exhibit a different tendency from the radioactivities determined using FBP and OSEM 2 D.|$|E

40|$|BAR domains {{can prevent}} {{membrane}} fission through {{their ability to}} <b>shield</b> <b>necks</b> of budding vesicles from fission-inducing factors. However, the physiological role of this inhibitory function and its regulation is unknown. Here we identify a checkpoint involving the BAR-domain-containing protein Arfaptin- 1 that controls biogenesis of secretory granules at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). We demonstrate that protein kinase D (PKD) phosphorylates Arfaptin- 1 at serine 132, which disrupts the ability of Arfaptin- 1 to inhibit the activity of ADP ribosylation factor, {{an important component of}} the vesicle scission machinery. The physiological significance of this regulatory mechanism is evidenced by loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion due to granule scission defects in pancreatic β cells expressing nonphosphorylatable Arfaptin- 1. Accordingly, depletion of Arfaptin- 1 leads to the generation of small nonfunctional secretory granules. Hence, PKD-mediated Arfaptin- 1 phosphorylation is necessary to ensure biogenesis of functional transport carriers at the TGN in regulated secretion...|$|R

60|$|The truth {{seems to}} have been that these Etruscan nations were {{weakened}} by a great new nation coming on them from the North. They were what the Romans called Galli or Gauls, one of the great races of the old stock which has always been finding its way westward into Europe, and they had their home north of the Alps, but they were always pressing on and on, and had long since made settlements in northern Italy. They were in clans, each obedient to one chief as a father, and joining together in one brotherhood. They had lands to which whole families had a common right, and when their numbers outgrew what the land could maintain, the bolder ones would set off with their wives, children, and cattle to find new homes. The Greeks and Romans themselves had begun first in the same way, and their tribes, and the claims of all to the common land, were the remains of the old way; but they had been settled in cities so long that this had been forgotten, and they were very different people from the wild men who spoke what we call Welsh, and wore checked tartan trews and plaids, with gold collars round their <b>necks,</b> round <b>shields,</b> huge broadswords, and their red or black hair long and shaggy. The Romans knew little or nothing about what passed beyond their own Apennines, and went on with their own quarrels.

The {{elephant}} seals: {{introduction to the}} genus The genus Mirounga comprises two species, the southern elephant seal (M. leonina) and the northern (M. angustirostris). Northern elephant seals breed in California and Baja California. They were hunted almost to extinction during the 19 th century, but after the introduction of protection laws in the United States and Mexico the species recovered at fast rate, and it is currently expanding outside its previous breeding range. The two species of the genus are very similar: external appearance, behaviour at sea, movement on land, gross traits of mating system and reproductive behaviour. The first difference is size, with the southern species much larger. In northern elephant seals maximum weight is about 2300 kg for males versus 3700 kg for southern, while females are more similar. On the contrary, secondary sexual traits are more developed in the northern species: the trunk is longer, and the <b>neck</b> and chest <b>shield</b> is more developed.

40|$|Background: Extended {{control of}} staff {{exposure}} in interventional radiology has been legally required {{over the last}} few years. This is determined by a number of factors, including the type of procedure, technical conditions and methodology. In orthopedic procedures fluoroscopy is used to control surgical reconstructions. An influence of particular factors on the registered values of doses received by the members of medical team performing osteosynthesis for limb fractures is presented in this paper. Material and Methods: Doses received by individual interventional team members performing specific functions, operator, assisting physicians and scrub nurse, during a series of the procedures were measured. Each person was equipped with 4 dosimetric tools, containing thermoluminescent dosimeters, to measure the equivalent doses for the eyes, hand skin and the <b>neck</b> (outside the <b>shield)</b> and to evaluate effective doses. The investigations were performed in operational theatres of 3 hospitals in Łódź. Results: The equivalent doses per one procedure for the eyes and hand skin of the operator were 0. 029 – 0. 073 mSv and 0. 366 – 1. 604 mSv, respectively. Significantly higher doses were noted during the procedures of intramedullary osteosynthesis, especially for the operator. An average age and body mass index (BMI) of patients treated in the monitored hospitals did not differ statistically. Conclusions: Based on the dosimetric measurements the following conclusions can be drawn: in orthopedic procedures of interventional radiology (IR) the exposure of the staff is mostly determined by the type of procedure and more precisely by its complexity and by the optimized use of X-ray unit, including pulsed fluoroscopy. It is also revealed that the operator is the most exposed person in the interventional team. Med Pr 2017; 68 (1) : 75 – 8...|$|R
