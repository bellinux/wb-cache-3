30|$|In <b>nature,</b> <b>leaf</b> {{senescence}} is {{a process}} of programmed cell death induced in age-dependent manner and by various environmental cues, such as senescence associated genes (SAGs), genotype, hormones, light and temperature, etc. (Yoshida 2003; Sarwat et al. 2013; Gao et al. 2016). Senescence is the final step in leaf development, which accompanied with the turn yellow of leaf, photosynthesis decline and biomacromolecules degradation, including nucleic acids, proteins, plastid pigments, and fatty acids, and so on. Finally, senescence is usually terminated with the death and abscission of leaf (Ougham et al. 2005; Lim et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2016). Leaf is not only the important photosynthetic apparatus for plants but also the crucial edible part of many vegetables for human being. Both the pre-mature and late-mature of plants will greatly affect the yield and quality of many crop plants (Chéour et al. 1992; Navabpour et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2011).|$|E

Such particles are often more fragile than their wild-type infectious virus counterparts, and as such can be damaged or lost during procedures that involve pelleting or precipitating the particles. The method presented here is based on ultracentrifugation and density gradients, with no pelleting or precipitation step. It makes virtually no assumptions about the yield of recombinant VLPs or their properties, which means that this protocol is ideally suited to screening new constructs which are expected to lead to the formation of VLPs. This protocol will allow the researcher to determine whether the construct does indeed form VLPs, and if it does, will reduce the likelihood of those particles being lost or damaged during the purification process.

Conventional wet chemical analysis of samples is destructive, time-consuming and expensive. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potentiality of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for determining litter chemistry during the decomposition process using a wide range of spe-cies and decomposition stages. The litter of 8 species of evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved trees, conifers and shrubs were used in both laboratory and field experiments. Near-infrared reflec-tance measurements were made with an NIRS Systems 5000 spectrophotometer over the range 1100 - 2500 nm. Calibration samples were analysed for ash, carbon and nitrogen. Acid-detergent fi-ber (ADF) and acid-detergent lignin (ADL) were determined using Van Soest procedures. Stepwise regression (SR) calibrations and partial least squares (PLSR) calibrations were developed and com-pared as well as the effect of scatter correction. The PLS algorithm was used to create the predictive models using all the information in the spectrum to determine the chemical concentration. Using scatter correction always gave better results.

The result of the stomata frequency was also significant where the highest was observed on the lower epidermis (23. 81 %) and upper epidermis (5. 88 %) of C. viscosa. Glandular, club shaped trichomes were observed in the leaf epidermis of C. viscosa.

It is one of the parameters that allow to reduce costs and losses of phytosanitary prod- ucts and to improve the spray accuracy. Moreover, the leaf roughness is related to adhesion mechanisms of liquid on a surface. It can be used to define <b>leaf</b> <b>nature</b> surface (hy- drophilic/hydrophobic). The main goal of this study is thus to estimate and to follow the evolution of leaf roughness using image processing and computer vision. The develop- ment and application of computer vision for measurement of surface leaf roughness using artificial neural networks will be described. The system for image acquisition of leaf surface consists of scanning electron microscope (SEM). The images of leaf surface are captured and analyzed to estimate the optical roughness. 2 -D Fast Fourier Trans- form (FFT) algorithm and Co-occurrence Matrix are used for texture analysis. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network is used to model and predict the optical roughness values...|$|R
