5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>anywhere.</b> Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was then that I said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the series}} was indeed {{proving to be a}} hit, its late time slot in the country's largest media market began to concern its distributor. Even though Letterman's show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson were strong ratings winners and Jeopardy! was able to retain a good amount of the {{audience}} from its lead in shows, a late night time slot is not usually considered beneficial for a first run series. WNBC, however, was not left with much choice in the matter. At the time, the station cleared the NBC daytime lineup in its entirety and aired {{two and a half hours}} of news beginning at 5:00p.m. The only available slots the station had were the 9:00a.m. hour between the end of Today and the beginning of the daytime schedule, the 4:00p.m. hour between the end of the daytime schedule and Live at Five, and the 7:30p.m. slot between the end of NBC Nightly News and the beginning of primetime. Each one of those slots was spoken for, however. The popular Donahue was one of the station's biggest ratings draws in daytime and was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>anywhere</b> (especially considering NBC's New York base was about to become its home), which precluded Jeopardy! from moving there. WNBC, as a network-owned station, had also picked up the syndicated edition of Family Feud when it premiered along with the rest of the stations NBC owned, which took away the 7:30 slot. King World looked for a way out of its unfavorable situation with WNBC, but there was not much to be done. The two other major network affiliates in New York, WABC and WCBS, both had the same issue as WNBC in that both stations cleared their network's schedule completely and had other programming filing the holes in their schedules.|$|E

500|$|However, Auerbach {{could not}} prevent the Celtics from {{going into a}} slump {{at the end of}} the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary {{increases}} that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. [...] While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics' 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons. In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown's passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, the cab driver pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family. Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>anywhere.</b> [...] We're going to sign Larry Bird, and we're going to be on top again." [...] Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, had a year of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of-Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation.|$|E

2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>anywhere,</b> as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
