The reaction rate exhibits first-order kinetics with respect to CAT o and RNH o in both media. The rate of reaction increases with increase in H +, but it decreases with respect to OH - with a slope of unity in both the cases.

The clusters resembled those formed by polycationic ferritin (DMPA-feritin), a visual probe that binds to anionic site on the plasma membrane. Biochemical studies with (125) I-labeled DMPA-LDL showed that the membrane-bound lipoprotein was internalized and hydrolyzed in lysosomes. The turnover time for cell bound (125) I-DMPA-LDL, i. e., the time in which the amount of (125) I-DMPA-LDL degraded was equal to the steady-state cellular content of the lipoprotein, was about 50 h. Because the DMPA-LDL gained access to fibroblasts by binding nonspecifically to anionic sites on the cell surface rather than by binding to the physiologic LDL receptor, its uptake failed to be regulated under conditions in which the uptake of native LDL was reduced by feedback suppression of the LDL receptor. As a result, unlike the case with native LDL, the DMPA-LDL accumulated progressively within the cell, and this led to a massive increase in the cellular content of both free and esterified cholesterol. Studies with (14) C-oleate showed that at least 20 percent of the accumulated cholesteryl esters represented cholesterol {{that had been}} esterified within the cell.

It was shown that compound 7 b was able to promote exclusively apoptotic cell death in K 562 cells associated to cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. This cytotoxic effect was not observed in normal peripheral mononuclear blood cells. the compound 7 b-induced intrinsic apoptotic pathway was triggered by the protein thiol oxidation that resulted in the dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. the preventive effect of the dithiothreitol on the compound 7 b-induced cell death and all downstream events associated to apoptosis confirmed that death signal was elicited by the thiol oxidation.

The production of ordered layers of aromatic hydrocarbons and dye molecules were performed under a variety of deposition conditions in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment. These films were studied with several UHV analytical techniques including low energy electron diffraction, photoelectron spectroscopies, thermal program desorption mass spectrometry and visible spectroscopy. The study of several aromatic hydrocarbons revealed that these molecules possess significant mobility on the Cu(100) surface, while adsorbing with their molecular plane parallel to the copper surface. A majority of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules studied were observed to adsorb in a single packing structure at similar substrate temperatures for divalent metal centers and a slightly higher temperature for trivalent metal centers. Chloroaluminum phthalocyanine was determined to pack in a unique structure at 150 °C and adopt the previously observed phthalocyanine structure at 175 °C.

A synthetic route to this compound has now been established. The preparation of the required intermediate, 4 -dimethylamino- 3 -trifluoromethylphenyl-lithium, afforded a route {{to a number of}} novel compounds containing trifluoromethyl groups ortho to a dimethylamino- group. The observed visible spectra of the dyes have been correlated with structural features. Apparent inconsistencies in the response of Crystal Violet to the introduction of substituents have been interpreted in terms of a possible loss of degeneracy of the NBMO pair in the derivatives of this compound. Novel analogues of Malachite Green, Crystal Violet and Michler's Hydrol Blue have been prepared containing terminal piperidino- and pyrrolidino- groups. Differences in the electronic absorption spectra of the parent systems have been correlated with the varying basicities of the amino- groups and to differing abilities of the terminal groups to stabilise resonance forms. Comprehensive series of derivatives of these dyes have been prepared containing orthotrifluoromethyl groups. The effect of substitution on their visible spectra has been shown to follow the trends established for their known dimethylamino- analogues. The readiness of Piperidine Violet and its 2 '-trifluoromethyl derivative to protonate when in strongly acidic media was not shared by their pyrrolidine analogues. This behaviour was illustrated by the production of Piperidine Green type spectra for these dyes when determined in solutions with a comparatively low concentration of acetic acid.

While the peptides bind to both monomeric and micellar SDS, no interaction occurs with HPS, evincing the contribution of electrostatic interactions. TOAC(3) -BK's EPR spectral lineshapes are broader than those of TOAC(0) -BK, indicating a more restricted degree of motion at position 3. Moreover, the motional freedom of both peptides decreased upon binding to SDS. BK and TOAC(0) -BK solution CD spectra indicate highly flexible conformations (possibly an equilibrium between rapidly interconverting forms), while TOAC(3) -BK's spectra correspond to a more ordered structure. SDS binding induces drastic changes in BK and TOAC(0) -BK spectra, indicating stabilization of similar folds. the micelle interface promotes a higher degree of secondary structure by favoring intramolecular hydrogen bonds. in contrast, TOAC(3) -BK spectra remain essentially unchanged. These results are interpreted as due to TOAC's ring imposing a more constrained conformation. This rigidity is very likely responsible for the inability of TOAC(3) -BK to acquire the correct receptor-bound conformation, leading to loss of biological activity. On the other hand, the greater flexibility of TOAC(0) -BK and the similarity between its conformational behavior and that of the native hormone are probably related to their similar biological activity.

40|$|My {{doctoral}} studies {{deals with}} model systems in soft matter. In these model systems, we address {{questions that are}} on the interface between physics and biology. The primary focus of the studies is to explore the dynamics and structural changes of aggregations of biologically relevant multi-component polymer, protein, peptide, and micellar systems using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based techniques. Diffusometry, relaxometry, and deuterium NMR techniques were chosen since they complement one another in understanding the dynamics and structure in the process of macromolecular self-assembly. Moreover, identifying the size of nanoparticle clusters in these model systems is a challenging problem and there is no technique that gives complete answers. Therefore, my doctoral work is a systematic attempt to use NMR as a tool to make quantitative statements about the nature of macromolecular clustering. [...] During my PhD, we used a model polymer-surfactant solution in order to identify surfactant concentration regimes relevant to understanding the behavior of biomolecules in a "crowded environment" consisting of multiple species of macromolecules. Such crowded environments are a characteristic of intracellular plasma. We studied a system composed of nonionic polymer poly(ethylene glycol) (PEO) and an anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at different SDS concentrations. Using NMR diffusometry, we measured the self-diffusion coefficients of the polymer (PEO) and surfactant (SDS) components simultaneously as a function of SDS concentration. Also, we obtained NMR relaxation rates for PEO and the chemical shifts as a function of SDS concentration. Using a simple model to interpret our experimental results, we developed a precise method to identify the onset of aggregation of SDS on PEO chains (critical aggregation concentration CAC= 3. 5 mM) and a crossover concentration (C 2 = 60 mM) which is associated with a sharp change in the relaxation behavior, as well as an increase in free surfactant concentration. Moreover, {{in the context of a}} simple model, we identified the SDS concentration (Cm = 145 mM) beyond which the diffusion of the aggregates was strongly hindered by the presence of other structures such as free micelles. [...] Another source of hindered diffusion, apart from macromolecular crowding, is diffusion in the presence of geometrical constraints. In the case of cylindrical or wormlike micelles, the constraint is to diffuse within the cylinder. Aggregates in a multi-component wormlike micelle are difficult to study via scattering techniques because they would require contrast matching. Therefore, We studied a system composed of a zwitterionic surfactant N-tetradecyl-N, <b>N-dimethyl-</b> 3 -ammonio- 1 -propanesulfonate (TOPS) and an anionic surfactant SDS in brine. NMR diffusometry indicates that the self-diffusion coefficients of surfactant is consistent with restricted diffusion within a reptating micelle. Using a simple model to interpret our diffusometry results, we estimated the average end-to-end micellar distance to be ͌ 1 μm. Using NMR relaxometry, we obtained the wormlike micelle overlap concentration (a characteristic concentration Cthreshold = 4. 5 mM). Deuterium NMR spectra indicate that the internal structure of the wormlike micellar system includes domains with different orientation orders with slow exchange between domains. Our experimental results (NMR diffusometry and rheometry) revealed that the wormlike micelles exhibit remarkable polymer-like scalings with a crossover from Zimm-like (diffusion) to Rouse-like (rheology) regimes. [...] During the latter part of my PhD, we explored protein solutions. We were motivated by the fact that scattering techniques in concentrated lysozyme protein solutions show conflicting reports over the existence of an equilibrium cluster phase. It is recognized that protein aggregation is essential in understanding the biophysics of proteins. Also, it must be noted that protein aggregations and misfoldings, which are implicated as a root cause of some diseases that are thus sometimes called “conformational diseases” are technically challenging to quantify. To address this problem, we worked on diffusion of lysozyme proteins in concentrated lysozyme solutions. Lysozyme is a common mammalian protein, which is found in human amylases. Using NMR diffusometry, we obtained the self-diffusion coefficients of lysozyme in concentrated lysozyme solutions. Diffusometry and relaxometry showed that both the observed diffusion coefficient and relaxation rates are a weighted average of monomer and aggregate fraction s. Therefore, our studies gave a strong evidence for both lysozyme monomers and thermodynamically stable lysozyme clusters in the protein solution with a rapid exchange between monomer and aggregate on the NMR time scale. [...] Finally, we addressed a practical problem of relevance to biochemists and biophysicists. Studying the dynamics of macromolecules and aggregates in multicomponent systems composed of peptide or protein and surfactants is challenging. Many peptides and proteins are synthesized in tiny quantities. We used NMR diffusometry and relaxometry to explore systems composed of peptides that are very long compared to the surfactant, dissolved with an anionic surfactant in an aqueous solution. We compared the results to those for shorter dipeptides whose size is comparable to the surfactant. Diffusometry shows that the longer peptide behaves as if there is no free fraction of peptide molecules in the solution. Based on that, we extracted reliable physical quantities such as the true hydrodynamic radius of long peptide-surfactant aggregate as a function of surfactant concentration. On the other hand, the smaller dipeptides are partitioned between the bound and free state such that the fraction of the bound peptide varies with surfactant concentration...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityAryl and/or alkyl {{substitution}} {{of one or}} two of the B-chloroethyl groups of bis or tris-B-chloroethylamine (nitrogen mustards) was shown in 1946 to reduce markedly the toxicity of these substances and to confer new and interesting pharmacologic properties upon the 2 -haloalkylamine grouping. These compounds, of which N, N, dibenzyl-B-chloroethylamine (Dibenamine) was the forerunner (1), possess the ability to block and reverse many of the pharmacologic effects of epinephrine, as well as reduce or abolish the effects mediated over the sympatho-adrenal nervous system. Evidence accumulated indicating that Dibenamine was the most specific, albeit not the most potent, adrenergic blocking drug, as compared to notoriously non-specific and toxic members existing in the same class (ergot derivatives, yohimbine, dioxanes, and so forth. (See (2) for reference and discussion). In 1947 it was shown by Loew (3) and, subsequently by Kerwin,et al. (4), Hunt (5), Henderson, et al. (6), and Nickerson (7), that the dibenzyl radical was not the only aryl substituent which conferred low toxicity and adrenergic blocking properties to the B-chloroethyl group in nitrogen mustards. Hence, alpa-naphthylmethyl, biphenylyloxy, phenylethyl, phenoxy, benzhydryl, and 9 -fluorenyl substituted derivatives were found to be active adrenergic blocking drugs, some homologues of which were far more potent than Dibenamine in this respect. However, certain of these derivatives were found not to be as specific as Dibenamine. Hence, compounds possessing appreciable antihistaminic properties (alpha-naphthyl-methyl and biphenylyloxy derivatives) were described (8); and others proved to be cholinergic (e. g., N, <b>N-dimethyl-</b> 2 -chloro- 2 -phenylethylamine, (9). From the available evidence it appeared that aryl and/or alkyl {{substitution of}} {{one or two of the}} B-chloroethyl groups of the nitrogen mustards altered the toxicity but did not reduce the potential chemical reactiveness inherent in the B-chloroethyl radical (see (10) for discussion of chemical reactivity of nitrogen and sulfur mustards). It was apparent, however, that the nature of the aryl substituent modified this reactiveness of this group so that it became more or less specific. This in turn was reflected in predominant pharmacologic effects of a given derivative, in contrast to the rather wide-spread and manifold pharmacologic effects of the nitrogen mustards (10). Nonetheless, other pharmacologic effects which appear in a given compound are in addition to prominent adrenergic blocking properties; thus most aryl derivatives of B-chloroethylamine which have been described are classified in this category. In view of the possible uses of adrenergic blocking drugs in medicine, and the fundamental usefulness of these drugs in delimiting functions of the sympathetic nervous system, the importance of knowing the specificity and potency of drugs is evident. Aryl derivatives possess desirable properties in that they are long-acting and highly potent and effective. Unfortunately, as pointed out above, not all derivatives appeared as specific as desired and, in addition, specificity among these agents had not yet been placed in quantitative terms. With these points in mind, studies of the specificity of action of some of the more potent and better known aryl-haloalkylamines were made on the isolated seminal vesicle of the guinea pig by the Magnus technique. Specificity of drug action was inferred from the relative concentrations of each adrenergic blocking drug required to inhibit the spasmogenic effects of equi-effective doses of epinephrine, nor-epinephrine, histamine, and acetylcholine, as compared to control contractions made in the absence of the antagonist. The measurement data obtained were converted to all-or-none data by designating that a given trial with an antagonistic drug was a positive trial if the per cent reduction was 50 per cent or greater; any value below this was a negative trial. Thus, small doses of antagonist yielded relatively few positive trials, and increasingly larger doses resulted in greater proportions of positive trials. The data were analyzed statistically by the graphic analysis of Litchfield and Wilcoxon (11) to forecast the relative concentration (in mcg. / 100 cc.) producing 50 per cent or greater inhibition of the spasm induced by the active drug in 50 per cent of the trials (ED 50) and the 95 per cent confidence limits of these estimates. Comparisons of the ED 5 O values obtained with the adrenergic blocking drugs antagonizing epinephrine revealed that N-ethyl-N-(2 -chloroethyl) - 9 -fluorenamine. HCl (Sy- 21, ED 50 Epi = 0. 52) was the most effective antagonist of epinephrine. This was followed in order by: N-ethyl-N-(2 -chloroethyl) benzhydrylamine. HCl (SY- 2, ED 50 Epi = 0. 75); N-ethyl-N-(2 -bromoethyl) -naphthalenemethylamine. HBr (SY- 28, ED 50 Epi = 1. 37); N, N-(2 -chloroethyl) -dibenzylamine. HCl (Dibenamine, ED 50 Epi = 2. 60) and, 2 -(2 -biphenylyloxy) - 2 '-chlorotriethylamine. HCl (SY- 8, ED 50 Epi = 3. 03). As to be expected, atropine sulfate (ED 50 Epi = 1330) and pyranisamine (ED 50 Epi = ca. 12 - 24, 000) were highly ineffective in antagonizing epinephrine under the conditions employed. Comparison of ED 50 Norepi values yielded the same order of potency. The individual values were uniformly less than the corresponding ED 50 Epi. The ED 50 Norepi to ED 5 OEpi ratio was 0. 8 in each case examined and indicates that less drug was required to inhibit nor-epinephrine than an equieffective amount of epinephrine, although the difference was statistically significant in only 2 of the 4 comparisons made. This result suggests that the greater susceptibility to blockade by these drugs of epinephrine pressor effects, as compared to nor-epinephrine. is due to significantly greater vasodilating properties of the former, and not to differences in the amines, per se, or site of action of the pressor agents. Antihistaminic properties, as judged by the ability to reduce histamine spasm, were revealed in all of the aryl-haloalkylamines exrunined. The most potent aryl-haloalkylamine in this respect (SY- 28, ED 50 Hist = 0. 71), however, was far less effective than pyranisamine (Neo-antergan maleate, ED 50 Hist =. 053) tested under the same conditions. The antihistaminic activity of the aryl-haloalkylamines (as was the anti-epinephrine activity) was irreversible (and hence, probably non-competitive) under these conditions since the drugs, once added to the muscle bath, could not be washed from the tissue. The ratio, ED 50 Hist/ED 50 Epi, each from the same antagonist gives some measure of the relative specificity. This ratio, calculated for each antagonist, varied from 44 (SY- 2) to 0. 5 (SY- 28). Hence, the same relatioship that existed between epinephrine and nor-epinephrine (ED 50 Norepi to ED 50 Epi ratio for each antagonist = 0. 8) does not exist between histamine and epinephrine and does not support the concept that epinephrine and histamine act in similar manners or on the same receptors. Comparison of the ratio, ED 50 Hist to ED 50 Epi, revealed that SY- 2 (Ratio = 44) was the most discriminating under these conditions, followed by SY- 21 (20), Dibenamine (13), SY- 8 (2) and SY- 28 (0. 5). The ratio of 0. 5 obtained with SY- 28 indicates that this drug is more effective in antagonizing histamine than epinephrine, and as such, should be classified as an antihistaminic. While the properties of these aryl-haloalkylamines were qualitatively similar with respect to histamine, epinephrine, and nor-epinephrine antagonism, marked differences were apparent with respect to antagonism of acetylcholine. Thus, SY- 2 and Dibenamine, were found to be incapable of blocking acetylcholine-induced spasm in quantities that did not produce spasm themselves (700 to 1400 times the respective ED 50 Epi). SY- 21 potentiated acetylcholine spasm markedly in doses of 500 - 1000 mcg. / 100 cc., quantities in themselves slightly spasmogenic. SY- 28 and SY- 8 were found to block acetylcholine. The concentrations required to do so were much above those of atropine sulfate but only 8 (SY- 8) and 68 (SY- 28) times their respective ED 50 Epi. The blocking properties of SY- 28 and SY- 8 were partially reversible by washing and differ in this respect from anti-epinephrine and anti-histamine activity. The modifying importance of the aryl radical is brought out by these results since the drugs studied differed only in the nature of the aryl radical (all were aryl-ethyl-B-chloroethylamines except Dibenamine [...] an aryl-benzyl-B-chloroethylamine). The results of these experiments revealed that aryl-haloalkylamine adrenergic blocking drugs possess pharmacologic properties other than anti-epinephrine activity, which may approach or overshadow the adrenergic blocking activity. The great pharmacologic potentialities of the B-chloroethylamine group appears to have been rendered more specific by juxtaposition of a suitable aryl radical, although the specificity exhibited does not approach certain other antagonists of different classes (e. g., atropine vs. acetylcholine, and pyranisamine vs. histamine). Finally, two of the most specific drugs, as determined above, were selected and studied in intact animals in order to assess, in some measure, their range of activity and site of action. The method employed was one in which the blocking activity of the drugs against epinephrine and adrenergic reflex pressor responses were obtained in the anesthetized dog by 1) carotid occlusion and 2) anoxia (nitrogen inhalation). In addition, adrenergic effects, manifested as a rise in blood pressure, was induced by injections of nicotine (25 mcg. /kgm., i. v.) acting primarily at the ganglionic level, and epinephrine (1 mcg. /kgm., i. v.) acting at the effector cell level. Both SY- 2 (20 mgm. /kgm., i. v.) and SY- 21 (1. 0 mgm. /kgm., i. v.) reduced, blocked or reversed the adrenergic responses due to carotid occlusion (reduced), anoxia (reversed), nicotine (reversed), and epinephrine (reversed). The data obtained suggested that SY- 21 was more potent than SY- 2, even more so than the differential in doses indicate. The data are interpreted as to suggest that a peripheral site of action is responsible for blockade of all the responses. In addition, no effects were observed, under the conditions employed, that could not be explained as due to peripheral blockade of the sympatho-adrenal nervous system. The experiments support the previous conclusion that SY- 2 and SY- 21 are among the most specific aryl-haloalkylamine adrenergic blocking drugs available...|$|E
