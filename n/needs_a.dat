Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities.|$|E

5|$|In {{a suburb}} of Bucharest, a 13-year-old boy, Andrei (Gabriel Huian), {{together}} {{with some of his}} friends, watches the prostitutes' show every night from a rooftop and how they are being taken by drivers. The boy falls in love with one of the girls, called Marilena (Mădălina Ghiţescu), and finds out that he <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> decent sum of money in order to approach her. Thus, he steals his father's (Gabriel Spahiu) salary and goes to the prostitutes' meeting place. Marilena's pimp (Andi Vasluianu) is also present, and only agrees to send Marilena and another prostitute with the boy to a nearby pub, where the Rom Elvis is singing (played by the singer Elvis Romano, who translated Elvis Presley's lyrics into his own language). The prostitutes play with Andrei, telling him that he <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> car in order to date them, then they leave.

However, N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in humidity, especially when young, provided that the air does not become too dry (below 50% R.H.). Humidity can be easily controlled using an ultrasonic humidifier in conjunction with a humidistat.|$|E

30|$|Comparisons {{of level}} of {{clinical}} sleep problem between the ASSQ and the SMP were performed using weighted kappa [19 – 21]. Weighted kappa {{was used as}} kappa (unweighted) does not consider the degree of disagreement. Reliability was estimated for the ASSQ scoring system with Cronbach’s alpha. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value [22] were estimated from the ASSQ scoring system sleep problem categories to the SMP categories after the clinical interview. Sensitivity was estimated {{as the number of}} subjects determined by the ASSQ scoring system as <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention from the SMP (moderate and severe) divided by the number of subjects <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. Specificity was estimated by the number of subjects determined by the ASSQ scoring system as not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical sleep intervention (none, mild categories) divided by the number of subjects not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. The positive predictive value was estimated by dividing the subjects for which there was agreement on <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention (moderate, severe categories) by the actual number of subjects <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP. The negative predictive value was estimated by dividing the subjects for which there was agreement on not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention by the actual number of subjects not <b>needing</b> <b>a</b> clinical intervention as determined by the SMP.|$|R
