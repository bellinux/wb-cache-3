50|$|In this book, Folbre {{discusses}} {{the costs of}} raising children, the value of child care to the economy, and how these costs are borne by society. She challenges the implicit view of mainstream economists who effectively view the raising of children {{as a process of}} consumption in which parents can derive happiness and how this view ignores the fact that children become the workers and taxpayers of the next generation. She argues that the time investment mothers make offers significant rewards in the reproduction of labor, and because of this, public policy should be designed to align private and public resources in promoting efficient commitments to the next generation. Folbre considers ways to improve the accounting of the economic value of raising children and how the current methods of calculating the economic cost of having children fail to capture the value of the time spent in care work. Folbre provides a surprising estimate of the value of parental time per child by asking what it would cost to purchase a comparable substitute for it. Yet she also argues that, as part of the <b>non-market</b> <b>sector,</b> care work is economically undervalued by simply utilizing its replacement cost.|$|E

Not only the amount of resources used for such purposes, but also other wider concerns (implications for private and government sector) have drawn the attention of economists in recent decades.

To do so, I first explain the notion of "altruism", as {{can be found in}} the works of Adam Smith, Gary Becker and Ludwig von Mises. On these grounds, we can say that by voluntary altruistic transactions the utility of both sides of the transaction has been increased.

This model was extended by introducing a third sector (investments in human capital) to a framework of decisions over time and to investment in human capital. This approach aimed at including the interaction between changes in wage rates over the life cycle resulting from the accumulation of human capital, the allocation of time between market and <b>non-market</b> <b>sectors,</b> {{and the impact of}} human capital on the productivity of household behaviour. This came at a time when Becker was largely focused on his economic analysis of family behaviour 20. This framework explained the decline of investment in human capital with age due to reduced profitability (smaller time spans and rising foregone earnings). This approach also underlined the effect of human capital on non-market efficiency, leading for instance to different patterns of consumption 21.|$|R

40|$|Mesange is a {{quarterly}} macro-econometric {{model of the}} French economy. This model has been developed and is used jointly by INSEE and the French Treasury. This working paper presents the {{new version of the}} model. The data used in the re-estimation process are those of the National Accounts base 2000 with fixed-base volumes. The paper contains a set of standard simulations giving some examples of the results used in the evaluation of economic policy measures and in the study of standard macroeconomic shocks. A second version of the model, re-estimated on National-Account data with chained volumes to better suit forecasting and short-term analysis, will be presented in a forthcoming INSEE working paper. The structure of the model is not very different from the initial version (Allard-Prigent et al., 2002). The French economy is represented as a small-open economy where {{the rest of the world}} is treated as exogenous. The economy is divided into three sectors: the manufacturing, non-manufacturing and <b>non-market</b> <b>sectors.</b> The model describes short-term Keynesian dynamics and its long-term equilibrium is driven by supply-side determinants. The re-estimation of the model has enabled us to take into account the structural evolutions of the French economy that have occurred since the last estimation (notably in terms of changes in labour productivity growth, the long-term elasticity of unemployment rate to real wage and the elasticity of substitution between labour and capital). Some extensions have been achieved, such as the creation of an energy block and the improvement of the fiscal block. macroeconometric model, estimation, simulation, macroeconomic policy...|$|R

Heterogeneous workers are assumed to have different productivities {{both at home and}} in the workplace. We investigate the degree to which there is under-investment in human capital, and examine the deadweight losses that accrue via distortionary taxes. We show that there are increasing returns to education at the participation margin, and that deadweight losses are most severe for workers located here. Although the social planner's optimum implies the worker should choose a high level of education and participate in the market sector, instead the worker chooses not to invest in human capital and either non-participation or partial participation in market-sector work. A severe deadweight loss is generated by this substitution effect.

From what {{was seen as an}} isolated ideological battle in the sphere of housing consumption, or a simple political response to the perceived demand for home ownership among sections of the working class, the sale of public sector dwellings now sits within a much more generalized debate and a much wider set of theoretical arguments. What was seen as a parochial housing policy is now seen as part of an international phenomenon. Similar housing debates can be observed in countries such as France, West Germany and Sweden. We now discuss sales in terms of privatization, a term which prior to the election of the Conservative government in 1979 was little used outside the more rarified circles of sociology and economics. In many ways, council house sales can be seen to have formed the vanguard of attempts to restructure social and economic relations. Policies of privatization now encompass sales of assets in the public market and <b>non-market</b> <b>sectors</b> such as British Telecom, British Rail or British Petroleum，public bodies such as Companies’ House, the disposal of land and buildings and the hiving off of various activities of the principal instutu-tions of the welfare state.

Contrariety investment climate in Ukraine is connected to the incomplete market institutional reforms, high levels of arbitrary interference by public authorities in the financial business and their corruption, backwardness of market infrastructure and others. This narrowness and financial market away from the main countries of the world financial capital flows. In the future, if we proceed with economic realities and financial market development level of countries with transitional economic expansion is possible in these countries to attract foreign capital. Total foreign capital inflows can have both positive and negative consequences for social and economic development. Receiving positive effects depends on the ratio between import and export of capital, foreign capital forms, directions using borrowed funds and others. The most common way of attracting foreign direct investment in real sector of economy of business is selling shares to foreign companies. Please be aware that the country in transition (non-) economics is 'fit' in global financial processes, following their own capacity for sustainable development. Integration into the global economy based on specialization in production of raw materials industries, which, unfortunately, now completely dominates the transition economies, is not effective. Countries with such exports have a strong immunity against fluctuations in world financial markets. For them there is always an external threat of violation of domestic macro-financial equilibrium.

He begins by noting that productivity {{is the relationship between}} the output of goods and services and the inputs of resources, both human and non-human used in their production. The measurement of productivity is fraught with conceptual and empirical issues, meaning that there can be a significant margin of error associated with productivity growth rates, even at the aggregate level. Sharpe identifies two particularly important measurement problems, namely the estimation of real output in the <b>non-market</b> <b>sector</b> where output is not measured independently of inputs and the estimation of price indices (which are needed to calculate real output) for products where quality has improved significantly or for new products (e. g. computers). According to Sharpe, the most important productivity trends that the general public should be aware of are: the post- 1973 productivity slowdown; the postwar convergence in OECD productivity levels toward the US level; the post- 1995 acceleration in labour productivity growth in the United States; the decline in Canada's relative international productivity ranking; and the widening of the Canada-US manufacturing productivity gap.
