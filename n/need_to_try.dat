5|$|Guitar Hero: Aerosmiths {{gameplay}} {{is structured}} similarly to the gameplay {{of the other}} games in the series, in which players use a guitar-shaped peripheral to simulate the playing of rock music, hitting fret buttons and strumming in time to notes as they scroll on the screen. The player's performance is tracked through each song; if the player does well they are given a score and a rating of up to five stars; if the player performs poorly, the song may end prematurely and the player will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> the song again. Each song can be played at one of four difficulties that changes the number and speed of the notes that must be played.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing {{a large number of}} crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When crews of NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The crews were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the average operating height of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared dossiers for crews to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the lighting systems, such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. Crews were warned about RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber crews of a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E

Pace bowler Dick Pollard was introduced, making his Test debut in place of Smailes. Like Smailes, Pollard was an {{experienced}} player active since 1933. Veteran pace bowler Bill Voce was recalled in place of his former bodyline series colleague Bowes. India made three changes with Syed Mushtaq Ali, Chandra Sarwate and Ranga Sohoni coming in for Gul Mohammad, Shinde and Nayudu.|$|E

Other treatments modulate the adverse immune response to allergens and include antihistamines, steroids, ciclosporin and immunotherapy (a process in which allergens are injected <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> induce tolerance).

25|$|The basic use of {{frequency}} analysis is to first count {{the frequency of}} ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them. More Xs in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that X corresponds to e in the plaintext, {{but this is not}} certain; t and a are also very common in English, so X might be either of them also. It is unlikely to be a plaintext z or q which are less common. Thus the cryptanalyst may <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and plaintext letters.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} of {{pharmacotherapy}} is usually SSRIs due to their more tolerable nature and reduced side effects compared to the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. Studies {{have found that the}} mean response to antidepressant medications for people with dysthymia is 55%, compared with a 31% response rate to a placebo. The most commonly prescribed antidepressants/SSRIs for dysthymia are escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. It often takes an average of 6–8 weeks before the patient begins to feel these medications' therapeutic effects. Additionally, STAR*D, a multi-clinic governmental study, found that people with overall depression will generally <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> different brands of medication before finding one that works specifically for them. Research shows that 1 in 4 of those who switch medications get better results regardless of whether the second medication is an SSRI or some other type of antidepressant.|$|E

The boys become angry with their father for not spending time with them, but the two have a great time with their grandfather.

[...] Nico Rosberg acknowledged that [...] "it's going the wrong way" [...] in terms of his championship hopes as he would have needed a victory and declared: [...] "Just <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to win next time out." [...] Sebastian Vettel lamented his chances at second place, as he said that he could have stayed in front of Rosberg had he made a pit stop a lap earlier during the second round of stops, However, he stated that [...] "with hindsight, it's always easy so, nevertheless, it's a great day". Hamilton followed up on his delight at matching Senna later on, saying: [...] "For me to win here at a race where I loved watching Ayrton drive and to match his wins, it doesn't feel real at the moment."

2500|$|In January 2002, Gonzales {{authored}} a memo that explored {{whether the}} Geneva Convention section III on the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW) applied to Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters captured in Afghanistan {{and held in}} detention facilities around the world, including Camp X-Ray in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The memo made several arguments both for and against providing GPW protection to Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters. The memo concluded that certain provisions of GPW were outdated and ill-suited for dealing with captured Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters: [...] " [...] is not the traditional clash between nations adhering {{to the laws of}} war that formed the backdrop for GPW. The nature of the new war places a high premium on other factors, such as the ability to quickly obtain information from captured terrorists and their sponsors in order to avoid further atrocities against American civilians, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> terrorists for war crimes such as wantonly killing civilians." ...|$|E

In a reversal of roles from Sánchez's failed investiture in March, the PSOE leader wanted to convey a harsh stance to Rajoy by reassuring he would never allow {{the formation of a}} Rajoy-led cabinet without clarifying whether he would try to explore an alternative himself. Rajoy mockingly undervalued Sánchez's reasons to vote against him by stating that he had [...] "already understood all parts of the 'no' and therefore [...] did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to argue [...] case", before asking Sánchez to just [...] "let him govern" [...] after having gathered 170 votes for his investiture and dismissing as unworkable any possible alternative government to his.|$|E
