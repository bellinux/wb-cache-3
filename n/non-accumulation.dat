Debtor {{countries are}} expected to provide a precise description of their economic and financial situation, 2) have implemented and are committed to implementing reforms to restore their economic and financial situation, and 3) have a demonstrated track record of implementing reforms under an IMF program. This means in practice that the country must have a current program supported by an appropriate arrangement with the IMF (Stand-By, Extended Fund Facility, Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, Policy Support Instrument). The level of the debt treatment {{is based on the}} financing gap identified in the IMF program. In the case of a flow treatment, the consolidation period coincides with the period when the IMF arrangement shows a need for debt relief. When the flow treatment extends {{over a long period of}} time (generally more than one year), the Paris Club agreement is divided into phases. The amounts falling due during the first phase are treated as soon as the agreement enters into force. Subsequent phases are implemented following completion of conditions mentioned in the Agreed Minutes, including <b>non-accumulation</b> of arrears and approval of the reviews of the IMF program.|$|E

Some accounts estimate that as high as 80 % of all in-service wood decay is caused by brown-rot Fungi. currant wood preservatives protect wood by means of broad spectrum biocides. Understanding the precise mechanism of brown-rot decay would permit development of targeted wood preservatives. A non-degradative strain OfPostia placenta (ME- 20) was studied to obtain information on defects in key decay mechanisms which prevent colonization. weight loss and hydrolysis of wood components, especially cellulose. The major defects of the monokaryon strain ME- 20 are: 1) <b>non-accumulation</b> of oxalic acid on cellulose and wood; 2) nonfibrillar hyphal sheath: 3) Failure to translocate iron into wood in soil block tests; and 4) Inability to degrade pit membranes.

SDS-PAGE analysis revealed <b>non-accumulation</b> of some polypeptides related to the ripening process due to storage at 6 °C, and two-dimensional electrophoresis confirmed the appearance of specific low-temperature polypeptides.

A substrate-dependent change in protease activity was also found in fruit under chilling temperature storage, as compared to ripening fruit.

40|$|Prochilodus lineatus {{is widely}} used in {{pisciculture}} projects, mainly {{in the south of}} Brazil. It shows a basic karyotype composed of 2 n = 54 chromosomes, in addition to as many as seven supernumerary chromosomes, also known as B-chromosomes. These additional small chromosomes are frequently heterochromatic, vary in number and morphology, and generally have no homology with the A complement. Intensive studies have investigated the function, origin and inheritance of these supernumerary chromosomes. The present study aimed to determine the inheritance pattern of the B-chromosomes resulting from directed cross-fertilization of P. lineatus, Prochilodontidae isolated from the Mogi-Guacu River, Pirassununga, SP. These cross-fertilization experiments were performed at CEPTA/ICMBio in Pirassununga. The transmission patterns of these micro-chromosomes agreed (K(B) = 0. 48) with the expectation of regular meiotic behavior following a Mendelian transmission model (K(B) = 0. 5). A <b>non-accumulation</b> process was observed for these B-chromosomes in filial generations. Together, our results indicate that the supernumerary chromosomes in P. lineatus samples from the Mogi-Guacu River exist in a neutral state and follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern...|$|E

40|$|Biobeds {{developed}} in Sweden bind and degrade pesticides from point sources. The {{objective of this}} work was to adapt the biobed to Italian operating conditions, for example, to identify organic materials as effective {{as those in the}} original Swedish composition. The capacity of urban and garden composts alone or mixed with citrus peel or straw to degrade chlorpyrifos and its metabolite TCP was compared to the typical Swedish biomix consisting of straw, peat, and soil. A tendency for higher 14 C-chlorpyrifos mineralization and lower TCP levels was observed in the biomixes with garden compost alone or amended with straw. In a second trial, a high correlation of lower TCP with increasing levels of straw in typical Swedish biomixes was observed. Straw stimulates production of lignin-degrading enzymes such as manganese peroxidase (MnP), and further trials with pure MnP showed that this enzyme degrades TCP. Materials with an active lignin-degrading microflora are a prerequisite for effective dissipation of chlorpyrifos and <b>non-accumulation</b> of TCP. Thus, lignocellulosic materials as straw and garden composts should be present in biomixes to be used under Italian conditions...|$|E

40|$|The membrane-based {{processes}} {{are among the}} most used techniques for leachate treatment in modern landfills but its environmental, technical and economical sustainability strongly depends on the disposal of concentrated leachate that is produced there. This paper presents the monitoring study of the landfill of the municipality of Monsummano Terme (Pistoia province, Tuscany. Italy) named "II Fossetto" where concentrated leachate obtained during membrane treatment is recirculated. The findings resulting from the first 30 months of monitoring of concentrated leachate recirculation show that leachate production did not increase significantly and that only a few quality parameters (i. e. COD, Nickel and Zinc) presented a moderate increase. Moreover, the latest data on biogas composition seem to indicate a reduction in methane content that, if confirmed, could be related to the partial inhibition of methanogens due to the competition of sulphate reducing bacteria. The <b>non-accumulation</b> of other conservative pollutants such as Ammonia Nitrogen and Chloride in the leachate is still under investigation and needs to be better clarified. The overall sustainability of the reinjection as a means of disposing of the concentrated leachate produced by membrane treatment should be further analysed and evaluated in the long term.

40|$|The {{following}} {{article is}} a reflection {{on the process of}} development from a critical perspective, which by departing from the Latin American cultural diversity, recaptures a multiplicity of criteria that transcend the shortsightedness of economic studies. It focuses on the knowledge of the native cultures of the Americas, whose worldview and ways of life have led us to consider alternative methods based on sustainability and ecological equity criteria. While the imposition and reproduction of a single way of looking at development as linked to production, growth, and consumption has shut out other worldviews and ways of life to legitimize the implementation of a politics of silence, exclusion, and extermination of the indigenous peoples, the latter, in turn, have managed to sustain a harmonious relationship with nature and to survive thanks to the sustainability of a <b>non-accumulation</b> economy based on distribution and equity. The full dimension of life, the environment, and the world, and the consequent historic and daily struggle of these peoples to preserve the biological and cultural diversity and community relationships ended up by building the culture of sustainability, in a natural way. In this light, it is critical to recuperate these worldviews, particularly at a time in which it has been clearly demonstrated that the imposition of a single way of looking at and managing development and, in a broader sense, the world, has led – and still does – to disastrous environmental outcomes in their several dimensions, that is, ecological, economical, socio-cultural, and political...|$|E
40|$|The {{genesis of}} the pegmatitic {{pyroxenite}} that often forms {{the base of the}} Merensky Unit in the Bushveld Complex is re-examined. Large (> 1 cm) orthopyroxene grains contain tricuspidate inclusions of plagioclase, and chains and rings of chromite grains, which are interpreted to have grown by reaction between small, primary orthopyroxene grains and superheated liquid. This superheated liquid may have been an added magma or be due to a pressure reduction as a result of lateral expansion of the chamber. There would then have been a period of <b>non-accumulation</b> of grains, permitting prolonged interaction with the crystal mush at the crystal– liquid interface. Crystal ageing and grain enlargement of original orthopyroxene grains would ensue. Only after the pegmatitic pyrox-enite had developed did another layer of chromite and pyroxenite, with normal grain size, accumulate above it. Immiscible sulphide liquids formed with the second pyroxenite, but percolated down {{as a result of their}} density contrast, even as far as the footwall anorthosite in some cases. Whole-rock abundances of incompatible trace ele-ments in the pegmatitic pyroxenite are comparable with or lower than those of the overlying pyroxenite, and so there is no evidence for addition and/or trapping of large proportions of interstitial liquid, or of an incompatible-element enriched liquid or fluid in the production of the pegmatitic rock. Because of the coarse-grained nature of the rock, modal analysis, especially for minor minerals, is unreliable. Annealing has destroyed primary textures, such that petrographic studies should not be used in isolation to distinguish cumulus and intercumulus components. Geochemical data suggest that the Merensky pyroxenite (both pegmatitic and non-pegmatitic) typically consists of about 70 – 80 % cumulus orthopyroxene and 10 – 20 % cumulus plagioclase, with a further 10 % of intercumulus minerals, and could be considered to be a heteradcumulate.

40|$|Basic {{qualitative}} {{properties of}} the creep curves generated by the linear integral constitutive relation of viscoelasticity (with an arbitrary creep compliance) under cyclic piecewise-constant uni-axial loadings (with an arbitrary asymmetry stress ratio) are studied analytically. General formulas {{and a number of}} exact two-sided bounds are obtained for maximal, minimal and ratcheting strain values during each cycle, for their sequences limits, for the rate of plastic (non-recoverable) strain accumulation and for cyclic creep curve deviation from the creep curve at constant stress which is equal to the cycle mean stress. Their dependence on loading cycle parameters and creep compliance properties are analyzed. Monotonicity and convexity intervals of cyclic creep curves, sequences of maximal and minimal strain values and ratcheting strain sequence, their evolution with cycle number growth and conditions for their boundedness, monotonicity and convergence are examined. The linear viscoelasticity theory abilities for simulation of ratcheting, creep acceleration, cyclic hardening or softening and cyclic stability under symmetric cyclic loadings are considered. The analysis carried out revealed the importance of convexity restriction imposed on a creep compliance and the governing role of its derivative limit value at infinity. It is proved that the limit value equality to zero is the criterion for <b>non-accumulation</b> of plastic strain, for memory fading and for asymptotic symmetrization of cyclic creep curve deviation from the creep curve at the mean stress. The qualitative features of theoretic cyclic creep curves are compared to basic properties of typical test creep curves of viscoelastoplastic materials under cyclic multi-step uni-axial loadings in order to elucidate the linear theory applicability scope, to reveal its abilities to provide an adequate description of basic rheological phenomena related to cyclic creep and to develop techniques of identification and tuning of the linear constitutive relation. In particular, it is proved that the linear constitutive relation with an arbitrary (increasing convex-up) creep compliance function provides the absence of ratcheting and cyclic softening under symmetric cyclic multi-step loadings and the absence of creep acceleration whenever a symmetric cyclic loading is added to a constant load...|$|E
40|$|Radiant frost {{during spring}} is a {{significant}} problem for field pea (Pisum sativum L.) grown in Mediterranean environments as plants are at the vulnerable reproductive stage when frost occurs. In such environments, radiant frost events after the commencement of flowering of field pea may lead to severe frost injuries on plants, and can adversely affect the grain yield. Despite {{the importance of the}} impact of frost on grain yield, no dedicated study has been conducted on reproductive frost tolerance (RFT) in field pea. One aim of this research was to develop a simple and reliable screening method to evaluate frost tolerance of eight reproductive organs (from immature buds to mature pods) which are often present at the same time on a single plant. A controlled environment screening method that exposed plants to a defined temperature regime, including a minimum temperature of - 4. 8 °C for 4 hr, was developed. A scoring key was devised to record frost symptoms on each reproductive organ, and five categories were defined to evaluate frost damage on seeds. Using this screening method, a diverse collection of germplasm was screened, including 83 accessions sourced from high altitude and frost prone areas in 39 countries. A locally adapted variety, Kaspa, the most widely cultivated field pea variety in southern Australia, was included in the screening. The flowering stage was found to be more susceptible to frost than the pod development stage. Buds and set pods were found to be the most frost-susceptible reproductive organs, and mature pods were the most frost-tolerant reproductive organs. Genetic variation was found among field pea genotypes for frost tolerance at the flowering stage. Eight accessions, ATC 104, ATC 377, ATC 947, ATC 968, ATC 1564, ATC 3489, ATC 3992 and ATC 4204, each from a different country, were identified with more than 20 % frost survival of flowering stage organs. Kaspa was highly susceptible to frost at reproductive stages, with no buds, flowers or pods surviving the frost treatment. A BC 1 F 1 population was derived from frost- tolerant ATC 1564 and frost-sensitive Kaspa, and segregation of the frost survival trait and SSR markers was studied. Little marker polymorphism was observed between the two genotypes, with only 41 (12. 3 %) of the 332 primer pairs assayed on DNA samples of the parental lines, exhibiting polymorphic products in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unfortunately, most of these markers were not linked with any other loci, and only two linkage groups were developed: one with three markers, and the other with only two. No strong marker-trait associations were observed for frost tolerance. Responses of reproductive-stage plants to low positive temperature (10 / 5 °C day/night, and 150 – 250 μmole m⁻² s⁻¹ PPFD) for 7, 14 and 21 days were studiedas were the effects of these cold treatments on survival of vegetative and reproductive tissues after frost, for frost-tolerant (ATC 968 and ATC 1564) and frost-sensitive (ATC 1040 and Kaspa) genotypes. Under long exposures (21 days), all genotypes exhibited an ability to maintain the photosynthetic rate. All genotypes were found to be adversely affected by chilling at the reproductive stage, however frost-sensitive genotypes were more responsive to low positive temperatures (cold) than frost tolerant genotypes. Evidence of symptoms of chilling injuries was found in the frost-sensitive genotype: distortion in the ultrastructure of chloroplasts was observed in parenchyma cells of stipules in Kaspa. A decrease and/or <b>non-accumulation</b> of soluble sugar in vegetative and reproductive tissues found in all genotypes under cold conditions reflected the inability in reproductive stage plants to acclimate. In contrast to what has previously been observed for pea seedlings, cold treatment of reproductive-stage pea plants did not result in acclimation, did not improve reproductive frost tolerance, and in fact reduced frost tolerance. In conclusion, a drop in temperature under radiant frost conditions is lethal for reproductive stage pea plants. Reproductive organs are inherently sensitive to frost, and severe frost damage may lead to abortion of buds, flowers and set pods, and significantly reduce the seed weight. Thesis (Ph. D.)
