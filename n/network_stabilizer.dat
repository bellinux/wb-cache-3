50|$|Glass {{has three}} major {{components:}} a network former (silica), a network modifier (flux), and a <b>network</b> <b>stabilizer</b> (predominantly lime). In the early 16th and 17th centuries glassmaking (the {{manufacture of glass}} from raw materials) and glassworking (the creation of objects from glass) occurred within the same glasshouse. Glass was also recycled {{at this time in}} the form of cullet.|$|E
40|$|MYC {{deregulation}} {{is common}} in human cancer and has a role in sustaining the aggressive cancer stem cell populations. MYC mediates a broad transcriptional response controlling normal biological programmes, but its activity is not clearly understood. We address MYC function in cancer stem cells through the inducible expression of Omomyc-a MYC-derived polypeptide interfering with MYC activity-taking as model the most lethal brain tumour, glioblastoma. Omomyc bridles the key cancer stemlike cell features and affects the tumour microenvironment, inhibiting angiogenesis. This occurs because Omomyc interferes with proper MYC localization and itself associates with the genome, with a preference for sites occupied by MYC This is accompanied by selective repression of master transcription factors for glioblastoma stemlike cell identity such as OLIG 2, POU 3 F 2, SOX 2, upregulation of effectors of tumour suppression and differentiation such as ID 4, MIAT, PTEN, and modulation of the expression of microRNAs that target molecules implicated in glioblastoma growth and invasion such as EGFR and ZEB 1. Data support a novel view of MYC as a <b>network</b> <b>stabilizer</b> that strengthens the regulatory nodes of gene expression networks controlling cell phenotype and highlight Omomyc as model molecule for targeting cancer stem cells...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStructural {{changes of}} metals (Zn, Sb, In, Ga) and metal halides (AgI, ZnI 2, CdI 2, PbI 2, BiI 3) {{modified}} GeTe 4 glasses were investigated {{with the aid}} of Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of these glasses in the frequency region between 100 cm− 1 and 300 cm− 1 display four main bands at about 124, 140, 159 and 275 cm− 1 which are contributed by Ge-Te, Te-Te, Te-Te and Ge-Ge vibration modes. The intensity of 159 cm− 1 and 275 cm− 1 bands vary with the addition of different glass modifiers. While the relative intensity of the 124 cm− 1 and 140 cm− 1 bands are insensitive to composition changes. Glass modifiers like Zn, In and Sb act as glass network unstabilizer which will disorganize the glass network by opening up the chain structures of Ge-Te and Te-Te. In the case of Ga and metal halides, Ga can open up Ge-(Te-Te) 4 / 2 tetrahedra and form Ga-(Te-Te) 3 / 2 triangle. Iodine can form covalent bonds with tellurium and decrease the tendency of microcrystal formation. Thus both Ga and iodine ultimately act as glass <b>network</b> <b>stabilizer...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of the R, L, and C parameters of passive components in nonsinusoidal conditions. Since these components usually work with voltage and current waveforms that are different from sinusoidal ones, nonsinusoidal characterization has to be made. The importance of nonsinusoidal characterization of passive components is highlighted through the analysis of two case studies: (1) the influence of distorted waveforms on the line impedance <b>stabilizer</b> <b>network</b> (LISN) passive component behaviors and (2) the influence of voltage and current harmonics on hybrid filter responses. In this paper, the authors propose and describe a measurement method based on linear system identification and model parameter estimation techniques. Then, the two case studies are analyzed and described {{with the help of}} some test results...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel neuro-fuzzy {{hybrid power system}} stabilizer (PSS) design for damping electromechanical modes of oscillation and enhancing power system synchronous stability. The hydrid PSS comprises a front-end conventional nalog PSS design, an artificial neural <b>network</b> (ANN) based <b>stabilizer,</b> and a fuzzy logic post-processor gain scheduler. The stabilizing action {{is controlled by the}} post-processor gain scheduler based on an optimized fuzzy logic excursion based criterion Jo- The two PSS stabilizers, conventional nd neural network, have their damping action scaled online by the magnitude of Jo and its rate of change dJo. The ANN feedforward two-layer based PSS design is the curve fitted nonlinear mapping between the damping vector signals and the desired optimized PSS output and is trained using the benchmark analog PSS conventional design. The fuzzy logic gain scheduling post-processor ensures adequate damping for large excursions, fault conditions, and load rejections. The parallel operation of a conventional PSS and a neural network PSS provides optimal sharing of the damping action under small as well as large-scale generation-load mismatch or variations in external network topology due to fault or switching conditions...|$|R
