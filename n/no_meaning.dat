5|$|Seeds of Evil {{begins with}} the new Turok, Joshua Fireseed, {{appearing}} through a portal to face a female alien named Adon. She explains he has been called by the Elders of the Lost Land, the Lazarus Concordance, to defeat the Primagen, a powerful alien entity that was imprisoned in the wreckage of his own Lightship after attempting to witness {{the creation of the}} universe. This incident {{led to the creation of}} the Lost Land, a bizarre and barbarian world where time has <b>no</b> <b>meaning.</b> Awakened by the events of Dinosaur Hunter, the Primagen mobilizes several races of primitive creatures from the Lost Land to destroy five Energy Totems, powerful devices that bound the Primagen to his Lightship. The destruction of these Energy Totems would allow the Primagen to escape the confines of his Lightship, and the resulting shockwave would destroy the known universe.|$|E
5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E

5000|$|The website B Movies Heroee {{found the}} film worst than its predecessor, stating, [...] "The good Erwin C. Dietrich creates a cheerful comedy soft-core, {{which has no}} great pretensions {{technical}} or narrative. There is no doubt, Sechs Schwedinnen von der Tankstelle is more absurd than its predecessor". The French blog Alligatographe criticized {{almost every aspect of}} the film and concluded, [...] "With <b>no</b> <b>meanings,</b> <b>no</b> talent, no scenario and no comedians, the film bores most of the time".|$|R
25|$|One {{can also}} look at this from the {{perspective}} of what the meaning of our existence is. Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair—what meaning can all of this have?

25|$|Demonology as {{a subject}} {{studying}} evil and occult beings, its Islamic equivalent would deal with Shayateen, but instead usually focus on the Jinn, although their attitude towards humans can differ {{and they can be}} good and evil. Accordingly, Demonology in Islam does not focus on evil spirits contrasting an Angelology of good spirits, rather deals with all sorts of invisible beings, including devils, Jinn, angels and several supernatural creatures appearing in Islamic folklore with <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> in Islamic theology.|$|E
25|$|After {{obtaining a}} {{doctorate}} successfully, Dutch doctors may bear either the title dr. (lower case) before, or the letter D (rarely in practice) behind their name, but not both simultaneously. In the Netherlands, Academic titles are used exclusively within academia. Holding a PhD title has become a standard requirement for a university career. The doctor title has little to <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> or implications for public life outside academia. It cannot be added to documentation (e.g. passport, drivers licence), and is used infrequently in daily practice.|$|E

25|$|This {{ethnic group}} label {{has been used}} by other Malagasy and foreigners to {{describe}} the people who traditionally inhabited the southwestern coast of Madagascar, bounded inland by the Menarandra and Onilahy rivers. The people themselves do not use this label or identify as part of a single ethnic group, however, and prefer to identify along other kinship or geopolitical lines; the name Mahafaly holds <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> for the people originating from this area and instead is a label imposed from the outside. The majority of the population is concentrated {{along the banks of the}} rivers that run through the otherwise largely arid territory.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{cultural}} and language immersion, children were supposed to learn English. School officials also required students to take new English names, either by choice or assignment. This was confusing, as the names from which they were to choose had <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> for them. Luther Standing Bear {{was one of the}} first students to arrive when Carlisle opened its doors in 1879. Once there, he was asked to choose a name from a list on the wall. He randomly pointed at the symbols on a wall and named himself Luther, and his father's name became his surname.|$|E
25|$|While {{ecotourism}} agencies {{claim to}} help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha {{feel that they are}} being put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people do not see the tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive commercialization and commodification of their culture.|$|E

25|$|In chemistry, Schrödinger, Pauling, Mulliken {{and others}} {{noted that the}} {{consequence}} of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet, could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. Max Born suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a probability distribution which was connected with finding the electron {{at some point in}} the wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> if we cannot observe it, as we cannot with electrons in an atom.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{division}} by zero is division {{where the}} divisor (denominator) is zero. Such a division can be formally expressed as a/0 where a is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has <b>no</b> <b>meaning,</b> {{as there is}} no number which, multiplied by 0, gives a (assuming a≠0), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0/0 is also undefined; when it is the form of a limit, it is an indeterminate form. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to a/0 is contained in George Berkeley's criticism of infinitesimal calculus in 1734 in The Analyst ("ghosts of departed quantities").|$|E

All residents of this village were evacuated after the government designated it a no-entry zone. According to a Japanese government panel, authorities had shown no respect for the lives and dignity of village people. One NISA official apologized for the failure and added that the panel had stressed the importance of disclosure; however, the mayor said that the information would have prevented the evacuation into highly polluted areas, and that apologies a year too late had <b>no</b> <b>meaning.</b>|$|E

25|$|Azarenka {{dominated}} the early rivalry, winning {{the first six}} meetings between the pair, including {{in the second round}} of the 2007 Australian Open, the final of the 2009 Brisbane International and all four matches that eventuated in 2010. The win in Brisbane marked Azarenka's first success in a WTA Tour final, having previously lost three finals. Bartoli got her first win over Azarenka in Eastbourne in 2011, winning after Azarenka retired with injury. At the 2011 WTA Tour Championships, Bartoli qualified as a reserve for Maria Sharapova and in the only match she played, she upset Azarenka in three sets. The match had <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> because Bartoli could not qualify for the semi-finals as Sharapova had lost her two matches and Azarenka had already qualified for the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|The {{attitude}} of Vienna Circle towards metaphysics is well expressed by Carnap {{in the article}} 'Überwindung der Metaphysik durch Logische Analyse der Sprache' in Erkenntnis, vol. 2, 1932 (English translation 'The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language' in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed., Logical empiricism at its peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath, New York : Garland Pub., 1996, pp.10–31). A language—says Carnap—consists of a vocabulary, i.e., a set of meaningful words, and a syntax, i.e., {{a set of rules}} governing the formation of sentences from the words of the vocabulary. Pseudo-statements, i.e., sequences of words that at first sight resemble statements but in reality have <b>no</b> <b>meaning,</b> are formed in two ways: either meaningless words occur in them, or they are formed in an invalid syntactical way. According to Carnap, pseudo-statements of both kinds occur in metaphysics.|$|E
25|$|Toponyms are {{the names}} given to places or {{features}} of a particular district, region, etc. This could include planets, countries, cities, towns, villages, buildings etc.; it can be further divided into specialist branches: hodonymy, the names of streets, roads, and the like; hydronymy, the names of water bodies; and oronomy, the names of mountains. Toponymy has popular appeal because of its socio-cultural and historical interest and significance for cartography. However, work on the etymology of toponyms has found that many place names are descriptive, honorific or commemorative but frequently they have <b>no</b> <b>meaning</b> or the meaning is obscure or lost. Also the many categories of names are frequently interrelated. For example, many place-names are derived from personal names (Victoria), many names of planets and stars are derived from the names of mythological characters (Venus, Neptune), and many personal names are derived from place-names, names of nations and the like (Wood, Bridge).|$|E
