5|$|Espejo {{attacked}} Barreto's {{report in}} three ways. First, {{he claimed that}} Barreto, supposed author of the report, was <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> writing it. Then {{he argued that the}} allegations were exaggerated semi-truths or outright lies. And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could not be solved by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and taking advantage of the natural resources of the region.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Tories {{contended that}} the Liberals had been in power too long, {{and that it was}} time for a change. The PC party stated that the Liberals were arrogant, inflexible, and <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> looking at {{problems}} from a new point of view. Liberals responded that with the country prosperous, there was no point to a change.|$|E

5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} to permit {{assisted}} feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not responsive to swallowing tests and required a feeding tube, Judge Greer ruled that she was <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} services, the Congolese Air Force is <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> {{carrying}} out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or {{capable of being}} restored to service and {{it is unclear whether}} the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again the}} fatal {{weakness}} of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Yugoslav Air Force {{inventory}} in April 1941 {{included more}} than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, {{in addition to}} 20 largely civilian transport aircraft which had been pressed into military service. Of these, 107 of the fighter aircraft were of modern design, the remainder were <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> meeting front line Axis aircraft on close to equal terms, and were therefore considered obsolete. Some bomber and reconnaissance aircraft were also considered obsolete for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|The {{inefficiency}} of North Korean logistics {{remained a}} fatal {{weakness of the}} North Korean Army, costing it crucial defeats after an initial success with combat forces. The North Koreans' communications and supply were <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack {{in the face of}} massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points.|$|E
5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered the excitement for the locals. Rosecroft was <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E

5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a driven wheel, a torque must be applied to {{generate}} the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including electric, piston-driven, turbine-driven, pneumatic, and hydraulic. (Torque may also be provided by human power, as in {{the case of}} a bicycle.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of skeletal muscles, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are attached to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.|$|E
5|$|The Allied defeat {{during the}} Greek Campaign {{indirectly}} {{contributed to a}} change of government in Australia. Prime Minister Menzies' leadership had been weakened by the lengthy period he spent in Britain during early 1941, and the high Australian losses in the Greek Campaign led many members of his United Australia Party (UAP) to conclude that he was <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> leading the Australian war effort. Menzies resigned on 26 August after losing the confidence of his party {{and was replaced by}} Arthur Fadden from the Country Party, which was the UAP's coalition partner. Fadden's government collapsed on 3 October and was replaced by an Australian Labor Party government under the leadership of John Curtin.|$|E

5|$|The V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C {{engines are}} {{connected}} by drive shafts {{to a common}} central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine failure occurs. Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The V-22's autorotation characteristics are poor partly because the rotors have low inertia.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{predecessor}} was Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, {{a tactical}} shooter announced in 2011. It had {{a focus on}} narrative, and the story campaign features many cut-scenes and scripted events. However, the game fell into a development hell shortly after its announcement. The game's outdated engine and frequent change of leadership hindered development progress, and game quality was not up to par. In addition, it was planned to be released on seventh-generation video-game consoles which were <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> processing certain game mechanics. Seeing {{the arrival of a}} new generation of consoles, the team wanted to make use of this opportunity to create a more technologically advanced game. As a result, Ubisoft decided to cancel Patriots, and assembled a new team of 25 people to come up with ideas to reboot the series.|$|E
5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment.|$|E

5|$|While Australian Naval Reserve {{personnel}} {{are assigned to}} permanent units, {{most members of the}} Army Reserve and Air Force Reserve are members of reserve units. Most of the RAAF's reserve units are not intended to be deployed, and reserve {{personnel are}} generally attached to regular air force units during their periods of active service. The Army Reserve is organised into permanent combat and support units, though most are currently manned at levels well below their authorised strengths and are <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> deploying as formed units. There have been long-running debates over whether the Army Reserve and its structure remain relevant to modern warfare.|$|E
5|$|By 1995, the ARBiH and the HVO had {{developed}} into better-organised forces employing comparably {{large numbers of}} artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications. The VRS was <b>not</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> penetrating their defences even where its forces employed sound military tactics, for instance in the Battle of Orašje in May and June 1995. After recapture of {{the bulk of the}} Republic of Serb Krajina (the Croatian Serb-controlled areas of Croatia) in Operation Storm in August 1995, the HV shifted its focus to western Bosnia and Herzegovina. The shift was motivated by a desire to create a security zone along the Croatian border, establish Croatia as a regional power and gain favours with the West by forcing an end to the Bosnian War. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed the move as it contributed to their goal of gaining control over western Bosnia and the city of Banja Luka—the largest city in the Bosnian Serb-held territory.|$|E
