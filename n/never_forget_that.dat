5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They showed us how to treat an opening act and I will <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that.</b> That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years!

He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and {{we were having a}} lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

500|$|Frazier {{began his}} fourth season {{representing}} Penn State with 17 points, 8 assists, and 5 rebounds {{in an exhibition}} game against Philadelphia on November 3, 2012. He sat out {{for much of the}} second half, giving his duties to D. J. Newbill. After the game, Frazier said that the team [...] "just played Penn State basketball." [...] On November 9, 2012, the first regular season for Frazier as a senior, he logged his 19th career 20-point game against Saint Francis (PA). On November 18, Frazier left six minutes into a game against Akron due to a ruptured left Achilles tendon. It was announced that he had a recovery period of about 12 months and would be out for the season. The injury was described as a [...] "devastating blow" [...] to the program by ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan. Chambers addressed the situation, saying, [...] "I have no doubt he will meet this challenge and will again be one of the top players in the nation," [...] in accordance to his potential fifth year of NCAA eligibility. Frazier redshirted the season shortly after it was announced by the school that he would undergo surgery. He said, [...] "I will <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> game, that injury, <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> camera. I'm sitting there on the sideline with the (television) camera just zooming in on my foot. I'll never forget the look on my sister's face, my mom and dad's face." [...] During his rehabilitation, Frazier began using the elliptical machine, doing work in the swimming pool, and taking part in weight training. He was guided by Penn State's athletic trainer, Jon Salazer, throughout the process. Frazier's sister Krystal had torn her right Achilles tendon when playing college basketball nearly seven years prior, and had gone through a similar rehabilitation before resuming her playing career.|$|E

By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, [...] "I'll <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'." [...] Before instantaneously writing the word [...] "Saw" [...] in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title.

500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} despite [...] "Don Geiss, America and Hope" [...] not being [...] "strong" [...] {{as the last}} episode it had [...] "many funny moments scattered throughout" [...] that he was satisfied with. He noted that the uncomfortable relationship between Liz and Wesley [...] "worked better" [...] here than previously. Sepinwall said it [...] "was a good story" [...] for Jack's character, {{and that it was}} [...] "nice" [...] to see 30 Rock [...] "fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC".

He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can <b>never</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character [...] "something important to do... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character." [...] Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned [...] "I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, {{this is one of my}} favorite episodes of the season." [...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when the last time I thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E
