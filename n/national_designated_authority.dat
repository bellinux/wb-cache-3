Algeria has installed in July 2, 2006, the Commission of the <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> (DNA), responsible for the implementation of the CDM. In the context of development of a portfolio of projects eligible for a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a Workshop was organized by the Central Directorate HSE (health, Safety and Environment) in June 9, 2008 at the headquarters of the Directorate General of Sonatrach in Algeria. The main objective of this meeting is to present the project MASDAR and identify projects to be eligible for CDM. It {{should be noted that the}} Masdar Initiative was launched in April 2006 by the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which consists to invest in the development of energy future, including clean energy, renewable and alternative. At the institutional level, Tunisia has established its <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> (DNA) since December 2004 for approval of CDM projects. In addition, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Small and Medium Enterprises has created in December 2005 a CDM Task Force which aims to promote the realization of CDM projects in the areas of energy and industry.

The DNA should be designed to both attract investment and to establish an effective regulatory framework for project approval—including assessment to ensure that CDM projects contribute to national sustainable development objectives. Since CDM investment flows to Africa are uncertain, however, countries cannot risk large investments in institutional infrastructure and need to build on existing institutions.

In that context, website development and hosting is a key outreach mechanism for DNAs to market their national CDM programme as well as improving their country?s competitiveness on the global market. But also Annex I DNA websites can play a useful role, particularly for host country companies who want to assess the attractiveness of countries as buyers of CERs. As per the information available on the internet, only 26 Parties among which are 8 Annex I countries have set up official DNA websites which contain a variety of information related to CDM as well as climate change-related activities. As it has been observed that the organisation of most of the DNA websites and quality of information available can be improved and webmarketing tools seem not to have been used, we suggest a standard model structure of websites separately for DNAs of Non-Annex I and Annex I countries differentiated according to the size and CDM attractiveness of the host country...|$|R
40|$|As the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{has shown}} its rapidly growing market and we {{approach}} {{the beginning of the}} first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, an increasing number of non-Annex-B countries have recently established their <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authorities</b> (DNAs) to participate in the CDM. Essential questions to enable efficient operation of a non-Annex-B DNA (host country DNA) are i) how to expedite an approval process without losing quality of approved projects, ii) how to attract foreign investors, and iii) how to become financially sustainable. It is concluded that a balance between the level of scrutiny and approval speed and criteria is essential for the first question. A standardized and transparent approval process is of great help. As for the second question, a quick and transparent approval process {{is one of the key}} factors to attract foreign investors. A careful choice of promotional functions should be made striking a balance between a host country's needs and resource availability. A host country DNA at an early stage of development should first focus on operationalization of its approval system and is not recommended to expand its scope to promotional activities. Concerning the third question, a host country DNA should contemplate a balance among its Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) supply potential, related service fee volumes, and choice of DNA functions.

40|$|Given {{the lack}} of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{activities}} in least developed countries (LDCs), subsidies for CDM projects have been suggested as a remedy. To date, subsidies spent in the CDM context have been limited to capacity building. Donor agencies have provided close to EUR 45 million for awareness raising, institutional capacity building and project development in Africa and LDCs over the last 10 years, which equals about 8 % of the total CDM revenues in these countries. Per registered project, the implicit subsidy reaches almost EUR 1 million. This article assesses these CDM subsidies {{with regard to their}} effectiveness in mobilizing institutional set-up and project development. Targeted capacity building programmes, such as those focused on establishing a <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority,</b> have been successful, but project development support did not mobilize significant numbers of CDM projects in most LDCs.

50|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the effects of}} the mine closures, in 1999 the government announced several measures to assist the economically depressed Jiu Valley. These measures included: 1) designating the Jiu Valley as a disadvantaged area, a status under which companies investing in the area would benefit from certain tax breaks; 2) construction on the Campul lui Neag-Baile Herculane road (begun August 15, 1999); and 3) the <b>National</b> Tourism <b>Authority</b> <b>designating</b> the Jiu Valley as a tourist area in order to provide jobs for some of the laid-off workers. In addition, the World Bank designated $12 million to fund a social mitigation plan. Most miners, however, continue to see no tangible assistance or implementation of job creation or new skills training. As such, government pronouncements are skeptically seen as mere lip service of politicians attempting to placate the electorate and prevent more miner unrest. The money was inadequate, they say, {{the development and implementation of}} laws and programs set up too late, and no infrastructure was ever established to support the development of new industries like tourism.|$|R
40|$|Policy {{documents}} and academic literature suggest that Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) finance could complement traditional ‘energy access’ (EA) funding in developing countries, including the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Yet these propositions {{have not been}} empirically tested. This study helps fill this gap by examining constraints to CDM project passage through five stages of an idealized project development cycle (PDC) in Tanzania, and their implications for {{the ability of the}} CDM to contribute to financing energy access in LDCs. Twenty-five semi-structured interviews and documentary material were analysed using an analytical framework developed for systematic investigation of constraints. Institutional constraints such as the under-performance of Tanzania's <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> were the most often mentioned obstacles for project development. Yet non-institutional constraints such as limited energy sector mitigation potential, indigenous skill shortages, and low carbon market prices also hinder project development. Institutional constraints buttress, rather than supersede, pre-existing non-institutional constraints, and together they prevent energy projects from completing the PDC and accessing CDM finance. The number and severity of constraints suggest that the situation is unlikely to change rapidly, and that the CDM sustains and exacerbates existing global inequalities. Since traditional energy access funding is insufficient to address these inequalities, new funding and policy mechanisms are required...|$|R
40|$|The clean {{development}} mechanism (CDM) {{is part of}} {{the global}} carbon market developing rapidly in response to global warming. It has the twin objective to achieve sustainable development (SD) in host countries and assist Annex- 1 countries in achieving their emission reduction targets in a cost-efficient manner. However, research has shown that trade-offs between the two objectives exist in favour of cost-efficient emission reductions and that left to the market forces, the CDM does not significantly contribute to sustainable development. The main argument of the paper is the need for an international standard for sustainability assessment [...] additional to national definitions [...] to counter weaknesses in the existing system of sustainability approval by <b>designated</b> <b>national</b> <b>authorities</b> in host countries. The article develops a new methodology, i. e. a taxonomy for sustainability assessment based on text analysis of the 744 project design documents (PDDs) submitted for validation by 3 May 2006. Through analysis of the SD benefits of all CDM projects at aggregated levels, the strengths and limitations of the taxonomy are explored. The main policy implication of the research is to propose the taxonomy as the basis of an international verification protocol for designated operational entities (DOEs) for reporting, monitoring and verifying that potential SD benefits described in the PDDs are actually realized. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, industrialised {{countries}} may finance greenhouse gases mitigation projects in developing countries. The Kyoto Pro-tocol explicitly {{requires that the}} CDM shall assist developing countries to achieve sustainable devel-opment. However, a clear definition of sustainability for CDM projects is still debatable. MATA-CDM (Multi-Attributive Assessment of CDM Projects) is an approach that facilitates a quantitative assessment of potential projects regarding their contribution to sustainable development. This paper presents applications of MATA-CDM in two different countries. In South Africa, the application was done mainly for academic and demonstrative purposes, whereas in Uruguay it was implemented together with the responsible <b>Designated</b> <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> (DNA). The work in both countries included the selection of sustainability criteria and measurable indicators. Experts weighted the criteria using personal interviews and a multi-stakeholder workshop. This method was applied to three potential CDM projects in South Africa and one in Uruguay. Results show that under the conditions of this study, the MATA-CDM approach yet fails to yield a perfect quantitative overall sustainability assessment of CDM projects but that several findings could be useful to further develop the approach with the aim to translate the vague term sustainable development to a mainstream project level. Valuable experience was in particular collected with different stakeholder processes to perform criteria weighting...|$|R

Compliance with all legal requirements is a basic consideration for project approval. The DNA invites other agencies with powers over sector-specific areas to join the DNA’s Advisory Board. Prior to project approval, CDM project submissions are required to be sent to the respective provinces where the project is to be executed for a 10 day comment period. CDM is not expected to be a major driver behind afforestation and reforestation projects. Financial costs of CDM AR are seen as a serious barrier to many potential project proponents, particularly for small-scale initiatives. Major multinational forestry companies have not shown a major interest in the carbon market, focusing their investment either on timber or pulp. However, there is considerable interest in certain provinces in the potential for CDM to leverage projects with additional environmental benefits, such as the prevention of erosion or watershed protection. In addition, marginal agricultural land could become more attractive if one includes the value of certified emission reductions (CERs). There may also be a niche i...|$|R

In addition, most of the studies and discussions on the DNA structures in Latin America and Caribbean and Indonesia have revealed the DNAs? inability to be financially supported by the developing host countries However, the Marrakech Accords did not specify that the DNA must not be created at national level.

In addition, based on the new political economy, DNA stakeholders? behaviour has been analysed. The study concluded that the regional approval body is economically defensible and represents the social optimum which maximises social welfare. Moreover, until now all the discussions on the DNA have been carried out at the national level. It has never been an attempt to discuss the CDM institution building at the regional level.
