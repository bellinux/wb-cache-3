40|$|Nitrate {{and certain}} short chain nitro{{compounds}} and nitro-oxy compounds are being investigated as dietary supplements to reduce {{economic and environmental}} costs associated with ruminal methane emissions. Thermodynamically, nitrate is a preferred electron acceptor in the rumen that consumes electrons {{at the expense of}} methanogenesis during dissimilatory reduction to an intermediate, nitrite, which is primarily reduced to ammonia although small quantities of nitrous oxide may also be produced. Short chain nitrocompounds act as direct inhibitors of methanogenic bacteria although certain of these compounds may also consume electrons at the expense of methanogenesis and are effective inhibitors of important foodborne pathogens. Microbial and nutritional consequences of incorporating nitrate into ruminant diets typically results in increased acetate production. Unlike most other methane-inhibiting supplements, nitrate decreases or has no effect on propionate production. The type of nitrate salt added influences rates of nitrate reduction, rates of nitrite accumulation and efficacy of methane reduction, with sodium and potassium salts being more potent than calcium nitrate salts. Digestive consequences of adding nitrocompounds to ruminant diets are more variable and may in some cases increase propionate production. Concerns about the toxicity of nitrate’s intermediate product, nitrite, to ruminants necessitate management, as animal poisoning may occur via methemoglobinemia. Certain of the naturally occurring nitrocompounds, such as 3 -nitro- 1 -propionate or 3 -nitro- 1 -propanol also cause poisoning but via inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase. Typical risk management procedures to avoid nitrite toxicity involve gradually adapting the animals to higher concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, which could possibly be used with the nitrocompounds as well. A number of organisms responsible for nitrate metabolism in the rumen have been characterized. To date a single rumen bacterium is identified as contributing appreciably to <b>nitrocompound</b> metabolism. Appropriate doses of the nitrocompounds and nitrate, singly or in combination with probiotic bacteria selected for nitrite and <b>nitrocompound</b> detoxification activity promise to alleviate risks of toxicity. Further studies are needed to more clearly define benefits and risk of these technologies to make them saleable for livestock producers...|$|E

The solvent effects were calculated using a PCM(Pauling) and SMD(Pauling) solvation models for ions and neutral molecules, respectively. Calculated thermodynamics of {{the reduction of}} nitro group to nitroso group suggests consequtive four-steps’ process (electron – proton – electron – proton transfer) where the first proton comes from solution, while the second one – from FMN.

Ability to thermal explosion initiation of benzoyl peroxide and of <b>nitrocompounds</b> is compared. Explosion properties of peroxides are analyzed. Measurements of burning temperature by means of micro thermocouples and the comparison of their values with the calculated ones of benzoyl peroxide and hydroperoxide of isopropyl benzene lead {{to the conclusion that}} burning of them propagates in condensed phase. It is noted that heat instability of benzoyl peroxide burning, contrary to many <b>nitrocompounds,</b> is absent. Burning of benzoyl peroxide is stable even in vacuum. It is noted that, although benzoyl peroxide is not applied as explosive, in some cases the explosion hazard of benzoyl peroxide heating can be bigger than that of PETN.

40|$|Neutrophils play a {{major role}} in acute {{inflammation}} by generating reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. Opioid peptides, including enkephalins, are present at inflammation sites. Neutrophils contribute to protect against inflammatory pain by releasing opioid peptides. In this investigation, the ability of human polymorphonuclear cells to induce oxidative and nitrative modifications of Leu-enkephalin has been investigated in vitro. Activated human neutrophils mediate the oxidation of Leu-enkephalin resulting in the production of dienkephalin. In the presence of nitrite at concentrations observed during inflammatory and infectious process (10 - 50 mu M), nitroenkephalin, a nitrated derivative of Leu-enkephalin, is additionally formed. The yield of nitroenkephalin increases with nitrite concentration and is significantly inhibited by the addition of catalase or 4 -aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH), a specific inhibitor of peroxidases. These results suggest that neutrophils induce nitration of Leu-enkephalin by a mechanism that is dependent on myeloperoxidase activity and hydrogen peroxide. Oxidative/nitrative modifications of Leu-enkephalin have been also evidenced when cells were treated with the NO-donor molecule, DEANO. The nitrated enkephalin has been examined for its effect on leukocyte functional responses. The data reveal that nitroenkephalin at micromolar concentrations inhibits superoxide anion generation and degranulation of azurophilic granules of human polymorphonuclear cells. Moreover, nitroenkephalin inhibits spontaneous apoptosis of neutrophils, as evaluated by measuring caspase- 3 activity.

Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, {{prepared by the}} Frens method, onto the resin beads in the chloride form is possible by the ready exchange of the citrate-capped negatively charged gold particles. The difficulty of nanoparticle loading, avoiding aggregation, has been solved by stepwise operation. Analysis of the gold particles after immobilization and successive elution confirm the unaltered particle morphology while compared {{to those of the}} citrate-capped gold particles in colloidal dispersion. It was observed that the rate of the reaction increases with the increase in catalyst loading, which suggests the catalytic behavior of the gold nanoparticles for the reduction of the aromatic nitrocompounds. The rate constant, k, was found to be proportional to the total surface area of the nanoparticles in the system. Kinetic study for the reduction of a series of aromatic nitrocompounds reveals that the aromatic <b>nitrocompound</b> exclusively adsorbs to atop sites of gold particles and that the rate of the reduction reaction increases as the particle size decreases. Similar reaction kinetics was observed involving gold sol of variable size (homogeneous catalysis) as catalyst. The induction time and the activation energy of the reaction decreases with decrease in particle size indicating the decrease in activation energy for the smaller particles, which also speaks for the increase of surface roughness with decrease in particle size.

Based on 16 S rDNA clone libraries, a common phylotype, designated CH 101, ranged between 92. 86 to 100 % of the total clones whereas less than 1 % of the other phylotypes were found. On the basis of the sequence identity, all of the sequences, except sequence CH 1270, are related from 98. 97 to 99. 45 % to 16 S rDNA Methanobrevibacter woesei GS. Sequence CH 1270 is 97. 62 % homologous to the sequence identified to uncultured archaeon clone ConP 1 - 11 F. Clearly, the predominant methanogen found to reside in the chicken ceca was M. woesei.

The second phase of the study was conducted to observe the effects of selected nitrocompounds and two different feedstuffs on in vitro methane production in chicken cecal contents and rumen fluid. Initially, one of the three nitrocompounds was added to incubations containing cecal contents from laying hens supplemented with either alfalfa or layer feed. Both feed materials influenced volatile fatty acids (VFA) production and also fostered methane production in the incubations although methane was lower (P < 0. 05) in incubations with added <b>nitrocompound,</b> particularly nitroethane. Secondly, nitroethane was examined in incubations of bovine or ovine rumen fluid or cecal contents containing either alfalfa or layer feed.

40|$|Theoretical {{studies of}} {{molecular}} conformations and electronic properties calculations of eight 5 -nitrofuryl thiosemicarbazone free radicals, {{by means of}} ab initio (R/UHF), and DFT (R/UB 3 LYP) methods are presented and discussed in comparison with ESR and electrochemical experimental data. DFT calculated hyperfine coupling constants {{were used for the}} simulation of experimental spectra. We observed the molecules adopt mainly two conformations, both showing a pattern of spin density delocalization unusual for free radicals formed from aromatic <b>nitrocompounds.</b> Energy potential surfaces scaning through a determined dihedral angle were drawn to evaluate whether these conformations could coexist in equilibrium. Fukui and molecular orbital analysis were compared with ESR data as reactivity local indexes...|$|R
