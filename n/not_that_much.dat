25|$|Wine expert Tom Stevenson {{describes}} the classic profile of Sancerre blanc as bone dry, highly aromatic with intense flavors of peaches and gooseberries. He describes Sancerre rouge as being light to medium bodied with floral aromas and delicate flavors. The Pinot noir based rosés {{are described as}} dry and light bodied with raspberry and strawberry notes. Other wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson note {{that in recent years}} overproduction has introduced a lot of variable quality with some Sancerre blancs producing flavor profiles that are <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> different from generic Sauvignon de Touraine from the Middle Loire, though this varies depending on the producer and overall quality of the vintage.|$|E
25|$|An unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, {{formerly}} {{classified as}} T. nutricula, might be effectively immortal {{because of its}} ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory. At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded {{that there are three}} species of jellyfish that are immortal, and says their immortality may hold the key to immortality for human beings, as he says that genetically they are <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> different from humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{reality is}} not so clear-cut. The most {{advanced}} fusion programs {{in the world are}} inertial confinement fusion (such as National Ignition Facility) and magnetic confinement fusion (such as ITER and other tokamaks). In the case of the former, there is no solid roadmap to power generation. In the case of the latter, commercial power generation is not expected until around 2050. In both cases, the type of fusion discussed is the simplest: D-T fusion. The reason for this is the very low Coulomb barrier for this reaction; for D+3He, the barrier is much higher, and it is even higher for 3He–3He. The immense cost of reactors like ITER and National Ignition Facility are largely due to their immense size, yet to scale up to higher plasma temperatures would require reactors far larger still. The 14.7 MeV proton and 3.6 MeV alpha particle from D–3He fusion, plus the higher conversion efficiency, means that more electricity is obtained per kilogram than with D-T fusion (17.6 MeV), but <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> more. As a further downside, the rates of reaction for helium-3 fusion reactions are not particularly high, requiring a reactor that is larger still or more reactors to produce the same amount of electricity.|$|E

[...] With her, Elizabeth brought a marriage portion of about £1533. This was not to make Suffolk rich. Not only was it <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> compared to other dowries of the period, but York, whose wages from his various offices were almost permanently in arrears, often could not keep up the instalments.

In October 2007, during an interview with the development team responsible for the remake of Final Fantasy Tactics for the PlayStation Portable, , Executive Producer Akitoshi Kawazu was asked {{about the possibility of a}} remake or port of the title to the PSP. Kawazu mentioned that it is [...] "the next natural candidate for such an update", although there would be difficulty in porting the game, because it was a title that already pushed the original PlayStation to its technical limits. Kawazu also remarked that bringing the character Ashley Riot into other Ivalice titles would be difficult since, even in Vagrant Story, [...] "there's really <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> learn(ed) about Ashley Riot".|$|E

The character was initially conceived as the sister of Sid Fairgate (Don Murray), one of the central characters on the show, who was killed off in the next season. Casting agent Barbara Miller-Gidaly introduced Mills and Jacobs. After meeting with Miller-Gidaly, Jacobs decided to have Mills test for the role, which was unusual for an established actress. She auditioned shortly after and convinced the producers that she was the right person for the part. Jacobs said, [...] "She came back that afternoon and she read and she was great, and it meant reshaping the role a little bit, but, um, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much.</b> You know, she still came in, she drove up in the Volvo station wagon.

Using data from Spain, Maria Jose Luengo-Prado and Almudena Sevilla-Sanz take issue with this perspective. <b>Noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of the reduction in spending is related to food expenditure, they argue that in many cases reduced spending simply reflects the fact that those who are retired have more time to use home-produced goods...|$|R

[...] Kellman selected [...] "Amor Gitano", [...] "Irreemplazable" [...] and the [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] remix as the highlights of the EP.

2500|$|Since the {{ensemble}} covariance is rank deficient (there {{are many more}} state variables, typically millions, than {{the ensemble}} members, typically less than a hundred), it has large terms for pairs of points that are spatially distant. Since in reality the values of physical fields at distant locations are <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> correlated, the covariance matrix is tapered off artificially based on the distance, which gives rise to localized EnKF algorithms. These methods modify the covariance matrix used in the computations and, consequently, the posterior ensemble is no longer made only of linear combinations of the prior ensemble.|$|E

[...] Navarro wrote, [...] "Most offensive of all, however, is how cheaply The Apprentice handles its license. This game presents itself horribly.

[...] Navarro also criticized the game's audio clips of Donald Trump, and its short length, noting that the entire game could be completed in 20 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrator is}} {{met by the}} writer George MacDonald, whom he hails as his mentor, just as Dante did when encountering Virgil in the Divine Comedy; and MacDonald becomes the narrator's guide in his journey, just as Virgil became Dante's. MacDonald {{explains}} {{that it is possible}} for a soul to choose to remain in Heaven despite having been in the grey town; for such souls, the goodness of Heaven will work backwards into their lives, turning even their worst sorrows into joy, and changing their experience on Earth to an extension of Heaven. Conversely, the evil of Hell works so that if a soul remains in, or returns to, the grey town, even its happiness on Earth will lose its meaning, and its experience on Earth would have been Hell. Few of the ghosts realize that the grey town is, in fact, Hell. Indeed, it is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> different from the life they led on Earth: joyless, friendless and uncomfortable.

2500|$|Due to the {{unconventional}} {{release of the}} game, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves has not been widely reviewed as a standalone product. Greg Miller from IGN scored the game 6.5/10, describing it {{as more of a}} tech demo of the PlayStation Move's functionality, rather than a fully-fledged game. He also criticised the game's lack of lasting appeal as there are no prizes or costumes to collect. Miller did however say [...] "If you have a bud who is as into LittleBigPlanet as you are, you're going to have fun" [...] and that the game could act as a good demonstration piece for the PlayStation Move. Eurogamer scored the game 7/10 and said that [...] "there's not a great deal of substance" [...] and criticised the use of the LittleBigPlanet engine instead of LittleBigPlanet 2s enhanced features, but tempered it by saying [...] "when you've got a game that already looks as lovely as this one does, I'm sure you'll be able to live with that." [...] GamesRadar also criticised the game's length; [...] "Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves is a very capable game; there's just <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> [...] "game" [...] to go around", the reviewer was also puzzled about the use of the original LittleBigPlanet engine in a game released next to the enhanced LittleBigPlanet 2 and summed up by saying [...] "Overall, Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves is a strange beast. It's too good to be a demo, too short to be a game, too outdated to be a preview and imbued with too much care and character to be passed off as a PS Move advergame", and scored the game as 7/10.|$|E
