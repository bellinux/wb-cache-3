Structurally, CNTs represent one dimensional (1 D) tubes with single- or multiple-layer graphitic sidewalls; and graphene is two dimensional (2 D) one-atom-thick sp 2 carbon sheets. With their remarkable intrinsic physical, chemical, and electronic properties, carbon nanomaterials have revolutionary potential to make impact on various existing technologies in many fields from construction and energy to electronics and biomedicine. Current research activities are focused on harnessing the desired properties of carbon nanomaterials for practical applications by their rational functionalization. Among different covalent or noncovalent chemical functionalization schemes, heteroatom doping into the graphitic lattice most fundamentally alters the intrinsic properties of <b>carbon</b> nanomaterials. <b>Nitrogen-doped</b> CNTs are the most studied doped carbon nanomaterials due to their excellent electrochemical catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Moreover, <b>nitrogen-doping</b> in multiwalled <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> (MWCNTs) results in hollow compartments resembling stacked cups. These nanocups, termed as <b>nitrogen-doped</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> cups (NCNCs), may find potential applications as drug delivery carriers. We managed to efficiently separate individual nanocups from their stacks through chemical and physical separation methods. By functionalizing separated NCNCs with gold nanoparticles (GNPs), the nanocups can be effectively corked by GNPs on the cup opening. The GNP-corked NCNCs form self-enclosing nanocontainers with potential applications as drug delivery nanocarriers. The increasing use of carbon nanomaterials in biological and industrial applications inevitably raises the risk of exposure to humans and the environment with potential toxicological and ecological issues.
