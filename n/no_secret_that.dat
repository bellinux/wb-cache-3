5|$|In 1629, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, {{arrived in}} Virginia, having {{traveled}} south from Avalon, his failed colony on Newfoundland. Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians, both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants, {{and because it}} was <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own. After a brief stay, Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter, and Claiborne, in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony, was sent to England to argue the Virginians' case. This happened to be to Claiborne's private advantage, as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{power balance}} {{began to change}} after King Rajendra came of age and his grandmother, Tripurasundari, died on 26 March 1832 due to cholera. Bhimsen lost his main support and the court became a stage for a power struggle, which even though started off {{as an attempt to}} assert the King's {{authority}} from the Mukhtiyar, spread to various aristocratic clans and their attempt to secure total authority. It was <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> Bhimsen was able to maintain his supremacy due to the large standing army under his and his family's command; and in the subsequent years, different factions would attempt to increase their influence based on the strength of the number of battalions under their grip. After Tripurasundari's death, the royal seal by which government orders were approved naturally went {{into the hands of the}} senior queen Samrajya Laxmi, who knew all too well of its powers and wanted to emulate the queens of the past by establishing her own regency. Sensing Samrajya Laxmi's ambition, Ranbir Singh started to stroke her dislike of Bhimsen in the hopes of becoming the mukhtiyar himself. Getting a whiff of this matter, Bhimsen strongly reprimanded Ranbir Singh which caused him to resign from his General's position and live in retirement in his house at Sipamandan. However, Bhimsen later managed to placate his brother, by giving him the title of Chota (Little) General, and send him to Palpa as its governor. Since he could find nobody that he could trust to keep watch over the royal palace, Bhimsen from then on started to live in an ordinary rented house located near the palace premise.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> {{there have}} been some {{difficult}} episodes in our past – Jallianwala Bagh, which I shall visit tomorrow, is a distressing example. But history cannot be rewritten, however much we might sometimes wish otherwise. It has its moments of sadness, as well as gladness. We must learn from the sadness and build on the gladness.|$|E

25|$|Marvel Comics {{created their}} own version of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, when they {{introduced}} Fafnir of Vanaheim and his companion Blackrat to the Conan comic series.

25|$|Cipollini made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> he did {{not like}} {{climbing}} stages, and while he completed all stages of the Giro on many occasions, he infuriated purists by not attempting mountain stages at the Tour or Vuelta. While this is a common practice with sprinters without points jersey aspirations so as to save themselves {{for the rest of the}} season, Cipollini's practice of releasing photos of himself lounging at the beach while the others struggled in the mountains earned him more than his fair share of attention in this regard.|$|E
25|$|In tributes, both Taoiseach Brian Cowen {{and former}} UK prime {{minister}} Tony Blair stressed Cardinal Daly's {{contribution to the}} peace process in Northern Ireland. The deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, the Sinn Féin MLA Martin McGuinness, said it was <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> Republicans and Cardinal Daly had never enjoyed a close relationship during The Troubles, but that relations had warmed since then. Warm tributes also came from the Primate of the Church of Ireland, the Most Rev. Alan Harper, the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Rev. Donald P. Ker, and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Rt. Rev. Dr. Stafford Carson.|$|E

It is a record of a phase and period of her existence which, I believe, she might wish those who are--interested in her--to study, especially as she had <b>no</b> <b>secrets</b> <b>that</b> she could desire to conceal.

25|$|Over the {{objections}} of Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pöhl, he allowed a 1:1 exchange rate for wages, interest and rent between the West and East Marks. In the end, this policy would seriously hurt companies in the new federal states. Together with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Kohl was able to resolve talks with the former Allies of World War II to allow German reunification. He received assurances from Gorbachev that a reunified Germany {{would be able to}} choose which international alliance it wanted to join, although Kohl made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> he wanted the reunified Germany to inherit West Germany's seats at NATO and the EC.|$|E
25|$|The match {{ended with}} Honinbo Shusai winning by two points. However, his victory was {{surrounded}} by controversies. At {{the time of the}} match, the tradition dictated that the player holding white had the right to adjourn the game at any time, and there was no sealing of moves before adjournment. This meant that Shusai, being the nominally stronger player and thus holding white, could adjourn the match whenever {{it was his turn to}} move and continue deliberating at home before the match resumed. Shusai shamelessly abused this privilege by adjourning the game more than a dozen times, all at his turn to play. For instance, on the eighth day of the match, Shusai played first, and Go Seigen replied within two minutes, Shusai then thought for three and a half hours, only to adjourn the game. It was <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> Shusai, during adjournments, discussed and studied the game with his students to come up with the best moves. Go Seigen was therefore put into an especially adverse position for having to take on the entire Honinbo establishment.|$|E

500|$|Former prime ministerial adviser Sanjaya Baru {{published}} a book titled [...] in which he criticised Singh for not being [...] "fully in charge of his government in having {{to compete with the}} dynastic INC leader, Sonia Gandhi, for influence within his own cabinet." [...] Singh's office retorted in saying it is [...] "smacks of fiction and coloured views of a former adviser." [...] After Baru said [...] "it is <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> Sonia Gandhi was the super prime minister," [...] Priyanka Vadra replied [...] "I think Manmohan Singh ji is the super PM."

500|$|McGovern has aligned {{himself with}} liberal and {{progressive}} causes. [...] "It's <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> I'm a liberal," [...] {{he said in}} 2010. [...] "I didn't poll any of this stuff, but I am who I am." [...] Political interest groups generally rank McGovern {{as one of the}} most liberal members of Congress. The National Journal ranked him among the seven most liberal representatives. The Washington Post noted that the political similarities between McGovern and his mentor, 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern, are numerous: [...] "Both are considered among the most liberal and anti-war lawmakers of their generation. The most prominent difference? They aren't related." ...|$|E
500|$|Responses to PewDiePie's content are mixed; Anthony Taormina of Game Rant writes [...] "It's <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> as his {{popularity}} continues to grow, PewDiePie {{has become an}} increasingly divisive figure. While some love the YouTuber for the entertainment he provides, others see PewDiePie as the singular representation of our gameplay commentary obsessed culture." [...] Chris Reed of The Wall St. Cheat Sheet commented on the divisive opinions about PewDiePie, stating, [...] "PewDiePie is not universally adored [...] the great divide in opinion on PewDiePie seems to be largely generational. Older people {{are less likely to}} subscribe to YouTube channels, or to pay much credence to YouTube personalities in general. Many younger viewers, on the other hand, see him as endlessly entertaining and relatable." ...|$|E

Being so slim, he could go where any of his four-footed neighbors could, and it wasn't long before he knew all about every hole and nook and corner anywhere around.

500|$|Chamberlain {{hoped that}} a {{cancellation}} of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference. Describing the event as the [...] "most crucial gathering since Versailles", Time magazine featured Chamberlain on its cover, referring to him as [...] "that mighty mover behind British Cabinet scenes, lean, taciturn, iron-willed... It is <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> Scot MacDonald remains Prime Minister by Prime Mover Chamberlain's leave." [...] The Conference came to nothing, when US President Franklin Roosevelt sent word {{that he would not}} consider any war debt cancellation. After the US Congress passed the Johnson Act, forbidding loans to nations in default on their debts, Chamberlain felt that Britain could not pay the entire debt, and, as the Act made no distinction between a partial and complete default, the Chancellor entirely suspended Britain's war debt payments to the US.|$|E

Louis tried to take advantage but an attempt by a Franco-Dutch fleet to combine with a larger Dutch fleet ended in failure on 17 September when they encountered a larger English fleet led by Thomas Allin off Dungeness.|$|E
500|$|At the Giants Pérez {{hoped for}} a fresh start; rumors had swirled in Kansas City about {{problems}} in the clubhouse, and it was <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> the trade had been deeply unpopular in both Denver and Kansas City.

[...] Pérez hit [...]256 {{over the course of}} the 2003 season; an improvement on his previous season but a far cry from the Colorado days. Pérez returned for the 2004 season, but the situation in San Francisco had become uncomfortable. Although signed as a starter at second base, he quickly became backup to José Cruz, Jr., while he lost out at shortstop to Deivi Cruz. His batting average slumped to [...]232. He had a staunch defender in manager Felipe Alou, but in the end he was the [...] "odd man out" [...] and the Giants released him on August 14, 2004.

500|$|During {{his ninth}} season in 1966, Taylor did not sign a new one-year {{contract}} and instead played out his option; he made <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> {{it was likely}} his last season with the Packers. He caught a career-high 41 passes that year but recorded the fewest rushing yards since his second season. The Packers finished atop the Western Division with a 12–2 record and defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the 1966 NFL Championship Game for their fourth NFL title in six years. In January 1967, Taylor and the Packers played in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, known retroactively as Super Bowl I, in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. They easily defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 35–10. Taylor was the top rusher of the game with 56 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} on a Packer Sweep play, with his score being the first rushing touchdown in Super Bowl history. [...] "It was just good blocking on a weak-side sweep play," [...] said Taylor of his touchdown run. [...] "It's a cakewalk when you get the blocking. It was just like we had been doing the last five or six years." [...] The game was his final with the Packers.|$|E
500|$|... "Applause" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Chris Richards of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "It's good. Maybe even slow clap good. Because while so many (too many!) of Gaga's songs {{have been designed}} to boost the esteem of her flock, this song finds her openly pining for the mass-adulation that all superstars need to survive." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard lauded the song's hook and remarked, [...] "As always, Gaga has turned a lofty idea into a jingle for the masses." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, stating that [...] "Lady Gaga makes <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> <b>that</b> she's after mass adoration, and as far as lead singles go, her next grand spectacle is off to a strong start." [...] Carl Williot of Idolator praised the track, saying that it [...] "ticks all the right boxes when it comes to being a balls-to-the-wall pop delight ... this is pop doing what good pop songs should do, which is grab you by the collar from the first listen and make you fall in love on the spot." [...] The Huffington Post writer Baggers described it as [...] "pop at its best: instant, euphoric, joyful and impossible to get out of your head".|$|E

[...] Vicky Frost from the media blog Organgrinder felt that although the storyline was decent, [...] "it did seem to be about three different episodes stuffed into one." [...] She also noted the it was generally [...] "ridiculous, but it isn't nearly as ridiculous - or ridiculously bad - as its spin-off [...] was." [...] Leigh Holmwood however, believed [...] "it was good to see the spy drama return for a seventh series with a high octane episode mixing Islamic terrorism and Russian counter espionage, {{even if it did}} overdo the 'for Queen and country' bit."
