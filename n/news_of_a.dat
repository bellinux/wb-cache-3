5|$|In Baghdad, {{given the}} lack of firm and public {{leadership}} by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and when <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family begged him to come back to Baghdad. On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad sent three leading Muslims {{to bring}} him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to {{increase}} {{the morale of the}} Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, so as to avoid any panic within Muslim ranks.|$|E

5|$|<b>News</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Kidnapping (Noticia de un secuestro) {{was first}} {{published}} in 1996. It is a non-fiction book that examines a series of related kidnappings and Narco-terrorist actions committed in the early 1990s in Colombia by the Medellín Cartel, a drug cartel founded and operated by Pablo Escobar. The text recounts the kidnapping, imprisonment, and eventual release of prominent figures in Colombia, including politicians and members of the press.|$|E

5|$|A mutant with {{a nearly}} indestructible layer of skin. In the film's early sequences, he is a {{formidable}} fighting man, but years later, due to a poor diet, has gained {{an enormous amount of}} weight. A fan of the X-Men movies, Durand contacted the producers for a role as soon as <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new film came out. The suit went through six months of modifications, and had a tubing system inside to cool Durand down with ice water. David Harbour auditioned for the role, but was turned down for being too fat at the time.|$|E

5|$|Cambrian, {{the fourth}} ship {{of her name}} in the Royal Navy, was laid down by Pembroke Dockyard in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 8 December 1914, {{launched}} on 3 March 1916, and completed in May 1916. She was commissioned into service that same month and {{was assigned to the}} 4th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet in which she served through the end of World War I and until 1919. The squadron was generally tasked with screening the battleships of the Grand Fleet during the war. The ship did not participate in the inconclusive Action of 19 August 1916 with the rest of her squadron. The squadron was briefly detached from the Grand Fleet in March 1917 to fruitlessly patrol off the Norwegian coast when <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> blockade runner was received by the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 Berni {{returned}} to Rosario where he briefly {{lived on a}} farm and was then hired as a municipal employee. The Argentina of the 1930s {{was very different from}} the Paris of the 1920s. He witnessed labor demonstrations and the miserable effects of unemployment and was shocked by the <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military coup d'état in Buenos Aires (see Infamous Decade). Surrealism didn't convey the frustration or hopelessness of the Argentine people. Berni organized Mutualidad de Estudiantes y Artistas and {{became a member of the}} local Communist party.|$|E
5|$|In August 804, Harun {{dispatched}} another raid {{under his}} general Ibrahim ibn Jibril. The Arabs crossed into Asia Minor through the Cilician Gates and raided freely. Nikephoros {{set out to}} meet them, but was forced to return before he could do so, due to some unspecified event at his back (Warren Treadgold surmises <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible conspiracy). On his march home, however, the Arabs launched a surprise attack at Krasos in Phrygia and defeated his army. According to al-Tabari, the Byzantines lost 40,700 men and 4,000 pack animals, while the Emperor himself was wounded three times. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor confirms that the imperial army lost many men and that Nikephoros was almost killed himself; saved only by the bravery of his officers.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this defeat, and with rumours circulating in Constantinople of his death, Theophilos's position was precarious. He abandoned the campaign and withdrew to Dorylaion, whence he soon departed for the imperial capital. Ancyra itself was left abandoned, and plundered by the Arab army on 27 July. Then the united Abbasid army marched unopposed to Amorion, which fell after a siege of two weeks. Out of its entire population of some 70,000, only about half survived the brutal sack, to be sold as slaves. The fall {{of the city was}} one of the heaviest blows Byzantium suffered in the entire 9th century, both in material and symbolic terms. Fortunately for the Empire, <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rebellion in the Caliphate forced al-Mu'tasim to withdraw soon after.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September, the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions {{along with}} the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna. <b>News</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{breakthrough}} at Dobro Pole prompted the defenders of Doiran to abandon their positions and rush {{to the defense of}} their homeland, in order to prevent a future occupation by the Entente. On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached Krivolak, thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania. The 2nd Bulgarian Army headed towards the Kosturino Pass avoiding direct engagement with the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Rigorous {{attempts}} to warn of tornadoes {{began in the}} United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, {{with the advent of}} weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.|$|E
50|$|On April 14, 2010, {{there was}} <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ontario Northland {{takeover}} of the controversial Ottawa Valley rail tracks. However, this development is highly unlikely due to <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> funds. This purchase may be improbable.|$|R

5|$|The camp's {{commanding}} officer Major General J. Franklin Bell called Berlin {{into his office}} and asked the showman to raise funds for a new community house to lodge families of service members who visited the camp. The projected expense of the project was $35,000. At first, Berlin called in favors from civilian colleagues to visit and put on local performances to boost morale, but <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Navy fundraising show on Broadway called Boom Boom inspired Berlin to request permission to write and stage a full Broadway production of their own.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. According to an {{advertisement}} in the February 1899 issue of The Numismatist, gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as {{a birthday present}} and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a dealer offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins rates the least expensive gold dollar in very fine condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given {{for each of the}} Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.|$|E
5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a reciprocity treaty with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism. The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. <b>News</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E
