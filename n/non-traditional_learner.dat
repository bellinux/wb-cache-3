40|$|Abstract. The e-Learning {{concept is}} a {{foreseeable}} tendency in many environments nowadays, with {{differences in the}} stage of e-Learning utilization and usage, {{as well as the}} paradigm shift that comes with it. In its varieties, it offers fruitful soil for developing systems such as distance and hybrid learning, as well as initiatives such as life-long learning and <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learner</b> education. We are proposing a model of Faculty certification program that trains non-traditional learners with various backgrounds for a specific skill set, needed by working professionals, delivered on demand, at the workplace, with obtained set of competences effective proximately after completion. The model is learner-oriented and specific-skill-set-oriented. It combines the related theoretical backgrounds of several faculty subjects along with practical exercises of what needs to be learned. The example skill set would be Financial Risk Analysis for an Entrepreneur, with brief elaboration of the benefits for the stakeholders in the process...|$|E

While most institutions reflected the intent of honoring learners' prior learning, achieved informally or non-formally, institutions were bound by internal policy and structure in terms of protocols. The relationship of transfer credit opportunities to engaging with learners in preparing RPL documents for assessment was also varied. Broad disparities in fee information made it difficult to determine what the actual costs of various protocols would be for learners.

50|$|Many {{students}} {{are drawn to}} online learning {{for a variety of}} reasons; particularly, the ability to avoid the requirement of traveling to a physical location, which may be impossible for some <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learners.</b> Critics argue that for online education to be taken seriously, online programs must adhere to generally accepted educational standards. One way that virtual schools are proving their effectiveness is the implementation of the same standardized testing that brick and mortar schools require of their students. To address this criticism, the International Association for K-12 Online Learning (iNACOL) developed a set of standards released in September 2007 and updated on October 12, 2011. Some believe that this is an important first step in monitoring online programs, but while every provider of education must be accredited, the quality of accreditation varies significantly. For instance, the non-profit AACSB is the most prestigious accreditation agency for business schools and no virtual schools have received accreditation by the agency.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a new, mid-range {{theory of the}} recognition of prior learning (RPL) with <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learners.</b> It incorporates a practice framework accompanied by good practice principles, to support the implementation of socially just RPL. Formal skills recognition processes, such as RPL, {{have been used as}} tools for enhancing social inclusion and social justice within educational institutions across the world. RPL seeks to affirm and accredit skills and knowledges that have evolved from diverse, informal learning experiences and cultural locations and is thought by some to be &# 145;a powerful tool for bringing people into the learning system&# 146; (Hargreaves 2006, 2). However, in Australia and elsewhere, RPL is largely accessed by those who are already familiar with systems and discourses of formal learning. This excludes the very people who could most benefit from RPL and misses an opportunity to integrate alternative knowledges into professional education curricula. This qualitative, empirical study, explores non-traditional learners&# 146; experiences of RPL for the formal award of Community Services qualifications within the Australian vocational education and training (VET) sector. Data are gathered at three points during the RPL process through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with nine RPL candidates, their workplace supervisors and the assessors. A total of 22 participants provide data via 54 individual interviews and one assessor focus group. Data analysis was undertaken using constructivist grounded theory methods revealing three key aspects of RPL that operate as &# 145;vectors&# 146; to guide and stabilise the RPL experience for individual candidates. A strong &# 145;meta&# 146; theme emerges, indicating ontological purposes of RPL and intersubjective qualities and effects of the assessment. Philosophical and political theories of Recognition (Honneth 1995, Oliver 2001) are used to demonstrate how RPL is an interpersonal exchange that engages both the candidate's and assessor's sense of 'who' they are and how socially valued and agentive they feel. The thesis concludes that in order to provide a suitably tailored response to <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learners</b> in the context of striving for socially just and inclusive RPL, the assessor must embrace this avowedly ontological conceptual base and hone specific skills for the conduct of an ethically responsible assessment relationship...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the professional lives of {{three groups of}} teachers whose work with <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learners</b> locates them {{in the field of}} open and distance learning. These are Queensland regional university teachers; Queensland adult literacy teachers; and English teachers of Travellers. All three groups are positioned - or position themselves - between their students and various incarnations of officialdom (university administration, vocational education and training syllabus documents, government agencies). This positioning constructs many of these teachers as ‘double agents’ (Harreveld, forthcoming), overtly complying with official bureaucracy while covertly ‘using the system’ to get what they can for their marginalised clients. For at least some of these teachers, their work as double agents shades into potential transfonnation [sic], whereby the multiple perspectives of students and systems are fused in a ‘double vision’ (Coombes, Simpson, Danaher & Danaher, 2001). The paper draws on ideas of Foucault (1979), de Certeau (1984) and Bourdieu (1993, 1998), and concludes by reflecting on the role of open and distance teaching in facilitating the move from double agents to double vision...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{discusses the}} pedagogical practice {{of a classroom}} 'community of inquiry' {{as a way of}} providing an exciting, productive and transformative learning experience. The term 'community of inquiry' is used to indicate the key purpose of the community. Following the argument of Dewey (1916) that learners should be active makers of meaning, alongside contemporary constructivist approaches, this presentation considers why and how a community of inquiry supports and scaffolds students as they construct their understandings of subject matter. It argues that through dialogue, critique, validation, and reinterpretation with teachers and other students that members of the community are able to bring meaning to new ideas and evaluate their worth in relation to ideas they would supplant. The elements that underpin a community of inquiry are explored including safety, support, respect, and sharing as tools for facilitating transformation of perspectives. The notion of the community of inquiry as a tool for inclusion and engagement of <b>non-traditional</b> <b>learners</b> is also discussed. Finally, the role of the teacher/expert is considered in light of the issues of power and ensuring student-centered learning...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} demand amongst {{potential}} higher education (HE) <b>learners</b> from the <b>non‐traditional</b> group for flexible degree level provision, key factors influencing {{their decision to}} pursue a degree and existing degree provision. The research entailed {{a combination of a}} questionnaire survey, focus group discussions and interviews with the relevant stakeholders in Fife, Scotland. There is evidence for the existence of a demand for local degree provision in Fife: 22 % would certainly want to pursue a degree locally and another 31 % who originally did not intend to pursue a degree would reconsider it if there were suitable local provision. An increasing demand for degree provision in Fife is also evident and requires addressing. Although there are now three models of college/HE partnerships available within the area, the types of partnerships which can cater more for the need of <b>non‐traditional</b> <b>learners</b> are still very limited. It is also argued that flexible and local learning provision is merely a starting point and that practical and academic support to ensure successful completion of learners' studies is even more crucial...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} the impact of differentiated instructional techniques on non-traditional, adult student engagement in an RN-BSN completion program course. Differentiated instructional techniques have been a staple method of teaching in K- 12 education for a number of years. Differentiated instruction (DI) is a means of teaching students by considering learning preferences and by offering options for meeting course requirements. <b>Non-traditional,</b> adult <b>learners</b> have varied life experiences as well as learning needs. This study addressed how and why engagement of the adult learner in a nursing course was affected by using common differentiated instructional techniques such as model-building, tiered assignment, and literature circles. The study was conducted using case study method. A purposeful sample of <b>non-traditional,</b> adult <b>learners</b> enrolled in an RN-BSN health promotion nursing course was taken. Data were collected via participant observation and field notes, faculty interview, participant journals, open-ended questionnaires, researcher notes, and focus group transcript. Tiered assignments (blog and family assessment) and literature circle postings were also reviewed. Thematic content analysis (TCA) was employed for data analysis. Five major themes emerged from the data: valuing the student, framing, learning environment, non-traditional teaching techniques, and behaviors of engagement. Each major theme was composed of several subthemes. Subthemes associated with valuing the student included personhood, voice of the student, self awareness, choice, and skills related to Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences. The second theme of framing was connected with the subthemes of making meaning and context. The third theme of learning environment entailed subthemes of safety, freedom, structure, and forced engagement. The fourth theme of non-traditional teaching techniques included “Out-of-the-box” thinking, control over learning, and self-directed learning. The final theme of behaviors of engagement was comprised of subthemes of enjoyment, ownership, accountability, motivation, and creativity. Findings of the study indicated that each of the differentiated instructional techniques had a positive impact on student engagement. The subthemes served to identify specific aspects of the DI techniques that were found to be most beneficial for the <b>non-traditional,</b> adult <b>learner.</b> Department of Educational StudiesThesis (D.
