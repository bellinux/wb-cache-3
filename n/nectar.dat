5|$|Juveniles of some spiders in the {{families}} Anyphaenidae, Corinnidae, Clubionidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae feed on plant <b>nectar.</b> Laboratory {{studies show that}} they do so deliberately and over extended periods, and periodically clean themselves while feeding. These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water, which indicates that they are seeking nutrients. Since many spiders are nocturnal, the extent of <b>nectar</b> consumption by spiders may have been underestimated. <b>Nectar</b> contains amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals in addition to sugars, and {{studies have shown that}} other spider species live longer when <b>nectar</b> is available. Feeding on <b>nectar</b> avoids the risks of struggles with prey, and the costs of producing venom and digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take <b>nectar,</b> either by sucking free <b>nectar</b> {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, <b>nectar</b> may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, vitamins and minerals normally found in <b>nectar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although a honeyeater in origin, {{the striped}} honeyeater's food source is {{primarily}} insects, and its diet includes seeds and fruits {{as well as}} <b>nectar.</b> Its bill has evolved to a short, straight, sharply pointed shape more suited to probing crevices for insects, than to probing flower tubes. It has the honeyeater’s brush tongue and takes <b>nectar</b> from shallow flowers such as eucalypt blossoms.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to use the isotope {{analysis}} method to quantify the carbon of C 3 photosynthetic cycle in commercial apple <b>nectars</b> and to determine the legal limit to identify the beverages that do not conform to the safety standards established by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. These beverages (apple <b>nectars)</b> were produced in the laboratory according to the Brazilian legislation.

The &# 948; 13 C values of the apple <b>nectars</b> and their fractions (pulp and purified sugar) were measured to quantify the C 3 source percentage. In order to demonstrate the existence of adulteration, the values found were compared to the limit values established by the Brazilian Law.

40|$|Abstract Flower-visiting bats {{encounter}} <b>nectars</b> {{that vary}} in both sugar composition and concentration. Because {{in the new}} world, the <b>nectars</b> of bat-pollinated flowers tend {{to be dominated by}} hexoses, we predicted that at equicaloric concentrations, bats would ingest higher volumes of hex-oses than sucrose-containing <b>nectars.</b> We investigated the intake response of three species of Neotropical bats, Lep-tonycteris curasoae, Glossophaga soricina and Artibeus jamaicensis, to sugar solutions of varying concentration...|$|R
5|$|Inflorescences (clusters of flowers) of {{at least}} 60plant {{families}} are eaten by lemurs {{ranging in size from}} the tiny mouse lemurs to the relatively large ruffed lemurs. If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the <b>nectar</b> is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for <b>nectar</b> or pollen consumption.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on <b>nectar,</b> using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather <b>nectar</b> {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen to feed their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers to feed from. Some bumblebees rob <b>nectar,</b> making a hole near the base of a flower to access the <b>nectar</b> while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects, other arthropods, small {{birds and}} reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, <b>nectar</b> and {{miscellaneous}} vegetation. A 1984 {{study of the}} Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more detailed study of another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% <b>nectar,</b> 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common dietary item was <b>nectar</b> from flowers of the Bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.|$|E

5|$|The {{sunbirds}} and spiderhunters {{are very}} small passerine birds which feed largely on <b>nectar,</b> although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take <b>nectar</b> by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, <b>nectar</b> may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging <b>nectar</b> relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the <b>nectar</b> duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E
5|$|To develop, {{the larvae}} must be fed both <b>nectar</b> for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed <b>nectar</b> to the larvae by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate <b>nectar.</b> Larvae are fed pollen {{in one of two}} ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen {{at the base of the}} brood-cell clump from which the larvae feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the larvae.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mining trees is {{very useful}} in domains like bioinformatics, web mining, mining semi-structured data, and so on. These efforts largely {{assumed that the}} trees are static. However, in many real applications, tree data are {{evolutionary}} in nature. In this paper, we focus on mining evolution patterns from historical tree-structured data. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to discover negatively correlated subtree patterns (<b>NECTARs)</b> from a sequence of historical versions of unordered trees. The objective is to extract subtrees that are negatively correlated in undergoing structural changes. We propose an algorithm called NECTAR-Miner based {{on a set of}} evolution metrics to extract <b>NECTARs.</b> <b>NECTARs</b> can be useful in several applications such as maintaining mirrors of a website, maintaining XML path selectivity estimation, web advertisement placement strategy, and semantic XML search engine. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm has good performance and can discover <b>NECTARs</b> accurately. ...|$|R

In New England National Park, red wattlebirds would be more aggressive if there were moderate amounts of <b>nectar</b> in groves of flowering banksias but less so at lean or abundant times.|$|E

5|$|Durian {{flowers are}} large and {{feathery}} with copious <b>nectar,</b> and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat <b>nectar</b> and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E

5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} <b>nectar.</b> As they probe for <b>nectar,</b> honeyeaters end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E
