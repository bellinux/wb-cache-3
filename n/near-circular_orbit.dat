The new model gives revised parameters for the previously known planets, with lower eccentricity orbits {{than in the previous}} model and including a more robust characterization of the orbit of Mu Arae e.

25|$|Most cubewanos {{are found}} between the 2:3 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune (populated by plutinos) and the 1:2 resonance. 50000 Quaoar, for example, has a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> close to the ecliptic. Plutinos, on the other hand, have more eccentric orbits bringing some of them closer to the Sun than Neptune.|$|E
25|$|At 43 AU and a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit,</b> Quaoar is not {{significantly}} perturbed by Neptune, unlike Pluto, {{which is in}} 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. The ecliptic view illustrates the relative inclinations of the orbits of Quaoar and Pluto. Note that Pluto's aphelion is beyond (and below) Quaoar's orbit, so that Pluto {{is closer to the}} Sun than Quaoar at some times of its orbit, and farther at others.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of objects (the so-called 'cold population'), have low inclinations and <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits.</b> A smaller population (the 'hot population') is characterised by highly inclined, more eccentric orbits.|$|R
40|$|Modified {{program has}} been {{developed}} using improved variation of Encke method which avoids accumulation of round-off errors and avoids numerical ambiguities arising from <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> of low inclination.

5000|$|Of {{the many}} exoplanets discovered, most exoplanets {{have a higher}} orbital {{eccentricity}} than our solar system. Exoplanets found with low orbital eccentricity, near circular orbits, {{are very close to}} its star and are tidally locked to the star. All eight planets in the Solar System have <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits.</b> The exoplanets discovered show that the solar system, with its unusually low eccentricity, is rare and unique. One theory attributes this low eccentricity to the high number of planets in the Solar System; another suggests it arose because of its unique asteroid belts. A few other multiplanetary systems have been found, but none resemble the Solar System. The Solar System has unique planetesimal systems, which led the planets to have <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits.</b> Solar planetesimal systems include the asteroid belt, Hilda family, Kuiper belt, Hills cloud, and the Oort cloud. The exoplanet systems discovered have either no planetesimal systems or one very large planetesimal system. Low eccentricity is needed for habitability, especially advanced life. High multiplicity planet systems {{are much more likely to}} have habitable exoplanets. [...] The grand tack hypothesis of the Solar System also helps understand its <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> and other unique features.|$|R
500|$|The {{two stars}} are {{reported}} to have a 3.5 visual magnitude difference, although the difference is much smaller at infrared wavelengths. This is unexpected and may indicate further unseen companions. The mass of the stars can be determined from the orbital motion, but uncertainties in the orbit have led to widely varying results. In 1975, an eccentric 388 year orbit gave masses of [...] and [...] A smaller <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> published in 2015 had a 300-year orbit and gave masses of [...] and [...] respectively for GJ 195 A and B.|$|E
500|$|Although Herschel {{continued}} {{to describe his}} new object as a comet, other astronomers {{had already begun to}} suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object. Its nearly circular orbit led him to a conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as [...] "a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn". Bode concluded that its <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> was more like a planet than a comet.|$|E

25|$|The 'hot' and 'cold' {{populations are}} strikingly different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are in low inclination, <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits.</b> The {{parameters}} of the plutinos’ orbits are more evenly distributed, with a local maximum in moderate eccentricities in 0.15–0.2 range and low inclinations 5–10°.|$|R
25|$|The {{confirmed}} {{planets are}} believed to be located close to the star with <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits.</b> In order of distance from the star, these are Gliese 581e, Gliese 581b, and Gliese 581c.

5000|$|Varuna is {{classified}} as a classical trans-Neptunian object and follows a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> with a semi-major axis of ≈43 AU, {{similar to that of}} [...] but more inclined. Its orbital period is similar to Quaoar at 283 years. The graph shows the polar view (top; Varuna’s orbit in blue, ’s in red, Neptune in grey). The spheres illustrate the current (April 2006) positions, relative sizes and colours. The perihelia (q), aphelia (Q) and the dates of passage are also marked. Interestingly, the orbits of Varuna and Pluto have similar inclination and are similarly oriented (the nodes of both orbits are quite close). At 43 AU and on a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit,</b> unlike Pluto, which is in 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune, Varuna is free from any significant perturbation from Neptune. The ecliptic view illustrates the comparison of Varuna's <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> with that of Pluto (highly eccentric, e = 0.25), both similarly inclined.|$|E
50|$|Most cubewanos {{are found}} between the 2:3 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune (populated by plutinos) and the 1:2 resonance. 50000 Quaoar, for example, has a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> close to the ecliptic.

50|$|Gliese 581c and d {{are within}} the {{habitable}} zone of the host star, and {{are two of the}} most likely candidates for habitability of any exoplanets discovered so far. Gliese 581g, detected September 2010, has a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> {{in the middle of the}} star's habitable zone. However, the planet's existence is contested.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} objects (cubewanos) {{are very}} different from the scattered objects: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low-inclination, <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> whose eccentricities peak at 0.25. Classical objects possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Though the inclinations of scattered objects are similar to the more extreme KBOs, very few scattered objects have orbits as close to the ecliptic as much of the KBO population.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} a {{rendezvous}} of two spacecrafts on the close <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> is considered. Impulse parameters are determined using necessary conditions of optimality. Basis-vector theory is used. Nondegenerate six-impulse solutions are considered. For the impulse parameters (points of applications and orientations) analytic expressions {{with respect to the}} time of rendezvous are found. Induced five-impulse solutions are found using these expressions. Total V is compared with those of the Lamberts problem. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R
5000|$|Perturbing forces {{caused by}} the {{oblateness}} of the Earth will also change the shape (called the [...] "eccentricity") of the orbit. To compensate, there are <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> {{where there are no}} secular/long periodic perturbations of the eccentricity, only periodic perturbations with the same period as the orbit. Such an orbit is called a [...] "frozen orbit". These orbits are often the preferred choice for Earth observation missions where repeated observations under constant conditions are desirable.|$|R
50|$|The {{satellite}} was three-axis stabilized {{and in a}} <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit.</b> It carried four instruments: a Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), a Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT), a Bragg Crystal Spectrometer (BCS), and a Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS). About 50 MB {{were generated}} each day and stored on board by a 10.5 MB bubble memory recorder.|$|E
5000|$|The polar view {{compares the}} <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> of Quaoar to the highly {{eccentric}} (e=0.25) orbit of [...] (Quaoar’s orbit in blue, Pluto’s in red, Neptune in grey).

50|$|The Einstein Observatory, HEAO-2, was {{launched}} on November 13, 1978, from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on an Atlas-Centaur SLV-3D booster rocket into a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> {{with an initial}} altitude slightly above 500 km. Its orbital inclination orbit was 23.5 degrees. The Einstein Observatory satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and burned up on March 25, 1982.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{expression}} is derived for <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> which relates die difference in instantaneous angular momentum of a satellite as observed at two different times {{from the same}} station to the dissipative perturbing forces which acted on the satellite during that time interval. This {{expression is}} valid for an arbitrarily asymmetric gravity field. Possible applications to the measurement of very short-term atmospheric density variations and to the improvement {{of knowledge about the}} earth's shape and gravity field are described...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike comets, which {{spend most}} of their orbit at Jupiter-like or greater {{distances}} from the Sun, main-belt comets follow <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> within the asteroid belt that are undistinguishable from the orbits of many standard asteroids. Although quite a few short-period comets have semimajor axes well within Jupiter's orbit, main-belt comets differ in having small eccentricities and inclinations similar to main-belt asteroids. The first three identified main-belt comets all orbit within the outer part of the asteroid belt.|$|R
40|$|From a {{comparison}} of the 2 : 1 and 3 : 2 resonances (in the asteroidal belt) two possible explanations to the absence of 3 : 2 apocentric librators are suggested. The first one is that such 3 : 2 resonant motion is dynamically unstable. The second interpretation requires the absence of <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> originally at 4 AU. The latter view, if correct, is inconsistent with cosmogonic models which predict the original orbits of the asteroids to be nearly circular...|$|R
50|$|Rather than {{applying}} (1) and (2) on {{the partial}} derivatives of the orbital elements eccentricity and argument of perigee directly one should apply these {{relations for the}} eccentricity vector. First of all the typical application is a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit.</b> But there are also mathematical advantages working with the partial derivatives {{of the components of}} this vector also for orbits with a significant eccentricity.|$|E
50|$|At 43 AU and a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit,</b> Quaoar is not {{significantly}} perturbed by Neptune, unlike Pluto, {{which is in}} 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. The ecliptic view illustrates the relative inclinations of the orbits of Quaoar and Pluto.

5000|$|For Sun-synchronous spacecraft, {{intentional}} {{shifting of}} the orbit plane (called [...] "precession") {{can be used}} {{for the benefit of the}} mission. For these missions, a <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> with an altitude of 600-900 km is used. An appropriate inclination (97.8-99.0 degrees) is selected so that the precession of the orbital plane is equal to the rate of movement of the Earth around the Sun - or about 1 degree per day.|$|E
5000|$|Extreme-mass-ratio {{systems of}} a stellar-mass compact object {{orbiting}} a supermassive black hole. These are sources for detectors like LISA. Systems with highly eccentric orbits produce {{a burst of}} gravitational radiation as they pass through the point of closest approach; systems with <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits,</b> which are expected {{towards the end of}} the inspiral, emit continuously within LISA's frequency band. Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals can be observed over many orbits. This makes them excellent probes of the background spacetime geometry, allowing for precision tests of general relativity.|$|R
25|$|In 1749, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} the planets were formed when a comet collided with the Sun, sending matter out to form the planets. However, Laplace refuted this idea in 1796, showing that any planets formed in such a way would eventually crash into the Sun.

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{model is}} {{formulated}} {{to simulate the}} orbital evolution {{of a system of}} colliding particles. It is found that inelastic collision alone (even if the impact energy dissipation from collision is very large) does not lead to the formation of a narrow ring-like jet stream; instead, a flat disk structure, similar to Saturn's rings, usually results. To produce the radial focusing effect, it is argued that additional dynamical effects, which would strengthen the collisional interaction between the particles in <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits,</b> is needed...|$|R
50|$|In September 2008, it was {{announced}} that a Jupiter-like planet, now designated as Gliese 832 b, had been detected in a long-period, <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbit</b> around this star (false alarm probability thus far: a negligible 0.05%). It would induce an astrometric perturbation on its star of at least 0.95 milliarcseconds and is thus a good candidate for being detected by astrometric observations. Despite its relatively large angular distance, direct imaging is problematic due to the star-planet contrast.|$|E

40|$|Satellites in low Earth orbits must {{accurately}} conserve their orbital eccentricity, since {{a decrease}} in perigee of only 5 - 10 % would cause them to crash. However, these satellites are subject to gravitational perturbations from the Earth's multipole moments, the Moon, and the Sun that are not spherically symmetric and hence do not conserve angular momentum, especially over {{the tens of thousands}} of orbits made by a typical satellite. Why then do satellites not crash? We describe a vector-based analysis of the long-term behavior of satellite orbits and apply this to several toy systems containing a single non-Keplerian perturbing potential. If only the quadrupole potential from the Earth's equatorial bulge is present, all <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> are stable. If only the octupole potential is present, all such orbits are unstable. If only the lunar or solar potential is present, all <b>near-circular</b> <b>orbits</b> with inclinations to the ecliptic exceeding 39 degrees are unstable. We describe the behavior of satellites in the simultaneous presence of all of these perturbations and show that almost all low Earth orbits are stable because of an accidental property of the dominant quadrupole potential. We also relate these results to the phenomenon of Lidov-Kozai oscillations. Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure; submitted to American Journal of Physic...|$|R
