40|$|Sample {{pre-treatment}} and enrichment {{using the}} supported liquid membrane (SLM) technique for {{the determination of}} phenolic <b>nitrile</b> <b>herbicides</b> in presence of carbamates in river water samples was investigated. The uncharged herbicide molecules from the flowing aqueous solution diffuse through an immobilized water-immiscible organic solvent, supported by a porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane, and trapped in a stagnant acidic acceptor phase in an ionic form. Using n-undecane as a membrane solvent, the SLM extraction methodology was successfully used for the enrichment and separation of phenolic <b>nitrile</b> <b>herbicides</b> in environmental waters with extraction efficiencies of 60 % or better. A RDS (%) of 2. 1 and 1. 8 was obtained for the extraction of ioxynil and bromoxynil from river water, respectively...|$|E
50|$|Bromoxynil is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula HOBr2C6H2CN. It {{is classified as}} a <b>nitrile</b> <b>herbicide,</b> and as such sold under many trade names. It is a white solid. It works by inhibiting photosynthesis. It is moderately toxic to mammals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Rhodobacter sphaeroides {{reaction}} centre is {{a relatively}} robust and tractable membrane protein that has potential for exploitation in technological applications, including biohybrid devices for photovoltaics and biosensing. This report assessed {{the usefulness of the}} photocurrent generated by this reaction centre adhered to a small working electrode as the basis for a biosensor for classes of herbicides used extensively for the control of weeds in major agricultural crops. Photocurrent generation was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the triazides atrazine and terbutryn, but not by <b>nitrile</b> or phenylurea <b>herbicides.</b> Measurements of the effects of these herbicides on the kinetics of charge recombination in photo-oxidised reaction centres in solution showed the same selectivity of response. Titrations of reaction centre photocurrents yielded half maximal inhibitory concentrations of 208 nM and 2. 1 ÂµM for terbutryn and atrazine, respectively, with limits of detection estimated at around 8 nM and 50 nM, respectively. Photocurrent attenuation provided a direct measure of herbicide concentration, with no need for model-dependent kinetic analysis of the signal used for detection or the use of prohibitively complex instrumentation, and prospects for the use of protein engineering to develop the sensitivity and selectivity of herbicide binding by the Rba. sphaeroides reaction centre are discussed...|$|R
