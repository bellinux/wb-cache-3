5|$|Of {{the famous}} Modernist writers who {{spent time in}} Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an {{appearance}} at the salon. James Joyce came once or twice but didn't care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for In Search of Lost Time. His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting finally did happen he was too <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> bring up the subject {{he had come to}} talk about.|$|E
5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> meet her, and I just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the more}} surreal short films in the show, {{containing}} minimal dialogue and apparently set in a dystopian future society. It features a man (McCulloch) {{who works at a}} draconian sausage factory and {{falls in love with a}} woman who works there kissing the boxes so they have the company's lipstick logo. Too <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> talk to her, the man, who had stolen some sausages for his deranged, sausage-obsessed father (Thompson), leaves them on her doorstep anonymously. Knowing he can never lead a normal life while caring for his gibbering idiot father, he resigns himself to loneliness.|$|E
25|$|Crosby had an {{interest}} in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach. From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. Although he was passionate about his team, he was too <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to the game on the radio. Crosby had the NBC telecast of the game recorded on kinescope. The game {{was one of the most}} famous in baseball history, capped off by Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009. The restored broadcast was shown on MLB Network in December 2010.|$|E
25|$|Richter {{parachute}}d into Britain on {{the early}} morning of 12 May 1941, landing near London Colney north of London. Richter quickly hid his parachute and equipment {{and spent the next}} few days and nights hiding in the forest, too <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> travel to London. When Richter eventually came out of hiding, he was approached by a lorry driver who asked Richter for directions. Unable to give directions, Richter aroused the suspicions of the lorry driver who drove a short distance and reported the strange foreigner to a police officer. The police officer found Richter and, after examining his papers and asking him a few questions, decided to take Richter to the local police station. Richter's identity papers, in the name of Fred Snyder, were clearly forged and did not match the expired Czechoslovak passport in his possession (which was in his own name). Richter was sent to Camp 020 where he was interrogated by officers of MI5. Richter was a difficult agent to break and it was only when he was confronted with fellow spy Josef Jakobs that Richter began to crack. Richter revealed the true purpose of his mission, to check up on agent Wulf Schmidt.|$|E

500|$|As an art critic, Uzanne wrote several {{reviews of}} etchings, as in a {{critique}} of French painter and illustrator Félix Buhot: [...] "Buhot is a visionary, one obsessed by the picturesqueness of modern life; <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> excess, tortured by a crowd of fleeting impressions and queer ideas, he suffered from a cruel inability to reproduce them as he wished." [...] Uzanne's written style was characterized {{by the use of}} Anglicisms and eccentric neologisms.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Aaliyah left Jive Records {{and signed}} with Atlantic Records. She worked with record {{producers}} Timbaland and Missy Elliott, {{who contributed to}} her second studio album, One in a Million. Missy Elliott recalled Timbaland and herself being <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> work with Aaliyah, since Aaliyah had already released her successful début album while Missy Elliott and Timbaland were just starting out. Missy Elliott also feared {{she would be a}} diva, but reflected that Aaliyah [...] "came in and was so warming; she made us immediately feel like family." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{physical}} acts can increase parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> supply <b>to</b> the heart, resulting in blocking of electrical conduction through the AV node. This can slow down or stop {{a number of}} arrhythmias that originate above or at the AV node (see main article: supraventricular tachycardias). Parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> supply <b>to</b> the heart is via the vagus nerve, and these maneuvers are collectively known as vagal maneuvers.|$|R
40|$|Activity-dependent, {{developmental}} {{synaptic plasticity}} permits, in part, an animal’s <b>nervous</b> system <b>to</b> be constructed {{in a way}} that depends on both the animal’s experiences and its body’s particular morphology. The continuing expression of this plasticity into later life allows constant adaptation of the animal’s <b>nervous</b> system <b>to</b> changes in the animal’s body as it grows and ages, also allowing some recovery from major injury. We instantiate a previously studied model of such neuronal development on a robotic platform to establish whether "developmental robotics" can equip a robot with a <b>nervous</b> system tuned <b>to</b> the robot’s individual morphology and that allows recovery from damage...|$|R

500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{spoken by}} the giant mutant Stan {{was inspired by}} a mentally handicapped character in the MTV show How's Your News?, which Parker and Stone produced; according to Parker and Stone, the character could only say phrases like [...] "Bubba chop, bubba chewy chomp", and both men took turns voicing mutant Stan to sound the same way. Isaac Hayes, who does the voice of Chef, recorded all his lines via phone from New York; Parker and Stone said they were <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> ask him to repeat the line, [...] "Now I know how all those white women felt", but he had no problem repeating it. The genetic mutations Dr. Mephesto creates, including the animals with multiple asses and the goldfish with bunny ears, were inspired by things Parker drew during high school.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} night, Jerry, Elaine, and George {{have dinner}} with Elaine's father, writer Alton Benes. While preparing for the dinner, George arrives at Jerry's apartment with the song [...] "Master of the House" [...] from the musical Les Misérables stuck in his head. George and Jerry are both very <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> meet Alton because {{he is such a}} famous author. When they are about to leave, Jerry puts on his new jacket. George is very impressed and attempts to get Jerry to reveal its cost. Kramer enters the apartment and asks for two minutes' help guarding his illegally parked car as he carries down some doves that he is looking after for a magician friend. However, they refuse to help because he often underestimates how long things take to do.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{from the}} first, Yiddish theater drew {{a level of}} theater {{criticism}} comparable to any other European theater of its time. For example, Bercovici cites a [...] "brochure" [...] by one G. Abramski, published in 1877, that described and gave critiques of all of Goldfaden's plays of that year. Abramski speculated that the present day might be for Yiddish theater a moment comparable to the Elizabethan era for English theater. He discussed what a Yiddish theater ought to be, noted its many sources (ranging from Purim plays to circus pantomime), and praised its incorporation of strong female roles. He also criticized where he saw weaknesses, noting how unconvincingly a male actor played the mother in Shmendrik, or remarking of the play Di shtume kale (The Mute Bride) — a work that Goldfaden apparently wrote to accommodate a pretty, young actress who in the performance was too <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> deliver her lines — that the only evidence of Goldfaden's authorship was his name.|$|E

500|$|Britten, {{though a}} {{reluctant}} conductor and a nervous pianist, was greatly sought after in both capacities. The piano accompanist Gerald Moore {{wrote in his}} memoirs about playing at all the main music festivals except for Aldeburgh, because [...] "as the presiding genius there is the greatest accompanist in the world, my services are not needed". Britten's recital partnership with Pears was his best-known collaboration, but he also accompanied Kathleen Ferrier, Rostropovich, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, James Bowman and John Shirley-Quirk, among others. Though usually too <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> play piano solos, Britten often performed piano duets with Clifford Curzon or Richter, and chamber music with the Amadeus Quartet. The composers whose works, other than his own, he most often played were Mozart and Schubert; the latter, in Murray Perahia's view, was Britten's greatest idol. As a boy and young man, Britten had intensely admired Brahms, but his admiration waned to nothing, and Brahms seldom featured in his repertory.|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of composing [...] "Fifteen", Swift became very <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> show Anderson the song, for {{she did not know}} how her friend would respond. [...] "It was a really personal song, especially from her angle of it." [...] However, when Swift performed the song for Anderson and asked whether she was comfortable with the song, Anderson confirmed: [...] "She said, 'Does it bother you that your name is in a song that's so personal?' And it really doesn't just because of the way Taylor and I feel about it. If one girl can kind of learn from it or connect to a song like that, it's totally worth it." [...] With Anderson's consent, Swift recorded [...] "Fifteen" [...] with producer Nathan Chapman, who produced all but one track on Swift's 2006 eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift. Recording the highly personal track caused Swift to cry. Swift attributed the event to {{the fact that she is}} most likely to cry over when her loved ones undergo pain, as she witnesses it, rather than her own experiences. She went to say [...] "Fifteen" [...] usually gets her every time.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded by Roberts and Tikovoi. However, the pair struggled to finish its production, with Roberts describing {{the process as}} something that [...] "just wouldn't work". The incompletion of the song led to stress and illness for Roberts, and she decided to contact producer Diplo {{to work on the}} record. Discussing her choice in an interview for The Guardian, Roberts said that she only had one chance to get him to work with her and asked for his assistance. After Diplo reassured the singer that he would help, Roberts revealed that the situation was no longer in her hands and that she would wait for him to contact her with some progress. Despite her worries, she felt that [...] "he just got it straight away". Communications were limited between the pair, but when Roberts received Diplo's finished production, she was too <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> listen to it immediately. Instead, she burnt the track to a CD, and drove to a deserted field with her younger brother and sister, where she played the song loudly. After positive responses from her siblings, Roberts declared Diplo a [...] "genius".|$|E

500|$|They {{passed a}} week that saw no action in Cambridge and Bury St Edmunds, hearing on 20 July that the Council in London had {{declared}} for Mary. Staying at Cambridge, Northumberland himself proclaimed Mary Tudor as queen at the market place. Warwick was {{with him as he}} threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The city that had welcomed the Duke splendidly was <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> please the new queen. A large group of townsmen and university scholars surrounded King's College to arrest the Duke, who was with his son lodged on the premises. In contrast to his father, Warwick resisted arrest. A letter from the Council arrived that everyman could go his way, so the Duke asked to be set free, [...] "and so continued they all night [...] ". At dawn the Earl of Warwick [...] "was booted ready to have ridden in the morning", and escape. It was too late, however, as the Earl of Arundel arrived to again arrest the Duke and his entourage. The prisoners returned riding side by side through London, the guards having difficulties protecting them against the hostile populace.|$|E
500|$|Leslie sees Jeanine Restrepo (Loretta Fox), an {{influential}} zoning board member {{who could help}} Leslie with her plans to turn the Sullivan Street pit into a park. Leslie is too <b>nervous</b> <b>to</b> approach her, so she practices with Mark (Paul Schneider), who teasingly pinches her nose because he says as Jeanine, [...] "I can do whatever I want"; Ann pinches Mark's nose and Leslie pinches Ann's, and Mark summarizes, [...] "It's fun {{to pretend to be}} zoning board members." [...] Marlene suggests Leslie try sucking up to Jeanine in her speech, but it comes across awkwardly when Leslie claims to [...] "love" [...] Jeanine. When Leslie tries to approach her later, Jeanine suggests Leslie make an appointment with her secretary. Marlene says this means Jeanine is blowing them off, and tells Leslie to blackmail Jeanine with the knowledge that her husband has a DUI offense in Illinois. Leslie shares the advice with Ann, who says she believes it is unethical and wrong; offended, Leslie accuses Ann of pampering Andy. ("He's got three crutches, {{and one of them is}} you. And the other two are crutches.") Ann storms off.|$|E
500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan.

I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: [...] "Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." [...] " [...] On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished [...] "My Name Is" [...] in an hour. [...] Three other songs, including [...] "Role Model", were also recorded that day.|$|E
