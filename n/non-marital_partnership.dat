40|$|Not {{the final}} {{published}} versionOBJECTIVE: To examine the factors {{responsible for the}} disparity in HIV prevalence between {{young men and women}} in two urban populations in Africa with high HIV prevalence. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey, aiming to include 1000 men and 1000 women aged 15 - 49 years in Kisumu, Kenya and Ndola, Zambia. METHODS: Participants were interviewed and tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Analyses compared the marital and <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnership</b> patterns in young men and women, and estimated the likelihood of having an HIV-infected partner. RESULTS: Overall, 26 % of individuals in Kisumu and 28 % in Ndola were HIV-positive. In both sites, HIV prevalence in women was six times that in men among sexually active 1 5 - 19 year olds, three times that in men among 20 - 24 year olds, and equal to that in men among 25 - 49 year olds. Age at sexual debut was similar in men and women, and men had more partners than women. Women married younger than men and marriage was a risk factor for HIV, but the disparity in HIV prevalence was present in both married and unmarried individuals. Women often had older partners, and men rarely had partners much older than themselves. Nevertheless, the estimated prevalence of HIV in the partners of unmarried men aged under 20 was as high as that for unmarried women. HIV prevalence was very high even among women reporting one lifetime partner and few episodes of sexual intercourse. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioural factors could not fully explain the discrepancy in HIV prevalence between men and women. Despite the tendency for women to have older partners, young men were at least as likely to encounter an HIV-infected partner as young women. It is likely that the greater susceptibility of women to HIV infection is an important factor both in explaining the male-female discrepancy in HIV prevalence and in driving the epidemic. Herpes simplex virus type 2 infection, which is more prevalent in young women than in young men, {{is probably one of the}} factors that increases women's susceptibility to HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|Background Sexual {{behaviour}} {{surveys are}} widely used, but under-reporting of particular risk behaviours is common, especially by women. Surveys in whole populations provide an unusual opportunity {{to understand the}} extent and nature of such under-reporting. Methods All consenting individuals aged between 15 and 59 within a demographic surveillance site in northern Malawi were interviewed about their sexual behaviour. Validity of responses was assessed by analysis of probing questions; by comparison of results with in-depth interviews and with Herpes simplex type- 2 (HSV- 2) seropositivity; by comparing reports to same sex and opposite sex interviewers; and by quantifying the partnerships within the local community reported by men and by women, adjusted for response rates. Results 6, 796 women and 5, 253 men (83 % and 72 % of those eligible) consented and took part in sexual behaviour interviews. Probing questions and HSV- 2 antibody tests in those who denied sexual activity identified under-reporting {{for both men and}} women. Reports varied little by sex or age of the interviewer. The number of marital partnerships reported was comparable for men and women, but men reported about 4 times as many <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnerships.</b> The discrepancy in reporting of <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnerships</b> was most marked for married women (men reported about 7 times as many <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnerships</b> with married women as were reported by married women themselves), but was only apparent in younger married women. Conclusions We have shown that the under-reporting of <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnerships</b> by women was strongly age-dependent. The extent of under-reporting of sexual activity by young men was surprisingly high. The results emphasise the importance of triangulation, including biomarkers, and the advantages of considering a whole population...|$|R
50|$|While {{various forms}} of {{long-term}} sexual relationships and co-habitation short of marriage have become increasingly common in the Western world, these are generally not described as concubinage. The terms concubinage and concubine are used today primarily when referring to <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnerships</b> of earlier eras. In modern usage, a non-marital domestic relationship is {{commonly referred to as}} co-habitation (or similar terms), and the woman in such a relationship is generally referred to as a girlfriend, lover or (life) partner.|$|R

40|$|In {{population-based}} surveys {{on sexual}} behaviour, men consistently report higher numbers {{of sexual partners}} than women, which {{may be associated with}} male exaggeration or female under-reporting or with issues related to sampling, such as exclusion of female sex workers. This paper presents an analysis of data collected {{in the context of a}} longitudinal study in rural Tanzania, where a sexual partnership module was applied to all participating men and women in the study population. Since the study design included all men and women of reproductive ages and did not involve sampling, these data provide a unique opportunity to compare the consistency of aggregate measures of sexual behaviour between men and women living in the same villages. The analysis shows that <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnerships</b> were common amongst single people of both sexes [...] around 70 % of unmarried men and women report at least one sexual partner in the last year. However, 40 % of married men also report having non-marital partners, but only 3 % of married women did so. Single women reported about half as many multiple partnerships in the last year as men. Under-reporting of <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnerships</b> was much more common among single women than among married women and men. Furthermore, women were more likely to report longer duration partnerships and partnership with urban men or more educated men than with others. If a woman reports multiple partners, biological data indicate that she is at high risk of contracting HIV. For men, however, there is only a weak association between number of partnerships and the risk of HIV, and it cannot be excluded that men, especially single men, exaggerate the number of sexual partners.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{describe}} {{sexual partner}} change and condom {{use at the}} intake of a cohort study of urban factory workers in Tanzania. METHODS [...] From October 1991 to March 1992, 926 male and 170 female factory workers were interviewed using a structured, pre-coded questionnaire. Questionnaire reliability was assessed by pre-testing and comparison with results of unstructured interviews and carrying out repeat questionnaires on a sub-sample. RESULTS [...] Almost half of {{both men and women}} had had sexual intercourse by their 17 th birthday. The period of premarital sex had an interquartile range of 2 to 10 years in men and 0 to 2. 5 years in women. Having had sexual intercourse in the past month with more than one partner was reported by 22 % of the men and 5 % of the women. Factors associated with multiple partners in men were being born in or near Mwanza Region, having low education and low income, and being married. Condoms had been used in the past month by 3 % only, mainly with casual partners. Condom use in men was associated with being young, living in town, being born in Kagera Region, high education and high income, being circumcised, and having causal or steady (non- martial) partners. CONCLUSION [...] Information, education and communication (IEC) on sexual relationships and condom use should start at an early age, and include education at primary schools. Much sexual partner change appears to occur through steady (<b>non-marital)</b> <b>partnerships,</b> indicating the need for IEC to be expanded beyond groups such as commercial sex workers and their clients...|$|R
40|$|The three essays {{presented}} in this dissertation explore the importance of household composition for child well-being using data from a demographic surveillance site in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The first essay uses indicators of children 2 Ì† 7 s health at birth {{to determine whether the}} survival of the maternal grandmother and her presence in the household is associated with better perinatal outcomes. I find that a child whose maternal grandmother is alive throughout the gestation period is slightly larger at birth, but only if the grandmother is not resident. However, the mother 2 Ì† 7 s partnership status, another element of household composition, is strongly associated with birth weight. The second essay further explores how the marital and non-marital relationships of the parents might affect a child 2 Ì† 7 s chances of surviving through infancy and the first 7 years of life. I find that parental partnerships, including but not limited to marriage, are very important for child survival. Children of married mothers had half the hazard of dying faced by the children of unpartnered mothers. Furthermore, among children whose mothers were unmarried, those whose mothers were involved in regular <b>non-marital</b> <b>partnerships</b> had higher survival chances. In terms of cause-specific mortality, the children of married women were much less likely to die of any cause, including AIDS, than the children of unmarried mothers. The third essay turns to the importance of living arrangements for children 2 Ì† 7 s education, an indicator of child health and household investment in the child. I find that children who were members of the same household as their parents completed more schooling than children whose parents were absent or deceased. If the parent is {{not a member of the}} household, it makes little difference whether he or she is deceased or absent. Grandparents and other older adults in the household do not appear to improve education outcomes, nor mitigate the loss of a parent. Furthermore, other child household members are associated with slower educational progress of school-aged children. The three essays highlight the strong associations between parental relationships, children 2 Ì† 7 s access to mothers and fathers, and child well-being. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{cohabitation}} among unmarried couples {{becomes more}} common in the United States, a most pressing challenge facing inheritance law scholars, practitioners and others who concern themselves with the development of inheritance law is to craft reforms that would, if implemented, better serve non-marital families {{while at the same time}} maintain a reasonable ease of administration of estates. One area in urgent need of such reform is intestacy law. Current intestacy law generally does not reflect as well as it could the way Americans today structure their family lives. For example, the intestacy statutes of forty-seven states make no provision for the survivor of a <b>non-marital</b> committed <b>partnership.</b> This article proposes to change that. Professor Spitko has structured an intestacy statute that looks beyond the attributed intent of the decedent in order to protect those surviving committed partners who contributed significantly to the decedent 2 Ì† 7 s wealth or physical well-being or who sacrificed career opportunities for the good of the partnership. To implement these reciprocity and reliance values, Professor Spitko identifies twenty-three factors (the 2 Ì† 2 multi-factor 2 Ì† 2 test) that a court should use to qualify a committed partner for the purposes of the intestacy statute. His proposal also sets forth an accrual schedule that determines the size of the surviving committed partner 2 Ì† 7 s intestate share based on the duration of the partnership. Professor Spitko further proposes to give an intestate share to the survivor of a committed partnership that fractured prior to the decedent 2 Ì† 7 s death if, under the circumstances, the survivor 2 Ì† 7 s reciprocity or reliance interests should be vindicated. And he proposes to alter the rules for standing to challenge a committed partner 2 Ì† 7 s will in order to minimize the uncertainty that the proposal necessarily would introduce into the probate process...|$|R
