2500|$|Tempera and {{her sister}} ship are the first tankers {{propelled}} by ABB Azipod electric azimuth thrusters capable of rotating 360 degrees around the vertical axis. The pulling-type VI2500 pods in these two ships, with a <b>nominal</b> <b>output</b> of 16 MW and [...] fixed-pitch propellers turning at 86 rpm, are the most powerful ice-strengthened Azipod units ABB has ever produced. The forward-facing propeller increases the propulsion efficiency due to optimal water flow to the propeller and thus improves fuel efficiency. In addition an azimuthing thruster's ability to direct thrust to any direction also results in excellent manoeuvrability characteristics that exceeds those of ships utilizing traditional mechanical shaftlines and rudders. The turning circle of Mastera and Tempera is only half a kilometer at full speed, half of that of a traditional oil tanker of the same size. This is a significant safety factor as the stopping distance of a traditional tanker can be up to [...]|$|E

40|$|Asymmetries {{in price}} {{adjustment}} can reconcile contrasts between rapid price movements in inflationary episodes, consistent with classical theories of flexible pricing, and sluggish price responses in contractions, consistent with Keynesian theories of sticky price adjustments. Both classical and Keynesian characterisations may be describing price behaviour in {{different stages of}} business cycles if producers respond asymmetrically to positive and negative deviations from trends. The case for asymmetric pricing is examined in four stages: A search for asymmetries in the outputs of SIC two-digit industries finds that negative asymmetries in trend deviations are more pronounced in real <b>outputs</b> than in <b>nominal</b> <b>outputs.</b> This suggests and offsetting positive asymmetry in industry prices where below-trend prices are more readily raised than above-trend prices are lowered. ...|$|R
