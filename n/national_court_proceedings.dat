40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the implications of}} the European Commission, as primary administrative enforcer of competition law in the Union, using its own ‘preliminary reference procedure’, through observations in <b>national</b> <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> under Council Regulation 1 / 2003, to minimise the risks of divergent application of EU anti-trust rules under the decentralised system of enforcement ushered in by that Regulation. It sets the scene with the relationship between the European Commission and national courts in competition law, before describing the relevant provisions of the Regulation and its accompanying Courts Notice. It then discusses the legal nature of the Commission opinion as a Union instrument. Identifying cases where the Commission has offered observations, it assesses the implications of administrative intervention in judicial decision making. It finds that greater transparency is crucial for legitimacy, legal certainty and maximum impact on consistent application...|$|E
30|$|Sweden {{joined the}} EU in 1995, {{and after the}} EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, Sweden (alongside Ireland and the UK) decided to open-up the labour market to new EU {{citizens}} entirely and abstain from any transitional arrangements. Very soon after this opening of the labour market, a conflict arose that still characterises discussions about the Sweden-EU relationship. A company hired Latvian workers to construct a school in the municipality of Vaxholm, without collective agreement. After <b>national</b> <b>court</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) finally ruled that the blockade represented a restriction on freedom to provide services under Article 49 EC. The series of events, known as ‘the Vaxholm case’ or simply ‘Laval’, has become a strong national narrative, {{and serves as a}} metaphor of how the ‘Swedish model’, founded on independent negotiations between labour and business, is challenged by the free movement of labour. The work conditions of low-skilled, manual labour in general and of posted workers specifically, have since been a constant factor in the political debate.|$|E
40|$|The EU {{competition}} law reforms of 2004 decentralised enforcement from the European Commission to national competition authorities and national courts, while the European Commission remains {{central to the}} system. This thesis responds to a need for research into how institutions interact in this system of concurrent competences to effectively enforce the EU competition rules. It explores the constitutional consequences of the methods for ensuring coherent interpretation and effective application of the EU competition rules, through case studies on the interaction between courts and administrative authorities and between the supranational and national levels. With {{a focus on the}} role of courts, the thesis draws on the EU principle of institutional balance and the concept of interpretative pluralism. It finds that while apparently empowering (national) courts, the post‐ 2004 regime still limits the ambit of judicial competence in favour of administrative bodies. The European Commission can influence interpretation of the competition rules in <b>national</b> <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{as well as in the}} European Competition Network of competition authorities, in which the Court of Justice of the European Union has in effect handed over responsibility. In an extension of national courts’ obligation not to rule counter to a European Commission decision, forthcoming legislation proposes they should be bound by national competition authority decisions. The thesis argues that there should be more emphasis on horizontal relationships between courts, led by judges themselves. This would not only lend itself to coherent – and effective – application of {{competition law}}, but would allow courts to push back against the apparent dominance of administrative authorities in this area...|$|E

40|$|The {{exclusion}} of arbitration from {{the scope of}} application of the Brussels Regime on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters in the EU {{has a long history}} and is still subject to controversy. After some introductory explanations of the legal framework and relevant principles in the field of law, this minor dissertation examines chronologically all possible involvements of <b>national</b> <b>courts</b> in arbitral <b>proceedings</b> in order to give an overview of the (in-) applicability of the Brussels Ia Regulation to them. For this purpose, the relevant case law of the CJEU and the related legal developments beginning with the adoption of the Brussels Convention up to the entry into force of the Brussels Ia Regulation are being considered. Finally, the legal problems arising from the current state of affairs and how courts should navigate it are discussed with an emphasis on the possible enforcement constellations of contradicting judgments and awards...|$|R

40|$|For the European Union of the 21 st century, {{the search}} for {{sustainable}} prosperity and stability includes the challenge of reconciling democratic ideals and practices {{with the construction of}} a European constitutional order. From the 2001 Laeken Summit to the 2009 Lisbon Treaty and beyond EU leaders have repeatedly set out to bring citizens closer to EU governance by making it more democratic and effective yet several national ratification referendums have shown that publics are divided about whether and why to endorse or veto complex EU reform packages imposed from the top down. Despite these limitations people do effectively engage in the making of a European polity. By initiating <b>national</b> <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> active citizens are promoting fundamental European rights in Member States' practices. As party members they contribute to shaping mass media communication about, and national publics' understanding of, European political alternatives. As civil society activists citizens help build social networks for contesting certain EU reforms or advocating others. Last but not least, as voters in national and European elections they choose between competing party visions, and national parliamentary stances regarding the role of democratic citizenship. This original contribution to the debate about democratic citizenship vis-à-vis the challenges of economic globalization and European political integration presents critical explorations of different fields of direct, representative, participatory and deliberative democratic citizenship practices that affect the transformation of Europe.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{administration}} of justice by courts is being discussed in many countries. The lengthy duration of <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> in particular {{is considered to be}} a problem in the Netherlands. This article presents the results of a large-scale research project into the opinions of litigant parties concerning the duration of administrative <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the Netherlands. Research was also carried out into the influence on the duration of <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> as a result of both the conduct of litigant parties and the characteristics of district courts. There are a number of factors, in particular the presence of significant backlogs of unfinished cases at the district court that have been proven to be responsible for delaying <b>court</b> <b>proceedings.</b> This provides a starting point for the formulation of several recommendations to speed up <b>court</b> <b>proceedings.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
