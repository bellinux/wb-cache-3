5|$|On 1 July 1958, {{responding}} to Eisenhower's call, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> convened the Conference of Experts in Geneva, aimed at studying means of detecting nuclear tests. The conference included {{scientists from the}} US, Britain, the Soviet Union, Canada, Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, and Romania. The US delegation was led by James Fisk, a member of PSAC, the Soviets by Evgenii Fedorov, and the British delegation by William Penney, who had led the British delegation to the Manhattan Project. Whereas the US approached the conference solely from a technical perspective, Penney was specifically instructed by Macmillan to attempt to achieve a political agreement. This difference in approach {{was reflected in the}} broader composition of the US and UK teams. US experts were primarily drawn from academia and industry. Fisk was a vice president at Bell Telephone Laboratories and was joined by Robert Bacher and Ernest Lawrence, both physicists who had worked on the Manhattan Project. Conversely, British delegates largely held government positions. The Soviet delegation was composed primarily of academics, though virtually all of them had some link to the Soviet government. The Soviets shared the British goal of achieving an agreement at the conference.|$|E
5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers.</b> At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E

25|$|Today, some 26,000 {{nuclear weapons}} {{remain in the}} arsenals of the nine <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers,</b> with {{thousands}} on hair-trigger alert. Although U.S., Russian, and British nuclear arsenals are shrinking in size, those in the four Asian nuclear nations—China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea—are growing, {{in large part because}} of tensions among them. This Asian arms race also has possibilities of bringing Japan into the nuclear club.|$|E

25|$|The {{bilateral}} {{interaction was}} possible because, in many respects, Brazil and Argentina {{shared a common}} understanding of the global non-proliferation regime as a top-down imposition of the major <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> {{at the expense of}} weaker nations. In fact, starting in the early 1960s the two delegations to the IAEA had a tacit agreement, through which they would take turns in the seat assigned to the Latin American country with the most advanced nuclear program.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the final}} {{orders of the}} Prime Minister are {{at his or her}} discretion, and no fixed options exist, {{according}} to the December 2008 BBC Radio 4 documentary The Human Button there were four known options: retaliating with nuclear weapons, not retaliating with nuclear weapons, the submarine commander uses his own judgement, or the submarine commander places himself under United States or Australian command if possible. This system of issuing notes containing orders in the event of the head of government's death is said to be unique to the United Kingdom (although the concept of written last orders, particularly of a ship's captain, is a naval tradition), with other <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> using different procedures. The letters are destroyed unopened whenever a Prime Minister leaves office.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, {{the first}} {{plutonium}} core nuclear device {{tested by the}} United States (Trinity test) had a yield of 20 kilotons of TNT, and the first nuclear device detonated by India in 1974, though of primitive design, had a yield {{in the region of}} 8 kilotons of TNT. If the North Korean nuclear test is less than even a kiloton in yield, it would be a historically small inaugural nuclear test. Even if it were as many as the reported intentional yield of 4 kt it would be the smallest nuclear test ever conducted by a state as a first test. Some advanced <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> have produced very small tactical nuclear weapons in the low-kiloton range, but their development is far more technologically challenging than that of weapons in the 15–20 kiloton range, requiring advanced weapons materials and core geometries.|$|E

According {{to the statement}} of France all the objects of the Alliance, a NATO {{had to leave the}} country until April 1967.

25|$|Between 1940 and 1996, the U.S. {{government}} {{spent at}} least $ in present-day terms on nuclear weapons, including platforms development (aircraft, rockets and facilities), command and control, maintenance, waste management and administrative costs. It is estimated that, since 1945, the United States produced more than 70,000 nuclear warheads, {{which is more than}} all other nuclear weapon states combined. The Soviet Union/Russia has produced approximately 55,000 nuclear warheads since 1949, France built 1,110 warheads since 1960, the United Kingdom built 835 warheads since 1952, China built about 600 warheads since 1964, and other <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> built fewer than 500 warheads all together since they developed their first nuclear weapons. Until November 1962, the vast majority of U.S. nuclear tests were above ground. After the acceptance of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, all testing was relegated underground, in order to prevent the dispersion of nuclear fallout.|$|E
25|$|Nations such as France, Russia and the United Kingdom are {{generally}} considered to be great powers due to their military and strategic importance, their status as recognised <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> and also their permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Some academics also believe that Germany and Japan are great powers, but due to their large advanced economies and global influence as opposed to military and strategic capabilities. Italy also has seen much discussion among academics and commentators regarding its status as a great power, particularly for its position in the G7 and the nation's influence in regional and international organisations. Although broad academic support for India as a great power is uncommon, recent years have seen some in the field of political science, such as Malik Mohan (2011) and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski (2012) put forward the assertion that India holds the status of a great power.|$|E
25|$|In {{talks between}} Prime Minister Erlander and Commander-in-Chief Swedlund in 1959, Erlander {{confirmed}} that the program on enhanced defense research would give results {{with regard to the}} warhead design. He emphasized, however, that he was uncertain about the effect it would have on the nuclear weapons issue and would delay the final decision on production until closer to the estimated date of completion in 1963. Thus, Palme preferred to postpone the crucial decision for years, with the goal of avoiding a serious split in the party, as opposed to a difficult compromise necessary to satisfy the desires of both sides for the long run. The implication of this doctrine meant that almost any nuclear weapons research could be pursued under the terms “defense research” and “freedom of action”, while the Social Democratic leadership and the government had partially included the nuclear opponents’ lines in their public declarations. With the nuclear opponents essentially co-opted, AMSA's activity was diminished, and the Swedish peace movement started focusing primarily on advocating reduction of nuclear arsenals in the major <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers.</b> When the government brought up the issue in 1961, Erlander said that he himself now swung in the negative direction regarding the nuclear program, as compared to his views 3–4 years earlier, which he had never announced publicly. The decision that was expected {{to be made in the}} coming years remained suspended. The research was continued and the freedom of action doctrine was intact. Erlander's scientific adviser, Torsten Gustafson, was one of those advocating for the continued investment in research.|$|E

500|$|.....where a {{fresh start}} is badly needed—is in a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests. The {{conclusion}} of such a treaty—so near and yet so far—would check the spiraling arms race {{in one of its}} most dangerous areas. It would place the <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security—it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards.|$|E
500|$|On 31 March 1958, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union {{approved}} {{a decision to}} halt nuclear testing, conditional on other <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> doing the same. Khrushchev then called on Eisenhower and Macmillan to join the moratorium. Despite the action being met with widespread praise and an argument from Dulles that the US should reciprocate, Eisenhower dismissed the plan as a [...] "gimmick"; the Soviet Union had just completed a testing series and the US {{was about to begin}} Operation Hardtack I, a series of atmospheric, surface-level, and underwater nuclear tests. Eisenhower instead insisted that any moratorium be linked to reduced production of nuclear weapons. In April 1958, the US began Operation Hardtack I as planned. The Soviet declaration concerned the British government, which feared that the moratorium might lead to a test ban before its own testing program was completed. Following the Soviet declaration, Eisenhower called for an international meeting of experts to determine proper control and verification measures—an idea first proposed by British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> of China's energy structure and industry system.

500|$|As the <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> {{pursued a}} test ban agreement, they {{also sought to}} contend with a rising {{communist}} China, {{which at the time}} was pursuing its own nuclear program. In 1955, Mao Zedong expressed to the Soviet Union his belief that China could withstand a first nuclear strike and more than 100 million casualties. In the 1950s, the Soviet Union assisted the Chinese nuclear program, but stopped short of providing China with an actual nuclear bomb, which was followed by increasingly tense relations in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Khrushchev began the test-ban talks of 1958 with minimal prior discussion with China, and the two countries' agreement on military-technology cooperation was terminated in June 1959. Prior to the Moscow negotiations of the summer of 1963, Kennedy granted Harriman significant latitude in reaching a [...] "Soviet-American understanding" [...] vis-à-vis China.

40|$|This master’s thesis {{analyses}} Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses as necessitation by {{uncovering the}} strategies and arguments surrounding the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> expansion debate in 2004 - 2006. The study on Japanese case is contrasted with Finland as a representing case of European perspective of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in revival period from early to mid- 2000 s. Based on previous research {{the concept of}} necessitation is defined as 'reluctant acceptance' of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> People unwillingly accept <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as for the greater challenges such as climate change and energy security. In addition, necessitation is a forceful strategy of argumentation promoting <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as an energy source without alternatives. Regarding necessitation, this research addresses following themes: discourses and representations surrounding <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in Japan 2004 - 2006, argumentation strategies to necessitate <b>nuclear</b> <b>power,</b> and major similarities and differences of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses between Japan and Finland. Qualitative content analysis {{is applied to the}} minutes of the meetings produced by responsible institutions in Japan. Following datasets are selected for the analysis: 1) the sectorial meetings for long-term nuclear energy policy under Japan Atomic Energy Commission in 2004 - 2005 and 2) the minutes documented in Nuclear Subcommittee under Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in 2005 - 2006. In order to gain deeper understanding of the arguments, discourse analysis is also conducted upon the material. The research first discloses seven Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses based on the arguments - <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> for: energy security, stable supply, cost-efficiency, environmental compatibility, <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as a means of international contribution, new economic growth, and guaranteed nuclear safety. Representations of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> are analysed within each discourse. The analysis also reveals the employed argumentation strategies to oblige <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> use and prioritised discourses. A comparison between Japanese and Finnish <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discussions shows significant common discourses in energy security, stable supply, affordable electricity, and climate change mitigation. This comparison also shows distinctive Japanese discourses in international collaboration and national economic prosperity. Moreover, Japanese arguments over environmental and economic benefit of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> are by far more elaborate. The research reveals a wide range of social issues concerning the necessity of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in Japan, whereas Europe concentrates on limited social issues of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> A detail picture of Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> shows extensive expectation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> which are embedded in the society. This indicates that more convincing persuasion for <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> expansion is required in Japan. In both domestic and international level, Japan still has to dispel the suspicion of military use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> and diminish the concerns about nuclear safety. Moreover, Japan is in need of establishing additional social benefit of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> for the acceptance of more economically, environmentally and technologically challenging nuclear fuel cycle...|$|R
