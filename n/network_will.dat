The medical school, {{which is expected to}} open in 2017 in partnership with Hackensack University Health <b>Network,</b> <b>will</b> be one of six Catholic medical schools in the United States and should address a shortage of primary care physicians in New Jersey and the surrounding region. The College of Communication and the Arts was a department in the College of Arts and Sciences before being elevated in the summer of 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push Notification Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and authenticate unique identifiers (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and responds with the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The <b>network</b> <b>will</b> acknowledge and authenticate the request. If the authentication succeeds, the data to be transmitted is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{sparked a}} major public discussion on station safety and security, mainly because the station was unstaffed when the suspects mugged Ali on the platform. The only security present was CCTV cameras, and the ticket barriers were left open allowing the suspects to enter the station freely. Many high-profile politicians spoke {{on the issue of}} station safety and called on rail companies to provide security or staff the station until the last train had left the station. The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone assailed Silverlink, the train company who managed the station, for not providing all-night staffing or security. The new provider of every franchise across the rail <b>network</b> <b>will</b> have to provide staff at all times the station is open.|$|E
40|$|As {{the use of}} sensor <b>networks</b> expands, there <b>will</b> be multiple, {{independent}} networks {{operating in}} the same physical space. These <b>networks</b> <b>will</b> run heterogeneous applications and be managed by different entities.

Such <b>networks</b> <b>will</b> unavoidably interact with each other due their common communication hardware.

Unlike traditional communication networks, which {{are designed to}} offer a single type of service, integrated-services <b>networks</b> <b>will</b> offer multiple services, including data, voice, video, and others. Supporting applications with diverse traffic characteristics and performance objectives requires the offered services to be both flexible and guaranteed. To be flexible, integrated-services <b>networks</b> <b>will</b> use packet-switching technology. To provide performance guarantees in terms of throughput, delay, delay jitter, and loss rate, a proactive network control approach is needed. One {{of the most important}} components in this architecture is the service discipline at the switching nodes [...] ...|$|R
5|$|Though Line A ran on a {{different}} voltage {{to the rest of}} the network, it was converted to the 1500v used on the rest of the network when the 200 Series trains began to arrive. On the other hand, Line B has traditionally been the most troublesome of the network given its different voltage and the fact that it uses third rail electrification as opposed to the overhead lines used on the rest of the network, making it in effect a separate entity not capable of sharing its stock with other lines. Presently this line uses 1960's rolling stock acquired from Tokyo's Eidan Marunouchi Line, along with CAF 5000 and CAF 6000 stock acquired from Madrid which are to replace the aging Eidan stock. The line, along with its remaining third rail stock, is being converted to overhead lines at 1500v, after which the entire <b>network</b> <b>will</b> be standardised.|$|E

40|$|Applications in {{high speed}} ATM <b>networks</b> <b>will</b> specify {{quality of service}} (QoS) {{requirements}} on an end-to-end basis. Typical application QoS metrics are cell loss rate, delay jitter, throughput, and maximum delay.
