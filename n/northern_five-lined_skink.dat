50|$|As {{their common}} name suggests, southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> have five {{characteristic}} narrow stripes along their bodies that become lighter with age. The middle stripe {{tends to be}} narrower than the others, and the dark areas between stripes are black in young skinks but become brown with age. A similar lizard, the common <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (Plestiodon fasciatus), is slightly smaller than the southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> and has broader stripes. However, {{it is difficult to}} discriminate between these two species on the basis of physical appearance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> can be {{maintained}} in captivity with minimal care. Some U.S. states impose general restrictions on taking reptiles including native <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> from the wild without a permit or hunting license, for example Maryland (no more than 4 may be possessed without a permit), Indiana and Ohio.|$|R

50|$|The {{common name}} for these lizards {{with a blue}} tail is the common <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink.</b>|$|R
50|$|Plestiodon inexpectatus, {{the southeastern}} <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> {{is a common}} skink in the southeastern United States.|$|R
25|$|Predators {{include the}} red-winged blackbird, Pennsylvania firefly, <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> green darner, {{goldenrod}} spider, Chinese mantis, fiery searcher, and striped skunk.|$|R
50|$|Popular {{features}} of the park include hiking trails and three beaches. There is an abundance of wildlife, including walking sticks and <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks.</b>|$|R
50|$|This skink {{species is}} easy to {{maintain}} in captivity. It has the same requirements as the common <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> although it can tolerate dryer conditions.|$|R
5000|$|The American <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> {{is small}} to medium-sized, growing to about 12.5 to 21.5 cm total length. Young <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> are dark brown to black with five {{distinctive}} white to yellowish stripes {{running along the}} body and a bright blue tail. The blue color fades to light blue with age, and the stripes also may slowly disappear. The dark brown color fades, too, and older individuals are often uniformly brownish. The southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> P. inexpectatus, of the Southeastern United States {{is very similar to}} this species and there is some overlap in range. The two species can be distinguished by their scales. [...] The broad-headed skink, P. laticeps, is similar, and may be difficult to distinguish from P. fasciatus. The former species usually lacks the two enlarged postlabial scales characteristic of P. fasciatus. Adult male broad-headed skinks, with their large size and swollen red head, are readily distinguished from P. fasciatus.|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} name, inexpectatus ("the unexpected"), {{is possibly}} {{a reference to}} the unexpected discovery of this species in 1932, almost 175 years after Linnaeus described Plestiodon fasciatus, commonly known as the American <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink.</b>|$|R
50|$|Southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> {{are common}} {{inhabitants}} of wooded {{areas of the}} southeastern United States. They are commonly found on small islands off the southeastern coast {{even in the absence}} of fresh water and vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Reptiles include timber rattlesnake, {{northern}} copperhead, eastern box turtle, common snapping turtle, and southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink.</b> Amphibians of frogs, toads, and salamanders are all common residents. Notable {{species of}} salamander include Jordan's salamander and hellbender.|$|R
50|$|The (American) <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (Plestiodon fasciatus) is {{a species}} of lizard endemic to North America. It {{is one of the}} most common lizards in the eastern U.S. and one of the seven native species of lizards in Canada.|$|R
50|$|Although officially a Historical Class park, the petroglyphs {{themselves}} are actually concentrated {{in a relatively}} small area of the 1643-hectare park. The rest consists of primarily woodland habitat home to several provincially rare species, such as the <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> Eumeces fasciatus.|$|R
50|$|Young southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> have {{a bright}} blue or purplish tail, {{especially}} towards the tip. Also, stripes become a bright reddish orange towards the head. Juvenile coloration may persist into adulthood, giving {{the head of}} the animal an altogether orange-brown appearance.|$|R
50|$|<b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> are ground-dwelling animals. They prefer moist, {{partially}} wooded habitat {{that provides}} ample cover or inside walls of buildings, trees {{as well as}} sites to bask in the sun. They {{can also be found}} in broken, rocky areas at the northern edge of their habitat.|$|R
50|$|The {{parchment}} like eggs of <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks,</b> {{similar to}} many other reptiles, are thin and easily punctured. Freshly laid eggs range from spherical to oval in shape averaging 1.3 cm in length. Absorption {{of water from the}} soil leads to increased egg size. Egg coloration also changes over time, from white to mottled tan, after contact with the nest burrow. The incubation period ranges from 24 to 55 days, and varies due to fluctuations in temperature. Females typically brood their eggs during this time, exhibiting defensive behavior against smaller predators. Parental care ends a day or two after hatching when hatchlings leave the nest. Young <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks,</b> with a potential life span of up to six years, attain sexual maturity and begin reproducing within two to three years of hatching.|$|R
50|$|Southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> are oviparous; {{the clutch}} size varies from 6 to 12, {{with the number}} of eggs {{diminishing}} with higher latitudes. The female broods the eggs and protects them from predators, including other skinks. The hatchlings appear about one month after the eggs have been laid in early summer.|$|R
50|$|Dalrymple (1988) reports 24 {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and amphibians collected in traps in pine rocklands on Long Pine Key. Among the most common species collected were brown anole (Anolis sagrei), eastern narrow mouthed toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis), greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris), southeastern <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (Eumeces inexpectatus), southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala), and southern toad (Bufo terrestris).|$|R
50|$|<b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> also exhibit antipredation behavior. In evasion {{of various}} predators {{including}} snakes, crows, hawks, shrews, moles, opossums, skunks, raccoons, and domestic cats, skinks may disconnect their entire tail {{or a small}} segment. Skinks run to shelter to escape their distracted predators as the disconnected tail continues to twitch. Skinks may also utilize biting as a defensive strategy.|$|R
50|$|The {{wetlands}} of {{the park}} also support significant animal species including spotted turtles, Blanding’s turtles and eastern Massassauga rattlesnakes. Uplands support both the hognose snake and <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> {{both of which are}} considered species of special concern. There is also a population of fox snakes, which use offshore islands extensively, and overwinter in hibernacula in the area.|$|R
50|$|Fertilization in <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> is internal, {{with eggs}} laid by the female between {{the middle of}} May and July, at least one month after mating. The mating season begins in May. The female Plestiodon will lay its eggs in June, and {{four to six weeks}} after the incubation, the young hatch. Thus the {{birthing}} process consists of laying eggs and external incubation.|$|R
50|$|In most lakes, lake trout, yellow pickerel, smallmouth and largemouth bass, lake whitefish, and {{northern}} pike {{can all be}} found. Additionally, in the more secluded areas one may see white-tailed deer, moose, black bear, red fox, beaver, and raccoons. Commonly seen mammals include eastern cottontail rabbits, eastern chipmunks, red squirrels, gray squirrels, and voles. It also hosts Ontario's only lizard, the <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink.</b>|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{wild animals}} reside in Mockingbird Valley including: white-tailed deer, red fox, groundhog, opossum, raccoon and the {{occasional}} coyote. Birding enthusiasts have also recorded sightings of wild turkey, blue heron, turkey vulture, red tail hawk, pileated woodpecker, and the great horned owl. Due to the karst topography, reptiles and amphibians such as the red salamander and <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> are also common.|$|R
50|$|The {{broad-headed skink}} gets {{its name from}} the wide jaws, giving the head a {{triangular}} appearance. Adult males are brown or olive brown in color and have bright orange heads during the mating season in spring. Females have five light stripes running down the back and the tail, similar to the <b>Five-lined</b> <b>Skink.</b> Juveniles are dark brown or black and also striped and have blue tails.|$|R
50|$|A {{southern}} {{portion of}} this region was designated a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2002, the Frontenac Arch Biosphere Reserve. Within this biosphere reserve is the relatively small St. Lawrence Islands National Park. Although it is small, it has many Frontenac Arch species mentioned above, including deerberry, Blanding's turtle, and <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks.</b> Further north, there is, still a large gap in the ecological link to Algonquin Park. In this gap are smaller parks such as Frontenac Provincial Park and Bon Echo Provincial Park.|$|R
40|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> is the most expansive of any eastern North American lizard, ranging from previously glaciated southern Canada southward to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Atlantic seaboard west to Texas and Minnesota. The most northerly populations occur in southern Ontario and are of conservation concern. We developed six polymorphic dinucleotide microsatellite loci to examine the genetic structure within and among Ontario’s populations and to examine the intrapopulation levels of genetic diversity relative to more southern populations...|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> extends in the north to {{southern}} Ontario, Michigan and eastern New York. The western border is in Minnesota, Missouri and eastern Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Florida, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana and Texas. These skinks tend to be most abundant on the coastal plain in the southeastern United States and along the Gulf Coast. They have now been seen in increasing numbers in the northern Chesapeake Bay Region of Maryland particularly along {{the shores of the}} Elk River.|$|R
50|$|Wildcat Mountain State Park has a {{woodland}} ecosystem. The Kickapoo River Valley and {{the park}} provide a habitat for many animals typically found in the woods of the Upper Midwest. Common birds include tundra swans, Canada geese, great blue herons, sandpipers, wild turkeys, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles and turkey vultures. Reptiles are {{also found in the}} park including, <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks,</b> red-bellied snakes and eastern hog-nosed snakes. White-tailed deer, red squirrels, and beaver are among the mammals found in the park.|$|R
50|$|Takydromus tachydromoides, the Japanese grass lizard, is a wall lizard {{species of}} the genus Takydromus. It is found in Japan. Its Japanese name is 'kanahebi' (カナヘビ). 'Hebi' means 'snake' in Japanese, {{although}} this lizard is not a snake. There are three lizards found in the four main islands of Japan. The other two are the Japanese gekko (also, Schlegel's Japanese gekko, Gekko japonicus), and the Japanese <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (Eumeces latiscutatus, also Plestiodon latiscutatus; this skink shows five lines only as a juvenile).|$|R
50|$|Other {{common names}} include blue-tailed skink (for juveniles) and {{red-headed}} skink (for adults). It is technically appropriate {{to call it}} the American <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> to distinguish it from the African skink Trachylepis quinquetaeniata (otherwise known as five-lined mabuya) or the eastern red-headed skink to distinguish it from its western relative Plestiodon skiltonianus (otherwise known as the western skink). The blue-tailed skink proper is Cryptoblepharus egeriae from Christmas Island, but in North America the juveniles of any Eumeces or Plestiodon species may be called this.|$|R
25|$|Kings Gap State Park has a {{wide variety}} of wild plants and animals. Turkey {{vultures}} can be seen near the summit of the mountain. Reptiles including the box turtle, <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> copperhead snakes and timber rattlesnakes. The plant life is diverse as well. Wild blueberry, huckleberry and mountain laurel {{can be found in the}} woods with large stands of chestnut oak, white pine, larch and Douglas fir. Vernal pools appear in the springtime. These pools provide habitats and breeding area for amphibians like wood frogs, spotted salamanders, and spring peepers.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{distinctive}} southern {{animals in the}} county include <b>five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> (Ontario's only species of lizard), black rat snakes and southern flying squirrels. Unusual southern plants include the Arrow arum, a nationally rare wetland plant found near Mississippi Lake. [...] The south-facing cliffs over Big Rideau Lake, including Foley Mountain, have a slightly warmer climate, and therefore support an unusual southern flora including shagbark hickory, tall cinquefoil (Potentilla arguta) and a rare fern, blunt-lobed woodsia. Cliff Bennett provides a list of 26 routes for canoe and kayak exploration of the county.|$|R
40|$|The habitat patch {{in which}} an animal resides can have {{profound}} fitness consequences. I studied habitat selection in a population of <b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> at Point Pelee National Park, Ontario, Canada. Skinks {{did not use the}} entire resource spectrum that was available. Preference was shown for larger, moderately decayed debris which provided a moist and relatively constant microclimate. Habitat selection was density-independent, suggesting that intraspecific competition does not structure the pattern of habitat use. A high level of parental care occurred, with females brooding and guarding clutches. Females varied their body contact with eggs and moved eggs vertically to control moisture. Human disturbance, centred at boardwalks, has a negative effect on skink abundance and distribution through reduction of debris. The incorporation of an Allee effect in habitat selection models is extended, and a new graphical model the 2 ̆ 2 Ideal social distribution 2 ̆ 2 is presented which may better explain patterns observed in <b>Five-lined</b> <b>skinks</b> or other social species.

50|$|Upper Rideau Lake {{is part of}} {{the range}} of a number of animals listed as species at risk. If you spot any of these species along the Rideau Canal you are urged to record date, time, location, and species {{information}} to drop off at any lockstation.Endangered species include the loggerhead shrike and spotted turtle.Threatened species include golden-winged warbler, least bittern, peregrine falcon, chimney swift, red-headed woodpecker, grey fox, Blanding's turtle, musk turtle, and black rat snake,Special concern species include cerulean warbler, Louisiana waterthrush, short-eared owl, yellow rail, red-shouldered hawk, southern flying squirrel, <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink,</b> map turtle, snapping turtle, milksnake, and ribbon snake.|$|R
25|$|Kings Gap is {{suitable}} habitat {{for a variety}} of reptiles, including the box turtle, the <b>five-lined</b> <b>skink</b> (one of Pennsylvania's few lizards), the northern copperhead and the timber rattlesnake. Sightings of these reptiles are not uncommon in the summer months. In the Mansion Day Use Area, copperheads and rattlesnakes are sometimes seen hunting rodents along the stone walls of the mansion patio and garden. Although these snakes are venomous and should be respected, in their natural habitats they retreat when threatened. The timber rattlesnake is classified as a candidate species in Pennsylvania, which means it could receive endangered or threatened status in the future. For additional information on these reptiles, contact the center office.|$|R
