40|$|Did {{the early}} Pentecostals regard {{themselves}} as servants {{to the wider}} church, bearers of the gifts of the Spirit, sent to bring a renewed focus on love, unity, holiness, and justice to {{all parts of the}} church? Or did they see themselves as the only true believers in the midst of apostates, heretics, and reprobates? What can be found among the early Pentecostals, as a people whose primary self-identity was as a people of the Spirit, that carried the Spirit's mission forward in unique or significant ways? Can the loss of such practices help explain the decline of the Pentecostal movement? Narrating the Pentecostal movement through the lens of the Spirit's mission to the world is an attempt to give a normative account of Pentecostal liminality, to describe certain communitas commitments as ones that gave rise to the movement and propelled it forward. This study describes in detail how this understanding itself came to be something else, something quite damaging. Still, the general principle was that the Holy Spirit comes in power and blesses work that aligns with the Spirit's own mission. That is the primary presupposition at work here as well, that through understanding the mission of the Holy Spirit, we may find ways to align ourselves with that mission, to co-labor with the Spirit by privileging the liminal moment. Implicit in this claim is the denial that such alignment is automatic, guaranteed, or even self-sustaining. The argument here is that the incompatibility of the Pentecostal ethos represented by these communal commitments with the uncritical acceptance of evangelical-fundamentalist theological accounts {{on the part of the}} second and third generation Pentecostals resulted in a loss of what constituted the Pentecostal movement as such. This dissertation begins with an exegesis of John 16. 8 - 11 in an effort to articulate Pentecostal ethics in terms of participation in the Spirit's mission of convincing the world with regard to sin, righteousness, and power. The conclusions of this exegesis are that the entire world is in view throughout this passage; that the Spirit convicts all with regard to sin, defined as <b>not</b> <b>believing</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jesus,</b> righteousness, defined as following Jesus' example in a life of holiness, and power, defined as the Spirit's judgment on all forms of power that are self-aggrandizing as opposed to the cruciform mode of authority that must characterize the Christian life; and that the Spirit accomplishes this convincing work primarily through the life of the communitas the Spirit forms, embodies, and empowers. These results are then carried to the Pentecostal movement in its earliest instantiation and as it exists as a Christian subculture today, asking what Pentecostal liminality might look like, if the rubric of the Spirit's mission to the world is applied as a moment we are to participate in enduringly.

50|$|In {{all four}} of these works, Doherty {{presents}} views {{on the origins of}} Christianity, specifically promoting the view that Jesus is a mythical figure rather than a historical person.

Rather, they <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jesus</b> as a heavenly being who suffered his sacrificial death in the lower spheres of heaven {{in the hands of the}} demon spirits, and was subsequently resurrected by God. This Christ myth was not based on a tradition reaching back to a historical Jesus, but on the Old Testament exegesis in the context of Jewish-Hellenistic religious syncretism heavily influenced by Middle Platonism, and what the authors believed to be mystical visions of a risen Jesus.|$|R

According to Doherty, Paul's Christ originated as a myth derived from middle Platonism with some influence from Jewish mysticism and belief <b>in</b> a historical <b>Jesus</b> emerged only among Christian communities in the 2nd century.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an analysys of the {{concepts}} of the ecclesiology of Joseph Shulam (1946 –), and the ways how it seeks to transform Christian theology and praxis {{as it is shown}} in his published writings. In the first chapter, I present an introduction to Messianic Judaism, its history and core theological issues. Messianic Judaism is a form of Judaism that holds that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, standing in the middle ground between Judaism and Christianity. Its core theological issues revolve around negotiating and reconciling between the theological priorities of Judaism and Christianity. In ecclesiology, this is shown in the different models of conceiving the people of God as a community of Jewish and non-Jewish followers of Jesus, {{and the role of the}} majority of the Jewish people who do <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jesus</b> as the Messiah. The second chapter is an analysis of Shulam’s theological paradigm of roots. Shulam understands the essence of roots to be the correct understanding and living out the teachings of the Bible. The correct understanding is based on a concrete and indexical relationship between the biblical revelation and reality. Traditional Christian creeds and allegorical, spiritualizing interpretations are rejected as unbiblical ”human doctrines” that alienates the biblical text from faith rooted in reality. In the third chapter, I analyze the three core elements of Shulam’s ecclesiology: God, Israel and the Church. The spiritual life of the people of God is based on the conviction that there is only one God who is the Creator and Father of all living beings and this faith is meant to unite all humankind and restore it to its original wholeness. The Messiah, whom Shulam considers divine, is God’s instrument for enabling people to live in relationship with God. Israel is the physical, ethnic people of Israelites, nowadays known as Jews. Israel is the elect people of God, and by election Shulam means being chosen for the mission to restore the knowledge of God and erase the darkness of idolatry. The Church is the fulfillment of this mission and the extension of Israel that is made of Gentiles who join the ”commonwealth of Israel” and become heir to Israel’s spiritual blessings through faith in Messiah together with the Jewish believers. The practical significance of Jewish tradition for Messianic Jews and Christians is analyzed in the fourth chapter. The most central issues are synagogue as a social setting, hermeneutics, the identity of Gentile believer, and how to apply Jewish halakhah to Messianic Jews and Christians. Shulam considers ”the seat of Moses” in Matthew 23 a basis for Rabbinic Judaism, the heir to the Pharisees to have an authority to interpret the Scriptures and make halakhic rulings that are, to some extent, binding even for followers of Jesus. The fifth chapter is devoted to conclusions. Shulam’s call for a revision or, as he calls it, ”restoration”, is a multifaceted program, but it revolves around the Christians’ relationship to Jews and the idea of Israel. Israel, the Jews, still have an identity as a people of God, holding a divine calling to teach the Torah to the nations, and Orthodox Jews are the heirs to this calling today. This does not remove their need to <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jesus</b> as their Messiah and Saviour. But Christians who believe Jesus as a Messiah should, in Shulam’s understanding, abandon their denominational Christian traditions, and embrace their faith as a form of Judaism with Jesus at its center...|$|R
40|$|Scholars who {{recently}} rejected secularisation theses {{on the grounds}} that they were insufficiently defined or contextualised now seem to be accepting with unseemly, uncritical haste, the new, in vogue notion of the post-secular. Scholars seem tempted to drop the term ‘post-secular’ into their papers and presentations as if it is a generally accepted and understood term. It is not and nor, as this paper will argue, is it plausible unless applied to a limited and specific range of phenomena. Far from disappearing, religion is often used publicly as a marker of group identity. This is not a return to religion, or a resurgence in spirituality, but a fluctuating form of contextualised religious identity. Christian nominalists may <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> God or <b>Jesus,</b> at least if belief is understood as ‘faith’. It would be incorrect, however, to dismiss them as ‘unbelievers’, or their nominalist beliefs as not having essential or substantive reality. They <b>believe</b> <b>in</b> many things, usually related to ‘belonging’. By closely examining people’s sense of Christian ‘belonging’, we find other more subtle, interwoven ‘belongings’ related to, for example, history, nation, morality, gender, and ‘culture’...|$|R
40|$|Der Beitrag verfolgt die theologische Hypothese, dass es auch bei Menschen, die sich selbst als nichtkirchlich, nichtchristlich oder sogar als nichtreligiös verstehen, einen vorreflexiven, unartikulierten Bezug zum Zentralinhalt des christlichen Glaubens geben kann. Richard Rothe hatte erstmals von einem „unbewussten Christentum“ gesprochen. Dieses Motiv wurde in der Theologiegeschichte des ausgehenden 19. und des 20, Jahrhunderts von Martin Kähler und Martin Rade aufgenommen, es begegnet im sog. „christlichen Sozialismus“ und in der davon beeinflussten Dialektische Theologie. In Bonhoeffers Gefängnisbriefen scheint es ebenso auf wie in Tillichs Rede von der „latenten Kirche“. Diese Spur zieht sich weiter bis in die „Politischen Theologie“ Dorothee Sölles. Auch in der katholischen Theologie finden sich Überlegungen dieser Art, vor allem in Rahners Konzept des „anonymen Christseins“. Der Beitrag zeichnet diesen Denkweg nach und unterzieht ihn einer systematisch-theologischen Reflexion.

In the 19 th century Richard Rothe coined the term “unconscious Christianity” to articulate that assumption. In the history of theology in the late 19 th and 20 th century that topic was discussed and developed further. Martin Kähler und Martin Rade took it into consideration. The movement of the so called „Christian Socialists” referred to it as well as the representatives of the “Dialectical Theology”. It appears in Bonhoeffer’s letters from prison and is indicated in Tillich’s reflection on the “latent Church”. The trace of that theme leads further to the “Political Theology” of Dorothee Sölle. There is a similar line of thought in catholic thought, which seems to culminate particularly in Rahner’s “anonymus Christianity”.
