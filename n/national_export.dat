The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi’s exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country’s Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.|$|E

The contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to the GDP of the central and western provinces was small, but the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to the economies of the central and western provinces was significantly greater than the foreign export dependence. Therefore, in the current international market downturn, the eastern provinces, which occupy {{a higher proportion of}} foreign trade, must accelerate their transformation to address the negative impacts of the export slump. The central and western provinces must also make full use of their comparative advantages by undertaking an industrial transformation and improving the development environment to address the indirect impacts of the export slump.|$|R

30|$|Table  3 {{also shows}} the foreign export {{dependence}} of each province. The data in Table  3 {{indicate that the}} foreign export dependence {{of most of the}} eastern provinces was relatively higher. The foreign export dependence of Guangdong Province was the highest, reaching 93  % in 2007. To some extent, this explains why <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> made such a great contribution to the GDP of the eastern provinces. By comparing the foreign export dependence of each eastern province with the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to their GDP, however, we observed that the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to the eastern provinces’ GDP was far less than their foreign export dependence. For example, the foreign export dependence of Guangdong Province was 93  %, whereas its value added contributed by <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> accounted for 43  % of its GDP. There are two important reasons for this: first, a large part of China’s foreign trade belongs to the processing trade (i.e., exports require the import {{of a large number of}} intermediate products), and the domestic value added rate is low. Therefore, although the foreign export dependence is higher, the percentage of the value added contributed by exports is relatively low. The economic relationships between the regions lead to high export spillover effects in the eastern provinces; in other words, the exports of these provinces require the purchase of intermediate raw materials from inland provinces, which boosts the GDPs of the inland provinces. This is why foreign export dependence cannot be used to measure the contribution of exports to provincial GDP. In fact, the contribution of exports to the eastern provinces’ economies tends to be overestimated when using foreign export dependence.|$|R

30|$|In other regions, {{the foreign}} export {{dependence}} of the central and western provinces is significantly {{lower than that of}} eastern provinces. The foreign export {{dependence of the}} central provinces was the lowest and accounted for only 6.39  %. Above, we noted that the contribution of exports to the western provinces’ economies was not the lowest, but was higher than the contribution of exports to the central provinces’ economies. Considering that the foreign export dependence of the western region was the lowest, it can be inferred that the economic relationships between the western and eastern provinces are closer than the economic relationships between these regions and the central regions. By comparing the western provinces’ foreign export dependence with their contribution to exports, we found that for the western provinces, the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to GDP was significantly higher than the foreign export dependence. For example, Yunnan Province’s foreign export dependence was only 4  % in 2007, whereas the contribution of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to its GDP reached 12  %. The contributions of <b>national</b> <b>exports</b> to the GDP of Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang were substantially higher than their foreign export dependence. Therefore, for the western provinces, the contribution of exports to their economies will be underestimated when using foreign export dependence because the spillover effects of export production in other regions are not considered.|$|R

In our estimation approach, we select pairs of exporting countries that belong to a common preferential trade area and examine their exports of goods with high transport costs and strong scale economies relative to their exports of goods with low transport costs and weak scale economies. We find that home-market effects exist and {{that the nature of}} these effects depends on industry transport costs. For industries with very high transport costs, it is national market size that determines <b>national</b> <b>exports.</b> For industries with moderately high transport costs, it is neighborhood market size that matters.
