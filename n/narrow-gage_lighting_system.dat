In the scenario considered in this paper, under a demand response request, <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> in a building react by executing dimming control to reduce power consumption based on their load shedding flexibilities. Load shedding flexibility reflects the amount of power reduction that can be achieved by an individual controller without violating minimum illumination requirements of occupants in that area.

HaslerThe Internet of Things (IoT) {{is rapidly}} growing and is {{starting}} to be incorporated into commercial buildings. One {{of the ways that}} the IoT is being used in buildings is connected lighting, also referred to as smart lighting. Connected lighting allows for communication between the <b>lighting</b> <b>system,</b> people, the environment, and other devices. This paper will focus on connected lighting and its effect on lighting controls and design. The IoT is expected to see substantial growth {{in the next few years}} and the growth of connected devices will have a huge impact on the lighting industry as connected <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> will be installed in more commercial buildings. The shift to solid state lighting (SSL) in recent years has brought the transition from conventional lighting controls to connected lighting controls. For this shift to be successful, issues with interoperability, security and reliability will need to be overcome. Connected <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> on the market are using both wired and wireless technologies. Power over Ethernet (PoE) and wireless technologies such as ZigBee and Bluetooth Smart are currently being incorporated into connected <b>lighting</b> <b>systems.</b> The introduction of these technologies is changing the way that <b>lighting</b> control <b>systems</b> are designed and installed. Products such as fixture-integrated sensors and wireless devices are also being used in connected <b>lighting</b> <b>systems.</b> These products, along with the wired and wireless technologies, are changing <b>lighting</b> control <b>system</b> configurations. <b>Lighting</b> design will also be affected by connected <b>lighting</b> <b>systems.</b> New features including color-tunability and indoor positioning will be used to enhance the <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> and improve occupant health.
