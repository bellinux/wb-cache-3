25|$|Each curve may {{pass through}} itself during this motion, {{but the two}} curves must remain {{separated}} throughout. This is formalized as regular homotopy, which further requires that each curve be an immersion, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>any</b> map. However, this added condition {{does not change the}} definition of linking number (it does not matter if the curves are required to always be immersions or not), which is an example of an h-principle (homotopy-principle), meaning that geometry reduces to topology.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the early}} Shia {{differed}} only marginally from mainstream Sunnis in their views on political leadership, {{but it is possible}} in this sect to see a refinement of Shia doctrine. Early Sunnis traditionally held that the political leader must come from the tribe of Muhammad—namely, the Quraysh tribe. The Zaydis narrowed the political claims of Ali's supporters, claiming that <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>any</b> descendant of Ali would be eligible to lead the Muslim community (ummah) but only those males directly descended from Muhammad through the union of Ali and Fatimah. But during the Abbasid revolts, other Shia, who {{came to be known as}} Imamiyyah (followers of the Imams), followed the theological school of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, himself the great great grandson of Muhammad's son-in-law Imam Ali. They asserted a more exalted religious role for Imams and insisted that, at any given time, whether in power or not, a single male descendant of Ali and Fatimah was the divinely appointed Imam and the sole authority, in his time, on all matters of faith and law. To those Shia, love of the imams and of their persecuted cause became as important as belief in God's oneness and the mission of Muhammad.|$|E

500|$|Davis biographer Jack Chambers {{was more}} critical, finding the sound quality and Grossman's {{performance}} poor, {{especially on the}} first disc, where he indulged in a [...] "nervous downpour of notes that is narrow in range and unimaginative". In general, Chambers complained that the concert's largely improvised format was risky and inauspicious: [...] "It can inspire creative bridges and emotive playing melded into a spontaneous suite or degenerate into a babble of voices bogged down {{in search of the}} musical means to get from one theme to the next." [...] In Tingen's opinion, the quality of the mix was [...] "substandard" [...] and Grossman's solos sounded [...] "nervous and shrill", but he still recommended Black Beauty as [...] "a powerful document of an exciting phase in Miles's electric explorations, when the direction of his live performances was catching up with his studio explorations". Writing for Down Beat, John Corbett found the recording [...] "gritty" [...] but the grooves free and pure-sounding. Sputnikmusic's Hernan M. Campbell was more enthusiastic, deeming it [...] "the perfect live album for <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>any</b> fan of Miles Davis, but jazz fans in general".|$|E

Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it [...] "defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there's never been anything like this before." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review, describing the film as [...] "like eating popcorn, but it's <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>any</b> old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel... ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can't help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie". The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "This violent Hong Kong thriller has more psychological depth than most of its kind, but ultimately seems like a pointless exercise in style".|$|E

Christopher Tapley from Variety praised both Gaga and Warren's songwriting, describing it as: [...] "something of an anthem for the cause... It {{is one of}} the strongest contenders in this year's race for best original song [...] But far more than that, it is a rally cry for a movement." [...] Lisa Wright wrote in NME that the song is: [...] "a somber piano ballad befitting of the topic with lyrics that depict the frustration of being told to pick yourself up and carry on by people who couldn't possibly understand your situation." [...] Idolator's Robbie Daw claimed that the [...] "powerful, unsettling" [...] visuals were complimented by a [...] "strong vocal performance" [...] from Gaga.

500|$|In November 2007, the Anne Frank tree—by then {{infected}} with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk—was {{scheduled to be}} cut down {{to prevent it from}} falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist Arnold Heertje said about the tree: [...] "This is <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>any</b> tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews." [...] The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the horse chestnut, which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution. The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years. However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree. Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. Saplings were also sent to a school in Little Rock, Arkansas that was the scene of a desegregation battle, Liberty Park (Manhattan), which honours victims of the September 11 attacks, and other sites in the United States. Another horse chestnut tree honoring Frank was planted in 2010 at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham, Alabama.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that. The fact that Inhumans are now out there is something I think we need to investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>any</b> powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart is about what it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E
