40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ways in which {{personal}} experience and native language status shape individual medical background knowledge. In this exploratory study, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with native (NES, n= 10) and <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES,</b> n= 7) participants. From the interviews it emerged that personal experiences or personal (emotional) involvement with any kind of medical condition have several effects on an individual’s knowledge and perception of medical terminology. Three main effects were found: 1) Personal experience fosters the retention of medical terms; 2) personal experience can promote the development of deeper underlying knowledge structures for the medical terms in question; 3) personal experience can aid participants in becoming aware of the different meanings health professionals and lay people attach to one and the same medical term. These findings, however, only hold true for NES participants. NNES participants experience many difficulties in medical communication. Most of their problems relate to English proficiency, their respective native language and the unfamiliarity with Western medical practice. 31 page(s...|$|E

Thirty research articles (fifteen articles belonging to native and fifteen belonging to <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> writers) were selected from leading (Iranian and International) journals of Chemistry and the use of first person pronouns were analyzed. The analysis shows that the overall distribution of first person pronouns in <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> articles is higher than that in native <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> writings.

40|$|A {{continuing}} {{growth of}} <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> instructors hired by American universities has been substantial in recent years. Their presence on campus has brought more diversity into both {{the academic and}} university culture. However, currently most of the foreign scholars working in American universities come from countries where English is not used as a native language. Due to the differences between their cultural backgrounds and the American mainstream cultures, major adjustments are needed for both NNES instructors and students in their university lives. This study wasiii intended to identify the key components of the obstacles and challenges faced by both NNES instructors and students in an academic college setting.

40|$|In {{the global}} workplace, {{there has been}} {{tremendous}} growth in business processing outsourcing (BPO). Many industries are establishing call centres, back offices and other offshore enterprises in developing countries {{in an attempt to}} reduce costs. This development has far-reaching implications for language in these offshore destinations. Despite complaints about the communication skills of <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> agents in these outsourced destinations, the language of the calls has not been well-researched. This paper focuses on one area of the BPO industry, call centre communication. We limit the discussion to calls in the insurance industry, in one offshore destination, the Philippines. In this paper, we outline the development and problems faced in offshore outsource destinations. Based on an analysis of a sample of call centre interactions, we outline their generic structure, and we investigate some of the reasons for breakdowns in communication. We use some examples from the data and discuss the linguistic realisations to illustrate what is happening in such breakdowns. The findings from the analyses are important {{for the development of the}} industry, for the training of customer service representatives, and could help us understand why frustration is experienced by many.

40|$|Using medical {{terminology}} {{involves a}} large risk of miscommunication in English-medium consultations as patients {{often do not}} know or misunderstand the terms commonly used by physicians, or even misuse terms in their interactions with medical professionals (Hadlow/Pitts 1991; Street 2003). Patients and physicians also frequently associate different meanings with the same medical terms, which further threatens patient-physician communication (Hadlow/Pitts 1991). To date most investigations {{on the impact of}} medical terminology have focused on native English speaking (NES) individuals in monolingual encounters, while insights from <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> physicians and patients have been largely neglected. Through semi-structured interviews, this qualitative explorative study investigates the experiences of patients and physicians from diverse linguistic backgrounds in medical encounters within Australia. A particular focus is given to the way NES and NNES participants perceive and judge the impact of the meaning of medical terms on patient-physician communication. Findings suggest that both the use and meaning of medical terminology are perceived and judged very differently by individuals who come from different language backgrounds and who hold varying degrees of medical knowledge. Findings indicate that common blanket recommendations urging medical professionals to avoid or explain jargon may be futile since physicians and patient also diverge in their understanding of what constitutes jargon or medical terminology. 20 page(s...|$|E

Students (N= 161) who were enrolled in an oral English course at Purdue University participated in a survey. Follow-up {{interviews were conducted with}} voluntary participants (N= 9) to examine {{the perceptions of}} NNES graduate students towards NNES instructors in depth. The findings in the survey showed that more than one third of the participants experienced difficulty with their NNES instructors due to their limited intelligibility and restricted command of English. Furthermore, one third of the participants expressed that they would transfer to another section of a course if the NNES instructor of the course speaks highly accented English. However, the majority of them believed NNES instructors can be as effective as NNS instructors. More overtly negative views were found during the interviews; many of the interviewees revealed strong desire to avoid NNES instructors with particular language backgrounds. Familiarity with the accents also {{played a significant role in}} ameliorating their negative perceptions toward NNES instructors. When there were communication breakdowns between the respondents and their NNES instructors, they tended to give up listening to the lectures and sought other resources or solutions to keep up their study address difficulties. Moreover, the majority of the interview participants expressed that they would avoid to discuss discussing the communication issues with their NNES instructors directly as it would be seen as rude and disrespectful. ...|$|E

This study emphasizes the meanings of our experiences as language learners and as ESOL teachers in relation to our identity construction, and highlights the effects of cultural, linguistic and interpersonal elements on our identity transformation. The specific {{purpose of this study}} is to seek alternatives to (1) develop and enrich our understanding of the diverse learning and teaching journeys of Filipina NNES ESOL teachers that Mid-Atlantic Public Schools (MAPS) hired between 2005 and 2006, (2) understand and co-construct our identities as supported and marginalized, (3) look at other Filipina NNES ESOL teachers to juxtapose their experiences to my own, as a person with an insider/outsider perspective, and (4) to use our narratives to inform MAPS and other U.

Through narrative life history interviews, email follow-up interviews, informal conversations, and questionnaires, the study explored Filipina NNES ESOL teachers' experiences of becoming and being ESOL teachers in MAPS. The study hopes to encourage local and state policy makers and curriculum developers to design professional development plans for Filipino teachers, and to encourage researchers to do further research on the lived experiences of other K- 12 international teachers; which may include groups such as Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Hispanic, Indians, Nigerians, Jamaicans, etc. through additional qualitative research designs like case study, portraiture and ethnography...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{there is}} a lack of {{investigation}} into the language learning and language use strategies of non-native English speaking students at the graduate level. Existing literature of the strategy use of the "more successful" language learners are predominantly based on student data at the secondary school or college levels. This dissertation research project will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods ("mixed-methods" research) to examine academic English listening and speaking strategy use patterns of <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> graduate students and also to investigate those students' relevant metacognitive thinking and its impact on their strategy use. First, this research project will investigate what kinds of strategies are being employed and how they are being employed to help those students achieve communicative competence in oral academic English. Descriptive statistics based on a large-scale database of questionnaire responses will be provided. Secondly, this project will investigate what factors have significant effects on the strategy use of this particular student group. Statistical tools such as the multiple regressions and path analysis are used to determine the effects of gender, academic fields, regions of origin, degree level, and other factors. Thirdly, this project examines students' metacognitive thinking and how it impacts their strategy use. The guiding theory related to this line of investigation is that students' metacognitive thinking is closely related to their strategy use patterns. Finally, this project also aims to validate a new assessment tool (a questionnaire) for investigating non-native graduate students' academic English listening and speaking strategy use. Results of the study are expected to eventually help build a descriptive model of listening and speaking strategy use of NNES graduate students and will inform learner-centered instructional design and curriculum development. The ultimate benefit will also be to help many NNES graduate students achieve at a much higher level in graduate school because of their improved English listening and speaking skills...|$|E

40|$|Objective of the Study: The {{objectives}} for this thesis were 1) to understand <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> business professionals' self-perception of their oral communication competence in English, 2) {{to understand the}} importance of English language and competence in <b>English</b> for <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> business professionals when they consider employability and career expectations and finally 3) to study whether the concepts of self-perceived oral English communication competence, self-perceived employability and career expectations are somehow connected. Methodology and the Analytical Framework: Based on previous literature on oral communication, communication competence, employability and career, a theoretical framework was constructed for the thesis. The research was conducted with a quantitative survey containing demographic questions and questions related to self-perceived English oral communication competence, self-perceived employability and career expectations. The questionnaire was distributed through various channels and responses were collected from <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> business professionals. Statistical methods, including Spearman's rank-order correlation and independent t-test, were used to analyze the data alongside with visual presentation. Findings and Conclusions: The main findings of the thesis were related to the importance of <b>English</b> skills for <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> business professionals and self-perceived oral communication competence in English. First, over 90 % of the 34 respondents of the questionnaire considered English communication skills important when thinking of their future career prospects and advancement possibilities. Second, the scores for self-perceived oral English communication competence indicated that the respondents seemed to consider themselves more competent communicators in some situations than others. No correlation was found in this study between self-perceived communication competence and self-perceived employability.

While the phrase "East Asian ESL teachers" in the title refers to Wen-Lin Huang, Kuriko Yayama, and Xuen Zhang, K- 12 ESL teachers in east coast public schools, it is also refers to me. These descriptions are based on my personal journey as an English learner and graduate student, as well as intensive interviews with three NNES ESL teachers whose experiences I have to honor and give voice to by presenting them as I learned from them. This study captures the NNES teachers' experiences of becoming and being ESL teachers in the United States. Particularly, this study emphasizes the meanings of our experiences as language learners, ESL teacher candidates, and ESL practitioners in relation to our identity construction and reconstruction, and highlights the effects of cultural, linguistic, social, personal and interpersonal elements on our professional identity transformation. This study also describes the multitude of obstacles NNES ESL teachers overcome in developing {{the power of their}} minds.

Publishing research articles in English-medium refereed journals is a challenging task for <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> doctoral students. Limited research, however, {{has been conducted}} in the Australian context to explore publishing experiences of NNES doctoral students. Adopting a qualitative research approach with semi-structured interviews to collect data, this research investigates language-related challenges {{encountered by}} seven Vietnamese students studying doctoral programs in Australian universities and their strategies to successfully publish their research articles in English. Content analysis was adopted for data analysis and an inductive approach was used to identify themes {{that emerged from the}} data. The results show that as non-native English speakers, these Vietnamese doctoral students had difficulties in using their discipline-specific terminology, expressing ideas in English and developing ideas logically. They also had to handle paper rejection and negative comments on their language issues given by journal gatekeepers. As novice scholarly writers, they encountered additional challenges because of their insufficient knowledge of and practice in writing research articles. To get their papers published, they have developed necessary strategies such as co-authoring with supervisors, seeking linguistic assistance from native speakers, self-proofreading, and developing genre knowledge of research articles. This research project has important implications for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) programs and supportive writing programs that aim to help increase the publication outputs of NNES doctoral students in Australian universities. Future research may examine the publishing experiences of NNES doctoral students on a larger scale that allows comparisons between different linguistic groups as well as generalisation of the results to a wider population.

40|$|Researchers have {{examined}} <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> student integration problems and survival strategies in U. S. academic classes mainly from NNES student perspectives. Noticeably scarce or absent are studies investigating {{the role of}} U. S. students during multicultural interactions, the impact of NNES students on U. S. students, or the socially constructed nature of group work. Guided by a social constructionist methodology, this study approached group work interaction from both a U. S. and NNES college student perspective. Intensive interview data were gathered and analysed by employing constructivist grounded theory strategies, which exposed behaviours and processes participants reported using in groups. Discourse {{analysis was used to}} gain a deeper understanding of what participants tried to achieve with their language. The findings confirm that multicultural interaction is extremely complex and changeable and poses difficult but different interpersonal problems for both parties, though NNES students are more profoundly affected. Analyses suggest that students used a discourse of difference to position themselves and others. In the discourse, U. S. student group work conduct was used as the standard against which NNES student behaviour was measured. The discourse favoured U. S. students and disturbed power circulation accordingly. Positioning acts and story lines anchored in the discourse seemed to be part of changeable substructures, specific to the individual and the situation. The substructures, consisting of needs and expectations, formed the local moral order that determined participants' rights and duties. Positioning involved complicated decisions about whether individuals should take social risks, leave comfort zones, reposition themselves, revise story lines, perform emotion work, or change ideas and expectations. Consequences of decisions were group inclusion or exclusion, becoming visible or invisible in class, and learning or not learning from group encounters. Trying to alleviate U. S. -NNES group interaction problems involves a broad approach that includes creating institutional commitment to diversity through setting meaningful educational goals and making individuals aware of personal stakes and responsibilities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background. Previous {{research}} on written feedback {{has taken place}} mainly in campus-based settings. Written feedback to Non-Native English speaking Online Doctoral students is under-researched. Aim. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the attitudes, perceptions and actions of <b>Non-Native</b> <b>English</b> <b>Speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> Online Doctoral students toward the written feedback that they receive from their Native English Speaking (NES) doctoral research supervisors. This research will address questions about these students’ attitudes and perceptions regarding written feedback and the feedback providers. Furthermore, the investigation’s research findings point towards practical application by doctoral research supervisors. The Social Presence, Transactional Distance and Second Language Activity theories frame the interpretation of the findings. Sample. 100 online doctoral students completed the online survey of which 41 completed enough of the survey to be included in the study and 10 telephonic or Skype interviews were conducted. The survey respondents lived on different continents and represented seventeen distinct first languages, namely Afrikaans; Arabic; Chinese; Croatian; Dutch; French; German; Italian; Malay; Malayalam; Mandarin; Portuguese; Romanian; Russian; Spanish; Swedish; and Turkish. Method. A survey preceded and informed the 10 individual semi-structured interviews. An exploratory sequential, mixed methodological approach was used to develop an understanding of the main themes related to what NNES online doctoral students do with written feedback. Findings. This study focuses on the intersection of the online modality with the language issues encountered by NNES online doctoral students as opposed to campus-based NNES doctoral students or NES online doctoral students. The focus of this study is not a comparison between campus-based and online NNES and NES students but is intended to reflect upon issues that will promote the use of written feedback to improve the NNES online doctoral students learning experience. This study found that while NNES online doctoral students share many of the experiences of NNES campus-based students and NES online doctoral students, the combination of online and language issues compound the NNES online doctoral students’ ability to make good use of the written feedback that they receive. This combination of online and NNES has significant implications for policy, institutional guidance and practice.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the precollege and college level factors that moderate {{the relationship between}} language background and college cognitive gains for <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> students. I focused on three college cognitive outcomes, including critical thinking, need for cognition, and positive attitude toward literacy. Because there is limited research {{on the relationship between}} language background and college cognitive growth, I first examined the effects of being a NNES student on college cognitive outcomes. Next, I {{explored the}} mediating effects of three sets of influences on the relationship between NNES status and college cognitive outcomes, including students’ precollege characteristics and background, college-level academic and non-academic experiences, and institutional characteristics. Data of this study was from the Wabash National Study of Liberal Arts Education (WNSLAE) – a longitudinal study investigating the effects of college experiences on student cognitive and personal outcomes theoretically associated with a liberal arts education. The final sample had a total of 4, 304 students, including 4, 063 native English speaking students (NES) and 241 non-native English speaking students. Because this study examined NNES students’ cognitive outcomes and was focused on student level rather than institutional level differences, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was used for analyses. Results of this study suggested that NNES students demonstrated significantly fewer gains in critical thinking and positive attitude toward literacy than their native English speaking peers after controlling a variety of confounding variables. Moreover, the relationship between students’ native language status and critical thinking as well as need for cognition was conditional on precollege and college level influences. This study makes three important contributions to existing literature. Firstly, this study is among the first, if not the first, that examines the cognitive gains of NNES students during college using a pretest-posttest design. It adds to the growing body of literature that highlights the effects of student characteristics on college experiences and outcomes and expands our understanding of the role of language background in college student development. Secondly, this study provides empirical evidence on the effects of language background on college cognitive growth using a multi-institution longitudinal data and a pretest-posttest design. It estimates students’ cognitive gains during college through controlling the precollege level of cognitive scores besides a variety of confounding variables. Thirdly, results of this study provides valuable practical insights. This study is a significant addition to the literature that explores the college cognitive growth of underrepresented student groups. As the American society continues to become more diverse in many aspects, implications of this study are helpful for educators and researchers to achieve educational excellence for all students...|$|E

The study also aimed to determine the extent to which the 2 ̆ 2 native speaker fallacy 2 ̆ 2 [...] the preference for anything related to native speakers over anything related to non-native speakers [...] was evident in these perceptions, particularly in tutoring strategies, difficulties in tutoring, and tutoring competence. The researcher collected data for the study from pre- and post-session interviews of both types of tutors and cross-analyzed coded patterns from this data with patterns found in pre- and post-session interviews of both types of tutees and with the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s observations of the participants 2 ̆ 7 sessions. According to the research results, both tutors 2 ̆ 7 and tutees 2 ̆ 7 perceptions as expressed in their interviews were more affected by the tutors 2 ̆ 7 status, NES versus NNES, than by specific qualifications of the tutors to assist tutees, with the responses revealing the participants 2 ̆ 7 assumption of native speakers 2 ̆ 7 superiority. Despite cross-analyzed findings that NNES tutors were perceived as more able to explain the causes of error, findings also revealed NES tutors 2 ̆ 7 confidence in their NES status as compensating for their lack of grammar knowledge and NNES tutors 2 ̆ 7 perception of themselves as inferior and needing to compensate for their non-NES status through teacher-like directness in assistance offered. Also, despite tutees 2 ̆ 7 expressed appreciation for NNES tutors 2 ̆ 7 explanations of errors, tutees still expressed a preference for NES tutors and applied a double standard, with NNES tutors seen as effective only if proved to be good writers and NES tutors assumed to be effective by virtue of their native speaker status. Drawing upon findings suggesting the influence of the native speaker fallacy on the participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions, the researcher concludes by discussing the significance of this study for identifying possible university initiatives to enhance appreciation of diverse cultures and for suggesting that although intrinsic knowledge of language seems preferred over learned knowledge, possessing both types of knowledge and the flexibility to employ more fluid roles as both peer and teacher would seem to equip tutors for more productive sessions...|$|E

The general research question is: In what ways does participation in service-learning impact student learning?

If so, how? (2) Do native and <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> students respond to service-learning similarly? Why or why not? (3) Are native and <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> students affected by service-learning similarly? Why or why not? (4) What other factors [...] such as learning style, previous experience with community service, and career goals [...] impact service-learning outcomes? (5) Does service-learning lead to improved student writing? If so, in what ways? The study consists of treatment and comparison groups of native and <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> students, {{for a total of}} four classes in the case study. Critical pedagogy, complexity theory, teacher research, experiential and service-learning theories provide the main theoretical rationales for the study. Data collection involved surveys, student interviews, participant observations, analysis of students' journal and essay writing, and course evaluations. Douglas Biber's (1988) multifeature/multidimensional approach to textual analysis was used, along with holistic and primary trait analyses of student texts to determine what, if any, impact service-learning had on the student's writing performance. The initial results document cognitive, sociocultural, and affective factors that contribute to the writing performance of linguistically and culturally diverse learners. Service-learning had a positive impact on participants' self-perception as members of the local community and on their personal agency in promoting social change. ESL students were especially enthusiastic about improved cross-cultural understanding and oral communication skills {{as a result of their}} community service.

40|$|Drawing on Vygotskian sociocultural theory, {{particularly}} genetic {{method and}} activity theory, {{and using a}} qualitative case study design, the present study explored the professional experiences of three preservice English as an additional language (EAL) teachers in secondary schools in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, it sought to understand the preservice teachers as learners of EAL teaching, {{the context of the}} EAL professional experiences, and the preservice teachers’ activity of learning to teach EAL in relation to personal and contextual factors. The study was conducted at Greystone University and its three partnership secondary schools in Victoria, including Redwood Secondary College, Greenfern Secondary College and Bluerock Grammar School. Research participants included three preservice teachers of the Graduate Diploma of Education program at Greystone, three mentor teachers working at the partnership schools, and two academics working at the university. Data were collected through interviews, stimulated recalls, the preservice teachers’ self-reflections, and analysis of documents, lesson plans, audio-recorded lessons, and teaching materials. Qualitative content analysis was conducted with the support of NVivo 10 software. A joint activity system of preservice EAL teaching and mentoring was constructed for each preservice teacher/mentor teacher pair {{based on the results of}} qualitative content analysis, and this served as a unit of analysis. The study found that the preservice teachers brought a range of personal factors to the professional experiences and these developed in interaction with various contextual factors inherent in the practicum settings in shaping their professional experiences. Major personal factors included prior beliefs, educational experience, teaching experience, <b>non-native</b> <b>English</b> <b>speaking</b> (<b>NNES)</b> background, professional identity, emotions, and other personal factors. Influential contextual factors included policies, curriculum, rules, tools, division of labour, interactions with mentor teachers, learners, and other community members. Data analysis also shows instances of professional development as a result of the interaction between the persons of the preservice teachers as learners of teaching, the context of learning to teach, and the activity of learning to teach. All the three preservice teachers developed their professional identity as an important part of their professional socialisation process. Each participant also demonstrated areas of developing EAL teaching expertise through appropriation of mediating tools. The findings support the view that contextual and personal factors are crucial for understanding preservice teachers’ professional learning during the school-based professional experience and extend the literature on the Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) professional experience by providing comprehensive and systematic insights into preservice school-based EAL teaching. Together with theoretical and research contributions, the study has a number of implications for EAL teacher education practices in terms of developing the knowledge base for EAL teaching and an effective model of professional experience for EAL preservice teachers...|$|E
