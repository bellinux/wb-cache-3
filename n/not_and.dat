5|$|Ain't {{has several}} antecedents in English, {{corresponding}} to {{the various forms of}} to be <b>not</b> <b>and</b> to have not that ain't contracts. The development of ain't for to be <b>not</b> <b>and</b> to have not is a diachronic coincidence; in other words, they were independent developments at different times.|$|E
5|$|Ain't is a {{contraction}} for am not, is not, are not, has <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> {{have not}} in the common English language vernacular. In some dialects ain't is also used as a contraction of do not, does <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> did not. The development of ain't for {{the various forms of}} to be not, to have <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> to do not occurred independently, at different times. The usage of ain't for the forms of to be not was established by the mid-18th century, and for the forms of to have not by the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|All {{efforts to}} extend the church beyond Kent {{encountered}} difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps {{at the urging of}} Æthelberht, but his kingdom was <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> Rædwald seems to have converted only to the extent of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. It proved impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.|$|E

5|$|Also, {{depending}} {{on the model of}} the roller coaster, the track size can vary.

5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British.

5|$|An't for is not {{may have}} {{developed}} independently from its use for am <b>not</b> <b>and</b> are not. Isn't was sometimes written as in't or en't, {{which could have}} changed into an't.

Jonathan Swift used an't to mean is not in Letter 19 of his Journal to Stella (1710–13): It an't my fault, 'tis Patrick's fault; pray now don't blame Presto.|$|E
5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German {{authorities}} {{had intended to}} put the 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could <b>not</b> <b>and</b> would not participate in war production.

The Amis, Saisiat, Tao and Kavalan are all traditionally Eastern Plains cultures. The distinction between Pingpu and Gaoshan people continues to affect Taiwan's policies regarding indigenous peoples, and their ability to participate effectively in government.|$|E

The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-154M, with registration RA-85621, serial number 86A 742 and date of manufacture 14 January 1987. The flight consisted of a crew of eleven, including a cockpit crew of four (two aircraft pilots, one engineer and one navigator), a cabin crew of five and two technicians.

40|$|The CCR 4 -NOT complex (1 mDa in size), {{consisting}} of the proteins CCR 4, CAF 1, <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> 1 to NOT 5, regulates gene expression both positively and negatively and is distinct from other large transcriptional complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae such as SNF/SWI, TFIID, SAGA, and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. The physical and genetic interactions between {{the components of the}} CCR 4 -NOT complex were investigated in order to gain insight into how this complex affects the expression of diverse genes and processes. The CAF 1 protein was found to be absolutely required for CCR 4 association with the <b>NOT</b> proteins, <b>and</b> CCR 4 and CAF 1, in turn, physically interacted with NOT 1 through its central amino acid region from positions 667 to 1152. The NOT 3, <b>NOT</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> 5 proteins had no significant effect on the association of CCR 4, CAF 1, <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> 1 with each other. In contrast, the NOT 2, <b>NOT</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> 5 interacted with the C-terminal region (residues 1490 to 2108) of NOT 1 in which <b>NOT</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> 5 physically associated in the absence of CAF 1, <b>NOT</b> 3, <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> 4. These <b>and</b> other data indicate that the physical ordering of these proteins in the complex is CCR 4 -CAF 1 -NOT 1 -(NOT 2, NOT 5), with <b>NOT</b> 4 <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> 3 more peripheral to <b>NOT</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>NOT</b> 5. The physical separation of CCR 4 and CAF 1 from other components of the CCR 4 -NOT complex correlated with genetic analysis indicating partially separate functions for these two groups of proteins. ccr 4 or caf 1 deletion suppressed the increased 3 -aminotriazole resistance phenotype conferred by not mutations, resulted in opposite effects on gene expression as compared to several <b>not</b> mutations, <b>and</b> resulted in a number of synthetic phenotypes in combination with not mutations. These results define the CCR 4 -NOT complex as {{consisting of}} at least two physically and functionally separated groups of proteins...|$|R
5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split {{on whether the}} Clause {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does <b>not</b> <b>and</b> that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E
