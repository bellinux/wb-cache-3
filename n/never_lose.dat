5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will <b>never</b> <b>lose</b> a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E

25|$|In the 2014–15 Big Bash League season final, Maddinson's Sydney Sixers {{lost to the}} Perth Scorchers on {{the final}} ball. Maddinson contributed to his side's total with the bat with a handy 19 off 22 balls with two fours. Maddison fielded the final ball with a perfect throw over the stumps only to be fumbled by the Sixers' captain Henriques, missing the {{opportunity}} to run out Arafat and compete in a super over. In the 2014/15 KFC T20 Big Bash, when Sydney Sixers captain, Moises Henriques was injured, Maddison replaced him as captain briefly. He is the only Sydney Sixers captain to <b>never</b> <b>lose</b> a match.|$|E

Among his major victories was The National Association single sculls championship in 1875 at Saratoga where he beat four competitors in the final heat, including noted rower of the day James Riley. In 1876, he won the two amateur rowing championships at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. He won the single scull championship in a time of 10 minutes and 48½ seconds on a 1-mile straightaway course. A few days later, he won the double scull championship (with partner Frank E. Yates) in a time of 9 minutes and 52½ seconds over the same distance.|$|E
25|$|So at this moment, I begin my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I <b>never</b> <b>lose</b> the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{historical}} background of Hong Kong, immigration status in Hong Kong is determined {{by a combination of}} both nationality and residence status. Therefore, even a Chinese national with the right of abode in Hong Kong has a slightly different status to a foreign national with the right of abode in Hong Kong as well (since the former can <b>never</b> <b>lose</b> the right of abode status while the latter can lose it if he does not enter Hong Kong for a period of 36 months). At the same time, a foreign national with the right of abode in Hong Kong has a preferential immigration status to a Chinese national without the right of abode in Hong Kong, as the former can remain in Hong Kong indefinitely, while the latter has to have his immigration status reassessed whenever his visa/permit expires.|$|E

25|$|During the season, Anthony made five game-winning {{shots in}} the last five seconds: at Houston on January 8, 2006; at home versus Phoenix on January 10; at Minnesota on February 24; at Indiana on March 15; at home versus the Los Angeles Lakers on April 6. All five of those game-winners were made on jump shots, while the shot against Minnesota was a three-point field goal. Anthony also made a shot in the final seconds to force {{overtime}} vs. the Dallas Mavericks on January 6. He made {{shots in the}} final 22 seconds against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 18, 2006, and the Philadelphia 76ers on March 9, which gave the Nuggets leads they would <b>never</b> <b>lose.</b> Anthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the season, alongside Phoenix' Shawn Marion, Houston's Yao Ming, Philadelphia's Allen Iverson and Washington's Gilbert Arenas.|$|E
25|$|In Season 2, skill rankings were {{assigned}} {{on a scale}} of 1 to 5000; a player was then subsequently assigned one of seven tiers tied to the skill ranking: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster. A player could enter a new tier by increasing their skill ranking. For all tiers up through Diamond, the player could <b>never</b> <b>lose</b> that tier ranking even if their skill dropped below the tier's threshold. Master and Grandmaster tiers required the player to continue to play; losing too many matches or not playing {{over a period of time}} could cause the player to fall out of that tier. End of season rewards were based on these tier rankings. Blizzard found that the method of bringing forward Season 1 skill rankings to Season 2 caused too many players of lower skill rank to be filtered into the Gold and Platinum tiers. This caused a wide distribution of player skills within these rank tiers and also caused players that started in Gold or Platinum tiers to have their skill rank drop significantly despite having even win-loss records.|$|E
25|$|For {{several months}} prior to Survivor Series, Hart and Shawn Michaels had several {{backstage}} arguments including a fight before a house show in Hartford, Connecticut (after Michaels had publicly accused Hart of {{having an affair with}} Sunny), which saw Michaels suspended for two months. After a show in San Jose, California on October 12, 1997, Hart claimed he spoke to Michaels about being professional and trusting one another in the ring. Hart allegedly said he would have no problem losing to Michaels if McMahon requested. Hart also claimed that when Michaels replied that he would <b>never</b> <b>lose</b> to Hart, Bret was shocked and became angry. This led to Hart's outright refusal to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Michaels at the pay-per-view event in Montreal, although in , Hart states to McMahon that he would happily drop the belt but not in Canada. However, in his own autobiography, Michaels refuted Hart's claim, saying that he would have cleanly lost to Hart had storylines demanded so (however others, including Jim Cornette in various shoot interviews, have often refuted this saying that they knew first hand that Michaels had no intention of jobbing to Hart). Michaels also pointed out that he had lost cleanly to Hart several times in the past, most notably in the WWF's first ever ladder match at a Wrestling Challenge taping on July 21, 1992, which would subsequently be made available on multiple Coliseum/WWE Home Video releases and in the main event of Survivor Series 1992. Michaels also lost to Hart in a Steel Cage match in December 1993.|$|E

[...] Maulbetsch immediately denied the rumor, saying: [...] "I have not resigned. [...] I am aware that a faction here {{is trying to get}} me out, but I do not intend to throw up the sponge." [...] In December, pressure to fire Maulbetsch grew, and one Oklahoma newspaper observed: [...] "Coach Maulbetsch of the A. & M. football team is the object of attacks from many sides because of the rather poor showing made by his team during the past season. [...] They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role. [...] Regardless of his past record, those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever, are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who, by fair means or foul, will gather in a team that will win victories and <b>never</b> <b>lose</b> a game." [...] Ultimately, Maulbetsch resigned at the end of May 1929 as Oklahoma A's coach in football, baseball, and basketball.

Neji also remedies the estranged relations between himself {{and the members of the}} main house, resulting in his training with Hiashi and Hinata at the end of Part I. Neji is killed during the Fourth Great Ninja War as he sacrifices himself to protect Naruto and Hinata from Obito Uchiha's attack, telling Naruto that he made the choice to die protecting those dear to him as his father had. Following the war's conclusion, a memorial is held in Neji's honor.

500|$|In the mid-1830s, Lieutenant Governor Francis Bond Head {{devised a}} plan to {{relocate}} the Ojibwa of the Credit River, along with other Indian bands of southern Upper Canada, to Manitoulin Island. [...] Bond Head believed that the Indians needed to be removed completely from {{the influence of the}} white settlers of Upper Canada. [...] Jones, allied with Sir Augustus Frederick D’Este and Dr Thomas Hodgkin of the Aborigines' Protection Society in Britain, opposed the move. [...] They knew the poor soil of Manitoulin Island would force the Indian Bands to abandon farming and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. [...] After the surrender of the Saugeen tract, protected by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, Jones became convinced the only way to end the perpetual threat of relocation of the Mississaugas was to obtain title deeds to their lands. [...] Jones travelled to England in 1837 to petition the Colonial Office directly on the issue. [...] He was accompanied by his wife and their niece Catherine Sunegoo. [...] The Colonial Secretary Lord Glenelg postponed meeting with Jones until the spring of 1838, as he was occupied with the Rebellions of 1837. [...] In the meantime, Glenelg refused to approve Bond Head's proposal. [...] Jones spent the intervening time touring England, preaching, giving speeches and fundraising for the Canadian Methodists. [...] Although Bond Head had sent a letter to Glenelg to discredit Jones, the Minister met with Jones in the spring of 1838. [...] The meeting went very well for Jones, as Glenelg promised to help secure title deeds for the Mississaugas. Glenelg also arranged an audience with Queen Victoria for Jones. [...] Jones met with her in September of that year, and presented a petition to Queen Victoria from the chiefs of the Mississauga Ojibwa community asking for title deeds to their lands, to ensure the Credit Mississaugas would <b>never</b> <b>lose</b> the title to their lands. [...] The petition was written in the Latin script, signed by the chiefs in pictographs and accompanied by wampum supplementing the information of the petition. [...] Jones, dressed in his Ojibwa regalia, presented the petition and interpreted it for Victoria, to ensure accurate and favourable reception. [...] Victoria approved her minister's recommendation that the Mississaugas be given title deeds. [...] He returned to Upper Canada shortly thereafter.|$|E
