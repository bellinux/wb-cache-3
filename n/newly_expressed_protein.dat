40|$|Premarket, genetically {{modified}} (GM) plants are assessed for potential risks of food allergy. The major risk would be transfer {{of a gene}} encoding an allergen or protein nearly identical to an allergen into a different food source, which can be assessed by specific serum testing. The potential that a <b>newly</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>protein</b> might become an allergen is evaluated based on resistance to digestion in pepsin and abundance in food fractions. If the modified plant is a common allergenic source (e. g. soybean), regulatory guidelines suggest testing for increases in the expression of endogenous allergens. Some regulators request evaluating endogenous allergens for rarely allergenic plants (e. g. maize and rice). Since allergic individuals must avoid foods containing their allergen (e. g. peanut, soybean, maize, or rice), {{the relevance of the}} tests is unclear. Furthermore, no acceptance criteria are established and {{little is known about the}} natural variation in allergen concentrations in these crops. Our results demonstrate a 15 -fold difference in the major maize allergen, lipid transfer protein between nine varieties, and complex variation in IgE binding to various soybean varieties. We question the value of evaluating endogenous allergens in GM plants unless the intent of the modification was production of a hypoallergenic crop...|$|E
40|$|The main {{concerns}} about {{adverse effects of}} genetically modified (GM) foods on health are the transfer of antibiotic resistance, toxicity and allergenicity. There are two issues from an allergic standpoint. First, the transfer of a known allergen may occur from a crop into a non-allergenic target crop. The second scenario {{is the creation of}} a neo-allergen where de novo sensitisation occurs in the population. The first scenario occurred in 1996 when the 2 S albumen protein from Brazil nut was transferred into soy bean (N. Engl. J. Med. 334 (1996) 688). 2 S albumen was found to be a major Brazil nut allergen and the <b>newly</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>protein</b> in transgenic soy retained its allergenicity. Patients allergic to Brazil nuts and not to soy bean now showed an IgE mediated response towards GM soy bean. We argue {{that it is possible to}} prevent such occurrences by doing IgE-binding studies and taking into account physico-chemical characteristics of proteins and referring to known allergen databases. The second possible scenario of de novo sensitisation does not easily lend itself to risk assessment. We compare GM technology to traditional plant breeding and food processing methods. There is no evidence that the technology used for the production of GM foods poses an allergic threat per se compared to other methodologies widely accepted in the food industry. We need to proceed cautiously in the future, assessing individual GM foods on the basis of their individual merits and risks prior to introducing them into the market. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The weight-of-evidence, case-by-case {{approach}} {{is considered the}} most appropriate way of assessing the allergenicity of genetically modified (GM) food and feed. This scientific opinion discusses various aspects to increase the strength and accuracy of this approach, including the latest developments pertaining to clinical aspects of allergic reactions, structural aspects of GM food and feed and in silico approaches, as well as IgE binding studies and cell-based methods, profiling techniques and animal models. In this context, conclusions and recommendations are provided to update and complement current risk assessment strategies for the allergenicity assessment of <b>newly</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>protein(s)</b> and whole GM food and feed. In summary, {{it is recommended that}} with regard to the search for sequence homology and structural similarities, the local alignment method with a known allergen with a threshold of 35 % sequence identity over a window of at least 80 amino acids is considered a minimal requirement. When IgE binding tests are considered necessary, e. g. when there is sequence homology and/or structure similarity with known allergens, the use of individual sera from allergic individuals rather than pooled sera is recommended. In addition to the pepsin resistance test, it is recommended that the resistance to digestion of the <b>newly</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins</b> is evaluated using other in vitro digestibility tests mimicking physiological conditions of humans. Finally, when the recipient of the introduced gene is allergenic, in order to compare the allergenicty of the whole GM plant with that of its appropriate comparator(s), it is recommended that relevant characterised endogenous allergens are included in the comparative compositional analysis of the GM plant and its appropriate comparator(s).

Moreover, the determination of genetic identity allows for segregation and traceability (identity preservation) throughout the supply chain of GM crops that have been enhanced with value-added quality traits. Prerequisites for GMO detection include a minimum amount of the target gene and prior knowledge of the type of genetic modification, such as virus or insect resistance traits, including controlling elements (promoters and terminators).

40|$|AbstractGenetically {{modified}} (GM) crops {{may contain}} <b>newly</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins</b> that {{are described as}} “intractable”. Safety assessment of these proteins may require some adaptations to the current assessment procedures. Intractable proteins are defined here as those proteins with properties that make it extremely difficult or impossible with current methods to express in heterologous systems; isolate, purify, or concentrate; quantify (due to low levels); demonstrate biological activity; or prove equivalency with plant proteins. Five classes of intractable proteins are discussed here: (1) membrane proteins, (2) signaling proteins, (3) transcription factors, (4) N-glycosylated proteins, and (5) resistance proteins (R-proteins, plant pathogen recognition proteins that activate innate immune responses). While the basic tiered weight-of-evidence approach for assessing the safety of GM crops proposed by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in 2008 is applicable to intractable proteins, new or modified methods may be required. For example, the first two steps in Tier I (hazard identification) analysis, gathering of applicable history of safe use (HOSU) information and bioinformatics analysis, do not require protein isolation. The extremely low level of expression of most intractable proteins {{should be taken into}} account while assessing safety of the intractable protein in GM crops. If Tier II (hazard characterization) analyses requiring animal feeding are judged to be necessary, alternatives to feeding high doses of pure protein may be needed. These alternatives are discussed here...|$|R

The assessment focuses on evaluation of the potential allergenicity of the <b>newly</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>protein(s)</b> as the primary potential risk using a process that markedly limits risks to allergic consumers. However, Codex also recommended evaluating a second concern, potential increases in endogenous allergens of commonly allergenic food crops that might occur due to insertion of the gene. Unfortunately, potential risks and natural variation of endogenous allergens in non-GE varieties are not understood, and risks from increases have not been demonstrated. Because regulatory approvals in some countries are delayed due to increasing demands for measuring endogenous allergens, we present a review of the potential risks of food allergy, risk management for food allergy, and test methods that may be used in these evaluations. We also present new data from our laboratory studies on the variation of the allergenic lipid transfer protein in non-GE maize hybrids as well as data from two studies of endogenous allergen comparisons for three GE soybean lines, their nearest genetic soy lines, and other commercial lines. We conclude that scientifically based limits of acceptable variation cannot been established without an understanding of natural variation in non-GE crops. Furthermore, the risks from increased allergen expression are minimal as the risk management strategy for food allergy is for allergic individuals to avoid consuming any food containing their allergenic source, regardless of the crop variety...|$|R

The investigation revealed growth inhibitory potential of immunoglobulin G in a dose dependent manner supported by scanning electron microscopic studies. The N-glycan enriched fraction of immunoglobulin G after PNGase treatment was found more effective, comparable to ampicillin than native immunoglobulin G supporting the fact that colostrum derived oligosaccharides is crucial and act as ideal substrates for undesirable and pathogenic bacteria. The MALDI TOF/TOF analysis confirmed the glycostructures of abundant N-glycans of immunoglobulin G exerting antibacterial activity.

40|$|Evaluation of the {{potential}} risks of food allergy presented by any new GM crop {{is an important part}} of the regulatory review process required by most countries. To manage food safety, developers should ensure that they have avoided introducing a known allergen and potentially cross-reacting proteins, as well as have eliminated the risk that the recombinant protein becomes a de novo allergen. However, no studies have addressed the matrix effects between recipient crops and the gene donor organisms on {{the potential}} risk of allergenicity of the <b>newly</b> <b>expressed</b> <b>proteins</b> in GM crops. The overall goal of this dissertation is to investigate potential differences in matrix effects on the newly introduced protein by developing two model transgenic soybeans encoding major peanut allergens, Ara h 2 or Ara h 6. The 2 S albumins of peanut were chosen as model transgenic proteins because peanut is one of the most important sources of food allergy in most geographical regions and these proteins are dominant allergens. Additionally, although soybeans and peanuts are both legumes and have overall similar food component characteristics, there are marked differences in the strength of food allergic reactions. Development of these GM soybean lines includes characterization of the recombinant proteins and ultimately they can be used for comparison of allergenicity with peanut and non-GM soybean. ^ The first step in this evaluation required the development of two transgenic soybean lines using Agrobacterium mediated transformation. The second aim was to purify gram-level Ara h 2 from peanut and characterize it. The third aim was to purify and characterize recombinant Ara h 2 (rAra h 2) expressed in the GM soybean for use in comparisons with the natural Ara h 2 (nAra h 2) from peanut. ^ A different post-translational proteolysis was revealed existing between soybean and peanut. However, the circular dichroism measurement demonstrated rAra h 2 and nAra h 2 shared very similar secondary and tertiary structures. This result indicates although different matrix effects might exist between recipient crops and gene donor organisms, there is little possibility to introduce an increased risk of allergenicity of recombinant proteins in this developed model of GM crops. ...|$|R
