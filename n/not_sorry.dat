5|$|Alan Eagleson was not repentant for {{his actions}} during game eight. Eagleson {{was not the only}} one jostled by police; Eagleson's wife and the Canadian ambassador's wife were also jostled. Eagleson woke up with bruises from his treatment. Eagleson was <b>not</b> <b>sorry,</b> but he regretted the {{incident}} and planned to not get involved in further series. He did get a letter of support from Robert Ford, the ambassador, who basically agreed with Eagleson's actions. Mail and messages about the incident was mostly in favour of Eagleson. According to Ted Blackman, Canadian fans were basically understanding of Team Canada's actions as being provoked while the team was under duress.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} states of afterlife in Catholic belief. Heaven {{is a time}} of glorious union with God and a life of unspeakable joy that lasts forever. Purgatory is a {{temporary}} place for the purification of souls who, although saved, are not free enough from sin to enter directly into heaven. It is a state requiring penance and purgation of sin through God's mercy aided by the prayers of others. Finally, those who freely chose a life of sin and selfishness, were <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> for their sins and had no intention of changing their ways go to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without freely deciding to reject God and his love. He predestines no one to hell and no one can determine whether anyone else has been condemned. Catholicism teaches that God's mercy is such that a person can repent even at the point of death and be saved, like the good thief who was crucified next to Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Sherman {{was able}} to {{concentrate}} his army faster than Beauregard had anticipated and arrived at Columbia {{on the afternoon of}} February 16. The only Confederates defending the city were small detachments from Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry corps, Maj. Gen. Matthew Butler's cavalry division, and Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee's corps from the Army of Tennessee. Heavily outnumbered, Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton ordered an evacuation of the city without a fight, although they destroyed all bridges over the Congaree and Saluda Rivers in an attempt to delay the Union forces. Sherman occupied Columbia the following day. Much of Columbia burned to the ground in a fire that has engendered controversy ever since: some say it started when the Confederates set fire to cotton bales in the city, others say that drunken Union soldiers were fanning the flames of vengeance, while a few witnesses claimed that some of the fires were by accident. James W. Loewen researched the topic for his book, Lies Across America, and found that most likely, the cotton bale fires spread and caused most of the destruction. He did find that there were some fires started by Union soldiers, but the effects of these were minimal. Most likely, the Confederates' scorched earth policy was to blame for the burning of Columbia (in which not much of it burned). After the burning, Sherman was quoted as saying that he never gave the order to burn Columbia to the ground but he was <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> that it happened.|$|E

500|$|Among Bottomley's {{principal}} biographers, Hyman {{suggests that}} his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of {{wealth in the}} 1890s. [...] "Success went to his head and he started spending money like a drunken sailor and could never break the habit." [...] It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison {{as long as he}} did. Searle speculates that Bottomley was protected from prosecution because of his knowledge of wider scandals in the government, particularly after Lloyd George's coalition assumed power in 1916. Symons acknowledges Bottomley's [...] "wonderfully rich public personality" [...] but suggests that there was no substance behind the presentation: throughout his adult life, Bottomley was [...] "more a series of public attitudes than a person". Matthew Engel in The Guardian notes his ability to charm the public even while swindling them; one victim, cheated of £40,000, apparently insisted: [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> I lent him the money, and I would do it again". If London had had a mayor in those days, says Engel, Bottomley would have won in a landslide.|$|E
500|$|The film, {{distributed}} by Gainsborough Pictures, was neither a critical nor commercial success; Leonard J. Leff {{states that the}} film [...] "impressed neither the distributor nor the public". Like Hitchcock's other early films, the film was criticised {{for a lack of}} realism; an early review by Bioscope stated that [...] "in spite of skilful and at times brilliant direction, the story has an air of unreality." [...] Hitchcock himself considered The Mountain Eagle to be mundane melodrama best forgotten, and described the film to François Truffaut as [...] "awful" [...] and a [...] "very bad movie" [...] and stated that he was <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> that there are no known prints. After being bitterly disappointed with his first two films, Hitchcock believed that his directing career would soon be over, although he later described Waltzes from Vienna (1934) to be the [...] "lowest ebb" [...] of his career. Film historian J. Lary Kuhns, however, states in the book Hitchcock's Notebooks by Dan Auiler that one contemporary writer called The Mountain Eagle far superior to The Lodger. The Guardian describes the film as [...] "a ripping yarn about a dastardly father, a crippled son, a lovely schoolteacher and an innocent imprisoned".|$|E

500|$|In 1853, {{with the}} party {{increasingly}} divided over the slavery issue, Greeley printed an editorial disclaiming the paper's identity as Whig and declaring it to be nonpartisan. He was confident that the paper would not suffer financially, trusting in reader loyalty. Some in the party were <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> to see him go: the Republic, a Whig organ, mocked Greeley and his beliefs: [...] "If a party is to be built up and maintained on Fourierism, Mesmerism, Maine Liquor laws, Spiritual Rappings, Kossuthism, Socialism, Abolitionism, and forty other isms, we have no disposition to mix with any such companions." [...] When in 1854, Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas introduced his Kansas-Nebraska Bill, allowing residents of each territory to decide {{whether it would be}} slave or free, Greeley strongly fought the legislation in his newspaper. [...] After it passed, and the Border War broke out in Kansas Territory, Greeley was part of efforts to send free-state settlers there, and to arm them. In return, proponents of slavery recognized Greeley and the Tribune as adversaries, stopping shipments of the paper to the South and harassing local agents. Nevertheless, by 1858, the Tribune reached 300,000 subscribers through the weekly edition, and it would continue as the foremost American newspaper through the years of the Civil War.|$|E
500|$|The album's fourth track, [...] "Don't Stop", is {{characterized}} by a pulsating bass overlaid with strings punctuating and accompanying the riffs in sustained and glissandi gestures. The rhetoric of the track is displayed by Madonna's commands: [...] "Don't stop doin' what you're doin' baby, Don't stop, keep movin' keep groovin'". The next track [...] "Inside of Me" [...] starts with the same tempo as [...] "Don't Stop", with guitars, sustained strings, [...] "throbbing" [...] bass and jazz-y keyboards, with Madonna singing in a breathy vocal register. The singing conjures an erotic imagery as she sings on the chorus, [...] "Even though you're gone, love still carries on", however the lyrics were interpreted as both about her deceased mother, or a long-lost lover. The strings and an occasional saxophone sample makes [...] "Inside of Me" [...] a direct continuation of [...] "Erotica", with an interval where the drums drop off, exposing Madonna's vocals. On the sixth track, [...] "Human Nature", Madonna confronts chauvinism as she sings, [...] "And I'm <b>not</b> <b>sorry,</b> I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me", while telling herself in whispered tones to [...] "express yourself, don't repress yourself". Consisting of heavy bass and looping drum sounds in its four chord sequence, the song finds Madonna delivering a nasal tone reminiscent of 90s soul style. Together with [...] "Survival", the song became a vehicle for Madonna to lyrically vent off her frustrations regarding the controversies surrounding her.|$|E
2500|$|MacKenzie {{explained}} his actions in 1993. Talking to a House of Commons National Heritage Select Committee, he said: [...] "I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an MP said. It was a Tory MP. If {{he had not}} said it and the Chief Superintendent had not agreed with it, {{we would not have}} gone with it." [...] MacKenzie retracted the apology in November 2006, saying he apologised because the newspaper's owner, Rupert Murdoch, had ordered him to do so, stating: [...] "I was <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> then and I'm <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> now". MacKenzie refused to apologise when appearing on the BBC's topical Question Time on 11 January 2007.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, {{the three}} {{candidates}} opposed to Tzipi Livni in 2008 {{called for a}} primary to be held as soon as possible, citing the probability of Knesset elections soon. On 19 January 2012, Livni set the primary date for 27 March 2012. Livni lost {{by a wide margin}} (64.5% to her 35.5%) to challenger and former defense minister Shaul Mofaz. In May 2012, despite Mofaz's appeal for her to remain in the party, Livni resigned from the Knesset. She stated that although she was leaving the Knesset, she was not retiring from public life, as Israel was [...] "too dear" [...] to her. Commenting on decisions she made, which may have contributed to her loss, she stated [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> for not backing down in the face of political blackmail—even when the price was being in the government—and for not willing to sell the country to the ultra-Orthodox," [...] adding [...] "And I'm definitely <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> for the main issue I promoted.

2500|$|The July Monarchy was {{threatened}} in 1839 by Louis-Mathieu Molé, who had formed an intermediate government. Guizot {{and the leaders}} of the left centre and the left, Thiers [...] and Odilon Barrot worked together to stop Molé. Victory was secured at the expense of principle, and Guizot's attack on the government gave rise to a crisis and a republican insurrection. None of the three leaders of that alliance took ministerial office, and Guizot was <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> to accept the post of ambassador in London, which withdrew him for a time from parliamentary contests. This was in the spring of 1840, and Thiers succeeded shortly afterwards to the ministry of foreign affairs.|$|E

[...] "Despite the fact that I'm sentenced to 16 life sentences I know that we will become free from Israeli occupation and then I will also be free from the prison," [...] she said.

2500|$|Moore {{pleaded guilty}} to {{attempted}} assassination {{and was sentenced to}} life in prison. At her sentencing hearing Moore stated: [...] "Am I sorry I tried? Yes and no. Yes, because it accomplished little except to throw away the rest of my life. And, no, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> I tried, because at the time it seemed a correct expression of my anger." [...] In 1979, Moore escaped from the Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia, but was captured hours later. After her return, she was transferred to a more secure facility, and she served the remainder of her term at the federal women’s prison in Dublin, California, where she worked in the Unicor Prison Industry for $1.25 per hour as the Lead Inmate Operating Accountant. Moore had the Federal Bureau of Prisons register number 04851-180.|$|E

On December 15, 2016, Roof {{was found guilty}} of all 33 federal charges against him. For the sentencing phase of the federal trial, Roof dismissed his attorneys and insisted on representing himself. In a statement to the court at his sentencing hearing on January 4, 2017, Roof offered no apology or explanation, saying [...] "There's nothing wrong with me psychologically." [...] At the hearing, prosecutors introduced into evidence a two-page excerpt from journal written by Roof from jail six weeks his arrest, in which Roof composed a white supremacist manifesto, writing: [...] "I would like to make it crystal clear, I do not regret what I did. I am <b>not</b> <b>sorry.</b> I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The final {{building}} was considered excessively large. The Guardian described it in 1978 as [...] "an awful warning against thinking too big in Britain's cities", and [...] "so castle-like in its outer strength that any passing medieval army would automatically besiege {{it rather than}} shop in it...". The underground railway scheme was abandoned by 1976 and the only deck access was across Corporation Street to another Town &City development in the Shambles. At the official opening, one of its champions, Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw, Mayor of Manchester, commented, [...] "I didn't think {{it would look like}} that when I saw the balsa wood models". [...] The [...] "unrepentant" [...] architects responded that they had provided what they had been asked to provide. Kenneth Stone said in 1978 [...] "We're not responsible for everything in there, but we're <b>not</b> <b>sorry</b> about the decisions we took as opposed to those which were forced upon us." [...] The critics' opinion did not mellow with time, and it was described as [...] "aggressive externally" [...] in 1991. The Economist noted in 1996 that it had [...] "long been regarded as one of Europe's ugliest shopping centres.... the epitome of lousy modern architecture... was hated". The Financial Times in 1997 called it [...] "outstandingly ugly" [...] and in 2000 [...] "one of Britain's least-loved buildings".|$|E
