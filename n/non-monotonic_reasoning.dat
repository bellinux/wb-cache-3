We present ASPMT(QS), a novel approach and fully-implemented prototype for <b>non-monotonic</b> spatial <b>reasoning</b> [...] -a crucial requirement within dynamic spatial systems [...] based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT). ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Sat Modulo Theories (SMT) instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. We formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame axioms using choice formulas. Spatial reasoning is performed by encoding spatial relations as systems of polynomial constraints, and solving via SMT with the theory of real nonlinear arithmetic. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with other prominent contemporary spatial reasoning systems. Our results show that ASPMT(QS) is the only existing system that is capable of reasoning about indirect spatial effects (i. e. addressing the ramification problem), and integrating geometric and qualitative spatial information within a <b>non-monotonic</b> spatial <b>reasoning</b> context.

40|$|Among <b>non-monotonic</b> {{systems of}} <b>reasoning,</b> <b>non-monotonic</b> modal logics, and autoepistemic logic in particular, have had {{considerable}} success.

We assume in addition that there is default knowledge about the preferences over the arguments, and we use an algorithm to derive the most likely preference order. In particular, we show how to use <b>non-monotonic</b> preference <b>reasoning</b> to compute preferences among arguments, and subsequently the acceptable arguments, from preferences among values.

40|$|Ontologies {{and rules}} are usually loosely coupled in {{knowledge}} representation formalisms. In fact, ontologies use open-world reasoning while the leading semantics for rules use <b>non-monotonic,</b> closed-world <b>reasoning.</b> One {{exception is the}} tightly-coupled framework of Minimal Knowledge and Negation as Failure (MKNF), which allows statements about individuals to be jointly derived via entailment from an ontology and inferences from rules.

That work leaves open what algorithms should be used to relate the entailments of the ontology and the inferences of rules.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an architecture that com-bines the complementary strengths of probabilistic graphical models and declarative programming to represent and reason with qualitative and quantita-tive descriptions of domain knowledge and uncer-tainty. An action language {{is used for}} the architec-ture’s low-level (LL) and high-level (HL) system descriptions, and the HL definition of recorded his-tory is expanded to allow prioritized defaults. For any given objective, each action in the plan created in the HL using <b>non-monotonic</b> logical <b>reasoning</b> is executed probabilistically in the LL, refining the HL description to identify the relevant sorts, fluents and actions, and adding the corresponding action outcomes to the HL history. The HL and LL do-main representations are translated into an Answer Set Prolog (ASP) program and a partially observ-able Markov decision process (POMDP) respec-tively. ASP-based inference provides a multino-mial prior for POMDP state estimation, and pop-ulates a Beta density of priors for metareasoning and early termination. Robots equipped with this architecture reason with violation of defaults, noisy observations and unreliable actions in complex do-mains. The architecture is evaluated in simulation and on a mobile robot moving target objects to de-sired locations in an office domain. ...|$|R

The architecture described in this paper couples the <b>non-monotonic</b> logical <b>reasoning</b> capabilities of a declarative language with probabilistic belief revision, enabling robots to represent and reason with qualitative and quantitative descriptions of knowledge and degrees of belief. Specifically, incomplete domain knowledge, including information that holds in {{all but a few}} exceptional situations, is represented as a Answer Set Prolog (ASP) program.

For any given task, each action in the plan contained in the answer set is executed probabilistically. The subset of the domain relevant to the action is identified automatically, and observations extracted from sensor inputs perform incremental Bayesian updates to a belief distribution defined over this domain subset, with highly probable beliefs being committed to the ASP program.

40|$|Abstract. Description logics are a popular, {{and widely}} used, {{formalism}} for describing domain knowledge in a structured way. To {{cope with the}} vagueness of real-world knowledge, several fuzzy description logics have already been proposed. In this contribution, we argue that, rather than modelling all vagueness in a generalized description logic, {{it may be more}} natural to encode vague attributes in concrete domains [1], and to model vague predicates on the level of query processing. Although description logics (DLs) have gained much popularity during the past decade, applications using them suffer from one important drawback: the information they capture is supposed to be perfect, i. e., well-defined, unambiguous, certain, etc. However, real-world knowledge is often far from perfect; in order to accommodate such imperfections, several extensions to DLs have been proposed, including e. g. <b>non-monotonic</b> and probabilistic <b>reasoning</b> mechanisms. In particular, we focus on techniques dealing with vagueness in DLs. Fuzzy set theory is by far the best-known and most popular formalism t...|$|R
