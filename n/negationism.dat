2500|$|The {{historian}} Deborah Lipstadt ( [...] , 1993), and {{the historians}} Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman ( [...] , 2002), distinguish between historical revisionism and historical <b>negationism,</b> {{the latter of}} which is a form of denialism. Lipstadt said that Holocaust deniers, such as Harry Elmer Barnes, disingenuously self-identify as [...] "historical revisionists" [...] in order to obscure their denialism as academic revision of the historical record.|$|E
2500|$|Vidal-Naquet was a {{specialist}} {{in the study of}} Ancient Greece, but was also interested (and deeply involved) in contemporary history, particularly the Algerian War (1954–62), during which he opposed the use of torture by the French Army, as well as Jewish history. Having participated with Michel Foucault and Jean-Marie Domenach in the founding of the Groupe d'information sur les prisons (GIP), one of the first French new social movements, he criticized <b>negationism.</b> Vidal-Naquet, who never abandoned his fascination with Antiquity, was also a supporter of [...]|$|E
2500|$|At a basic level, {{historical}} revisionism is {{a common}} and not especially controversial process of developing and refining the writing of history. Much more controversial [...] is the reversal of moral findings, which the heroes, good guys, or positive forces are depicted as villains, bad guys, or negative forces. This revisionism is quickly challenged by the supporters of the old view, often in heated terms. It becomes historical <b>negationism,</b> a form of historical revisionism that presents a re-interpretation of the moral meaning of the historical record. The term [...] "revisionism" [...] is used pejoratively by people who charge that revisionists are deliberately distorting the true historical record.|$|E
2500|$|As such, Lipstadt, Shermer, and Grobman {{said that}} {{legitimate}} historical revisionism entails the refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event, not {{a denial of}} the event, itself; that such refinement of history emerges from the examination of new, empirical evidence, and a re-examination, and consequent re-interpretation of the existing documentary evidence. That legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges {{the existence of a}} [...] "certain body of irrefutable evidence" [...] and the existence of a [...] "convergence of evidence", which suggest that an event — such as the Black Death, American slavery, and the Holocaust — did occur; whereas the denialism of history rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence, which is a form of historical <b>negationism.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Under the Rwandan constitution, [...] "revisionism, <b>negationism</b> and trivialisation of genocide" [...] are {{criminal}} offences. Hundreds {{of people}} have been tried and convicted for [...] "genocide ideology", [...] "revisionism", and other laws ostensibly related to the genocide. Of the 489 individuals convicted of [...] "genocide revisionism and other related crimes" [...] in 2009, five were sentenced to life imprisonment, a further five were sentenced to more than 20 years in jail, 99 were sentenced to 10–20 years in jail, 211 received a custodial sentence of 5–10 years, and the remaining 169 received jail terms of less than five years. Amnesty International has criticized the Rwandan government for using these laws to [...] "criminalize legitimate dissent and criticism of the government." [...] In 2010, an American law professor and attorney, Peter Erlinder, was arrested in Kigali and charged with genocide denial while defending presidential candidate Victoire Ingabire against charges of genocide.|$|E
2500|$|His support [...] "à titre amical" [...] ("in {{title of}} friendship") for Roger Garaudy in 1996 brought controversy. The [...] "Garaudy Affair" [...] had been {{revealed}} in January 1996 by the Canard enchaîné satirical newspaper, which prompted {{a series of}} denunciations against his book, [...] "The Foundational Myths of Israeli Politics," [...] and led Garaudy to be charged of <b>negationism</b> (before being convicted in 1998, under the 1990 Gayssot Act). But Garaudy provoked public indignation when he announced in March that he {{was supported by the}} Abbé Pierre, who was immediately excluded from the honour committee of the LICRA (International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism). The Abbé condemned those who tried to [...] "negate, banalize or falsify the Shoah," [...] but his continued support to Garaudy as a friend was criticized by all anti-racist, Jewish organisations (MRAP, CRIF, Anti-Defamation League, etc.) and the Church hierarchy. His friend Bernard Kouchner, co-founder of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), criticized him for [...] "absolving the intolerable," [...] while Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger (and archbishop of Paris from 1981 to 2005) publicly disavowed him. The Abbé then went into retreat in the Benedictine monastery of Praglia near Padua, Italy, where, according to the Voltaire Network, he would have met again Roger Garaudy. The Voltaire Network wrote that the Abbé had declared to the Corriere della Sera that the French press was [...] "inspired by an international Zionist lobby". In the film documentary Un abbé nommé Pierre, une vie au service des autres, the Abbé declared that his support had been towards the person of Roger Garaudy, and not towards his statements in his book, which he had not read.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Negationism</b> {{means the}} denial of {{historical}} crimes against humanity. It is not a reinterpretation of known facts, but {{the denial of}} known facts. The term <b>negationism</b> has gained currency as {{the name of a}} movement to deny a specific crime against humanity, the Nazi genocide on the Jews in 1941-45, also known as the holocaust (Greek: complete burning) or the Shoah (Hebrew: disaster). <b>Negationism</b> is mostly identified with the effort at re-writing history {{in such a way that}} the fact of the Holocaust is omitted.|$|E

50|$|History {{provides}} {{insight into}} past political policies and consequences, and thus assists people in extrapolating political implications for contemporary society. Historical <b>negationism</b> {{is applied to}} cultivate a specific political myth — sometimes with official consent from the government — whereby self-taught, amateur, and dissident academic historians either manipulate or misrepresent historical accounts to achieve political ends. In the USSR (1917-91), {{the ideology of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Soviet historiography treated reality and the party line as the same intellectual entity; Soviet historical <b>negationism</b> advanced a specific, political and ideological agenda about Russia and her place in world history.|$|E

50|$|Historical <b>negationism</b> or denialism is {{an illegitimate}} {{distortion}} of the historical record. It is often imprecisely referred to as historical revisionism, but that term also denotes a legitimate academic pursuit of re-interpretation of the historical record and questioning the accepted views.|$|E
5000|$|Historical <b>negationism</b> {{applies the}} {{techniques}} of research, quotation, and presentation for deception of the reader and denial of the historical record. In support of the [...] "revised history" [...] perspective, the negationist historian uses false documents as genuine sources, presents specious reasons to distrust genuine documents, exploits published opinions, by quoting out of historical context, manipulates statistics, and mistranslates texts in other languages. The revision techniques of historical <b>negationism</b> operate in the intellectual space of public debate {{for the advancement of}} a given interpretation of history and the cultural-perspective of the [...] "revised history". As a document, the revised history is used to negate the validity of the factual, documentary record, and so reframe explanations and perceptions of the discussed historical event, in order to deceive the reader, the listener, and the viewer; therefore, historical <b>negationism</b> functions as a technique of propaganda. Rather than submit their works for peer review, negationist historians rewrite history and use logical fallacies to construct arguments that will obtain the desired results, a [...] "revised history" [...] that supports an agenda — political, ideological, religious, etc. In the practice of historiography, the British historian Richard J. Evans describes the technical differences, between professional historians and negationist historians: ...|$|E

5000|$|Along {{the same}} lines, Lipstadt has criticized the German philosopher and {{historian}} Ernst Nolte {{for engaging in}} what she calls [...] "soft-core denial" [...] of the Holocaust, arguing that Nolte practises an even more dangerous form of <b>negationism</b> than the Holocaust-deniers.

50|$|The {{historical}} <b>negationism</b> of American Civil War revisionists and Neo-Confederates {{claims that}} the Confederate States (1861-65) were the defenders rather than the instigators of the war, and that the Confederacy's motivation for secession from the United States was {{the maintenance of the}} southern states' rights and limited government, rather than the preservation and expansion of the chattel slavery of African Americans.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "negationism" [...] (négationnisme) {{was first}} coined by the French {{historian}} Henry Rousso in his 1987 book The Vichy Syndrome which {{looked at the}} French popular memory of Vichy France and the French Resistance. Rousso {{argued that it was}} necessary to distinguish between legitimate historical revisionism in Holocaust studies and politically-motivated denial of the Holocaust, which he termed <b>negationism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1979 Pierre Guillaume {{approached}} Gérard Lebovici with {{a proposal}} to publish the Holocaust denial text Le Mensonge d'Ulysse by Paul Rassinier. Lebovici refused, so in 1980 Guillaume relaunched La Vieille Taupe as a negationist publishing house. Rassiner's book was the first published. Many of Guillaume's former associates deplore his reuse of the name for a purpose they regard as completely at odds with their former involvement. Some also regard Guillaume's suggestion that Guy Debord was a secret negationist as obscene. Some people view ultra-left <b>negationism</b> {{as evidence that the}} ultra-left and ultra-right are very similar - the meeting of the extremes. However most ultra left activists would distance themselves from all forms of <b>negationism,</b> and regard Guillaume's more recent development as a sad decline. Guillaume sees La Vieille Taupe as a genuine ultra left venture which concentrates on [...] "exposing the lies of the capitalist victors of the Second World War", even if {{most of the people who}} listen to him are from the far-right.|$|E
50|$|Critics name {{concerns}} {{on media}} manipulation and censorship like political censorship or denialism.There are accusations that embedded journalism is military {{manipulation of the}} media. There are accusations of <b>negationism</b> in public education and education resources. Throughout history propaganda {{has been used for}} gaining political capital and political support, like Nazi propaganda, United States of America hegemonic propaganda or Communist propaganda. There are also criticisms of monuments and statues supporting various ideologies through political symbolism, such as Nazi architecture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{protagonist of}} the story, Winston Smith, {{is an editor}} in the Ministry of Truth, {{responsible}} for effecting the continual historical revisionism that will negate the contradictions of the past upon the contemporary world of Oceania.To cope with the psychological stresses of life during wartime, Smith begins a diary, in which he observes that [...] "He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future", and so illustrates the principal, ideological purpose of historical <b>negationism.</b>|$|E
50|$|There was {{a strong}} {{governmental}} control over radio and television in the 1950-70s. Today, the CSA is only charged of surveillance of the respect of French law in the media, in particular concerning the 1990 Gayssot Act which prohibits racist or/and religious hate speech (under which <b>negationism,</b> in particular but not only Holocaust denial falls under), and time period allocated to each political party during pre-electoral periods. Furthermore, other laws prohibit homophobic hate speech, and a 1970 law prohibits the advocacy of illegal drugs.|$|E
5000|$|Christina Hoff Sommers {{has been}} a vocal critic {{of the concept of}} herstory, and {{presented}} her argument against the movement in her 1994 book, Who Stole Feminism? Sommers defined herstory as an attempt to infuse education with ideology, at the expense of knowledge. The [...] "gender feminists", as she termed them, were the band of feminists responsible for the movement, which she felt amounted to <b>negationism.</b> She regarded most attempts to make historical studies more female-inclusive as being artificial in nature, and an impediment to progress.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Israel Charny, a Genocide {{scholar and}} {{executive}} director of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide in Jerusalem wrote that Bernard Lewis' [...] "seemingly scholarly concern ... of Armenians constituting a threat to the Turks as a rebellious force who together with the Russians threatened the Ottoman Empire, and the insistence that only a policy of deportations was executed, barely conceal the fact that the organized deportations constituted systematic mass murder".
