25|$|Since boxing {{involves}} forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must {{be taken}} to prevent damage to bones in the hand. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without wrist wraps and boxing gloves. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not utilise them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves {{to be used in the}} bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and <b>no</b> <b>tampering</b> has taken place.|$|E
2500|$|In Quebec City, several ballot boxes {{containing}} {{votes from}} advance polls disappeared after {{the close of}} advance polling on October 7.

2500|$|The {{scientific}} method seeks to objectively explain {{the events of}} nature in a reproducible way. An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as [...] "Occam's Razor") and are generally expected to seek consilience—fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena. This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that <b>no</b> <b>tampering</b> has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress. This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might {{take the place of}} a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).|$|E

30|$|To detect if {{a picture}} region is lost or tampered, the {{extracted}} watermark is {{compared with the}} corresponding “host” content. For tampering detection, we extract the watermark and compute its inverse halftoning version. By computing the structural similarity (SSIM) between blocks of inverse halftoning and host content, {{it is expected that}} SSIM is higher for blocks where there are <b>no</b> <b>tampers.</b> On the other hand, if the image is tampered, the structural similarity between host and restored blocks are lower. For error concealment, the position of the lost areas are identified by the decoder and the damaged areas are substituted by the recovered watermark after an inverse halftoning process.|$|R
2500|$|In early December 2008, Seattle Sounders FC {{reportedly}} {{offered a}} coaching contract to Sigi Schmid, {{who led the}} Los Angeles Galaxy to a MLS Cup in 2002 and the Columbus Crew to a MLS Cup in 2008.

The Crew's ownership complained that Schmid had communicated with Sounders FC during the 2008 season, despite being denied permission to do so, and that he shared confidential information with Sounders FC after leaving the Crew. The MLS ruled that <b>no</b> <b>tampering</b> occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew before signing Schmid.

60|$|He was {{no doubt}} stirred by other {{political}} motives less praiseworthy, though submitted to {{in accordance with the}} practice and the known usages of Rome. He had undertaken to speak for Catiline when Catiline was accused of corruption on his return from Africa, knowing that Catiline had been guilty. He did not do so; but the intention, for our present purpose, {{is the same as the}} doing. To have defended Catiline would have assisted him in his operations as a candidate for the Consulship. Catiline was a bad subject for a defence--as was Fonteius, whom he certainly did defend--and Catiline was a democrat. But Cicero, had he defended Catiline, would not have done so as holding out his hand to democracy. Cicero, when, in the Pro Lege Manilia, he for the first time addressed the people, certainly spoke in opposition to the wishes of the Senate in proposing that Pompey should have the command of the Mithridatic war; but his views were not democratic. It has been said that this was done because Pompey could help him to the Consulship. To me it seems that he had already declared to himself that among leading men in Rome Pompey was the one to whom the Republic would look with the most security as a bulwark, and that on that account he had resolved to bind himself to Pompey in some political marriage. Be that as it may, there was <b>no</b> <b>tampering</b> with democracy in the speech Pro Lege Manilia. Of all the extant orations made by him before his Consulship, the attentive reader will sympathize the least with that of Fonteius. After his scathing onslaught on Verres for provincial plunder, he defended the plunderer of the Gauls, and held up the suffering allies of Rome to ridicule as being hardly entitled to good government. This he did simply as an advocate, without political motive of any kind--in the days in which he was supposed to be currying favor with democracy--governed by private friendship, looking forward, probably, to some friendly office in return, as was customary. It was thus that afterward he defended Antony, his colleague in the Consulship, whom he knew to have been a corrupt governor. Autronius had been a party to Catiline's conspiracy, and Autronius had been Cicero's school-fellow; but Cicero, for some reserved reason with which we are not acquainted, refused to plead for Autronius. There is, I maintain, no ground for suggesting that Cicero had shown by his speeches before his Consulship any party adherence. The declaration which he made after his Consulship, in the speech for Sulla, that up to the time of Catiline's first conspiracy forensic duties had not allowed him to devote himself to party politics, is entitled to belief: we know, indeed, that it was so. As Quæstor, as Ædile, and as Prætor, he did not interfere in the political questions of Rome, except in demanding justice from judges and purity from governors. When he became Consul then he became a politician, and after that there was certainly no vacillation in his views. Critics say that he surrendered himself to Cæsar when Cæsar became master. We shall come to that hereafter; but the accusation with which I am dealing now is that which charges him with having abandoned the democratic memories of his youth as soon as he had enveloped himself with the consular purple. There had been no democratic promises, and there was no change when he became Consul.|$|E

40|$|Digital medical {{images are}} {{very easy to}} be {{modified}} for illegal purposes. For example, microcalcification in mammography is an important diagnostic clue, {{and it can be}} wiped off intentionally for insurance purposes or added intentionally into a normal mammography. In this paper, we proposed two methods to tamper detection and recovery for a medical image. A 1024 [*]×[*] 1024 x-ray mammogram was chosen to test the ability of tamper detection and recovery. At first, a medical image is divided into several blocks. For each block, an adaptive robust digital watermarking method combined with the modulo operation is used to hide both the authentication message and the recovery information. In the first method, each block is embedded with the authentication message and the recovery information of other blocks. Because the recovered block is too small and excessively compressed, the concept of region of interest (ROI) is introduced into the second method. If there are <b>no</b> <b>tampered</b> blocks, the original image can be obtained with only the stego image. When the ROI, such as microcalcification in mammography, is tampered with, an approximate image will be obtained from other blocks. From the experimental results, the proposed near-lossless method is proven to effectively detect a tampered medical image and recover the original ROI image. In this study, an adaptive robust digital watermarking method combined with the operation of modulo 256 was chosen to achieve information hiding and image authentication. With the proposal method, any random changes on the stego image will be detected in high probability...|$|R
