50|$|The main {{breeding}} period occurs from August to January, {{with most}} eggs being laid in September and October. The stick nest is built {{high in a}} tree, usually a eucalypt, however other locations such as power pylons and tall buildings are occasionally chosen. Two to four eggs are laid which the female incubates for roughly twenty days and then is assisted by the male in rearing the chicks for around forty days until they leave the nest. Young Torresian crows then stay with their parents for several months after fledging, before joining the <b>nomadic</b> <b>flock.</b> Torresian crows aggressively defend their nest from goannas, snakes and birds of prey with aggressive dive-bombs. Dogs, cats and humans are also occasionally swooped in nest defence, however not nearly as aggressively as notorious species such as Australian magpies and masked lapwings.|$|E
50|$|Like other corvids, Torresian crows are {{intelligent}} and adaptable {{and have been}} known to steal food from larger birds by working in teams, and to feed on poisonous prey without ingesting poison (see below) among other behaviours. Torresian crows are large and aggressive birds, dominating most other species except large birds of prey and the Australian magpie. They have been observed to attack larger birds of prey, particularly wedge-tailed eagles and most owl species in defence of their nest or territory. Smaller birds will therefore attack crows in defence of their nests, with willie wagtails and pied butcherbirds being notable examples. Noisy miners and Australian magpies are among the few birds that are successful in driving Torresian crows out of their territories, with the latter species being one of the smaller bird species that dominate and displace crows where they meet. Between the months of January and August, large groups of crows congregate and roam nomadically across farmlands, forests and city suburbs. These groups consist of crows of all ages, however from September to December, many leave these flocks to breed in temporary territories, with the <b>nomadic</b> <b>flock</b> sizes reducing significantly to only young and old crows. Each pair of crows returns to the same territory each year, however territories may be taken over by other pairs from year to year.|$|E
50|$|During the {{breeding}} season the birds feed {{close to the}} nest tree. After fledging, the young birds and their parents join other family groups to form large flocks that disperse to summer feeding areas. At the end of summer, breeding adults return to their nest sites while immature birds form <b>nomadic</b> <b>flocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Awassi sheep can be {{kept under}} {{a wide range of}} {{production}} systems, from <b>nomadic</b> <b>flocks</b> relying on natural pasture in semi-arid areas where lamb production is the primary products, to intensive dairy flocks where milk and lambs contribute almost equally to the flock gross income, and it is known for its hardiness and adaptability.|$|R
25|$|The chicks {{remain with}} their parents until one to {{two months before the}} parents lay the next clutch of eggs the {{following}} year, remaining with them 10–12 months. After leaving their parents, the chicks form <b>nomadic</b> <b>flocks</b> with other juveniles and nonbreeders. They remain in these flocks until they form breeding pairs at between two and seven years old.|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} of natural {{breeding}} and the high proportion of males to females in the <b>nomadic</b> <b>flock,</b> male breeding stock was kept and grazed separately during the breeding season. Bucks come into rut during the breeding season. Rut {{is characterized by a}} decrease in appetite, obsessive interest in the does and a strong heat. Nomads knew that when strong-smelling bucks are not separated from the does during breeding season, their scent will affect the milk. In organic farming, male breeding stock has to be kept in the farm. It is permissible to use conventionally-kept male breeding stock.|$|E

5|$|Cape sparrows {{primarily}} eat seeds, {{and also}} eat soft plant parts and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large <b>nomadic</b> <b>flocks</b> {{to move around}} in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, a bush, a cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical clutch contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native southern grey-headed sparrow and the house sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, {{and it is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos {{occupy a}} wide range of {{habitats}} from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are <b>nomadic.</b> <b>Flocks</b> of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as the glossy black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The red-vented cockatoo inhabits mangroves and its absence from northern Luzon {{may be related to the}} lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as the food supply is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.|$|R
40|$|Scarlet-tufted {{malachite}} sunbirds (Neetarinia johnstoni) are {{endemic to}} the high altitude zones of East African mountains. On Mount Kenya the males are resident and territorial all year. The females arrive {{over an extended period}} {{at the beginning of the}} breeding season, after spending the non-breeding season in <b>nomadic</b> <b>flocks</b> at slightly lower elevations. Males are bright iridescent green with elongated central tail feathers, which are displayed during courtship. We examined the role of the tail in mate choice using natural variation and investigated the influence of tail length on male time budgets by experimental manipulation. Territorial males that paired had longer tails than territorial males which remained unpaired. Males with naturally long tails started breeding earlier, resulting in fledglings being produced earlier in the season when the weather was more clement. Birds which bred together in one year were paired together in the next year if they both survived. Thus the male's tail may only be involved as a cue in the formation of new pairs. Males which were already paired were subjected to one of three experimental treatments - having their tail elongated, shortened, or manipulated but kept at the same length. Males with experimentally shortened tails spent more time in flight and hawked for flying insects with a higher efficiency than control males. Both control and elongated tail males reduced the amount of time in flight and had a lower hawking efficiency after manipulation. These results suggest that the long tail of male scarlet-tufted malachite sunbirds is a handicap. The factors influencing the reproductive success of a pair are discussed. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Magpie social {{behaviour}} was studied at Linton in the Manawatu, from June 1978 to November 1982. Social behaviour patterns and reproduction were investigated, and {{the hypothesis that}} magpies were cooperative breeders was tested. There were two population phases. <b>Nomadic</b> <b>flocks</b> formed in spring and foraged on open, treeless pasture. The flock sex ratio was determined from morphometric measurements, and was between 33 : 66 and 50 : 50 males to females. Flock density stabilised at 1 magpie per hectare, and the estimated daily survival rate was 0. 9. Territorial magpies defended all-purpose areas averaging 5 hectares in size, {{and there was no}} correlation between territory size and the number of occupants. The mean adult survival rate was 0. 85, and annual productivity was 0. 96 juveniles per breeding female. Flock magpies associated randomly, and flock membership changed frequently. The primary activity of flock birds was foraging, which intensified during the afternoons, and in the month of March. The proportion of flock magpies foraging was positively correlated with the number of birds present. Territories were defended by pairs and groups. Non-kin groups may have formed in the flock, and kin groups formed when juvenile dispersal was delayed. Non-breeders did not help at the nest, and male parents made as many visits to nestlings as females did. Time of day strongly influenced the distribution of activities, so that foraging occupied more time in the afternoons. Group-territory magpies spent less time perching and more time defending the territory than pair-territory birds. The average national clutch size was 3. 5 eggs. There was no difference in the breeding output of pair-territory and group-territory hens, but per capita production was lower in the groups. Average individual fitness estimates were prepared for each of four magpie lifestyles, and were highest for pair-territory birds. Supplementary food did not inhibit juvenile dispersal, and lead to polygyny in the formerly pair-defended territories. Hens receiving extra food fledged more juveniles than they had in the previous spring. It was argued that magpies were not cooperative breeders, but selfish opportunists which exploited various social lifestyles in order to obtain reproductive status...|$|R
40|$|The Forest Raven, Corvus tasmanicus tasmanicus, is {{the only}} crow or raven species found on {{mainland}} Tasmania. Although members of the genus Corvus have been comprehensively studied, relatively {{little is known about}} the Forest Raven. While recently studies have been made of the closely related Northern Forest Raven (C. t. boreus) in New South Wales, this is the first study to be undertaken on the biology of the Forest Raven in Tasmania. Overall, the results of this study suggest that Forest Ravens are similar in their breeding biology and behaviour to other corvid species with similar life-histories, both in Australia and overseas. Adult breeding Forest Ravens maintain large self-sufficient territories year-round. Juvenile ravens remain in these territories with their parents for some months after fledging, before leaving to join <b>nomadic</b> <b>flocks</b> comprising immature birds and non-breeding adults. This study focused on the breeding biology and the behaviour of territory-holding adult Forest Ravens in six territories in light bushland around Hobart, southern Tasmania. Ravens built nests in trees characteristic of the tallest vegetation of the area, nests being situated on average 24 m above the ground. The Forest Raven nesting season began in August. Incubation and nestling periods lasted around 22 days and 37 - 49 days respectively, with second clutches being laid in the event of the failure of the first. Forest Ravens produced on average 1. 9 fledglings per pair per nesting season, with most pairs producing two fledglings. The survival rate of fledglings to one month was very high. Away from the nest, and outside the breeding season, Forest Ravens are consistent with other bird species in spending most of their time in perching behaviour and foraging. The Forest Raven is a common and distinctive member of Tasmania's avifauna, and is of commercial importance due to the damage it causes in orchards. Due to the perception of the Forest Raven as an agricultural pest the species is one of only three native bird species not protected by Tasmanian law. In a number of countries corvids are becoming increasingly urban, causing problems through aggressive behaviour, noise and unsanitary mess. Although this has not yet been reported in the Forest Raven, a potential increase in food sources as a result of suburban spread in Tasmania may in the future lead to greater numbers of ravens in such areas. By providing information on the breeding and behaviour of the Forest Raven, the results of this study may be of use in the development of plans or devices to manage the species in a controlled, effective and non-lethal way...|$|R
40|$|Moving or <b>nomadic</b> duck <b>flocks</b> in SE-Asia are flocks {{that are}} {{frequently}} transported to {{areas where they}} can find suitable feed, in particular in rice paddies after the harvest. Using rapid rural appraisal methods we interviewed moving duck owners in the Mekong Delta of Viet Nam and in Central Java of Indonesia to describe their management system. The characteristics of the moving duck production system appear to be conducive to these ducks spreading and transmitting HPAI virus to other birds: 1) Flocks are moved frequently and quickly over large distances, 2) Flocks use many different scavenging areas, 3) Flocks are exposed to numerous HPAI risk factors, such as having contact with other scavenging ducks, wild birds and domestic animals, and 4) A {{large number of people}} are involved in transport and management of these flocks. In Viet Nam, movement of ducks is usually conducted with boats and trucks over long distances (median distance travelled per year: 80 km) throughout most of the year (travel duration per year: 30 - 285 days), while in Indonesia flocks travel shorter distances during just a few months of the year and are transported on motorbikes, cars or herded by foot. Moving duck flocks in Viet Nam are larger than in Indonesia and are usually moved as single flocks owned by only one farmer, whereas in Indonesia, flocks of several owners often share transport. In additional field studies, 48 Vietnamese and 54 Indonesian moving duck flocks were monitored over a period of 6 months with blood samples being collected from individual birds. Overall crude bird-level HPAI H 5 antibody prevalence (HI titre≥ 16) was about 15. 5 % in Viet Nam and 5. 3 % in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia {{is one of}} the {{countries}} where Avian Influenza (AI) is endemic. In several parts of Indonesia, nomadic ducks are being used after harvesting the rice for cleaning the rice fields from weed, snails and insects. Nomadic ducks might {{play an important role in}} spreading all different types of influenza A viruses, because it is well known that aquatic birds form a reservoir for most influenza A types. In this project, questionnaires were used to obtain information about <b>nomadic</b> duck <b>flocks.</b> Next to this, trachea, cloaca and blood samples have been taken to test for the presence of influenza A virus (including H 5 -subtype) and antibodies against influenza A (including antibodies against H 5 -subtype). The aim of this study is to investigate the types of influenza A that are present in nomadic ducks in Cipunagara subdistrict (Subang district, Java, Indonesia) by taking trachea, cloaca and bloodsamples, and to relate the acquired data to flock size, origin of the ducks, duck breed, keeping reason, type of housing system, location of the ducks at night, transportation methods of the ducks, movements of the flocks and vaccination. 32 % of the flocks tested positive with the PCR-test for the presence of influenza A. Influenza A subtype H 5 was not found in the flocks. 100 % of the flocks showed the presence of antibodies against influenza A. 6 % of the flocks have antibodies against H 5 -subtype. These results were combined with the results of the questionnaire. This showed a relation between flock size and the presence of influenza A. Bigger flocks have a bigger chance of being influenza A positive. Next to this, there is a relation between flocks which are being removed from the rice fields at night and the presence of H 5 -subtype specific antibodies. Flocks that are being removed from the rice fields at night show more antibodies against H 5 -subtype...|$|R
