5|$|All of SR 607 {{is located}} in central Morgan County, Ohio. The state route starts at the {{intersection}} of SR60 near McConnelsville. SR607 travels <b>north</b> <b>for</b> the majority of the length. SR 607 passes near an Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) county garage near the beginning of the road. Halfway through the route, SR607 meets Township Road 696 in a T-intersection, where the route moves slightly westward. After that, there is an Ohio Army National Guard training site at Hawk Drive. The route keeps moving north until it ends at SR78 at another T-intersection. The route goes through mostly forests and small hills.

This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. No part of SR607 is included within the National Highway System, a system of routes deemed most important for the economy, defense and mobility of the country.|$|E

5|$|Following William Beebe's {{death in}} 1962, his {{research}} station at Simla remained in operation under Jocelyn Crane's management, {{under the new}} name of the William Beebe Tropical Research Station. However, because Jocelyn's research required her to travel <b>north</b> <b>for</b> extended periods, by 1965 she had little time to keep the station running. By 1971, the station had fallen into disuse and was declared closed. Meanwhile, as Asa Wright's health began to fail in her old age, her friends began to fear that after her death her neighboring estate of Spring Hill might be lost to developers, and established a trust to buy the estate and convert it into the Asa Wright nature center. In 1974, Beebe's property was donated to the newly established Asa Wright Nature Center.|$|E
