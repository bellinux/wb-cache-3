40|$|Background: Colonic and {{colorectal}} surgery frequently requires bowel preparation. This is {{an evaluation}} of the use of normal saline for one-day bowel preparation in children with colostomy. Patients and Methods:A prospective study of 55 children with colostomy who had one-day bowel preparation for colonic and colorectal surgical procedures in a 3 -year period. The information, along with clinical data was recorded on a structured proforma. Data were analysed using SPSS version 11. 0. Results:There were 33 boys and 22 girls. The median age was 4 years (range, one month - 13 years). The primary diagnosis were as follows: Anorectal malformation, <b>24</b> (<b>44</b> %); Hirschsprung`s disease, <b>24</b> (<b>44</b> %); Faecal incontinence- post-abdominoperineal pull-through, 2 (4 %); Penetrating rectal injury, 1 (2 %); others, 4 (8 %). Intraoperative bowel luminal fluid cleanliness was assessed as clear in 36 (62 %) and contaminated in 21 (38 %). Overall, postoperatively, superficial surgical site infection occurred in 6 (10. 9 %) patients (2 had clean intraoperative colonic fluid, 5. 9 %.

30|$|In {{the case}} of breast cancer, CSC populations {{identified}} by the markers CD <b>24</b> -CD <b>44</b> + or ALDH+ were characterized as minimally overlapping, largely separate cell populations, each capable of initiating tumors in immune deficient mice [14]. However, whether these different phenotypic populations identify distinct or independent CSCs in the tumor remained to be resolved. To further characterize these distinct breast CSC populations, we prospectively isolated these distinct subsets of breast cancer cells from a total of 30 human breast cancer samples. These tumor samples were digested in collagenase to obtain single tumor cells. Following tumor cell disassociation, tumor cell samples were incubated with anti-CD <b>44,</b> anti-CD <b>24,</b> and anti-lineage mixture antibodies (PE-conjugated anti-CD 2, CD 3, CD 10, CD 16, CD 18, CD 31, and CD 140 b), and then labeled by Aldefluor assay, and analyzed using MoFlo Astrios flow cytometry. Side and forward scatter were used to eliminate debris and cell doublets, and the Lin- tumor cells were further analyzed and sorted for ALDH+, ALDH-CD <b>24</b> -CD <b>44</b> + and bulk (non-ALDH+CD <b>24</b> -CD <b>44</b> +) tumor cell populations. Using gene expression profiling of ALDH+ and CD <b>24</b> -CD <b>44</b> + BCSCs (comparing to bulk tumor cells) isolated across different subtypes of human breast cancer tissues together with multi-marker immunofluorescence including CD <b>24,</b> CD <b>44</b> and ALDH 1, we have recently shown that the CD <b>24</b> -CD <b>44</b> + and ALDH+ cell populations identify anatomically distinct breast CSCs with distinct EMT (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) and MET (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition) gene-expression profiles respectively [8]. The EMT-like CD <b>24</b> -CD <b>44</b> + breast CSCs are primarily quiescent and localized at the tumor invasive front, while the MET-like ALDH+ breast CSCs are proliferative cells located mainly in {{the central part of}} tumors. Importantly, the epithelial and mesenchymal states of breast CSCs are not static; instead they display a cellular plasticity allowing them to transit between EMT and MET states [8]. This reversible, metastable epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of breast CSCs builds upon the current model of cancer metastasis postulating that EMT drives tumor cell dissemination while subsequent MET drives metastatic colonization [27].|$|R

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} peptide, sakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C) is a mutant {{of a class}} IIa bacteriocin, sakacin P, {{produced by}} lactic acid bacteria. SakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C) consists of 44 residues and possesses a C-terminal disulphide bond that ties the C-terminal tail to the mid part of the peptide-sequence, {{in contrast to the}} wild-type peptide which lacks a C-terminal disulphide bond. The three-dimensional structure of sakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C) in a membrane-mimicking environment (dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles) was investigated by circular dichroism (CD) and by two-dimensional homo nuclear resonance spectroscopy (NMR). CD spectra indicated that sakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C) exists as a random coil in water, whereas NMR results indicate that sakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C) has a well-defined structure in DPC micelles. Simulated annealing calculations based on distance restraints derived from NMR spectra, were used to generate structures of sakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C). The structures revealed an amphipathic central á-helix (residues 18 - 33), a less well-defined â-sheet-like structure in the N-terminal half (residues 1 - 17), and a defined structured C-terminal half (residues 34 - 44) without any common secondary structural motif. Comparison of sakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C) with leucocin A, another pediocin-like (class IIa) bacteriocin, revealed a striking resemblance, which may indicate that these two bacteriocins have the same mode of action on their target cells. The structural features of sakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C) and their possible role in an antimicrobial mechanism are discussed. In the lack of a rapid large-scale purification procedure for the purification of sakP(N <b>24</b> C + <b>44</b> C) that was needed in this study, a new and simple two-step purification procedure for pediocin-like bacteriocins and other cationic peptides was developed. The new procedure yields more than 80 % of the activity that is initially in the culture supernatant, and the final bacteriocin preparation is more than 90 % pure. With the new purification procedure, it is possible to purify milligram quantities of pediocin-like bacteriocins within a few hours...|$|R

40|$|Side {{population}} {{is a minor}} subpopulation (SP) of some cell lines, exporting staining dye Hoechst 33342 out of their cytoplasm. It is discussed as a possible source of "cancer stem cells", "tumour initiating cells" or "metastasis initiating cells". However, broad literature suggest, that stemness and other privileged properties of SP are very variable between different cell types, cell lines and stage of disease. Cell lines TRAMP are the only widely available murine models for testing of prostate cancer therapy. We noticed in literature a mention about existence of 1 - 2 % of cells constituting side population, but detailed characteristic have not been described until now. In this diploma thesis, we worked on characterisation of SP of the TRAMP-C 2 cell line in comparison to other cells (nonSP). In the first part, we compared stem properties of SP and nonSP. We started with checking the existence of SP by its verapamil sensitivity.
