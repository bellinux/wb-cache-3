40|$|Abstract- Experimental studies {{generally}} {{performed at}} this laboratory on the solubility of particular salts and oxides in dilute and concentrated aqueous solutions of electrolytes at temperatures up to 400 °C are presented. The techniques used are described. Some {{of this work}} applies an extended Debye-HUckel equation {{as a function of}} the ionic strength of the solution at the high temperatures. From the variation with temperature of a particular ionization or solubility equilibrium obtained from the studies, ther— modynamic functions at infinite dilution of electrolyte are calculated. The studies describe solubility behavior of sulfate salts in exhibiting retrograde solubilities with increasing temperature. But some 2 - 2 sulfate salts, like magnesium or <b>nickel</b> <b>sulfates,</b> hydrolytically precipitate oxy— sulfates or hydroxides in nearly neutral solutions at about 200 °C. Other sulfate, fluoride, and phosphate salts form two liquid phases at tem-peratures of 250 — 400 °C at saturated vapor pressures.

40|$|Copper {{concentrates}} can be sulfation roasted and leached {{with water}} to produce impure solutions of copper(II) sulfate. Copper sulfites are precipitated from aqueous copper(II) sulfate solutions with soluble salts of sulfurous acid like (NH 4) 2 SO 3 or Na 2 SO 3. The water insoluble copper sulfites dissolve in acetonitrile—water (AN/H 2 O) and reduce Cu 2 + to give acidic solutions containing up to 2. 4 M Cu+ as Cu 2 SO 4. Removal of acetonitrile by steam and disproportionation, gives up to 75 g pure particulate copper per litre of such solutions. Conditions for the recovery of Chevreul's salt from solution using different sulfite bases and for its dissolution in CuSO 4 /AN/H 2 O are determined. It is shown that both temperature and the molar ratios of Chevreul's salt and CuSO 4 are important in the efficiency and stoichiometry of the dissolution reaction. Methods of separating copper and nickel from solutions of copper(II) and <b>nickel</b> <b>sulfates,</b> and of recovering copper from dilute (< 0. 1 M) solutions of copper(II) sulfate, are suggested.

5000|$|Medium-phosphorus {{electroless}} nickel(MPEN) {{is referred}} to the nickel-phosphorus alloy deposited by electroless/autocatalytic {{process in which the}} resulting alloy consists of medium levels of phosphorus; the definition of medium levels is different in sources of different branches of technology(decorative, industrial, ...). the range accepted as medium levels can be (percent by weight) 4-7 (decorative purpose), 6-9 (industrial sources), or 4-10 (Electronic applications). The EN bath is typically composed of (a.) <b>Nickel</b> source <b>sulfate</b> , (b.) Reducing agent hypophosphite, (c.)

40|$|Despite many {{investigations}} {{have focused on}} the pristine toxicity of gold nanoparticles (GNPs), {{little is known about the}} outcome of co-exposure and interaction of GNPs with heavy metals which can possibly detoxify or potentiate them. Here, the combined exposure of <b>nickel</b> (II) <b>sulfate</b> (NiSO 4) and GNPs on the maturation response of dendritic cells (DCs) was explored. Exposure to GNPs or NiSO 4 separately induced cell activation. When cells were exposed to a mixture of both, however, the observed cell activation pattern indicated a competitive rather than an additive effect of both inducers with levels similar to those induced by NiSO 4 alone. Quantification of the GNP uptake by DCs demonstrated a significant decrease in intracellular gold content during co-incubation with NiSO 4. An extensive physiochemical characterization was performed to determine the interaction between GNPs and NiSO 4 in the complex physiological media using nanoparticle tracking analyses, disc centrifugation, UV-visible spectroscopy, ICP-MS analyses, zeta potential measurements, electron microscopy, and proteomics. Although GNPs and NiSO 4 did not directly interact with each other, the presence of NiSO 4 in the physiological media resulted in changes in GNPs' charge and their associated protein corona (content and composition), which may contribute to a decreased cellular uptake of GNPs and sustaining the nickel-induced DC maturation. The presented results provide new insights in the interaction of heavy metals and NPs in complex physiological media. Moreover, this study highlights the necessity of mixture toxicology, since these combined exposures are highly relevant for human subjection to NPs and risk assessment of nanomaterials. status: publishe...|$|R

The addition of even small amounts of borate to the solution significantly diminishes the extent of C 1 [...] induced interference. In order to calculate the true influence of borate on the C 1 [...] modified passivation charge, the abil-ity of borate to decrease the background passivation charge (i. e., in the absence of C 1 -) had to be taken into account. In this way, the "corrected " percent increase in anodic passivation charge, due to the presence of a specific [C 1 -] in solution, could be calculated for different amounts of added borate. The results indicate that with increasing borate addition the ability of the C 1 - to interfere with passivation decreases, until at a borate level>ca. 25 % {{there is no longer any}} influence of 0. 25 M C 1 -on the background anodic charge. A possible xplanation for the results is that the borate is behaving as an adsorption in-hibitor, facilitating surface oxidation by adsorbing on the surface in a "favorable " orientation, in contrast to the C 1 - whose adsorption hinders oxide formation. With increasing anodic electrode potential, the effectiveness of the borate at sup-pressing the C 1 [...] induced interference diminishes substantially, so that more borate would be required at the higher poten-tials for the same degree of protection.
