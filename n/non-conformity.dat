5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and <b>non-conformity</b> was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E

The {{success of}} several constraint-based {{modeling}} languages such as OPL, ZINC, or COMET, appeals for better software engineer-ing practices, {{particularly in the}} testing phase. This paper introduces a testing framework enabling automated test case generation for constraint programming. We propose a general framework of constraint program de-velopment which supposes that a first declarative and simple constraint model {{is available from the}} problem specifications analysis. Then, this model is refined using classical techniques such as constraint reformu-lation, surrogate and global constraint addition, or symmetry-breaking to form an improved constraint model that must be thoroughly tested before being used to address real-sized problems. We think that most of the faults are introduced in this refinement step and propose a process which takes the first declarative model as an oracle for detecting <b>non-conformities.</b> We derive practical test purposes from this process to gen-erate automatically test data that exhibit <b>non-conformities.</b> We imple-mented this approach in a new tool called CPTEST that was used to automatically detect <b>non-conformities</b> on two classical benchmark pro-grams, namely the Golomb rulers and the car-sequencing problem. ...|$|R

As Beauty and the Beasts opening number, [...] "Belle", a [...] "pivotal moment...in the narrative", plays a significant role in the film by introducing both the film's heroine, Belle, after whom the song is named, and Gaston, the film's villain. While Belle, a book-loving and intelligent nonconformist who has grown frustrated with her predictable village life, longs for an adventure similar to the ones she reads about in her books, Gaston is a narcissistic hunter who seeks her hand in marriage. In roughly five minutes, the song explains both Belle and Gaston's roles in Beauty and the Beast to the audience. The song also voices the opinions of the townsfolk and [...] "sets up the overall theme and foreshadows what makes the town so oppressive to [...] "; [...] while the villagers award Belle high praise for her doubtless Beauty, they see her as odd because of her love of books and ridicule her for her <b>non-conformity.</b> However, they appraise Gaston for his looks and masculinity.|$|E

After her father's horse returns without its rider, she willingly ventures into the woods in search of her father. She persuades the Beast that she will trade her own freedom in return for her father's, since her father is ill in the dungeon, promising to remain with the Beast in his castle among his staff of enchanted objects forever. Belle's curiosity leads her to the forbidden west wing where she discovers an enchanted rose without realizing that it is tied to the Beast's fate; and the Beast's rage at her trespassing causes her to flee the castle on horseback. [...] Belle is pursued by wolves in the woods but they are driven off by the Beast, afterwards Belle helps the injured Beast back to the castle and nurses him back to health. Although she initially dislikes her captor, Belle gradually learns to accept the Beast in spite of his appearance and eventually befriends him. Belle and the Beast's strong bond greatly envies Gaston to the point of which he storms the castle and mortally wounds the Beast, though Gaston falls to his own death in the process. However, Belle confesses her love for the Beast just in time to break the spell under which he had been placed by an enchantress as punishment for his selfish ways, and the Beast ultimately transforms back into a handsome prince.|$|E

Relaxing a bit the requirements, hex-dominant meshes [7], in contrast with full-hex meshes, are allowed to aggregate a mixture of hexahedra, prisms, pyramids and tetrahedra. The goal of hex-dominant meshing is to generate meshes where hexahedral elements dominate, both in number and volume.

In addition, the actual FAR and the in-control ARL values can be very different from the nominally expected values such as 0. 0027 (or ARL 0 = 370), particularly when c is small, even with large amounts of reference data.
