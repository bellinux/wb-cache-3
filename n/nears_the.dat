5|$|The {{seventh and}} final novel, Fyre (published in April 2013), sees the cast {{featuring}} the toughest challenges yet as Septimus <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> {{end of his}} ExtraOrdinary Wizard training. The dreaded Two-Faced Ring has been captured, but remains a grave threat, and must be plunged into the Alchemical Fyre {{for it to be}} destroyed for good. The ring, however, holds a threat far greater than most realize, and the restarting of the Fyre is, in itself, quite dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Then, SR 78 intersects with SR 115 east of Brawley, running {{concurrently}} {{with it for}} a brief distance. Shortly {{after passing}} through the small community of Glamis, the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe, passing near the Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve. As it <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> Colorado River and the Arizona border, SR78 briefly passes through Cibola National Wildlife Refuge before entering the community of Palo Verde, where the river {{turns away from the}} highway and SR78 enters Riverside County.|$|E
5|$|As he <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E

5|$|Once {{across the}} county line, the M-14 freeway runs through {{residential}} subdivisions {{from the western}} Detroit suburbs. There is an interchange for Beck Road as M-14 {{turns back to the}} east. The freeway crosses a rail line operated by CSX Transportation The freeway passes Ford Motor Company's Sheldon Road Plant near the Sheldon Road interchange. There is a crossing for another CSX rail line near the bridges over the River Rouge by the St. Johns Golf Course. The freeway through this area curves around a bit north of its previous course. As M-14 <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> Livonia city line, it meets an interchange with I-96 and I-275 that marks the eastern terminus of M-14 in Plymouth Township.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Petén {{was the last}} stage of the conquest of Guatemala, a {{prolonged}} conflict during the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. A wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest, Petén contains a central drainage basin {{with a series of}} lakes and areas of savannah. It is crossed by several ranges of low karstic hills and rises to the south as it <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> Guatemalan Highlands. The conquest of Petén, a region now incorporated into the modern republic of Guatemala, climaxed in 1697 with the capture of Nojpetén, the island capital of the Itza kingdom, by Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|There was a wharf on {{the river}} in 1874, served by a railway line, and sidings which were used to collect shingle.

5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E
5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Alex {{is able to}} prove her innocence {{with the help of}} her friends. She discovers that the {{suspected}} bomber is former FBI analyst-trainee Elias Harper, who planted the bomb on the instructions of a terrorist mastermind. Having cleared her name at a congressional hearing, Parrish is reinstated as an FBI agent and assigned to the field office in New York. In the operations section, she works to uncover the mastermind behind the bombings, as the 2016 Presidential election <b>nears.</b> <b>The</b> supervising training agent Liam O'Connor is eventually revealed to be the responsible individual and is shot and killed by Parrish and Booth. Parrish resigns from the FBI because of the bombing and the subsequent publicity. Two months later, she is approached by Matthew Keyes, who offers her a position at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).|$|E
5|$|The {{trunkline}} turns north, {{away from}} the river, as it <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> stadium and passes through {{the remainder of the}} northern suburb, changing to a more rural character as the freeway passes through the northern end of Kent County. M-46 joins US131 from the west at Cedar Springs and the two highways pass into northwestern Montcalm County near Sand Lake. North of Pierson the landscape is dominated by forests. M-46 turns east and leaves the freeway near Howard City while US131 continues into Mecosta County near the Little Muskegon River. The freeway forms the eastern boundary of the Manistee National Forest near the river and north to Big Rapids. Further north M-20 joins the US131 freeway near Stanwood and the two highways cross the Muskegon River on the way to Big Rapids. The city is served by its own business loop and M-20 turns east off the freeway along Bus. US131 toward the main campus of Ferris State University.

5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation {{about what is going on}} as the ship <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she is not the same as before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E
5|$|The Giotto and Vega {{missions}} gave {{planetary scientists}} their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, {{carbon dioxide and}} other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000km across. Evaporation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100millionkilometers into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{contacts}} Sulu, who informs {{them the}} conference is being held at Camp Khitomer. Both ships head for the talks {{as fast as they}} can. As Enterprise <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E

5|$|VV Corvi {{is a close}} spectroscopic binary, its two {{component}} stars orbiting {{each other}} with a period of 1.46 days. Both are yellow-white main-sequence stars of spectral type F5V, though the primary has begun expanding and cooling as it <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> end of its time on the main sequence. The mass ratio of the two stars is 0.775 ± 0.024. A tertiary companion was discovered during the Two Micron All-Sky Survey. W Corvi is an eclipsing binary that varies in brightness from apparent magnitude 11.16 to 12.5 over 9 hours. Its period has increased by 1/4 second over a century. It is an unusual system in that its two stars are very close to each other yet have different surface temperatures, and hence thermal transfer is not taking place as expected. SX Corvi is an eclipsing binary that is also a contact binary known as a W Ursae Majoris variable. The two component stars orbit closely enough to each other for mass to have been transferred between them—in this case the secondary having transferred a large amount of mass to the primary. RV Corvi is another eclipsing binary. Its brightness varies from apparent magnitude 8.6 to 9.16 over 18 hours. The system is composed of stars of spectral types F0 and G0, which orbit each other every 0.7473 days.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{nomination}} and election involves several steps. When an existing alumni trustee <b>nears</b> <b>the</b> {{end of his}} or her four-year term, or when a new alumni trustee seat is created, the Dartmouth Alumni Council proposes two candidates to fill the vacancy. If there are two vacancies, the Council suggests three candidates. Any alumnus/na who collects at least 500 alumni signatures may join the candidates on the ballot as a petition candidate. Then the Association of Alumni polls all Dartmouth alumni by paper and electronic ballots, using a preference voting system, to select the nominee or nominees. Finally, the Board traditionally elects the alumni nominee.|$|E
