Ødegaard trained with this team weekly {{for the next three}} years. He mostly played left back, as the coaches felt this would give him a positive experience with many ball touches while still playing against physically much stronger players.

500|$|Although Barry Lyndon found a great {{audience}} in France, {{it was a}} box office failure, grossing just $9.5 million in the American market, <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>close</b> to the $30 million Warner Bros. needed to generate a profit. The pace and length of Barry Lyndon at three hours put off many American critics and audiences, but the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Musical Score, {{more than any other}} Kubrick film. As with most of Kubrick's films, Barry Lyndons reputation has grown through the years and it is now considered to be one of his best, particularly among filmmakers and critics. Numerous polls, such as The Village Voice (1999), Sight & Sound (2002), and Time (2005), have rated it {{as one of the greatest}} films ever made. As of August 2015, it has as 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 52 reviews. Roger Ebert referred to it as [...] "one of the most beautiful films ever made", [...] "certainly in every frame a Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, remorseless in its doubt of human goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Williams from New York {{magazine}} {{described the}} song as sounding both throbbing {{as well as}} wistful. Christian John Wikane from PopMatters called the song a propulsive track. Alan Braidwood of the BBC, noted of the track: [...] "full-on dance, dark, disco, fun, big" [...] and compared it to other Madonna songs like [...] "Vogue", [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". Tom Bishop from the BBC commented that Madonna has either reinvigorated her career or she is [...] "merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material". Jason Shawhan from About.com commented that the song has [...] "way too much Abba in it for its own good." [...] He went on to elaborate that [...] "he only reason I can think of {{for this to be}} chosen as the first single was the Motorola ad campaign. It's not a bad song by far, it has pep and a sense of fun, but it's <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>close</b> to being one of the best songs on the record". Bill Lamb of About.com said that the ABBA sample sounded completely effortless like much of Madonna's best dance music. He further elaborated that what [...] "'Hung Up' amounts to is a big gushy love note to Madonna's core fans, those club kids who pack the floor every time they hear the pounding beats of a Madonna classic and the dj's who can't get enough of spinning her records. 'Hung Up' will send those fans into ecstasy, and it sounds good on the radio, too". Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine declared that [...] "Hung Up" [...] and the next single [...] "Sorry" [...] might not have the same sleaze as Madonna's older songs like [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] or [...] "Burning Up", but have the same modus operandi of being designed for [...] "sweaty up-all-night dancing". Rob Harvilla from The Village Voice called the song a triumphant jazz exercise.|$|E

2500|$|Development for Destiny {{began at}} Bungie in 2010 under the code name [...] "Project Tiger", {{shortly after the}} release of [...] This coincided with the {{announcement}} of a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard. Under Bungie's agreement with Activision, new intellectual property developed by Bungie will be owned by Bungie, not Activision, in a deal similar to the EA Partners Program. Details of this contract were revealed during the course of Activision's lawsuit against Jason West and Vincent Zampella, founders and former employees of Infinity Ward, including provisions for four Destiny games {{over the course of the}} ten-year deal. Initially, Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick suggested that the total investment in Destiny would be around $500 million. Bungie's COO Pete Parsons clarified that the game's development cost is <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>close</b> to $500 million, saying, [...] "For marketing you'd have to ask Activision people, but for development costs, not anything close to $500 million." [...] Activision subsequently confirmed the $500 million figure, stating that marketing, up-front infrastructure costs, and investment in the game's engine were included, and could be amortized over the life of the IP. Bungie would earn an additional $2.5 million bonus payout if the first game achieved a Metacritic score of 90 or above.|$|E
2500|$|In {{need of a}} {{statement}} game, the 49ers traveled to Seattle for a Thursday Night Football game against their division rivals. During the broadcast on NFL Network, Cris Collinsworth noted {{that if he were}} starting an NFL franchise, he would have taken the Broncos rookie quarterback Jay Cutler before Alex Smith and fellow rookies Matt Leinart and Vince Young – and that Smith was <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>close</b> to the others. Going into the 4th quarter, the 49ers were trailing the Seahawks 7–3, and pulling out a win looked unlikely. Smith however performed brilliantly in the fourth quarter, and drove the 49ers on a long touchdown drive down the field early, taking a narrow 10–7 lead. Late in the quarter, with the same score, Smith struck again – shaking off an almost certain sack, rolling to the left and completing a pass to Frank Gore for a touchdown to give the 49ers a 10-point lead. On the next drive, Smith cemented the victory by leading yet another touchdown drive, and rushing for a touchdown on a naked bootleg. Collinsworth had earlier in the game observed that [...] "Alex Smith is the best I've ever seen him. That drive is the best I saw," [...] and on seeing his touchdown run, commented [...] "What a second-half he has had!" ...|$|E

Every effort was in vain; I groaned with vexation as I felt that I was in for a sleepless night.|$|E
