40|$|Rural {{tourism is}} one of the opportunities, which can {{positively}} influence productivity and incomes in rural areas. European Union set the rural development as part of its priorities. This development has been conducted through several measures aimed at education, cooperation, municipality development, ecological agriculture, diversification of economic activities, etc. Rural tourism is a result of diversification of economic activities towards non-agricultural activities. The paper focuses on analysing financial tools of support used for rural tourism development. Development projects realized in the <b>Nitra</b> <b>Self-governing</b> <b>Region</b> (NSR) during programming period 2007 - 2013 (plus 2 years) are evaluated. These projects have been financed through different grant schemes created by the European Union (realised by Ministries, Local Action Groups, Agricultural Paying Agency) and also by the <b>Nitra</b> <b>Self-governing</b> <b>Region.</b> The paper also illustrates the localisation of approved projects and their purpose...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe article {{deals with}} the motor vehicle tax in {{relation}} with fiscal decentralization, particularly from 2005 with competence delegated to the <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> {{in the area of}} motor vehicle tax. The result of this provision in the field of fiscal decentralization is increasing of differences in the motor vehicle tax burden in <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> of Slovakia. The paper is the result of solving a series of impact studies solved by the authors in this field. Gradually over time from the transfer of competences in setting tax rates on motor vehicles to <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> and usage of the incomes of this tax can realistically assess the development and impact of this element of fiscal decentralization in the Slovak Republic as well as propose a solution of resulting situation. The aim of the paper is to identify the motor vehicle tax rates and tax income changes in the period of 2005 to 2013 as the result of fiscal decentralization and tax competence of <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> in the Slovak Republic. The main goal of the paper is to propose the new unified tax rates with higher tax reduction for environmentally friendly vehicles for all <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> in the Slovak Republic...|$|R

50|$|A {{unitary state}} is {{sometimes}} one {{with only a}} single, centralised, national tier of government. However, unitary states often also include one or more <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions.</b> The difference between a federation {{and this kind of}} unitary state is that in a unitary state the autonomous status of <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> exists by the sufferance of the central government, and may be unilaterally revoked. While it is common for a federation to be brought into being by agreement between a number of formally independent states, in a unitary state <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> are often created through a process of devolution, where a formerly centralised state agrees to grant autonomy to a region that was previously entirely subordinate. Thus federations are often established voluntarily from 'below' whereas devolution grants self-government from 'above'.|$|R

50|$|The {{distinction}} between a federation and a unitary state is often quite ambiguous. A unitary state may closely resemble a federation in structure and, while a central government may possess the theoretical right to revoke the autonomy of a <b>self-governing</b> <b>region,</b> it may be politically difficult for it {{to do so in}} practice. The <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> of some unitary states also often enjoy greater autonomy than those of some federations. For these reasons, it is sometimes argued that some modern unitary states are de facto federations.|$|R
5000|$|The term župa was popularized in Slovak {{professional}} {{literature in the}} 19th century as a synonym to contemporary Slovak term stolica (county). [...] After {{the collapse of the}} Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, it was used as the official name of administrative units of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia in 1919 - 1928 and then again in the Slovak Republic during WWII in 1940-1945. Nowadays, the term is used semi-officially as a short alternative name for the <b>self-governing</b> <b>regions</b> of Slovakia.

40|$|The article {{examines}} how {{a search for}} identity attempted by Žemaitians (Samogitians), a Lithuanian local cultural group, eventually evolves into the demand that Žemaitian community should be recognised as an autochthonous nation, and Žemaitian dialect &ndash; as a separate language, with all implicit rights. Attempts to implement {{the idea of a}} <b>self-governed</b> <b>region</b> as a guarantee of reconstruction and protection of Žemaitian identity is the most recent and vivid representation of such proceedings. Since Lithuania&rsquo;s accession to EU is increasingly perceived as a threat to cultural identity, other local cultural groups also tend to support the idea of <b>self-governed</b> <b>regions.</b> A suggestion that four (4) <b>self-governed</b> <b>regions</b> covering respective local culture distribution areas should be created in Lithuania is promoted. The authors of such demands, due to a multitude of historical, political, and social reasons, still do not have many supporters in central government bodies, and even in local communities, although in Žemaitija their number is greater...|$|R
