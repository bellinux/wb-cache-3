25|$|Like any {{breed of}} dog, the Picardy Shepherd is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone,</b> and much thought must {{be devoted to}} {{choosing}} the right dog. As more Picard puppies are imported into the US from France and other countries, {{it is important that}} owners and future breeders remain responsible; they will determine the fate of this breed in the United States. In 2006 the Berger Picard Club of America was formed to help promote and protect this breed. The Berger Picard was fully recognized in the herding group by the American Kennel Club as of 1 July 2015.|$|E
25|$|Many freedpeople {{could not}} afford to {{purchase}} land immediately after the war, but earned money in jobs outside farming such as fishing and oystering. Black land ownership thus increased even faster (though <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone)</b> during the 1870s. In Charles City County, three-quarters of Black farm workers owned their own farms, with an average size of 36 acres. In York County, 50% owned their farms, which averaged 20 acres. (Statedwide, the number of landowners was high, but the average size of land was only 4 acres.) These relatively small farms, on relatively poor land, did not generate enormous profits. However, they did constitute a base of economic power, and Blacks from this region held political office at a high rate.|$|E

[...] Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times echoed the sentiments, and praised the series for [...] "stay in touch with teens' lives".|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} better {{received}} by other critics. Popular Mechanics that year praised the game's detail {{and ability to}} recreate the complex maneuvering involved in the real battle. He {{referred to it as}} unique and [...] "fantastic". Creative Computing cautioned that the game [...] "is probably <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone.</b> The point which I probably cannot emphasize enough is that it is an extremely complex simulation ... However, for those ready for a ... I enthusiastically recommend Computer Bismarck". United States Navy defense researcher Peter Perla in 1990 considered war games like Computer Bismarck a step above earlier war-themed video games that relied on arcade-style action. He praised the addition of a computer-controlled opponent that such games provide to solitaire players. Perla attributes SSI's success to the release of its early wargames, specifically citing Computer Bismarck.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, {{there was}} a sudden surge in suicide rates amongst gay {{teenagers}} in the United States. In September 2010, at least six adolescents took their lives due to factors related to gay bullying. After reading about the surge of gay teen suicides, Kesha was inspired to write [...] "We R Who We R", along with Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. Production of the song was completed by Luke alongside Blanco and Ammo. After being nominated for the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, Kesha elaborated on the song's initial inspiration. She stated that she was concerned with today's society, criticizing the fact that people have to hide themselves and pretend to be someone other than who they are. Regarding her music she said that it was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone,</b> claiming that she is a misfit in society and not everyone understands her or what she stands for.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} 3DO {{release of}} D was well received. In their import review, GameFan staff stated they normally disliked interactive movie FMV games, but praised D for being innovative and creative, dubbing it [...] "a masterpiece." [...] In their {{review of the}} English release, they commended its horror elements and concluded it to be [...] "the best FMV game likely ever to be made" [...] and the best 3DO title at the time. GamePro staff gave the game high scores for its presentation and likewise commended its scare factor. They called it [...] "a frightening work of art" [...] but cautioned that it was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone.</b> A reviewer for Next Generation found the graphics were astounding and enhanced the player's involvement in the creepy storyline. He criticized the English localization's dialogue and voice acting, and said the game suffers from low challenge and extremely short length, but still found the game enjoyable. GameFan staff named D their 1995 3DO Game of the Year and the Best 3DO Graphic Adventure/FMV Game. GamePro staff ranked it the third best 3DO game for their 1995 Editors' Choice Awards.|$|E

500|$|Wolf: The Journey Home was {{nominated}} for the 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association. Publishers Weeklys Sybil Steinberg called it a [...] "powerful first novel" [...] and a [...] "genuinely eye-opening tale". She praised Bowen for [...] "striving to inhabit the wild psyche of Marta {{with a minimum of}} anthropomorphic sentimentality," [...] and felt the author conveyed [...] "both a reverence for the ways of the wild and a realistic grasp of wolves' fear of humans." [...] Reviewing the title for The Detroit Free Press, Judy Rose considered it a [...] "fact-and-fiction book" [...] written [...] "with a wolf's-eye view". She praised the work's factual basis and Bowen's extensive research into the topic, and felt the novel's release was [...] "well-timed", coinciding with growing interest in wolf research and the reintroduction programs, particularly those at Yellowstone Park. While noting the novel is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone,</b> she felt it would be enjoyable to [...] "wildlife lovers" [...] and that readers will [...] "howl with [...] pain". David Seideman of the Chicago Tribune considered the novel {{to be in the same}} [...] "vein [...] the classic The Incredible Journey", praising the author's [...] "faithfully [...] their indomitable spirit". He thought that [...] "Bowen's first-rate skills as a nature writer keep her from falling off the edge into anthropomorphism", though he criticized the scenes in which Marta refuses to hunt and even defends an old buck, feeling that she allowed [...] "her sympathies to distort reality" [...] and contradicted her own assertion that wolves are [...] "always looking for an easy meal." [...] Jennifer Henderson, of the Booklist, found it to be a [...] "memorable tale" [...] that highlights the difficulties in reintroducing wolves even to protected areas. Calling it a [...] "beautifully told wolf story" [...] with a [...] "tragic outcome", she recommended the novel for teenage readers who love animals. In Gentle Reads: Great Books to Warm Hearts and Lift Spirits, Deanna McDaniel recommends the novel in her list of 500 inspiring stories for young adults, considering it to be an engaging and [...] "vivid" [...] tale of survival that contains a [...] "strong message of hope" [...] in the legacy Marta leaves behind.|$|E

2500|$|According to the CODHES {{human rights}} NGO, forced {{displacement}} during Uribe's term affected over 2.4 million Colombian nationals {{by the end}} of 2009. A spokesperson for the organization stated: [...] "It's true that there have been advances for some segments of society, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone,</b> which casts into doubt the democratic component of (the government's) security policy.". From 2000 to 2008, more that 130.000 Colombian nationals fled to Ecuador. According to the International Displacement Monitoring Centre, an estimated total of 3.303.979 to 4.915.579 people have been internally displaced in Colombia.|$|E
5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow states, [...] "Steve Coleman's second {{recording}} {{as a leader}} introduces his M-Base music in its prime.

5000|$|The Allmusic review {{awarded the}} album 3 stars stating [...] "Drummer Gene Krupa's final {{recording}} {{as a leader}} reunited him with the bombastic tenor saxophonist Charlie Ventura... Ventura's extroverted playing (on tenor, alto and baritone) is <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone's</b> taste but he is in generally good form, and even an aging Krupa still retains his youthful excitement and enthusiasm".|$|R
2500|$|Game Informers Jeremy Zoss {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 and Xbox {{versions}} 8.25 out of 10, writing [...] "if titles like Fatal Frame represent the psychological end of horror gaming, then The Suffering {{is the equivalent}} of a splatter flick." [...] He concluded [...] "while I have many positive things to say about this title, I cannot stress enough that it's <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone.</b> Like a Friday the 13th movie, I would hardly call this game scary; it lacks the claustrophobia and dread of a survival horror title. It is, however, filled with tons of gore, vulgarity, and offensive material [...] If you think Peter Jackson's true masterpiece is Dead Alive, you'll be right at home with The Suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Derek Walter of Macworld, however, {{praised the}} iPhone app, writing that [...] "It’s a {{gorgeous}} calendar app that mines your Gmail account to automatically add events", with [...] "a splash {{of color and}} graphics for effect". Walter also criticized the then-lack of a widget in the Notification Center, {{as well as the}} then-lack of iPad support. Walter called the Material Design [...] "rather elegant and polished, with a focus on parceling off information for easy viewing, registering touches with a subtle splash on the screen, and using a lot of visuals cues", but noted that [...] "it’s <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone,</b> especially if you prefer Apple’s design overhaul first introduced in iOS 7. You’ll also find that some elements of Material Design don’t translate well to the iPhone, such as the loss of the slide gesture to go back".|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Trent Ward scored it 7.3 out of 10, writing, [...] "there really isn't {{enough to}} do to make {{long-term}} world-building very satisfying." [...] Whilst he praised the graphics and the economic system, especially the complex relationship between the different buildings, he was critical of combat, concluding, [...] "those who are looking for a more open-ended game may find that Settlers IIs low number of construction options and snore-inducing combat keep the game well within the bounds of strategy game mediocrity." [...] Stephen Poole scored the Gold Edition 6.6 out of 10. He too praised the economic system, but, like Ward, he was critical of combat. He also lamented the absence of online multiplayer, concluding, [...] "the game is definitely <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>everyone,</b> but for those who think they're up to the challenge of lording over a sprawling empire, the Gold Edition is an excellent deal." ...|$|E
