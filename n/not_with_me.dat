500|$|Excited by the experience, Goldman refined {{her public}} persona during {{subsequent}} engagements. Quickly, however, {{she found herself}} arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in Cleveland, {{she felt as though}} she had become [...] "a parrot repeating Most's views" [...] and resolved to express herself on the stage. Upon her return in New York, Most became furious and told her: [...] "Who is <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> is against me!" [...] She left Freiheit and joined with another publication, Die Autonomie.|$|E
500|$|Throughout Revenge of the Sith, Lucas {{refers to}} a wide range of films and other sources, drawing on political, military, and mythological motifs to enhance his story's impact. Perhaps the most media {{coverage}} was given to a particular exchange between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which led to the aforementioned controversy: [...] "If you're <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> then you're my enemy", Anakin declares. Despite Lucas' insistence to the contrary, The Seattle Times concluded, [...] "Without naming Bush or the Patriot Act, it's all unmistakable no matter what your own politics may be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Patterson and Liston had {{a rematch}} clause in their contract. Patterson wanted {{a chance to}} redeem himself, so they had a rematch on July 22, 1963, in Las Vegas. Patterson, a 4-1 betting underdog, was knocked down three times and counted out at 2:10 of the first round. The fight lasted four seconds longer than the first one. Liston's victory was loudly booed. [...] "The public is <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I know it", Liston said afterward. [...] "But they'll have to swing along until {{somebody}} comes to beat me." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt another pull at my coat-tails. Gooseberry had <b>not</b> done <b>with</b> <b>me</b> yet.|$|R
5000|$|... yoo?: Why {{will you}} <b>not</b> play <b>with</b> <b>me</b> today? (This usually means the Furby is upset) ...|$|R
60|$|You're <b>not</b> cross <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> are you? I'm {{very much}} flattered, and I thank {{you from the}} bottom of my heart.|$|R
2500|$|These {{are things}} {{related to the}} past and the {{environment}} I found myself in at the time. In the early '90s, there were all these different youth gangs in Norway and one thing led to another. I was involved in gang fights and had false friends [...] There was no political disposition – <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> nor any of my friends. But you had to profess allegiance to a certain group if you wanted to defend yourself and not get your ass kicked. [...] But there have definitely been changes and an evolution in my thinking. I'm a different person today.|$|E
2500|$|In Ethics, Dietrich Bonhoeffer {{pointed out}} another conflict, between /("He who is <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> is against Me; and he {{who does not}} gather with Me scatters") and /("For he who is not against us [...] is for us [...] "). Bonhoeffer called these two sayings [...] "the claim to exclusiveness and the claim to totality". [...] He argued that both are {{necessary}} and that [...] "The cross of Christ makes both sayings true." [...] D.A. Carson commented similarly, adding he thought {{there are two different}} contexts where /describe the attitude listeners are to have to other possible disciples: when in doubt, be inclusive, while /describe the standard listeners should apply to themselves: be in no doubt of one's own standing. Other commentaries argue that, juxtaposed, the sayings declare the impossibility of neutrality.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans {{used to tell}} me, and I got to {{know them}} well because I played soccer against them and with them and so forth. But they {{used to tell me}} that you guys are blessed. What we know about the Indians in Canada. They are blessed. But that blessing is being {{destroyed}} by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well. But there's going to be a war because the Israelis and the “Bushies” [...] you know, the bully, the bigot in the United States [...] tells you that if you're <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> you're against me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, I am {{responsible}} for you. You must come <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Oh, I trust he is <b>not</b> offended <b>with</b> <b>me!</b> How {{could he have}} got in without my seeing him?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Manuela, dear girl, do <b>not</b> trifle <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> It {{seems like}} magic. Did I not see you--in the ballroom--white--the {{daughter}} of Colonel Marchbanks?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “With me!” exclaimed Louisa. “No, <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Edwards; nor, surely, do {{you mean}} to trust {{yourself}} in that slight canoe.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! well, you Englishmen are so {{cold and}} ceremonious. But Lord Ongar was <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> like that. I knew Lord Ongar so well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is with Mrs. Woodward,' said he coldly, 'and Captain Cuttwater, <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> {{that you}} should speak of that. Mr. Tudor owes me nothing.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Inkosazana," [...] he {{answered}} humbly, [...] "be <b>not</b> angry <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> I am Tamboosa, {{one of the}} King's indunas. You saw <b>me</b> <b>with</b> the others last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY (sweetly). It was {{not your}} fault, was it? I'm so glad you're <b>not</b> angry <b>with</b> <b>me</b> any longer, lieutenant. (She offers her hand.) ...|$|R

60|$|Mor. 'Tis <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> as with {{a private}} man. Such may be swayed by honour, or by love; But monarchs only by their {{interest}} move.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! I forgot {{you were}} a heretic, poor thing! How inconvenient! And so you will <b>not</b> come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to the bull-fight next Sunday?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you <b>not</b> fly <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> then, Janet?" [...] {{said the}} Countess, anxiously. [...] "Am I to lose thee? Is this thy {{faithful}} service?" ...|$|R
60|$|When my {{turn came}} I was soon fast to a hard-fighting fish, {{but he did}} <b>not</b> stay <b>with</b> <b>me</b> long. This {{discouraged}} me greatly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never. It is <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> now, {{as it used}} to be some {{forty years}} ago, when warfare and bloodshed were my calling and my gifts!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Illo. He who is <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{is against}} me. Your tender [...] consciences! Unless they can slip {{out by a}} back-door, by a [...] puny proviso---- ...|$|E
60|$|Sir,--If Mr. Cunningham doubts the {{efficacy}} of the struggle for existence, as a factor in social conditions, he should find fault with Mr. Booth and <b>not</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't mean that, dear," [...] {{she said}} softly. [...] "I mean--your <b>not</b> quarrelling <b>with</b> <b>me</b> when I'm unreasonable. Why can't {{we always do}} so!" ...|$|R
