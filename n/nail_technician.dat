40|$|Objectives: The {{study has}} aimed at {{investigating}} the subjective assessment of an individual’s health status and comparing {{the prevalence of}} selected work-related symptoms among <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> occupationally exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to the one among control subjects. Associations between occupational exposure to VOCs and the incidence of adverse health effects were also analyzed. Material and Methods: The study involved 145 female <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> and 152 control subjects. Data on the prevalence of adverse health effects was collected using the researcher- made questionnaire and then analyzed by means of survival analysis methods. Results: Only 22 % of <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> as compared to 45 % of control subjects described their current health status as “excellent” or “very good” (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 2 – 0. 6, p < 0. 00005). In general, 61 % of <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> confirmed to have experienced any out of all symptoms considered in the study since the commencement of the job, which was significantly higher as compared to 17 % of control subjects (adjusted OR = 2. 8, 95 % CI: 2. 1 – 3. 7, p < 0. 0001). Estimated median length of the employment period free of investigated symptoms was significantly shorter among <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> as compared to controls (12 years vs. 33 years, p < 0. 0001), consistent with almost 4 -times increased hazard of the occurrence of such symptoms among the technicians (hazard ratio (HR) = 3. 9, 95 % CI: 2. 7 – 5. 7, p < 0. 0001). Cox proportional hazard regression modeling revealed almost 5 -times increased hazard of the occurrence of any symptoms among <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> exposed {{to higher levels of}} the mixture of VOCs as compared to those exposed to lower levels (HR = 4. 9, 95 % CI: 1 – 24. 1, p = 0. 05). Conclusions: All outcomes combined together indicate that <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> are subject to faster health deterioration, which may be assumed to be caused by occupational exposure to low levels of VOCs.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Objectives: The aims of {{this pilot}} study were to {{quantify}} respiratory and potential dermal exposure of <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> to acetone, formaldehyde, ethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, toluene and xylene. Fifteen female <b>nail</b> <b>technicians,</b> working in different salons {{participated in this}} study. Products used for nail treatments differed between salons. Most salons used acrylate based nail products whereas others used UV–gel products exclusively. Methods: The participants {{were divided into two}} groups, those who used acrylate– and those who used UV–gel products exclusively. Eight hour personal respiration exposure to acetone, formaldehyde, ethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, toluene and xylene were determined. The concentration of airborne volatile organic compounds in the salons was also determined {{with the use of a}} direct reading instrument (EntryRAE). Potential dermal exposure to the above mentioned solvents (excluding formaldehyde) was determined with the use of charcoal pads (surrogate skin method). During respiratory and dermal sampling, observations were made regarding work practices and control measures used in the salons. Results: It was found that the eight hour time weighed average exposure is well below the recommended occupational exposure limits of the individual chemicals and showed no additive effect. The highest mean respiratory exposures in both groups were acetone (27. 22 mg/m 3 and 28. 36 mg/m 3). EntryRAE results showed peak periods of exposure to volatile organic compounds during the day (322. 16 ppm) that were much higher than the average eight hour exposure (0. 21 ppm). The two groups’ exposure levels were compared to determine if there is a significant difference between the exposures levels but no statistically significant difference was found. The dermal exposures on hand and neck to acetone, ethyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate showed strong significant correlations to the concordant chemical’s respiratory exposures. Correlations between air and dermal exposure was calculated once more after adjusting dermal exposure but the findings indicated only one statistically significant correlation of 0. 42 in the case of ethyl methacrylate. Conclusion: <b>Nail</b> <b>technicians</b> are not at immediate health risk as the exposure in nail salons are well below recommended occupational exposure limits. However the unknown effects of chronic low level exposure to solvents and the large number of previous studies that reported increased health risks in <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> must also be considered. The use of methyl methacrylate in nail products sold in South Africa is also worrying as methyl methacrylate is banned by the FDA in the US due to its skin sensitisation potential that may lead to allergic contact dermatitis. The methods used to determine potential dermal exposure as well as adjusted dermal exposure remains problematic. This is due to the high percentage of adjusted dermal exposure values that had to be estimated and the fact that the activated charcoal pads have a higher absorption potential than human skin. Both methods must be improved to increase accuracy of results. Observations and EntryRAE results demonstrated the irregular nature of a nail technician’s work shift as well tasks performed from day to day. This complicates gathering data that is representative of a <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> eight hour exposure. Therefore to further improve accuracy of results, sampling should in future be task specific. Master...|$|R

5000|$|The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with nail polish are disputed. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), [...] "The amount of chemicals used in animal studies is probably {{a couple of hundred}} times higher than what you would be exposed to from using nail polish every week or so. So the chances of any individual phthalate producing such harm humans is very slim." [...] A more serious health risk is faced by professional <b>nail</b> <b>technicians,</b> who perform manicures over a workstation known as a [...] "nail table," [...] on which the client's hands rest - directly below the technician's breathing zone. In 2009, Dr. Susan Reutman, an epidemiologist with the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Division of Applied Research and Technology, announced a federal effort {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} downdraft vented nail tables (VNTs) in removing potential nail polish chemical and dust exposures from the technician's work area. These ventilation systems have potential to reduce worker exposure to chemicals by at least 50%. Many <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> will often wear masks to cover their mouth and nose from inhaling any of the harsh dust or chemicals from the nail products.|$|R

50|$|Currently, the {{industry}} estimates that almost 40% of <b>nail</b> salon <b>technicians</b> in the US are Vietnamese women.

She brought in her personal manicurist to teach a group of 20 wives of Vietnamese military office. The training required for nail salon work is short and inexpensive, the work does not require high English proficiency, and the work hours tend to be flexible enough to allow immigrant mothers to attend to family obligations.

40|$|Artificial {{fingernail}} {{products are}} made from many chemicals, but the main one {{in most of these}} products is ethyl methacrylate (EMA). In 1974 the U. S. Food and Drug Administration outlawed a similar chemical, methyl methacrylate (MMA), used in fingernail products. MMA was proven harmful to <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> and customers. However, both MMA and EMA can cause contact dermatitis, asthma, and allergies in the eyes and nose [...] all problems that <b>nail</b> <b>technicians</b> know about. Both can make the eyes, nose, and other mucous membranes sting, become red, and swell. Customers are at risk, too. Because {{it is often difficult to}} tell which chemical in a nail salon is causing a sensitivity or allergy, it is best to control your exposure before you become sensitized. In the nail salon, to get rid of EMA in the air you breathe, you should apply artificial fingernails at a ventilated work table. It is also helpful to keep all bottles of fingernail liquid tightly capped. Finally, you should look at your work habits to see if they can be improved.

For eyes and skin, 92 % of respondents complained eye ir-ritation (OR, 13. 1; CI, 5. 7 to 30. 1). In musculoskeletal symptoms, workers reported pain or discomfort in shoulders (OR, 20. 3; CI, 7. 7 to 54) and neck (OR, 19. 7; CI, 8. 9 to 43. 6).
