40|$|To meet future {{emission}} targets, {{it becomes}} increasingly important {{to optimize the}} synergy between engine and aftertreatment system. By using an integrated control approach minimal fluid (fuel and DEF) consumption is targeted within the constraints of emission legislation during real-world operation. In such concept, the on-line availability of engine-out NOx emission is crucial. Here, {{the use of a}} Virtual <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> can be of great added-value. Virtual sensing enables more direct and robust emission control allowing, for example, engine-out NOx determination during conditions in which the hardware sensor is not available, such as cold start conditions. Furthermore, with use of the virtual sensor, the engine control strategy can be directly based on NOx emission data, resulting in reduced response time and improved transient emission control. This paper presents the development and on-line implementation of a Virtual <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor,</b> using in-cylinder pressure as main input. The development steps from off-line modelling, calibration and validation towards real-time on-line implementation and validation will be presented in great detail.

An experimental SCR test apparatus installed on a slipstream of a Coo-per-Bessemer GMV- 4, 2 -stroke cycle {{natural gas engine}} is utilized. Ammonia (NH 3 ) feed rate control algo-rithm development is carried out. Two control algorithms are evaluated: a feed forward control algorithm, using a pre ammonia injection ceramic <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> and a feed forward plus feedback control algorithm, us-ing a pre ammonia injection ceramic <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> and post catalyst ceramic <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> to generate feedback signals.

40|$|This article {{describes}} a <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> based urea dosing control strategy for heavy-duty diesel aftertreatment systems using Selective Catalytic Reduction. The dosing control strategy comprises of a fast-response, model-based ammonia storage control system {{in combination with}} a long-timescale tailpipe-feedback module that adjusts the dosing quantity according to current aftertreatment conditions. This results in a control system that is robust to system disturbances such as biased <b>NOx</b> <b>sensors</b> and variations in AdBlue concentrations. The cross-sensitivity of the tailpipe <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> to ammonia is handled by a novel, smart signal filter that can reliably identify the contributions of NOx and NH 3 in the tailpipe sensor signal, without requiring an artificial perturbation of the dosing signal. The tailpipe feedback module compares the signal from the cross-sensitive tailpipe <b>NOx</b> <b>sensor</b> to the modeled tailpipe sensor signal to estimate the measured and modeled NOx conversion and NH 3 slip, {{without the need for}} an NH 3 sensor. The difference between these measured and modeled quantities is used to adjust the dosing quantity to the aftertreatment system, thereby maintaining nominal performance of the aftertreatment system in the presence of disturbances. Simulation results are presented of the urea dosing control system covering a wide range of disturbances, demonstrating the robustness properties of the controlled system. The robust urea dosing control strategy was implemented on a rapid prototyping platform and tested on a state-of-the-art Euro VI engine and aftertreatment systems, confirming the expected performance and robustness properties...|$|R

Machines focus power via an organization inherent in its components and design. Broken or degraded components disrupt this organization and the power and information flows. Shannon’s information theory for communications channels can then be applied as a health metric to this “machine channel”. Ageing of components degrades machine functional health. To prognose future health, differential equations that model ageing of the machine’s components are formulated and solved.
