500|$|Nelson {{said the}} video's {{production}} was ambitious, stating: [...] "It's an incredible challenge {{to make a}} creative clip of a song without the artist." [...] He goes onto say that Coolio helped enormously {{because he was the}} first to commit to his role as the bellboy. <b>Nelson</b> <b>says</b> that Coolio's role [...] "provides the thread that weaves together the entire concept of the video." [...] Yvette Lang, who executive produced the clip for F.M. Rocks, described the filming to be like a [...] "big party" [...] to show their support for Shakur. Ice-T's role as the hotel concierge was not originally intended. At first, there was a comedian set to play his role, but he ended up cancelling at the last minute. Since Ice-T was only available to shoot in the morning, Nelson decided to make him the concierge. The director called it a [...] "strange blessing" [...] since he is more memorable as a concierge, rather than his intended role.|$|E
500|$|In Venezuela, {{debate about}} The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is [...] "often acrimonious". The film has become key to framing people's {{understanding}} {{of the events of}} April 2002. The previously accepted international view was that Chávez's ousting came from a [...] "spontaneous popular response" [...] to the repression of his regime; the film [...] "directly contradicts" [...] this position, and since its release it has rapidly become [...] "the prevailing interpretation of [...] ". The film's critics charge that it omits or misrepresents important events. Much of the criticism is centered on the filmmakers' [...] "use of stock [...] devices", such as compositing clips from several events to present them as one incident. Parallel editing also depicts sequences as if they occurred at the same time, when some of the footage was captured on different days. Bartley and ÓBriain justify these methods as standard practice in the construction of documentary realist films. Caracas-based journalist Phil Gunson, writing in Columbia Journalism Review, says that most of the film critics who embraced the film ignored [...] "the complex, messy reality" [...] of the situation. He charges that the filmmakers [...] "omit key facts, invent others, twist the sequence of events to support their case, and replace inconvenient images with others dredged from archives". Bartley and ÓBriain argue that Gunson's points are [...] "issues of dispute" [...] that [...] "continue to divide opinion" [...] in Venezuela. Author Brian A. <b>Nelson</b> <b>says</b> that Bartley and ÓBriain—in their initial meeting with Chávez—did more than merely invoke the Irish general Daniel O'Leary to gain the president's support for filming; Nelson alleges that they offered to portray the president positively in return for open access, with a [...] "you scratch my back if I scratch yours" [...] understanding that he says was ultimately reflected in the film's [...] "unabashed pro-Chavismo." ...|$|E
500|$|When Æthelwulf succeeded to {{the throne}} of Wessex in 839, his {{experience}} as sub-king of Kent had given him valuable training in kingship, and he in turn made his own sons sub-kings. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, on his accession [...] "he gave to his son Æthelstan {{the kingdom of the}} people of Kent, and the kingdom of the East Saxons [...] and of the people of Surrey and of the South Saxons [...] ". However, Æthelwulf did not give Æthelstan the same power as his father had given him, and although Æthelstan attested his father's charters as king, he {{does not appear to have}} been given the power to issue his own charters. Æthelwulf exercised authority in the south-east and made regular visits there. He governed Wessex and Kent as separate spheres, and assemblies in each kingdom were only attended by the nobility of that country. The historian Janet <b>Nelson</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "Æthelwulf ran a Carolingian-style family firm of plural realms, held together by his own authority as father-king, and by the consent of distinct élites." [...] He maintained his father's policy of governing Kent through ealdormen appointed from the local nobility and advancing their interests, but gave less support to the church. In 843 Æthelwulf granted ten hides at Little Chart to Æthelmod, the brother of the leading Kentish ealdorman Ealhere, and Æthelmod succeeded to the post on his brother's death in 853. In 844 Æthelwulf granted land at Horton in Kent to Ealdorman Eadred, with permission to transfer parts of it to local landowners; in a culture of reciprocity, this created a network of mutual friendships and obligations between the beneficiaries and the king. Archbishops of Canterbury were firmly in the West Saxon king's sphere. His ealdormen enjoyed a high status, and were sometimes placed higher than the king's sons in lists of witnesses to charters. His reign is the first for which there is evidence of royal priests, and Malmesbury Abbey regarded him as an important benefactor, who is said to have been the donor of a shrine for the relics of Saint Aldhelm.|$|E

But due to Bethany's busy life, {{balancing}} her classes in what was to be her final semester at GMU with a full-time job, they had gotten used to not hearing from her for several days at a time, so they were not worried as February 2011 began without any news from her.

2500|$|As {{documented}} in Crewmember Bill Nelson's book [...] "Mission: An American Congressman's Voyage to Space", and {{as reported in}} Spaceflight Insider, [...] "The launch attempt on Jan. 6, 1986 was halted at T-31 seconds. The weather was perfect for the scheduled launch at dawn, but a failure of a liquid oxygen drain valve prevented it to close properly.

2500|$|May {{says that}} Oxford's poetry was [...] "one man's {{contribution}} to the rhetorical mainstream of an evolving Elizabethan poetic" [...] indistinguishable from [...] "the output of his mediocre mid-century contemporaries". C. S. Lewis said that de Vere's poetry shows [...] "a faint talent", but is [...] "for the most part undistinguished and verbose." [...] <b>Nelson</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "contemporary observers such as Harvey, Webbe, Puttenham, and Meres clearly exaggerated De Vere's talent in deference to his rank. By any measure, his poems pale in comparison with those of Sidney, Lyly, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, and Jonson." [...] He says that his known poems are [...] "astonishingly uneven" [...] in quality, ranging from the [...] "fine" [...] to the [...] "execrable".|$|E
2500|$|The {{one thing}} these two {{different}} women share is their name: Holly Solomon. Solomon the art dealer {{was one of}} Nelson’s major influences, helping him find his style, which often features shapes, patterns, and words. His 2013 exhibition title “Polka Dots for Holly Solomon," [...] is fitting. Based heavily on pattern and decoration, Nelson uses the polka dot as both object and non-object, while incorporating “affirmations” as text jargon and a nod to society’s obsession with the pursuit of happiness. Taking its cue from its name, Polka Dots For Holly Solomon is a large-scale installation of polka dot patterns and subliminal messages presented across an array of two-dimensional and three-dimensional surfaces. <b>Nelson</b> <b>says</b> that the intention behind his new work is to “mean something and mean nothing at all. I {{like to think of}} it as ‘non-conceptualism’.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Eleven {{year old}} Nelson and her father, Robert, while {{speaking}} to journalists outside their home defended the journal's decision to put nude Nelson on its cover, with <b>Nelson</b> <b>saying</b> that the photo [...] "is {{one of my}} favourites, if not my favourite photo, my mum has ever taken of me and she has taken so many photos of me. I think that the picture my mum took of me {{had nothing to do}} with being abused and I think nudity can be a part of art.

2500|$|Chávez used a {{strategy}} of polarization in Venezuela, a them against us situation, in order to single out those who {{stood in the way}} of his progress. He would insult and use name calling against original supporters that would question him; the media, business leaders, the Catholic Church and the middle class. Such [...] "words spawned hatred and polarization" [...] with Chávez, [...] "a master of language and communication", creating his own reality among Venezuelans. <b>Nelson</b> <b>says</b> that what hurt Chávez's popularity the most was his relationship with Fidel Castro and Cuba, with Chávez attempting to make Venezuela in Cuba's image. Venezuela became Cuba's largest trade partner while Chávez, following Castro's example, consolidated the country's bicameral legislature into a single National Assembly that gave him more power and created community groups of loyal supporters allegedly trained as paramilitaries. Such actions created great fear among Venezuelans who felt like they were tricked and that Chávez had dictatorial goals. This feeling of being tricked especially affected the media since they originally supported Chávez and his promises.|$|E
2500|$|A legend {{involving}} naval rum and Horatio <b>Nelson</b> <b>says</b> {{that following}} his victory and {{death at the}} Battle of Trafalgar, Nelson's body was preserved in a cask of rum to allow transportation back to England. Upon arrival, however, the cask was opened and found to be empty. The [...] body was removed and, upon inspection, {{it was discovered that}} the sailors had drilled a hole {{in the bottom of the}} cask and drunk all the rum, hence the term [...] "Nelson's blood" [...] being used to describe rum. It also serves as the basis for the term tapping the admiral being used to describe surreptitiously sucking liquor from a cask through a straw. The details of the story are disputed, as many historians claim the cask contained French brandy, whilst others claim instead the term originated from a toast to Admiral Nelson. Variations of the story, involving different notable corpses, have been in circulation for many years. The official record states merely that the body was placed in [...] "refined spirits" [...] and does not go into further detail.|$|E
6000|$|The lagoon in Keeling atoll is shallow; in the atolls of the Low Archipelago {{the depth}} varies from 20 to 38 fathoms, {{and in the}} Marshall Group, {{according}} to Chamisso, from 30 to 35; in the Caroline atolls {{it is only a}} little less. Within the Maldiva atolls there are large spaces with 45 fathoms, and some soundings are laid down of 49 fathoms. The greater part of the bottom in most lagoons, is formed of sediment; large spaces have exactly the same depth, or the depth varies so insensibly, that it is evident that no other means, excepting aqueous deposition, could have leveled the surface so equally. In the Maldiva atolls this is very conspicuous, and likewise in some of the Caroline and Marshall Islands. In the former large spaces consist of sand and SOFT CLAY; and Kotzebue speaks of clay having been found within one of the Marshall atolls. No doubt this clay is calcareous mud, similar to that at Keeling Island, and to that at Bermuda already referred to, as undistinguishable from disintegrated chalk, and which Lieutenant <b>Nelson</b> <b>says</b> is called there pipe-clay. (I may here observe that on the coast of Brazil, where there is much coral, the soundings near the land are described by Admiral Roussin, in the [...] "Pilote du Bresil", as siliceous sand, mingled with much finely comminuted particles of shells and coral. Further in the offing, for a space of 1,300 miles along the coast, from the Abrolhos Islands to Maranham, the bottom in many places is composed of [...] "tuf blanc, mele ou forme de madrepores broyes." [...] This white substance, probably, is analogous to that which occurs within the above-mentioned lagoons; it is sometimes, according to Roussin, firm, and he compares it to mortar.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 April 1990 a {{monument}} to McElwaine was erected in Corlat, County Monaghan.

50|$|Watson contended {{in a major}} {{championship}} {{for the first time}} at the U.S. Open in 1974 at Winged Foot, but he faded badly in the final round after having the 54-hole lead. Following this disappointment, Watson was approached in the locker room by legendary retired player Byron Nelson, a broadcaster at the event, who offered encouragement, insight and assistance. Nelson and Watson spoke briefly at that time, with <b>Nelson</b> <b>saying</b> he liked Watson's game and aggressiveness, and offered to help him improve. Watson, although disappointed by his weak finish, was flattered to receive Nelson's interest. However, the two men did not manage to get together to work on golf in depth until several months later, when Watson played in the Tour's Byron Nelson Classic in the Dallas area, and visited Nelson's nearby home. The two men would eventually develop a close and productive teacher-student relationship and friendship; Nelson had similarly mentored the young rising star Ken Venturi during the 1950s.|$|R
