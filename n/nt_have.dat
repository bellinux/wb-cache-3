The first experimental craft (later christened Friedrichshafen) of the type ″Zeppelin NT″ flew in September 1997. Though larger than common blimps, the Neue Technologie (New Technology) zeppelins are much smaller than their giant ancestors and not actually Zeppelin-types in the classical sense. They are sophisticated semirigids. Apart from the greater payload, their main advantages compared to blimps are higher speed and excellent maneuverability.

Dark Vapor then summons Uglien, {{although he is}} easily distracted by an ice cream cone, which Spuck seemingly pulls out of his behind. Right as Spuck and Kwirk {{believe that they are}} victorious, the monolith is stolen by Darth Vapor's henchman, Mini-Maul (A play on Darth Maul and Mini-Me), flying his Bow-Tie Fighter. Kwirk and Spuck secretly follow him onto Dark Vapor's starship, where a fight ensues. Meanwhile, Kwirk's mechanic, Mr. Squatty realizes the monolith's battery died and it just needed a jump start. The monolith is then repaired, and Captain Kwirk dispatches Mini-Maul by knocking him down into a pit of what appears to be liquid feces. Meanwhile, Mr. Spuck dispatches the rest of Vapor's henchmen in an asteroid field with a 12-gauge shotgun. Kwirk is reunited on the Consolationprize with Spuck, and he makes the discovery that the enemies' designation is pure gas. They dispatch Dark Vapor by launching a missile into his ship. With evil now vanquished, Captain Kwirk wonders why RoboFuzz and <b>N.T.</b> <b>have</b> not been returned to their respective universes. The Star Child then appears on their screen, and informs them that they have yet to battle the true evil, and to defeat it they must unite with their enemies. Kwirk, Spuck, Vapor, and Mini-Maul are then transported to a desert wasteland, where they meet Jar Jar Sucks. For a reason they can't explain, they all suddenly feel pure hatred toward him, and attack. They tie him up with his own tongue, and throw him over a cliff.

In sheep, homoplasmy is maintained since mtDNA {{is transmitted from}} the oocyte (recipient) only.

The mitochondrial triplasmy following M. mulatta NT reported here forces concerns regarding the parental origins of mtDNA in clinically reconstructed eggs.

40|$|Non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) {{have emerged}} as a vast and {{heterogeneous}} portion of eukaryotic transcriptomes. Several ncRNA families, either short (200 <b>nt),</b> <b>have</b> been described and implicated {{in a variety of}} biological processes, from translation to gene expression regulation and nuclear trafficking. Most probably, other families are still to be discovered. Computational methods for ncRNA research require different approaches from the ones normally used in the prediction of protein-coding genes. Indeed, primary sequence alone is often insufficient to infer ncRNA functionality, whereas secondary structure and local conservation of portions of the transcript could provide useful information for both the prediction and the functional annotation of ncRNAs. Here we present an overview of computational methods and bioinformatics resources currently available for studying ncRNA genes, introducing the common themes as well as the different approaches required for long and short ncRNA identification and annotation. ...|$|E

In addition, presence of only very low amounts of iso-aspartyl methyl transferase (IMT) activity at the onset of stationary phase and lower survival ability in early stationary phase in contrast to that of S. cerevisiae lend support to the ideas that (a) lower degree of survival of C. utilis in the stationary phase may be a direct consequence of inability to mobilise stored trehalose due to absence of intracellular AT and reduced levels of IMT activities and (b) trehalose may have a dual role vis-à-vis stress resistance in yeasts...|$|E
