5|$|Day {{was born}} to glass factory worker Ellis Day and his wife Hattie Leet in Alexandria, Virginia, a city seven miles from Washington, D.C, on October 30, 1916. His family, which {{included}} five other siblings, moved the following year to Mount Winans, a predominantly black community in a poor area of Southwest Baltimore, in a residence situated on Pierpont Street that lacked electricity and indoor plumbing. At a young age, Day became enamored with baseball, often playing local sandlot games or taking the long walk from his <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> Maryland Ball Park where he watched the Baltimore Black Sox.|$|E

5|$|Milk {{moved from}} New York City to San Francisco in 1972 amid a {{migration}} {{of gay and}} bisexual men to the Castro District. He {{took advantage of the}} growing political and economic power of the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> promote his interests, and three times ran unsuccessfully for political office. His theatrical campaigns earned him increasing popularity, and Milk won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977, his election made possible by, and a key component of, a shift in San Francisco politics.|$|E

It is generally the western boundary of the Streeterville <b>neighborhood,</b> <b>to</b> its east and River North to the west.|$|E
5|$|The South Jacksonville {{community}} emerged {{after the}} American Civil War and incorporated in 1907.

Since the 1990s, the neighborhood has seen several historic preservation and redevelopment projects. It is home to fourteen city parks, several schools and other amenities.|$|E

5|$|MD151 {{enters the}} city of Baltimore just west of its {{intersection}} with Rolling Mill Road and Kane Street. The state highway passes under I-95, a Norfolk Southern Railway railyard, and the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. At North Point Road, MD151's name changes to Erdman Avenue and the highway veers west to pass under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. The state highway veers northwest at its crossing of I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) just before the highway's cloverleaf interchange with US40 (Pulaski Highway), which also includes a ramp from southbound MD151 to southbound I-895. Connections between eastbound US40 and northbound MD151 are made via Mapleton Avenue just east of I-895. MD151 continues northwest concurrent with US40Truck as a six-lane boulevard between the Armistead Gardens <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> the east and industrial facilities on the west. The state highway passes by Archbishop Curley High School and through the Belair-Edison neighborhood before reaching its northern terminus at US1 (Belair Road), onto which US40Truck turns west. Erdman Avenue continues northwest as a two-lane street along {{the eastern edge of}} Clifton Park to MD147 (Harford Road).|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
5|$|The Puncheon Run Connector {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with US 13 in Dover, {{heading to the}} northeast as a four-lane freeway. After passing over State Street, the freeway curves {{to the east and}} passes between woods to the south and residential and commercial development to the north. The road crosses over the marshy St. Jones River and continues east-northeast, passing between a residential <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> the south and the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) headquarters to the north before coming to an eastbound exit and westbound entrance at Bay Road. Immediately after the Bay Road interchange, the Puncheon Run Connector merges into northbound DE 1 a short distance to the north of Dover Air Force Base.|$|E

5|$|The {{city has}} {{recognized}} {{the historic district}} in its zoning code. It divides the area into six separate districts — the Riverfront, First, Second, Third, Fourth Street and Fifth Avenue local historic districts. The Riverfront district includes the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> the northwest listed on the National Register as the Northern River Street Historic District. The other five are roughly aligned with the eponymous streets, with the First Street district consisting of two detached areas, the Second and Third street districts taking {{up most of the}} central area and the other two occupying the northeastern corner of the district. The city has also made some grants and tax exemptions available to qualified property owners. The city's current master plan calls for enhancing the district's mixed-use character, by encouraging both residential use and businesses that serve consumers, particularly retailers, and providing tax incentives for the rehabilitation of historic homes.|$|E
5|$|While {{several new}} {{buildings}} have been planned, {{many of the}} changes that had been proposed to the Ghetto in the previous master plan are no longer included in the new plan. The largest feature affecting the student neighborhoods is a new building to the east of Alberta Street, between Chambers Street and Obell Court, on the Darkside. According to the draft of the master plan, the building is intended to be a sustainable residence hall, a 75- to 90-bed facility that would also include an educational wing. The proposed building would use technologies such as solar energy, geothermal heating and cooling, compost piles and low-flow showers. The plan also calls for a walk/bike greenway to link the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> the core of campus and the athletic complex.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{residents}} began {{leaving the}} Woodbridge neighborhood for the suburbs. New residents to Woodbridge were less affluent. In the 1960s, the city cleared areas {{adjacent to the}} <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> support revitalization. The residents of Woodbridge organized a Citizen's District Council to preserve the neighborhood, and successfully managed to stabilize and preserve many of the remaining homes. Recent activity has shifted perception of Woodbridge from that of an up-and-coming <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> a hotbed of urban revitalization, with the few properties that come up for sale typically subject to bidding wars.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 {{study by}} the Department of Neighborhoods agrees on where to place {{the north end of}} the district, but puts its {{southern}} boundary at Columbia Street (a block north of Yesler Way at the water's edge).

Above Battery Street, they consider the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>to</b> extend only to Elliott Avenue, taking in facilities such as the World Trade Center. The southern cutoff at Columbia Street completely excludes the Pioneer Square neighborhood, while the extension inland to First Avenue means that they consider the former warehouse district along Western Avenue and the entire Pike Place Market Historical District as part of the Central Waterfront.|$|E
