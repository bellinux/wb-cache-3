40|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} Brigham Young 2 ̆ 7 s theology was his {{inclusion of a}} cosmology in his teachings. In his speeches as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Young juxtaposed cosmological pronouncements with practical advice. Young regularly opined on such topics as the eternal nature of matter and light and the interaction of gods and humans with these substances. Dovetailed to his cosmic musings was down-to-earth advice on raising children, avoiding the evils of the gold rush, and controlling one 2 ̆ 7 s temper. This paper argues that Young 2 ̆ 7 s mingling of the abstruse with the mundane functioned as a theodicy for the nineteenth-century Mormons. In order to justify an omnipotent God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon suffering and persecution, Young framed God and the human experience within a cosmology. He taught that humans exist with {{the express purpose of}} accumulating light and truth. This accumulation would continue after death throughout eternity. Young taught that an ineluctable factor in this progression was suffering and for this reason, Young condoned God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon hardship. By weaving these cosmological teachings with his pragmatic counsel, Young taught the Latter-day Saints to view their daily lives [...] full of struggles, pain, and fear [...] within a cosmological framework. Young believed that such a mindset would bolster the faith of the benighted Mormons...|$|R

Here, child day care is layed on a spectrum one end of which offers maximum market freedom in the form of income redistribution, a negative income tax, children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance,</b> or other transfer assistance, to be spent on the market if so desired for day care services, and {{on the other end of}} the spectrum a system of comprehensive child day care centers. In between are various mixtures of the two and various special blends like voucher systems.

Various day care policy options are discussed in relationship to assumptions that they make about cost, theories of child development, definitions of universality, the preference of parents, returns to scale, economic rationality, market responsiveness, quality, consumer democracy, and citizen control. Finally three central issues which lie outside of this analysis, freedom, political environment, and the target group to whom day care should be directed are discussed. In this discussion the point is made that day care is best conceived of as directed toward mothers not toward children or families. It is the mother who is most in need of the benefit of day care policy most of the time and to whom reasonable policy of day care should be directed. This consideration quite alters what seem fairly reasonable conclusions in favor of market day care in favor of day care by voucher or by direct service...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} 10 years, much {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on the importance of breakfast for people of all ages. Nutritionists have pointed out that persons who eat a hearty breakfast show fewer signs of mid-morning fatigue, have or develop better work habits, and do not get as hungry as those who eat little or no breakfast. Many people do not realize the importance of starting the day with a good breakfast. The 12 to 13 hour fast which the body undergoes from the evening meal until breakfast time requires the consumption of an adequate breakfast. Many poor breakfasts may be attributed to either failure {{to take the time to}} eat, or to not understanding the necessity of an adequate breakfast. Nationwide surveys report that a large number of adolescents and adults fail to receive the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of their caloric and nutrient needs at breakfast. A basic breakfast pattern has been developed to aid in planning an adequate breakfast that will supply 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the calories and other nutrients needed each day. It includes fruit, cereal and/or egg, milk, bread and butter, yet it allows for a wide variation in menus. it is economical and can be easy to prepare. A breakfast of these foods insures one of less morning fatigue and better feeling during the morning and all day long. Studies show that breakfast is the most frequently missed meal. Many of the subjects who did not eat breakfast had a total day 2 ̆ 7 s intake that was classified as poor. Eating two meals a day failed to make up for the deficiency in nutrients. Breakfast consumption shows a direct relationship to the diet score, proof of the fact omitting breakfast is a poor start for the day. At the ages when an individual needs a larger intake of calories and nutrients, many times there is an actual decrease in the intake of nutritions food. The adolescents are noted for this inverse relationship between their nutritive needs and their actual intake. Galloway and Wilcox (1954), in a Utah study of school children, found that the breakfast meal did not furnish the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the day 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of calories and many of the other nutrients. The noon and evening meals furnished a larger percentage of most nutrients to their diets. The number of children in the study by Galloway, et al., (1954) was somewhat limited. To obtain a better picture of Utah school children 2 ̆ 7 s breakfast habits, 799 dietary records on file in the Foods and Nutrition Laboratory and 495 records collected this school year (1956 - 57) were evaluated.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governmental}} agencies have increasingly turned to market based {{cap and trade}} programs to control the emission of pollutants. Firms subject to cap and trade regulation are typically required to acquire emissions allowances via open auction markets. The cost to acquire allowances may impose a substantial financial burden on a firm. While emissions reduction efforts may eliminate some firm 2 ̆ 7 s need to acquire additional allowances, there are still numerous firms that need to purchase additional allowances on the open market. This study presents a new forward buying heuristic, designed for those firms that need to purchase emissions allowances via auctions, which reduces the impact of emissions allowance acquisitions on the firms 2 ̆ 7 financial performance. The heuristic, designated as the Newsvendor Production Planning with Emissions Allowance Forward Buying (NPPAFB) method, applies a forward buying algorithm {{to determine the number}} of periods for which to forward buy allowances, the current production order up to level, and the current and future emissions allowance requirements (which serves as the order up to level for allowance purchases). Additionally, NPPAFB also authorizes unused emissions allowances to be sold when market conditions are favorable. Compared against three existing production planning and allowance procurement strategies, a simulation exercise finds that the NPPAFB method significantly reduces a firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> emissions <b>allowance</b> expenditures. These results indicate that heuristic can be readily adopted by any firm that is required to procure emissions allowances via open markets in an effort to improve the firm 2 ̆ 7 s profitability...|$|R

When including realistic concentrations for species not measured by ATMOS, i. e., the source gases CH 3 CCl 3, and C 2 F 3 Cl 3 below 25 km, and the reservoirs ClO, HOCl and COFCl between 15 and 40 km (five gases actually measured by other techniques), the 30 -degrees-N zonal 1985 mean total mixing ratio of chlorine, Cl, was found to be equal to (2. 58 +/- 0. 10) ppbv (parts per billion by volume) throughout the stratosphere, with no significant decrease near the stratopause.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{two questions}} of consumers' motor vehicle purchase and utilization. Both {{are related to}} policy variation induced by the U. <b>S.</b> Car <b>Allowance</b> Rebate System, better known as "Cash for Clunkers. " First, we directly investigate the impact of Cash for Clunkers, which was an economic stimulus program aimed at increasing new vehicle spending by subsidizing the replacement of older vehicles. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show the increase in sales during the two month program was completely offset during the following seven to nine months, consistent with previous research. However, we also find the program's fuel efficiency restrictions induced the purchase of more fuel efficient but less expensive vehicles, thereby reducing industry revenues by three billion dollars over the entire nine to eleven month period. This highlights {{the conflict between the}} stimulus and environmental objectives of the policy. Second, we investigate a related topic. Due to the high political costs of raising the tax rate on gasoline, the United States government combats the negative externalities associated with gasoline consumption by regulating the fuel efficiency of new cars sold. However, the success of these Corporate Average Fuel Economy restrictions depends crucially on whether inducing households to drive more fuel efficient cars causes them to drive more miles, which would offset {{some or all of the}} reduction in gasoline consumption. We examine this question by applying a regression discontinuity design to exploit the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency induced among new car buyers in Texas during the Cash for Clunkers program in 2009. While new car buyers whose "clunker" was barely eligible for the subsidy drove a similar number of miles per year prior to the policy and are similar in other ways to barely ineligible new car buyers, they bought significantly more fuel efficient vehicles. However, they did not respond by driving more miles following the program. As a result, the increased fuel economy reduced gasoline consumption proportionally. This suggests that behavioral responses do not undermine the effectiveness of fuel efficiency standards...|$|R

40|$|Small firms {{often have}} {{inadequate}} {{access to the}} capital necessary for sucessful management. The Swedish Government introduced in the mid- 1990 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> rules that facilitate retention of profit for sole proprietorships and partnership firms. The tax credits arising from the allowances give certain benefits {{as a source of}} financing compared to traditional forms of credits. Among the more essential benefits are that the payment for some parts of the tax credit can be put on hold almost indefinitely, or alternatively never be paid. The firms are free to use these means, and the responsibility of future payment of the postponed tax debt stays with the individual firms. The comprehensive purpose of the dissertation may be stated as to increase the understanding of small Swedish firms, especially sole proprietorships, utilizing possibilities for allowances for income smoothing and internal financing. At the beginning the dissertation describes case studies, comprising a smaller selection of microfirms. With a starting-point from the accounted and reported income-tax returns, alternative calculations are made where additional positive tax and finance effects appear possible to obtain. One purpose of these studies is to increase the insight regarding the possibilities of income smoothing and internal financing that arise from utilizing these allowances. These studies also illuminate, to what extent and in what way they are being used in reality. Another objective of these studies is to give a more substantive insight into the technics behind the different allowances, appropriation to positive or negative interest rate allocation appropriation or dissolving of tax allocation reserve appropriation or dissolving of “expansion fund” Theories regarding the creation of resources, through building of capital, and theories on financial planning and strategy are studied. The purpose is to find support for the choice of theoretical grounded underlying independent variables {{that can be used in}} cross-sectional studies to explain the use of the possibilities of appropriations. Theories of finance that are of greatest interest, in the operationalisation of these variables, are theories that discuss the choices of different financing alternatives for small firms. The “pecking order theory”, describes the firm’s order of priority when choices of finance alternatives are made. The concept of “financial bootstrapping” expands the frame for different forms of financing choices that especially very small firms have at their disposal. The last part of the theoretical frame deals with the phenomenon of “income smoothing,” which can be translated as leveling out profits/losses. A number of financial and non-financial variables are supported by and operationalised from these financial theories e. g., return on sales, capital turnover, quick ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, respectively age, gender and line of business. Cross-sectional studies are implemented for the taxation years of 1996 and 1999, on databases that have been extracted from Statistics Sweden. The group of 87, 276 sole proprietorships included in the study were required to complete tax returns and pay taxes for the business activity according to the supporting schedule, N 2, information from the sole proprietorships’ income statement and balance sheet in an accounting statement that comes with the income tax return form. The possibilities of allowances are considered as dependent variables. The intention of the cross-sectional studies is to survey and describe the utilization of possible allowances, with the support of the financial and non-financial independent variables. The connection of these variables to the decision of sole proprietorships to appropriate to the tax allocation reserve is also summarized in a logistic regression model. A number of theoretically based propositions are made for the purpose of observing how the variables are connected to the chances that sole proprietorships actually appropriate to this form of allowance. Appropriation to the tax allocation reserve stands out as the most practiced form of allowance. The studies also clarify that utilization varies among different forms of allowances, but that not all firms that have the prerequisites to utilize the possibilities really do so to the full. A further utilization of the different possibilities of allowances is often conceivable. For the sole proprietorships that are not utilizing these possibilities, the allowances should be considered eligible as a contribution to internal financing and to increase access to capital...|$|R

Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients have an increased need for ascorbic acid, because of increased loss through dialysate, reduced intake owing to nausea and loss of appetite, and increased oxidative stress. However, optimum intake is still controversial. We studied 50 clinically stable patients to determine the relationship between oral ascorbic acid intake and serum ascorbic acid (SAA) level. Total oral intake ranged from 28 mg daily to 412 mg daily. Only one patient had an oral intake of ascorbic acid below 60 mg per day. The SAA levels ranged from 1 mg/L to 36. 17 mg/L. Although a strong correlation existed between intake and SAA (p < 0. 001, R 2 = 0. 47), the variation in SAA at any given intake level was wide. Of the studied patients, 62 % had an SAA < 8. 7 mg/L, 40 % had an SAA < 5. 1 mg/L (below the level in a healthy population), and 12 % had a level below 2 mg/L (scorbutic). None of the patients demonstrated clinical manifestations of scurvy. Our results show that, in CAPD patients, ascorbic acid deficiency can be reliably detected only with SAA measurements, and oral intake may influence SAA level.

40|$|We have {{recently}} completed a search of 6 years of archival BATSE data for gamma-ray bursts (GRBS) that were too faint to activate the real-time burst detection system running on board the spacecraft. These "nontriggered" bursts can be combined with the "triggered" bursts detected on board to produce a GRB intensity distribution that reaches peak fluxes a factor of approximately 2 lower than could be studied previously. The value of the statistic (in Euclidean space) for the bursts we detect is 0. 177 plus or minus 0. 006. This surprisingly low value is obtained because we detected very few bursts on the 4. 096 s and 8. 192 s timescales (where most bursts have their highest signal-to-noise ratio) that were not already detected on the 1. 024 <b>s</b> timescale. If <b>allowance</b> is made for a power-law distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities, the extended peak flux distribution is consistent with models in which the redshift distribution of the gamma-ray burst rate approximately traces the star formation history of the universe. We argue that this class of models is preferred over those in which the burst rate is independent of redshift. We use the peak flux distribution to derive a limit of 10 % (99 % confidence) on the {{fraction of the total}} burst rate that could be contributed by a spatially homogeneous (in Euclidean space) subpopulation of burst sources, such as type lb/c supernovae.

The use prevalence of DS—including VMS, tonic medicines, manufactured health food supplements, cordial food supplements, and drink rehabilitators—was 54 %. VMS were taken most frequently, followed by tonic medicines and manufactured health food supplements. VMS use was highest in individuals who had a significant concern for their overall health and in those from families with a high socioeconomic level and with parental use of DS. Total daily study time of DS users was only slightly longer than that of nonusers. The VMS most frequently used were vitamin C and multivitamins. More than 46 % of other DS users, and 58 % of VMS users, had increased their intake of supplements during third grade relative to the previous year. VMS users had a more positive view of the potential health benefit of VMS than did nonusers. Vitamin and mineral intakes from VMS occurred over a wide range, with mean intakes typically exceeding the Korean and Canadian-U. <b>S.</b> Recommended Dietary <b>Allowances.</b> For {{a significant number of}} individuals, intakes of vitamin A, niacin, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and zinc exceeded the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels. Given the widespread use of DS by older teenagers, the contribution of these supplements to their overall health and well-being is a subject that clearly merits additional study...|$|R

40|$|The {{difficulties}} of locating earthquakes {{in the early}} instrumental period are not always fully appreciated. The networks were sparse, and the instruments themselves were of low gain, often had inappropriate frequency response and recording resolution, and their timing could be unreliable and inaccurate. Additionally, there was only limited knowledge of earth structure and consequent phase identification and propagation. The primitive Zöppritz tables for P and <b>S,</b> with no <b>allowance</b> for the core, did not come into use until 1907, and remained the main model until {{the adoption of the}} Jeffreys-Bullen tables in the mid- 1930 s. It was not until the early 1920 s that studies of Hindu Kush earthquakes revealed that earthquake foci could have significant depth. Although many early locations are creditably accurate, others can be improved by use of more modern techniques. Early earthquakes in unusual places often repay closer investigation. Many events after about 1910 are well enough recorded to be re-located by computer techniques, but earlier locations can still be improved by using more recent knowledge and simpler techniques, such as phase re-identification and graphical re-location. One technique that helps with early events is to locate events using the time of the maximum phase of surface waves, which is often well reported. Macroseismic information is also valuable in giving confirmation of earthquake positions or helping to re-assess them, including giving indications of focal depth. For many events in the early instrumental period macroseismic locations are to be preferred to the poorly-controlled instrumental ones. Macroseismic locations can also make useful trial origins for computer re-location. Even more recent events, which appear to be well located, may be grossly in error due to mis-interpretation of phases and inadequate instrumental coverage. A well converging mathematical solution does not always put the earthquake in the right place, and computer location programs may give unrealistically small estimates of error. Examples are given of improvements in locations of particular earthquakes {{in various parts of the}} world and in different time periods...|$|R
40|$|A {{sample of}} {{one hundred and fifty}} college seniors used the items of the Bem Sex-Role Inventory to describe: (1) themselves; (2) their own ideal selves; (3) their ideal person of the other sex; and (4) the ideal man or woman they envisioned the other sex to hold of them [...] for women, a man 2 ̆ 7 s ideal woman, and, for men, a woman 2 ̆ 7 s ideal man. The study was in {{response}} to recent arguments that we need to re-think our notions of what is appropriate behavior for men and women, and to encourage each sex to acquire the positively valued attributes traditionally considered the domain of the other sex. Of primary interest were the direct comparisons of the masculine and feminine attributes subjects endorsed as characteristic of themselves and of each other in their various descriptions, with particular concern for how the ideals envisioned by each sex compared with those actually given by the other sex. A three-way analysis of variance was computed in order to obtain error terms for the post hoc comparisons of means. For these comparisons, Sheffe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Contrast <b>Allowances</b> were used. The findings indicated that the women in the sample were less sex-typed than were the men, who remained traditional throughout their descriptions. Patterns endorsed by the women tended toward 2 ̆ 2 androgyny, 2 ̆ 2 or a balance of masculine and feminine traits, whereas patterns endorsed by the men tended to conform to the respective stereotypes. Although the women described an androgynous ideal for themselves, they endorsed a traditional M 3 ̆eF pattern for their own ideal man, but they differed from tradition in simultaneously endowing him with feminine attributes equal to their own. The men envisioned this general pattern when they described a woman 2 ̆ 7 s ideal man, but underestimated the masculine attributes the women assigned to this ideal. Patterns endorsed by the men showed a pervasive tendency toward the traditional sex-stereotypes, the men viewing one constellation of attributes as antithetical to the other. They described themselves, both actually and ideally, as significantly higher in masculine than in feminine attributes. Similarly, the ideal woman they described was feminine at the expense of her masculine propensities. This masculine view of the ideal woman was correctly envisioned by the women in their descriptions of a man 2 ̆ 7 s ideal woman, but they exaggerated the magnitude of the discrepancy between masculine and feminine traits. The masculine view of the ideal woman was also widely discrepant with the women 2 ̆ 7 s actual and ideal views of themselves. An examination of the particular attributes endorsed by both sexes revealed that they both chose similar constellations of valued traits in all descriptions but one. In this one, the women showed a marked confusion about the feminine and masculine traits characteristic of a man 2 ̆ 7 s ideal woman, envisioning her as characterized by extreme sex-stereotypes. This view did not correspond with the description the men gave of their ideal woman. Rather, the men endowed her with masculine and feminine attributes closely resembling their own, and matching those by which the women characterized their own ideal selves. The findings of this study appear to be instructive for both women and men in that they clarify important aspects of their current perceptions of themselves and of each other. They also underscore some of the misperceptions of each with regard to the other...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether the {{performance}} of prelamb shorn sheep is influenced by pasture allowance in the immediate post-shearing period and whether the relationship between performance and pasture allowance differed according to whether the ewes were shorn by standard comb (SC) or cover comb (CC). The trial was replicated across two years to allow for climatic variations that occurred between seasons which could markedly affect results. Fifty four ewes were used in each year in a 3 x 3 x 2 factorial design with three shearing treatments (ST) (SC, CC, and unshorn), three sward surface height (SSH) (nominal 3, 5, and 7 cm) and two pregnancy-status treatments (single and twin). There was an interaction between ST and SSH which resulted in liveweight gains during the period from pregnancy day 115 (P 115) to P 135 of 275, 613 and 4518 g; 1557, 2314 and 3997 g; and 3623, 2894 and 3997 g for SC, CC and unshorn (control) ewes set-stocked on 3, 5, and 7 cm SSH, respectively. There were no effects of ST or SSH on lamb weaning weight, ewe wool growth rate or mean fibre diameter. There was no interaction between ST and SSH for lamb birth weight (LBW), but the LBW of lambs bom to SC ewes (4. 9 ± 0. 1 kg) was significantly heavier (P< 0. 05) than those of lambs born to unshorn (control) ewes (4. 3 ± 0. 1 kg). Rectal temperatures of SC or CC ewes were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than those of unshorn (control) ewes on day 2 following shearing (S 2), and on S 4, S 8, and <b>S</b> 20. Pasture <b>allowance,</b> however, did not affect rectal temperatures of shorn ewes. Blood concentrations of glucose, NEFA or 3 -OHB were not influenced by ST or SSH throughout the days of measurement. There were no effects of ST or SSH on ewe organic matter intake (OMI), except on the 2 nd day following shearing where the OMIs of ewes set-stocked on 3 cm (941 ± 147 g) were significantly lower than those ewes grazing 5 cm (1628 ± 101 g) or 7 cm (1349 ± 135 g) SSH pasture. The results suggested that hypothermia, as determined by rectal temperatures and induced by pre-lamb shearing, cannot be avoided by pasture management. Neither the use of a standard comb for pre-lamb shearing, nor a low pasture allowance (3 cm SSH) affected short- or longterm production parameters...|$|R
40|$|All {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis focuses {{on the role of}} copper in various biochemical processes. It appears that copper has various faces in laboratory animals. On the one hand, copper is an essential trace element, which implicates that a certain requirement for copper exists. On the other hand, copper may be involved in the formation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing the development of oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has been associated with reduced lifespan and various diseases as a consequence of oxidative damage at the (sub) cellular level. Copper may not only affect biochemical processes in laboratory animals, it may also be affected itself by endogenous and exogenous factors, such as dietary cholesterol. Furthermore, strain differences in hepatic copper content and hepatic copper concentration have been found, which can be (partly) explained by genetic differences. All studies {{described in this}} thesis, except the review in chapter 3, were performed in laboratory animals keeping the 3 R 9 ̆ 2 s of laboratory animal science (reduction, refinement and replacement) in mind. Some of the studies performed are {{for the benefit of the}} animal (chapter 2), in some studies the animal is used as a model (chapter 6 - 10) and in some studies, the animal was used as a model, but the results of the study could be used for the benefit of the animal (chapter 4 and 5). In case the animal was used as a model, the purpose of the experiment was to study mechanisms in vivo rather than in vitro. The overall conclusions are : (I.) Copper is an essential trace element, implicating that a certain copper requirement exists to compensate for endogenous losses. The dietary copper allowance for the NMRI outbred laboratory mouse, as determined in the study described in chapter 2, is 4 ppm Cu, which is lower than the NRC 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> estimated <b>allowance</b> of 6 ppm Cu for maintenance and 8 ppm for growing and lactating mice, but in line with results described by other authors. The difference in dietary copper allowance probably stems from the fact that the recommendation of the NRC is based on rats and on four studies in mice, of which three were not designed to study copper requirement. We feel that this study contributes to a soundly based estimated copper allowance for mice. (II.) Evidence for the involvement of copper in the formation of free radicals and ROS comes mainly from in vitro research (chapter 3). No evidence was found for copper-mediated oxidative damage at the (sub) cellular level (chapter 4) nor a reduced lifespan was found (chapter 5) in mice fed diets with increasing copper concentrations. These results raise serious questions about the likelihood of developing oxidative stress in other rodents or in human in vivo after high copper intakes. (III.) In literature, dietary cholesterol has been associated with reduced liver copper concentrations and/or liver copper content. Feeding a cholesterol-rich diet to rats did not affect the liver copper content. In rabbits, a decrease in the hepatic copper store was found only in the dietary cholesterol-susceptible inbred strain. The idea that cholesterol-susceptible animals will show a greater decrease in hepatic copper content after being fed a cholesterolrich diet thus could not be consistently confirmed. In both rabbits and rats a decrease in liver copper concentration was found, but the decrease in rats was probably due to diet-induced hepatomegaly. The reduced liver copper concentrations in rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet as described in literature may also be the result of dietary-induced hepatomegaly. (IV.) Strain differences in liver copper store and liver copper concentrations can (partly) be explained by genetic differences between the strains. QTL analysis can be helpful in identifying genes that are involved in such quantitative traits. Some of the QTLs found in rats may give a clue as to what genes are involved in copper regulation. In the rabbit, however, more research on the structure of the genome is needed before candidate genes for QTLs can be identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a food quality index that can provide {{practical}} information to both consumers and professional people. The Index of Food Quality (IFQ) is a simple computerized tool based on a concept of nutrient density. The IFQ was designed to organize and clarify the present body of food composition data into a form that is directly applicable to dietary problems. The IFQ provides a method of analyzing food quality based on energy needs. The nutrient contents of foods are compared to essential nutrient standards with calories as a common denominator. In developing the IFQ, the nutrient standards were usually derived from the FDA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> recommended Daily <b>Allowances</b> (USRDA), and the value of 2300 kcal represented an average adult requirement for energy. An index number of 2 ̆ 212 ̆ 2 for a particular nutrient in a given food indicates that the amount of that food yielding just sufficient energy per day to maintain weight and good health will also contain exactly the recommended daily allowance of that nutrient. We developed an index number for each nutrient in each food considered in this study. A profile of index numbers was then derived for each food. One can assess whether he is meeting the RDA by calculating whether the foods he eats additively give a value of one or greater for each nutrient area. A computer program was developed that computes the nutrient indices and prints them in tabular and bar graph forms. The program is written in FORTRAN and was developed for use with a Burroughs B 6700 digital computer, but is readily compatible with the IBM 360 / 40 system as well. The program can evaluate a single food, various foods, and combinations of foods (i. e., diets, menus, or recipes) by printing its (their) nutrient profile. The graphs reflect the nutrient quality of a food, whether it is used as a sole source of energy or as it usually contributes to the diet (serving size). Menus, recipes, and diet profiles are presented as the sum of the nutrient contents of their individual foods and are printed as composite graphs. Nutrient data is being stored on tape and on disk. As it becomes available, new data may be written out on the disk file for later intra or inter-program use, either adding to or updating old values in the library. The IFQ program is completely flexible because every parameter can be expanded and/or modified to fit the data at hand. It can be adjusted to represent guidelines for a general population or be tailored to reflect individual or special group needs. In general, the program can compare any type of data to a reference value and produce the results in a bar graph profile. Data input is minimal. The program requires only the processing of the entry cards and a single index value per food or ingredient to print a typical graph. Modification in output requires only a code change in the entry cards and/or the input of additional special nutrient values not already stored on disk. The efficiency and speed of the modern high-speed computer coupled with a program that requires a minimum of card handling makes the IFQ a useful, rapid, and inexpensive tool for nutritional analysis and planning...|$|R
