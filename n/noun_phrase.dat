5|$|Swedish {{used to have}} genitive {{that was}} placed {{at the end of}} the head of a <b>noun</b> <b>phrase.</b> In modern Swedish, it has become an {{enclitic}} -s, which attaches to the end of the <b>noun</b> <b>phrase,</b> rather than the noun itself.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa distinguishes {{two types}} of {{grammatical}} third person in sentences, marked on both verbs and animate nouns. The proximate form indicates a more salient <b>noun</b> <b>phrase,</b> and obviative indicates a less prominent <b>noun</b> <b>phrase.</b> Selection and use of proximate or obviative forms is a distinctive aspect of Ottawa syntax that indicates the relative discourse prominence of noun phrases containing third persons; {{it does not have}} a direct analogue in English grammar.|$|E
5|$|Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar {{includes}} animate and inanimate noun gender, subclasses of verbs {{that are}} dependent upon gender, combinations of prefixes and suffixes that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of word formation. Ottawa distinguishes {{two types of}} third person in sentences: proximate, indicating a <b>noun</b> <b>phrase</b> that is emphasized in the discourse, and obviative, indicating a <b>noun</b> <b>phrase</b> that is less prominent. Ottawa has relatively flexible word order compared with languages such as English.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a syntactic {{analysis of a}} fragment of Amharic <b>noun</b> <b>phrases.</b> Amharic <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> possess some peculiar characteristics especially relating to the syntax of the definite article. The definite article shows some morphological and distributional characteristics distinct from languages such as English and German, which {{makes it difficult to}} directly apply the methods proposed for these languages to the analysis of Amharic <b>noun</b> <b>phrases.</b> In this paper, we provide a formal analysis of Amharic <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> by combining the methods of the different approaches suggested for analyzing <b>noun</b> <b>phrases.</b> The result shows that the affixial treatment of the Amharic definite article better explains the facts regarding the syntax of Amharic <b>noun</b> <b>phrases.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|A {{complete}} Khmer sentence {{consists of}} four basic elements which include an optional topic, an optional subject, an obligatory predicate and various adverbials and particles. The topic and subject are noun phrases, predicates are verb phrases and another <b>noun</b> <b>phrase</b> acting as an object or verbal attribute often follows the predicate.|$|E
50|$|If animacy is involved, animate <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> {{tend to be}} proximate, and inanimate <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> tend to be obviative.|$|R

5|$|Tamil is a {{consistently}} head-final language. The verb {{comes at}} the end of the clause, with a typical word order of subject–object–verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the <b>noun</b> <b>phrase.</b> Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.|$|E
5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of {{definite}}ness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a <b>noun</b> <b>phrase.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire <b>noun</b> <b>phrase,</b> as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Discusses {{the use of}} <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> in the {{automatic}} indexing process of theses and dissertations deposited in the UFPE Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (BDTD-UFPE), {{on the assumption that}} <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> consist of a better knowledge unit for indexing and information retrieval that individual words, allowing an adequate response to the users information need when searching for information. It presentes {{the state of the art}} of <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> and their automatic extraction process, as well as its applicability in automatic indexing and information retrieval. Method: Based on text analysis tool (OGMA), analyses the applicability of the extraction of <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> in automatic indexing and information retrieval of thesis and dissertations in the context of BDTD-UFPE. Applied to abstracts from Law, Computer and Nutrition thesis and dissertations, the variables could be observed, allowing the research team assess the extraction of <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> using: the percentage of accuracy of relevant noun phrases; the error rate extract strings that are not <b>noun</b> <b>phrases,</b> and; the percentage of non relevant <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> extracted. Results: The process of extracting <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> by OGMA showed different performances for each graduate program, with better performance (better accuracy rate) for abstracts from Law Thesis and Dissertations, followed by Computer and Nutrition ones. This performance difference can be partly explained by the different nature of technical terms presented in the abstracts. Conclusions: It concludes that although there are limitations in the available tools, the application of automated methods of extraction and indexing by <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> appears to be quite promising, since the <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> are configured as best descriptors and access to documents, eliminating the problems caused by synonymy and polysemy of isolated words...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} studies {{the structure of}} phrase of the menu name taken from CempakaMinggu Ini (CMI). The objective {{of this research is}} to describe the phrase structure of Englishmenu names. Theory used in this research is based on the Brown & Miller, Hockett and Baker‘stheory. The result of this qualitative research shows that <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> are classified into 6 nounphrases consisting of determiner and <b>noun,</b> 29 <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> formed from pure adjective andnoun, 50 <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> formed from derivation adjective and noun, and 113 <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> formedfrom <b>noun</b> and noun...|$|R

25|$|Japanese {{does not}} employ {{relative}} pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents. Instead, the relative clause directly modifies the <b>noun</b> <b>phrase</b> as an attributive verb, occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective (before the <b>noun</b> <b>phrase).</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{exception}} involves relativising the oblique <b>noun</b> <b>phrase.</b>|$|E
25|$|In example (33), {{the scope}} adverb occurs {{outside of the}} Quantified <b>Noun</b> <b>Phrase</b> every man, which permits this {{quantifier}} to have scope over the entire sentence, thus allowing it to c-command the pronoun ta (or he). This allows he to {{be interpreted as a}} variable bound to the quantifier phrase every man. In contrast, in example (34) the scope adverb occurs within the Quantified <b>Noun</b> <b>Phrase,</b> causing the quantifier to only have scope over that <b>noun</b> <b>phrase.</b> It therefore cannot c-command the pronoun ta, and so the pronoun cannot be interpreted as a variable bound to the quantifier.|$|E
50|$|Thematic {{relations}} are properties of <b>nouns</b> and <b>noun</b> <b>phrases.</b> Theta roles {{can be assigned}} to any argument including <b>noun</b> <b>phrases,</b> prepositional phrases and embedded clauses.

50|$|It is {{uncommon}} in conversation {{for the subject}} and object of a verb to be realized by full <b>noun</b> <b>phrases.</b> Most often, the highly marked parallel <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> are used to indicate emphasis.

25|$|Tlingit {{word order}} is SOV when non-pronominal agent and object phrases both {{exist in the}} sentence. However, {{there is a strong}} urge to {{restrict}} the argument of the verb phrase to a single non-pronominal <b>noun</b> <b>phrase,</b> with any other phrases being extraposed from the verb phrase. If a <b>noun</b> <b>phrase</b> occurs outside of the verb phrase then it is typically represented in the verb phrase by an appropriate pronoun.|$|E
50|$|The {{representation}} of <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> using parse trees {{depends on the}} basic approach to syntactic structure adopted. The layered trees of many phrase structure grammars grant <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> an intricate structure that acknowledges a hierarchy of functional projections.

40|$|Common <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> {{have more}} than one {{interpretation}}. Ever since Carlson 1977, kind interpretation and object interpretation are assumed to be the two basic interpretations. Japanese bare nouns are more complex, since Japanese lacks overt determiners and nouns are ambiguous between existential interpretation and definite interpretation. Not only that, common <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> can be used as if they were proper nouns, for example, shushoo `prime minister 2 ̆ 7 can be used to refer to the specific individual. This paper discusses these various interpretations of <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> and how interpretations are determined in a given situation. My proposal is that the situation determines the interpretations of common <b>noun</b> <b>phrases.</b> Adding the notion of situation into the Derived Kind Predication (DKP), proposed by Chierchia 1998, relations of existential interpretation, definite interpretations and unique, proper-noun like interpretations of common <b>noun</b> <b>phrases</b> are explained uniformly and straightforwardly...|$|R
