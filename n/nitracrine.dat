40|$|Summary Hypoxic {{cells in}} solid tumours are {{resistant}} to ionizing radiation and may be refractory to treatment by many chemotherapeutic agents. For these reasons the identification of drugs with selective toxicity towards hypoxic cells is an important objective in cancer chemotherapy. Nitroimidazoles such as misonidazole demonstrate such hypoxia-selective toxicity but have very low dose potency. The 1 -nitroacridine derivative l-nitro- 9 -(dimethylaminopropylamino) acridine (<b>nitracrine)</b> binds reversibly to DNA but also forms covalent adducts with DNA in vivo. We have found <b>nitracrine</b> to be selectively toxic to the Chinese hamster ovary cell line AA 8 under hypoxic conditions in culture, with a potency approximately 100, 000 times {{higher than that of}} misonidazole. The effect of oxygen is not a simple dose-modifying one in this system, probably in part because of rapid metabolic inactivation of <b>nitracrine</b> under hypoxic conditions.

Hypoxic cells in solid tumours represent an important problem in radiotherapy because of their resistance to ionizing radiation. These same cells are likely to be refractory to many chemotherapeutic agents since clonogenic cells in regions of hypoxia arising from limited oxygen diffusion (Thomlinson & Gray, 1955) are probably largel...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the field}} of {{antitumor}} DNA-intercalating agents, 9 -anilinoacridines {{play an important role}} due to their antiproliferative properties. Several cancer chemotherapeutics such as amascrine and <b>nitracrine</b> have been developed as anticancer agents. In the present study, several 2 -methyl- 9 substituted (AS 0 – 8) acridines were synthesized by nucleophilic substitution of 2 -methyl- 9 -chloroacridine (AS) with aromatic amines. The structures of novel compounds were determined using spectroscopic methods. Three compounds were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against A- 549 (Human, small cell lung carcinoma) and MCF- 7 (Human, breast cancer) cell lines using the MTT assay. Compound AS- 2 showed higher in vitro cytotoxic activity against A- 549 and MCF- 7 cancer cell lines with CTC 50 187. 5 and 212. 5 μg/ml respectively. The cancer cell cytotoxicity of acridines against A- 549 cell line was found to be more active than MCF- 7 cell line...|$|E
40|$|Tertiary amine N-oxides of DNA intercalators with alkylamino sidechains are a {{new class}} of bioreductive drugs. N-oxidation masks the {{cationic}} charge of the amines, forming prodrugs with low DNA binding affinity and low toxicity which can be activated selectively by metabolic reduction under hypoxic conditions. This study compares three intercalator N-oxides (NC-NO, DACA-NO and AQ 4 N), which, respectively, give <b>nitracrine</b> (NC), DACA and AQ 4 on reduction. In aerobic cell culture all three N-oxide were much less toxic than the corresponding amines, and showed large increases in cytotoxicity under hypoxia. The topoisomerase poisons DACA and AQ 4 (and their N-oxides) were less active against non-cycling than cycling cells. However, only AQ 4 N was active against the mouse mammary tumour MDAH-MCa- 4. This dialkylaminoanthraquinone-di-N-oxide has activity at least as great as the reference bioreductive drug RB 6145 against this tumour, both with and without radiation and when combined with the tumour blood flow inhibitor 5, 6 -dimethylxanthenone- 4 -acetic acid (DMXAA). It is suggested that the high in vivo activity of AQ 4 N relative to the other topoisomerase-targeted N-oxide, DACA-NO, may be in part due to release in hypoxic cells of an intracalator with sufficiently high DNA binding affinity that it is retained long enough to kill non-cycling cells when they eventually re-enter the cell cycle...|$|E
40|$|A Nitracrina, um agente antitumoral polonês, e o Quinifuryl, um anti-séptico russo, são compostos nitroheterocíclicos. A citotoxicidade dessas drogas foi investigada sobre três linhagens de células em condições de normoxia. Foi dada ênfase na comparação dos efeitos das drogas em tecidos tumorogênicos (células leucêmicas P 388 e K 562), e não tumorogênicos (células fibroblásticas NIH 3 T 3). Ambas as drogas mostraram significativa citotoxicidade para todas as linhagens de células. A toxicidade sobre as células leucêmicas P 388 de camundongos foi significativamente maior comparada com as células fibroblásticas NIH 3 T 3 de camundongos. Adicionalmente, a taxa de morte celular foi 2 - 3 vezes maior no caso das células P 388 versus NIH 3 T 3. As células K 562 de eritroleucemia humana demonstraram incorporação das drogas 10 minutos após sua adição, enquanto que os valores de LC 50 foram atingidos após um atraso de 3 horas devido às transformações intracelulares requeridas para matar as células. Também foi investigada a fotocitotoxicidade de ambas as drogas contra células tumorais e não transformadas de camundongos e de células de eritroleucemia humana. A citotoxicidade dessas drogas foi medida no escuro e no claro, sob iluminação com luz visível. Ambas as drogas mostraram elevada citotoxicidade quando iluminadas com valores de LC 50 7 - 35 vezes menores, após 1 hora de iluminação, comparado à incubação por 1 hora no escuro. A citotoxicidade da Nitracrina contra todas as células estudadas excede às do Quinifuryl, tanto no escuro como sob iluminação. O efeito tóxico geral foi calculado pela morte celular direta e pela contenção da proliferação celular. As micelas (PEG- 2000 -estearato) e os lipossomos unilamelares (DSPC) foram escolhidos como veículos de transporte. A citotoxicidade das drogas livres e imobilizadas também foi estudada. Nossos resultados mostraram que o Quinifuryl e a Nitracrina podem ser efetivamente imobilizadas por micelas e lipossomos unilamelares. Ambas as drogas continuaram altamente tóxicas contra as linhagens de células quando imobilizadas em lipossomos DSPC. Um efeito protetor das micelas contra a toxicidade da Nitracrina sobre células P 388 foi observado em baixa concentração da droga (0, 2 nmol/ml), mas não em concentração mais alta (2 nmol/ml). As micelas também protegeram as células P 388 contra a toxicidade do Quinifuryl. The {{cytotoxicity}} of two nitroheterocyclic compounds, Polish antitumor agent, <b>Nitracrine</b> and Russian antiseptic, Quinifuryl, towards {{three lines}} of cells were determined under normoxia conditions. Special emphasis {{has been placed}} on the comparisons of the drugs effects in highly tumorogenic, leukaemic P 388 and K 562 and non-tumorogenic, fibroblast cells NIH 3 T 3. Both drugs showed significant cytotoxicity to all cell lines. Toxicity of both drugs toward murine leukaemia was substantially higher, compared to non-transformed murine fibroblasts. At the drug concentrations of 2 nmol/ml, it took 2 - 3 times less time to reach the LC 50 with P 388 compared to NIH 3 T 3. Uptake of drugs by human erythroleukaemia cells was observed starting 10 min from the addition of the drug, while the LC 50 values were achieved after 3 hr of incubation. This delay in cell killing {{may be due to the}} intracellular transformation of drugs required for cell killing. It was also investigated the cellular phototoxicity of both drugs towards murine leukaemia, fibroblast and human erythroleukaemia cells. The cytotoxicity of these drugs towards two lines of leukaemic cells and a line of non-transformed cells, was measured in comparison, on the dark and under illumination. Both drugs showed highly elevated cytotoxicity when illuminated with LC 50 values 7 - 35 times lower after 1 h illumination compared to 1 h incubation of cells incubation with drug on the dark. Cytotoxicity of <b>Nitracrine</b> toward all cell lines studied exceeded that of Quinifuryl, both on the dark and under illumination, so that 10 times lower concentration of former drug was needed to reach the same toxicity as the latter. General toxic effect was calculated as a direct cell kill and a cell proliferation arrest. Micelles (PEG- 2000 -stearate) and small unilamellar liposomes (DSPC) were chosen as vehicles and cytotoxicity of free and immobilized drugs was studied. We show that both drugs are effectively immobilized and strongly retained by both micelles and unilamellar liposomes. Both drugs are highly toxic against all line cells, when is immobilized in liposomes DSPC. A protective effect of micelles against <b>Nitracrine</b> toxicity toward P 388 cells was observed at low drug concentration (0. 2 nmol/ml), but not at higher concentration (2 nmol/ml). Micelles also protected P 388 cells against cytotoxicity of Quinifuryl...|$|E
