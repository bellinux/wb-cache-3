5|$|Vinkeniers use {{a variety}} of methods to {{increase}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> in their birds. Techniques to develop singing aptitude include selective breeding programs, high-protein diets, and stimulating them with music and recordings of bird song. As wild finches generally begin singing during the spring mating season, keepers may also use artificial lights placed in aviaries to encourage increased song.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, vinkensport {{has had its}} {{cheating}} scandals, as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour, and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one contestant sang exactly the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.|$|E
5|$|On 15 December, Suffolk Constabulary's website {{revealed}} that a total of 7,300 telephone calls {{had been made to}} police regarding the investigation, and that over 300 police staff and specialists were working on the cases, with support from at least 25 other police forces. As of 18 December, the number of officers involved in the investigation had increased to 650 including 350 officers from 40 other police forces who had assisted in the inquiry.

40|$|The choice <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{attempts}} {{in a telephone}} survey is an important decision. A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; and a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn and increases the variance. The decision can also {{have an effect on}} the nonresponse bias. In this paper we study the effects <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts on the nonresponse rate and the nonresponse bias in two surveys conducted by Statistics Sweden: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Household Finances (HF). By use of paradata we calculate the response rate as a function <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts. To estimate the nonresponse bias we use estimates of some register variables, where observations are available for both respondents and nonrespondents. We also calculate estimates of some real survey parameters as functions <b>of</b> varying <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts. The results indicate that it is possible to reduce the current <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts without getting an increased nonresponse bias...|$|R

In {{addition to its}} song, the American robin has a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> used for communicating specific information such as when a ground predator approaches, and when a nest or robin is being directly threatened. Even during nesting season, when robins exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior, they may still band together to drive away a predator.|$|E
5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E

He turned down every request until 1994, {{when he was}} offered a bit part in the star-studded comedy film Maverick. Although the part required very little actual acting, after the movie's release Black received an increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> from directors who {{thought he would be}} perfect for a particular role. Black has appeared in several television shows, including Wings and The Larry Sanders Show. He has since starred in the 1998 television film, Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack, based on the rodeo star Jack Favor, who was falsely accused of double murders in Haughton, Louisiana in 1967. Lisa Hartman Black portrayed Ponder I. Favor, Jack's wife. Black had a major role in another television movie Going Home, and appeared briefly in the 2003 film Anger Management.|$|E

40|$|In {{telephone}} surveys, several call attempts {{are often}} needed {{to establish contact}} with selected individuals. We consider the problem of choosing the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts {{to be made to}} each selected individual before he or she is classified as unavailable. This is an important question since a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn. We start from the assumptions that the survey goal is to estimate a population total, that the sample can be divided into response homogeneity groups, and that the direct weighting estimator is to be used. We suggest a strategy for choosing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts that takes the survey design, non-response, measurement errors and costs of data collection into account. The strategy relies on models for non-response and measurement errors. In our models, the impact of the error sources on the estimator may differ for different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts. According to our strategy, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts is decided through a comparison of the estimator’s standard error for different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts but the same cost. Next we study the case when the response homogeneity groups do not work properly but there remains a non-response bias. Our solution relies on models for many different survey errors (the sampling error...|$|R

While in 2003 there were 11.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, over twice the average for the city of Louisville as a whole, which was 5.0 crimes per 1,000 residents Old Louisville now has a similar <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> for police assistance as other parts of Louisville. The Louisville Metro Police 4th Division is responsible for a large portion of Louisville beyond Old Louisville, but is conveniently located in Central Park in Old Louisville. It had 134 officers assigned to it in 2006. Most calls are related to car break-ins and non-violent crimes. Murders are still rare, with one or two per year. Overall crime rates for both Old Louisville and the city as a whole increased sharply in 2005 over the 2004 rate, although there was a decline again the first half of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Værøy Airport {{had opened}} on 1 July 1986 {{as part of}} the {{regional}} airport network in Northern Norway operated by Widerøe. Prior to this, Værøy and Røst had been served by helicopters using a heliport; that had replaced previous services with seaplanes. All services to the airport were suspended immediately after the incident. On 7 May, Widerøe stated that they would not use Værøy Airport, and that they would decline the concession to operate to Værøy if the island community did not receive a new airport. They commented that the restrictions caused by the wind forced the airline to terminate up to half the departures. The chairman of the Widerøe's Pilots' Union, Cpt. Helge Høvik, stated the same day that the airline might have to lower the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> at some other regional airports, namely Mosjøen Airport, Kjærstad, Mo i Rana Airport, Røssvold, Sandnessjøen Airport, Stokka and Sandane Airport, Anda. Høvik stated that he felt that many of the airports were located in the wrong place, for instance at the bottom of valleys, on top of hills and between mountains. Widerøe stated that there was not a safety problem at any other regional airports.|$|E
5|$|When {{the line}} opened, it {{received}} a lot of freight traffic {{for the construction of a}} power station in Årdal. From the opening, the Flåm Line was the fastest means of transport between Sogn and both Oslo and Bergen, and most post was also sent via the line. From 1977, most of the post was instead sent by truck via Gol, and only post from Aurland went via the railway. Other products sent by the line were milk to the dairy in Voss, which terminated in 1983, as well as fruit. Partial loads saw a large increase during the 1960s, after NSB and the ferry operator Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane teamed up to send packages via Flåm to Oslo and Bergen. Flåm had several arrivals until 1973, when Linjegods was established. Following a reorganization, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> was reduced to once per week. Freight volume fell further during the 1980s; an attempt in 1978 to force the three major distributors Linjegods, Firda Billag and Sogn Billag to route traffic via the Flåm Line failed.|$|E

25|$|The {{department}} {{also saw}} {{shift in the}} type of services it was called upon to provide. The number of fire alarms plummeted, thanks to improvements in building fire safety and fire suppression, but worsening public health and a crisis in health care availability led the public to call on DCFEMS to provide much more emergency health care. In 2002, there had fewer than 100 fire alarms per month but 8,000 to 9,000 calls for medical assistance. By 2013, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> per month had risen to almost 13,350, of which about 10,700 were for emergency medical care.|$|E

25|$|A mobile phone, or cell phone, is a long-range, {{electronic}} device used for mobile voice or data communication over {{a network of}} specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area, the number of phone calls were also very limited. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call {{would have to be}} switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b> The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today. The equipment weighed 80lbs, and the AT service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per local call. The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young at AT Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S. Engel in April 1973.|$|E

500|$|The {{rapid growth}} in sales of this product was unexpected, with Bennie quoted in an {{interview}} from late 1993 as saying [...] "the success of WinFax really caught us by surprise". With {{the success of the}} WinFax product, the company grew rapidly. By early 1993 the number of employees had grown to 250, {{and by the end of}} the year to 350. The increasing success of the WinFax product consequently led to significant strains on the firm to handle the increasing volume of calls to its Technical Support department, as each of the over 300 modems on the market at the time had their own nuances in how they implemented the fax data standard. Delrina spent roughly $800,000 in an improved telephone infrastructure in an attempt to get wait times to under five minutes. In December 1993 Delrina hired 40 additional people to help alleviate the growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to the firm for technical support.
