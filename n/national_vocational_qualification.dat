5|$|Supporting Imperial War Museum North's {{educational}} goals, {{the museum}} has operated a volunteer programme since opening in 2002. The programme seeks to engage local people at risk of social exclusion. Originally based on a <b>National</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualification,</b> the programme was revised and relaunched in 2004, and consisted of a basic cultural heritage course, providing opportunities to develop academic skills and improve confidence, and to support individuals seeking to return to employment. In return volunteers work in the museum's public spaces {{as part of the}} front of house teams. In January 2007 the museum launched the in Touch volunteer programme, in partnership with Manchester Museum and supported by £425,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The programme was recognised by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport as a case study of its kind, in the department's Third Sector Strategy.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the influence on the operational effectiveness of experienced Large Goods Vehicle drivers undertaking <b>National</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualifications</b> {{and the role of}} Further Education in the delivery of <b>vocational</b> <b>qualifications</b> to experienced practitioners. With the exception of studies conducted on behalf of Skills for Logistics (Grey, 2005; Winters, 2007, 2010) there was little research, which was openly available, that examined the deployment of <b>National</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualifications</b> to Large Goods Vehicle drivers. The specific focus of this research was concerning the effectiveness of work-based competency assessment NVQ programmes delivered to Large Goods Vehicle drivers working within the Road Freight sector of the logistics industry. Using an interpretive, qualitative based study and drawing on an Action Research approach, I analysed interview and observational data gathered during three Action Research cycles, undertaken over an eighteen month period. During the Action Research cycles, participant reflection was used as a key change mechanism. The research findings indicated a low level of satisfaction with regard to the objectives and outcomes of the <b>National</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualifications</b> programme for Large Goods Vehicle drivers and an unwillingness by the research participants to engage in overt reflective activity. There was very little credibility afforded to the <b>National</b> <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualifications</b> by either the participating Large Goods Vehicle Drivers or their Managers. However, following the inclusion of an additional 'demand led' element into the programme, there was further evidence to demonstrate that as experienced practitioners the Large Goods Vehicle drivers did value professional development predicated upon the validity and credibility of the provision available. The key findings from the study provide evidence for concluding that professional development is valued by experienced Large Goods Vehicle drivers, who are both willing and able to engage with work-based learning if it is within the context of their experience, aspirations and praxis...|$|R
