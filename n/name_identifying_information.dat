Globe Communications Corp., 648 So.2d 110 (Fla. 1994), the Florida Supreme Court {{held that}} a Florida {{criminal}} statute that prohibited the media from <b>identifying</b> the <b>names</b> of sexual assault victims violated the First Amendment. In that case, Globe Communications Corp. twice published the <b>name</b> and <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> of a sexual assault victim, violating the Florida statute. The paper had lawfully learned the victim's name through investigation. The Florida Supreme Court relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Florida Star v.

It also found that the statute was [...] "underinclusive" [...] in that it punished only media publication and not acts by a private person.|$|R

40|$|Background. Exposure {{to tobacco}} and alcohol {{advertising}} {{has been associated}} with adolescent substance use. However, {{it is not clear whether}} favorable reactions to advertising are an antecedent to or a consequence of substance use. This study investigated relationships between adolescents′ levels of susceptibility to substance use and their recognition and liking of tobacco and alcohol advertising. Method. Eighth-grade students viewed pictures of tobacco and alcohol advertisements with brand <b>names</b> and <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> obscured, attempted to <b>identify</b> the brand <b>name</b> and type of product being advertised, and rated their liking of the advertisements. Subjects were divided into three substance use status groups: nonsusceptible nonusers (have never used and do not intend to do so), susceptible nonusers (have not used but have not made a firm commitment not to experiment in the future), and users (have tried the substance). Results. Susceptible nonusers liked the tobacco advertisements at a level that was significantly greater than that of the nonsusceptible nonsmokers and comparable to that of the users. Liking of the alcohol advertisements generally increased with alcohol use status. Conclusions. These results suggest that tobacco advertisements ostensibly targeted to adult smokers may have the effect of recruiting new adolescent smokers...|$|R

40|$|Volume I {{contains}} a literature review, research {{paper and a}} public domain paper. The literature review examines literature on stress management interventions for professionals working in mental health and health care settings. The empirical paper investigates the relationship of self-efficacy and hardiness in trainee clinical psychologists and determines whether either concept mediates the relationship between stressors and well-being. It is intended that both pieces of work will be submitted to the British Journal of Clinical Psychology (see Appendix 2. 9 for the instructions for authors). Finally, the public domain briefing paper details the empirical paper. Volume II includes five Clinical Practice Reports (CPR). CPR 1 is a case formulation about a 56 year old gentleman with symptoms of anxiety and depression. CPR 2 is a service evaluation regarding staff perspectives on referring clients with psychosis for psychological therapies. CPR 3 documents a single-case experimental design that assessed the effectiveness of an anxiety intervention with a fifteen year old boy with Chrone’s disease.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and the Civil Partnership Act 2005, many lesbian and gay couples have started families through adoption; yet, to date, research on same-sex parent families has almost exclusively focused on families in which children were conceived through a heterosexual relationship or assisted reproduction. What is more, despite a large body of evidence regarding lesbian mother families, there have been few studies of children’s adjustment when raised by gay fathers. The circumstances of gay father families are more unusual than lesbian mother families; not only are the parents same-sex, but it is also rare for fathers, be they heterosexual or gay, to be the primary caregivers. It is not known what the combined effect of these two factors might be on children’s social, emotional, identity and gender development as they grow older. This study was the first to examine families in which children live, from early childhood, with their adoptive gay fathers, lesbian mothers or heterosexual parents in the UK. The focus was on the quality of parent–child relationships, parental wellbeing and child psychological development. Our aim was to produce robust evidence that may be used to inform all those who work with lesbian and gay adopters and their children about the experiences of adoption and family functioning in same-sex parent families. <b>Names</b> and <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> have been changed.

40|$|Context: On {{the island}} of Hawaii there is a shorltage of medical providers. Most of the {{residents}} of this island are insured by the Medicaid/Medical program (Quest). Currently, {{in the small town of}} Hilo, Hawaii, very few physicians are accepting new Medicaid patients. For example, as of August 1, 2005, there were no pediatricians who were accepting new 2 ̆ 2 Quest 2 ̆ 2 patients. These children must obtain medical services from their local community health clinic. The island of Hawaii has very few P. A. 2 ̆ 7 s despite it 2 ̆ 7 s overwhelming need. One reason may be that most physicians in Hawaii are in private practice and are uncertain if the addition of a PA would be financially beneficial or draining to their practice. This study will attempt to demonstrate an answer to this issue. Objective: To demonstrate, by using a series of average clinic visits and the lowest reimbursement rates from insurers, if hiring a PA would generate revenue for a private practice pediatric clinic. Design: The design will be a retrospective study, analyzing previous clinic visits with current insurance reimbursement rates. Setting: This study was completed with statistics gathered from the pediatric clinic of Joseph D 2 ̆ 7 Angelo, MD in Hilo, Hawaii.

The term identity theft was coined in 1964. Since that time, the definition of identity theft has been statutorily prescribed throughout both the U.K. and the United States as the theft of personally <b>identifying</b> <b>information,</b> generally including a person’s name, date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number, bank account or credit card numbers, PIN numbers, electronic signatures, fingerprints, passwords, or any other information {{that can be used to}} access a person’s financial resources.|$|R
5000|$|CAFE {{became the}} focus of {{mainstream}} media attention when they hosted controversial author and masculinist Warren Farrell to speak at the University of Toronto on November 16, 2012. The talk was met with protests from a coalition of activist groups, U of T Students United Against Sexism. The protesters accused Farrell and CAFE of [...] "misogyny, and of protecting and denying male privilege." [...] The event attracted a group of about 50-100 protesters who argued that Farrell's talk was Hate Speech and chanted [...] "No Hate Speech on Campus" [...] throughout the demonstration. The event was briefly delayed after protestors blocked access to the venue, before police intervened, allowing the event to proceed. Police and campus police who were attending the event arrested one protestor before releasing them without charge, while another was cautioned for assaulting a police officer. After the protest, several of the women who had protested against Farrell's talk were subjected to online bullying and harassment, after their pictures, <b>names,</b> and other <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> were posted on the website register-her.com, which was operated by American men's rights group A Voice for Men.|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} the First Officer Qualification (FOQ) ruling was {{to improve the quality}} of first {{officers}} flying for Part 121 carriers. In order to test this, a study was completed at a regional carrier to compare pilots hired prior to the FOQ ruling with those hired after the FOQ ruling. The study compared 232 pilots hired from 2005 – 2008 with 184 pilots hired from August 2013 –November 2014. The pilots’ date of hire as compared to the date the FOQ ruling went into effect defined the input (Source) variable. Initial training defined the output (Success) variables. The airline <b>name</b> and all <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> were removed from the data set. The pilots were compared in three areas: total flight hours, training completion and extra training events. The results of the study show that, while pilots hired after the FOQ ruling had a significantly higher number of total flight hours, that group was more likely to need additional training and less likely to successfully complete training than those who were hired prior to FOQ. The study shows that there may have been some unintended consequences of the FOQ ruling and that more extensive research is needed to confirm that these results are representative of regional carriers across the industry...|$|R

In 1955, the Aotearoa/New Zealand government legislated {{the closed}} stranger adoption period. Approximately 80, 000 children were constructed {{as a legal}} fiction when deemed as if born to a legally married couple. Birth family information was permanently sealed. Yet being raised in a fictional subject position and being denied access to any family of origin has consequences for all involved. After ten years of lobbying, the Adult Adoption Information Act (1985) came into effect. The power of that legislation was to overturn the strategies that suppressed adoptees’ rights to know details of their birth. Adult adoptees {{over the age of}} 20 years could access their original birth certificates, which provided a birth mother’s <b>name.</b> With this <b>identifying</b> <b>information,</b> reunions became possible. Birth family reunions involve a diverse range of experiences, reflecting the ways in which adoptees are contextually and historically produced. This paper reconsiders the identity implications of reunion stories using the theoretical concept of hybrid identity. The complexities of reunions are multiple, and adoptees negotiate their identities through being both born to and born as if and yet neither identity is safe. In the production of this hybrid story, it was possible to see the political and moral trajectories that enable and constrain a sense of self through the complexities of a legal context that produces binary subject positions...|$|R
