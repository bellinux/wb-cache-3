5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{source of income}} from the lands, an {{extension}} of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000, was last renewed in 2013 but at vastly reduced spending levels, leaving some counties scrambling to find <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> funding. In late 2013, the United States House of Representatives was considering a bill that would resume the funding and increase timber harvests to provide additional income to the counties.|$|E

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set up {{the first of several}} iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and smelt ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest iron content) was exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These allowed it to access <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|In the High Middle Ages {{there were}} <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> education, such as song and grammar schools. These were usually {{attached}} to cathedrals or a collegiate church and were {{most common in}} the developing burghs. By {{the end of the}} Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. Early examples including the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.|$|E

5|$|In the High Middle Ages, <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> {{education}} arose. Choir and grammar {{schools were}} designed to train priests, with an emphasis respectively on music and Latin grammar. The reorganisation of the church {{that began in the}} reign of David I (1124–53) gave the church a clearer diocesan and parochial structure, meaning that the seats of sheriffdoms, such as Perth, received schools that were usually under monastic patrons. Early examples of grammar schools include the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church. The newly created diocesan chancellors may have had authority over cathedral schools and schoolmasters within their diocese.|$|E
5|$|Populous: The Beginning is a {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} {{and is the}} third entry in the Populous video game series, developed by Bullfrog Productions. The game was released in 1998 on Microsoft Windows, and in 1999 for the PlayStation. Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player {{in the role of}} a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Adams {{emerged as}} an {{important}} public figure in Boston soon after the British Empire's victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). The British Parliament found itself deep in debt and looking for <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> revenue, and they sought to directly tax the colonies of British America for the first time. This tax dispute {{was part of a}} larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203) had been troubled from the outset: the {{aristocracy}} conspired against him, his pressing demand for <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> revenue {{was blocked by}} the refusal of Senate, clergy and merchants to contribute, while the lower and middle classes of the imperial capital frequently displayed their discontent with riots against corrupt officials. The most notable of these was a large-scale uprising in February 1200 against the warden of the praetorium, Constantinople's chief prison, John Lagos, which was bloodily suppressed by imperial troops.|$|E
5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give it much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E

5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> revenue to {{supplement}} existing sources of income. It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them. Although derived from the older geld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, rather than as a general tax regularly assessed. A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes. Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I, John, and the early years of Henry III, the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage, feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids, and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Constantinople was {{undergoing}} expansion. The cosmopolitan {{character of the}} city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the Genoese, and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople. These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, generating <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> wealth in a predominantly agrarian economy. Thessaloniki, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In Corinth, silk production fuelled a thriving economy. All this {{is a testament to the}} success of the Komnenian Emperors in securing a Pax Byzantina in these heartland territories.|$|E
5|$|In 1497 Bristol was the {{starting}} point for John Cabot's voyage of exploration to North America. For many years Bristol merchants had bought freeze-dried cod, called stockfish, from Iceland for consumption in England. However the Hanseatic League, which was trying to control North Atlantic trade at this time, sought to cut off supplies to English merchants. It has often been suggested that this drove Bristol's merchants to look West for <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> cod fish. On the other hand, while Bristol merchants did largely abandon Iceland in the late-15th century, Hull merchants continued to trade there. Moreover, recent research has shown that England's fisheries off Iceland actually grew significantly from the 1490s, albeit the centre for this activity shifted from Bristol to East Anglia. This makes it hard to sustain the argument that Bristol merchants were somehow 'pushed out' of Iceland.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the field}} seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran {{excavations}} of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided {{by his wife}} and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in The Roman Fort Near Brecon. He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract <b>new</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle-market newspaper the Daily Mail. In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler's first book for a general audience, Prehistoric and Roman Wales; he later expressed the opinion {{that it was not a}} good book.|$|E
