5|$|A <b>novelisation</b> of this serial {{written by}} Ian Marter was {{published}} by Target Books in August 1987. Marter died soon after completing the manuscript.

5|$|The <b>novelisation</b> and the screenplay, {{although}} both written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the <b>novelisation,</b> SMERSH is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for {{the whereabouts of}} the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts {{with a number of}} Bond stories, including the film The Living Daylights (1987), in which a character remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH {{is said to have been}} put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the <b>novelisation</b> include Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov as well as Colonel-General Niktin, a character from Fleming's novel From Russia, with Love who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.|$|E
5|$|Arrow Books also {{released}} a <b>novelisation</b> of the 1979 Quatermass serial, written by Kneale. This was written during production, and contained many additional scenes and extra background detail {{not included in}} the original scripts. Kneale offered many of these new scenes to the producers of the television version, but by this stage {{it was too late for}} them to be incorporated.|$|E

5|$|Panggilan Darah debuted at the Orion Theatre in Batavia on 30 June 1941. It was {{reported}} as a modest success, making {{most of its}} money from lower class audiences. It was screened in Surabaya, East Java, by August, and by September it had been shown in Singapore, then part of British Malaya. A <b>novelisation</b> by Roestam Sutan Palindih was published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning Publishers that year.|$|E
5|$|The Sarah Jane Adventures {{merchandising}} {{revived the}} concept of the <b>novelisation,</b> which {{had been part of the}} Doctor Who franchise from the 1970s to the 1990s (principally under the editorship of author and former Who script editor Terrance Dicks). The first series and most of the second were adapted in this way, but later series saw only a few releases and a transition from print to e-books.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} novelised by Nigel Kneale, {{his first book}} since his Somerset Maugham Award-winning short story {{collection}} Tomato Cain was published in 1949. The <b>novelisation</b> expanded on the backgrounds {{of many of the}} characters seen in the story, and added a deeper, more physical, relationship between Quatermass and Annie Morgan. It was this version of the story with which Kneale was most pleased.|$|E

5|$|Wanita dan Satria was {{released}} in 1941, reaching Bandung by August and Surabaya by September. The film was open to all ages. A <b>novelisation</b> was published later in 1941 by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning. As part of the growing movement to attract Indonesian intellectuals, the marketing staff emphasised the respectable (non-theatrical) background of the actors; the intelligentsia had little respect for traditional theatre and its players.|$|E
5|$|Written by Graham Williams, this two-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 25 September 1984 as Arcade and was planned {{to open the}} original 23rd season. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Matthew Robinson direct the adventure. Williams wrote a <b>novelisation</b> of the script which was published by Target Books in May 1989. It was later adapted by John Ainsworth for Big Finish {{as part of their}} The Lost Stories series in November 2009.|$|E
5|$|A serialised <b>novelisation</b> of Quatermass II, {{written by}} Kneale, {{ran in the}} Daily Express {{newspaper}} in the UK from 5 December to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw the storyline to a premature conclusion as the paper lost interest in the project. The television scripts were released by Penguin Books in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included. The book was re-released in 1979, with a new introduction by Kneale, {{to coincide with the}} transmission of the Thames Television serial.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a <b>novelisation</b> of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
5|$|Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang was loosely adapted as a 1968 film of {{the same}} name with a {{screenplay}} by Roald Dahl and Ken Hughes; a subsequent <b>novelisation</b> was also published. The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli, co-producer of the James Bond film series. The story was also adapted as a stage musical under the same name. In April 2011 a BBC Radio 4 Extra adaptation was broadcast with Imogen Stubbs as the voice of Chitty. Three sequels to Fleming's book have been published, all written by Frank Cottrell Boyce.|$|E
5|$|Gagak Item was {{released}} in late 1939 and was screened in Batavia (now Jakarta), {{the capital of the}} Indies; Medan, North Sumatra; and Surabaya, eastern Java. Some screenings of the film, also advertised under the Dutch title De Zwarte Raaf, had Dutch-language subtitles. A <b>novelisation</b> of the film, published by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning, soon followed. Gagak Item was one of four domestic productions released in 1939; the film industry had undergone a significant downturn following the onset of the Great Depression, during which time cinemas mainly showed Hollywood productions, and had only begun recovering following the release of Terang Boelan.|$|E
