The surface on which the objects are placed {{is covered with a}} clean cloth or appropriate <b>non-acidic</b> <b>paper,</b> and the objects are covered when not being examined. Any scrolls being examined are re-rolled up when not in use.|$|E

An advantage of paper {{is that it is}} generally less costly than plastic enclosures. The opaque quality of paper protects photographs from light exposure, and the porous quality protects photographs from humidity and gaseous pollutants. However, for images to be viewed, they must be removed from the enclosure, putting the materials at risk for mishandling and/or vandalism.|$|R
