40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{magnitude}} of continuous and transient whole-body vibration in the vertical direction on both subjective and biodynamic responses of human subjects has been investigated experimentally. Additionally, the relation between the subjective responses and the dynamic responses has also been studied. Twelve subjects were exposed to sinusoidal continuous vibrations at five frequencies (3. 15 – 8. 0 Hz) and at three magnitudes (0. 5 – 2. 0 m s? 2 rms). They were also exposed to transient vibrations that were modulated one-and-half cycle sinusoidal waveforms at the same frequencies as the continuous vibrations and at three magnitudes corresponding to the magnitudes used for the continuous vibrations. Discomfort was measured by the method of magnitude estimation with reference stimuli having frequency components {{in the middle of the}} frequency range used in this study. The driving-point dynamic responses (the ratio between the force and the motion, i. e., acceleration and velocity, at the driving point) were also measured and divided by the responses to the reference stimuli used in the measurement of discomfort so as to allow the comparison of the dynamic responses with the discomfort responses. Both the discomfort estimates and the normalised driving-point dynamic responses were influenced by the stimuli magnitudes, especially with the continuous vibration. At 3. 15 and 4. 0 Hz, the discomfort estimates and the <b>normalised</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> and apparent mass increased significantly with increases in vibration magnitude from 0. 5 – 2. 0 m s? 2 rms. Magnitude estimates for discomfort were correlated with the <b>normalised</b> mechanical <b>impedance</b> and apparent mass in the frequency range investigated. For the transient vibrations, the discomfort estimates and the driving-point dynamic responses were interpreted as responses in frequency bands around the fundamental frequency of the input motion. The results indicate similar nonlinearities in discomfort and driving-point dynamic responses associated with the principal body response within the range 3. 15 – 8 Hz. The nonlinearity in discomfort at these frequencies may be partially caused by the nonlinear dynamic response of the body and is sufficient to require consideration in methods of predicting discomfort caused by vertical whole-body vibration...|$|R

5000|$|In RF {{circuit and}} {{matching}} problems {{sometimes it is}} more convenient to work with admittances (representing conductances and susceptances) and sometimes {{it is more convenient}} to work with impedances (representing resistances and reactances). Solving a typical matching problem will often require several changes between both types of Smith chart, using <b>normalised</b> <b>impedance</b> for series elements and normalised admittances for parallel elements. For these a dual (<b>normalised)</b> <b>impedance</b> and admittance Smith chart may be used. Alternatively, one type may be used and the scaling converted to the other when required. In order to change from <b>normalised</b> <b>impedance</b> to normalised admittance or vice versa, the point representing the value of reflection coefficient under consideration is moved through exactly 180 degrees at the same radius. For example the point P1 in the example representing a reflection coefficient of [...] has a <b>normalised</b> <b>impedance</b> of [...] To graphically change this to the equivalent normalised admittance point, say Q1, a line is drawn with a ruler from P1 through the Smith chart centre to Q1, an equal radius in the opposite direction.

5000|$|The Smith chart is plotted on {{the complex}} {{reflection}} coefficient plane in two dimensions and is scaled in <b>normalised</b> <b>impedance</b> (the most common), normalised admittance or both, using different colours to distinguish between them.

Normalised scaling allows the Smith chart {{to be used for}} problems involving any characteristic or system impedance which is represented by the center point of the chart. The most commonly used normalization impedance is 50 ohms. Once an answer is obtained through the graphical constructions described below, it is straightforward to convert between <b>normalised</b> <b>impedance</b> (or normalised admittance) and the corresponding unnormalized value by multiplying by the characteristic impedance (admittance).

Any actual reflection coefficient must have a magnitude of {{less than or equal}} to unity so, at the test frequency, this may {{be expressed}} by a point inside a circle of unity radius. The Smith chart is actually constructed on such a polar diagram. The Smith chart scaling is designed in such a way that reflection coefficient can be converted to <b>normalised</b> <b>impedance</b> or vice versa. Using the Smith chart, the <b>normalised</b> <b>impedance</b> may be obtained with appreciable accuracy by plotting the point representing the reflection coefficient treating the Smith chart as a polar diagram and then reading its value directly using the characteristic Smith chart scaling.

40|$|The {{magnetotelluric method}} {{is widely used}} in the {{investigation}} of the geo-electric structure of the earth. The field data are traditionally inverted to reveal the subsurface structure solved using regularised iterative inversion techniques. These interpretation schemes effect matrix computations in real domain due to operational simplicity. The speed of convergence of these techniques is controlled by the calculation type {{and the size of the}} program or more specifically, size of the matrices used. A common problem encountered when dealing with real matrices in 2 D regularised inversion is their huge size. To partly overcome this problem, a new inversion strategy using complex singular value decomposition techniques has been successfully developed.;The use of analytical partial derivatives and a variety of problem regularization measures ensure that the scheme is stable and rapidly convergent. In this method, instead of using the Cagniard apparent resistivity and phase, the frequency <b>normalised</b> <b>impedance</b> is adopted as the interpretative data functions for improved model resolution. Sample applications to several synthetic and to field data from Parnaiba Basin in Brazil proved successful and are presented in this thesis.
