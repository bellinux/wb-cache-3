5|$|A Lebanese {{passport}} {{is invalid}} if the passport is not signed, and <b>normally</b> <b>the</b> bearer affixes his/her signature on the signature field, whose position has varied with various incarnations of Lebanese passports. Persons {{too young to}} sign a passport previously may have a parent or legal guardian sign the passport on their behalf, although this has since been prohibited.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. <b>Normally,</b> <b>the</b> jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, the Philippine Senate {{passed a}} bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the {{national}} flower alongside Sampaguita. A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. <b>Normally,</b> <b>the</b> bill would become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E
5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. <b>Normally,</b> <b>the</b> spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.|$|E

50|$|Post-processing can be {{done with}} image editing software. This <b>normally</b> {{involves}} cropping <b>the</b> image to a square and straightening it. The cropping is necessary because in most cases <b>the</b> (<b>normally</b> square) viewfinder image covers only about 25- 50% of the area of <b>the</b> (<b>normally</b> rectangular) digital picture.|$|R
5|$|The {{attacker}} consciously stops {{just short}} of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power. The attacker has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other. This is <b>normally</b> <b>the</b> practice when one training partner is a beginner.|$|E
5|$|The defender {{actively}} avoids or blocks {{an incoming}} attack {{executed by the}} training partner. The defender has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during sparring, and this typically occurs with training partners of similar experience. This is <b>normally</b> <b>the</b> practice when both training partners are in the senior ranks.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. In total, about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit , and, of these, twelve have {{walked on the}} Moon. <b>Normally,</b> <b>the</b> only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually {{replaced}} every six months. The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171km, achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.|$|E

Phosphorylase b is <b>normally</b> in <b>the</b> T state, inactive {{due to the}} physiological presence of ATP and Glucose 6 phosphate, and Phosphorylase a is <b>normally</b> in <b>the</b> R state (active).|$|R
5|$|The table gives crustal abundances of the {{elements}} commonly to rarely recognised as metalloids. Some other elements are included for comparison: oxygen and xenon (the most and least abundant elements with stable isotopes); iron and the coinage metals copper, silver and gold; and rhenium, the least abundant stable metal (aluminium is <b>normally</b> <b>the</b> most abundant metal). Various abundance estimates have been published; these often disagree to some extent.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (<b>normally</b> <b>the</b> far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. <b>Normally</b> <b>the</b> rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} rest of {{south-west}} England, the Blackdown Hills have a temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean temperature is approximately 10°C (50°F) and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but because of the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom (UK). January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1°C (34°F) and 2°C (36°F). July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around 21°C (70°F). December is <b>normally</b> <b>the</b> most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the Azores often brings clear skies to south-west England, particularly in summer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued {{to bring in}} additional luxuries, including pet dogs or cats to control the local vermin. The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, {{and a collection of}} 133 books. Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention of the family of Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively <b>normally.</b> <b>The</b> prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various confiscations by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. <b>Normally,</b> <b>the</b> mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria is a {{parliamentary}} democracy {{in which the}} most powerful executive position is that of prime minister. The political system has three branches—legislative, executive and judicial, with universal suffrage for citizens at least 18 years old. The Constitution of Bulgaria provides also possibilities of direct democracy. Elections are supervised by an independent Central Election Commission that includes members from all major political parties. Parties must register with the commission prior to participating in a national election. <b>Normally,</b> <b>the</b> prime minister-elect {{is the leader of}} the party receiving the most votes in parliamentary elections, although this is not always the case.|$|E
5|$|Gods were worshiped in cult temples {{administered}} by priests {{acting on the}} king's behalf. At {{the center of the}} temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. <b>Normally,</b> <b>the</b> god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos. After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods. As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will of the gods directly to the people.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Parkinson {{was made}} {{commander}} of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, having been made a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was demoted to major the following year; this reduction in rank was {{as a result of}} disciplinary action after using the workshop facilities at Trentham Military Camp for personal work. In 1939, he was returned to his temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. A lot of his work as {{commander of the}} artillery involved the implementing programs for the upskilling of gunners and non-commissioned officers to perform leadership roles <b>normally</b> <b>the</b> preserve of officers. Likewise, officers were expected to learn basic gunnery tasks.|$|E
