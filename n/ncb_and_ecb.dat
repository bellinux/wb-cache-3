5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{national}} central banks (<b>NCBs)</b> <b>and</b> the <b>ECB</b> have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis. Euro banknotes do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of {{the total value of}} banknotes issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key, calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{financial}} fragility of Bangladesh's National Banking System (NBS), providing an independent {{assessment of the}} Government's success in returning the NBS from financial crisis during 1987 - 1996. The evaluation utilises a comprehensive set of macroeconomic and microprudential variables, as per International Monetary Fund (2000). We find that government-owned Nationalised Commercial Banks (<b>NCBs)</b> <b>and</b> Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) were technically insolvent, and that concern should exist about the NBS's financial fragility due to exposure to adverse changes in macro-economic conditions. However, implicit government guarantee of the <b>NCBs</b> <b>and</b> DFIs protects against financial fragility leading to a banking crisis. ...|$|R

40|$|Bangladesh has {{a unique}} Banking system with {{multiple}} types of Banking with Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs), Private Commercial Banks (PCBs), Foreign Commercial Banks (FCBs), Islamic Commercial Banks (ICBs), Specialized Development Banks and the Cooperative Banks. Currently the magnitude of loan default is quite enormous in the Banking sector. However, the general perception and belief regarding the Islamic Banking is better recovery rate of loans and advances. This paper attempts to discuss the issues that govern the banking practices in Bangladesh and it also paints {{a picture of the}} lending practices followed by <b>NCBs,</b> PCBs <b>and</b> ICBs in Bangladesh. From the analysis presented in this case, it comes to light that ICBs lending practices with Islamic banking instruments mirrors the lending practices of conventional banks having synonymous counterpart products. The paper also unfolds some strategically weak links {{in the development of the}} banking sector, which has obstructed the overall economic development of the country. In this diversified Banking system, an attempt is made in the paper to analyze the issues governing the credit recovery rate and procedure with respect to the principles of Islamic Banking while comparing with the Conventional Banking principle amongst <b>NCBs,</b> PCBs <b>and</b> ICBs. In our effort to draw a comparison (between <b>NCBs,</b> PCBs <b>and</b> ICBs), we have taken the data, information between 1995 to 19998 figures.

40|$|Most outsiders tend to {{base their}} {{analysis}} {{of the future of}} the Eurosystem on the shape of the Federal Reserve System in the US. This paper argues that the US model is inappropriate. It suggests that the Eurosystem is pursuing a different arrangement, where {{the balance of power in}} the national central banks rather than in the centre may continue, particularly as the EU expands. This structure affects the relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy, the one wielded tightly by the <b>ECB</b> <b>and</b> the other by national governments subject to the Stability and Growth pact. The paper explores how the Eurosystem is developing the process of co-ordination between itself and the fiscal authorities. It concludes that this is pushing the Eurosystem towards increasing transparency in order to make its case. This process is simultaneously easing the relationship between the <b>ECB</b> <b>and</b> the European Parliament <b>and</b> between the <b>NCBs</b> <b>and</b> their governments and parliaments.

The results showed that the relationship between the FCR and the IGNA strain can be described by the First Order Exponential Decay function, and that the slope of this function reflects the sensitivity of conductive concrete. Based on the above relationship and damage mechanics theory, internal damage to the concrete is indicated by the relationship between the degree of damage and resistance. This self-sensing of strain in conductive concrete can be applied in monitoring damage to flexible components...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} volatility spillovers from {{changes in}} the size of the balance sheets of the Federal Reserve (FED) and European Central Bank (ECB) to emerging market economies (EMEs) from 2003 to 2014. We find that EME bond markets are most susceptible to positive volatility spillovers from both the FED <b>and</b> <b>ECB</b> in terms of magnitude. Positive volatility spillovers to EME currency markets are higher in the case of FED balance sheet expansions than those of the ECB by a factor of about ten. By contrast, we find that EME stock markets are subject to negative volatility spillovers. Moreover, we find only limited evidence of volatility transmission to the real economy of EMEs following the monetary policy actions of the FED <b>and</b> <b>ECB.</b> Finally, we show that the proportion of the volatility in EMEs that is accounted for by changes in FED <b>and</b> <b>ECB</b> balance sheets shifts over time...|$|R

A statistical analysis of dummy variables and log linear method have been used to compare the performance of <b>NCBs</b> <b>and</b> PCBs with respect to their loan default. The study (both dummy variable and log linear) reveals that the rate of default is the highest in NCBs as compared to PCBs. In sample banks’ default rate, we observe that both JB and NBL have alarming default rate while NBL’s default rate is a bit lower than that of JB. However, better situation of NBL in terms of loan recovery than JB.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{wished to}} analyse {{patterns}} {{of use of}} needle biopsy procedures by BreastScreen Australia (BSA) accredited programs to identify areas for improvement. DESIGN: BSA services provided anonymous data regarding percutaneous needle biopsy of screen detected lesions assessed between 2005 - 2009. RESULTS: 12 services, from 5 of 7 Australian states and territories provided data for 18212 lesions biopsied. Preoperative diagnosis rates were 96. 84 % for lesion other than microcalcification (LOTM) and 93. 21 % for microcalcifications. At surgery 97. 9 % impalpable lesions were removed at the first procedure. Of 11548 Microcalcification (LOTM) biopsied, 46. 9 % were malignant. The final diagnosis was reached by conventional core biopsy (CCB) in 72. 46 %, FNAB in 21. 33 %, VACB in 1. 69 % and open biopsy in 4. 52 % of lesions. FNA is being limited to LOTM with benign imaging After FNAB, core biopsy was required for 38 % of LOTM. In LOTM the mean false positive rate (FPR) was 0. 36 % for FNAB, 0. 06 % for <b>NCB</b> <b>and</b> 0 % for VACB. Diagnostic accuracy was 72. 75 % for FNAB and 92. 1 % for core biopsies combined. Of 6441 microcalcifications biopsied 2305 (35. 8 %) were malignant. Microcalcifications are being assessed primarily by NCB but 6. 57 % underwent FNAB, 45. 6 % of which required NCB. False positive diagnoses were rare. FNR was 5 % for <b>NCB</b> <b>and</b> 1. 53 % for VACB. Diagnostic accuracy was 73. 52 % for FNAB, 86. 29 % for <b>NCB</b> <b>and</b> 88. 63 % for VACB. Only 8 of 12 services had access to VACB facilities. CONCLUSIONS: BSA services are selecting lesions effectively for biopsy and are achieving high preoperative diagnosis rates.

40|$|International audienceThe tectonic {{evolution}} of the Paleo-Asian Ocean between the North China Block (<b>NCB)</b> <b>and</b> the Mongolia Block (MOB) is a contentious issue, and geodynamic models remain speculative. In an effort to puzzle out this controversy, a paleomagnetic study was carried out on the Silurian to Permian formations in central- eastern Inner Mongolia (China). More than 680 sedimentary and volcanic samples were collected from 86 sites. We have established titanium-poor magnetite and hematite as the principal magnetic carriers. AMS measurements demonstrate negligible deformation {{of the majority of}} study rocks with sedimentary fabrics. From primary magnetizations, a Late Devonian and a Permian pole are calculated for IMB at: λ[*]=[*] 46. 8 °N, φ[*]=[*] 349. 1 °E, dp[*]=[*] 14. 6 °, dm[*]=[*] 27. 3 ° with N[*]=[*] 3 and λ[*]=[*] 48. 7 °N, φ[*]=[*] 3. 7 °E, dp[*]=[*] 5. 2 °, dm[*]=[*] 9. 1 ° with N[*]=[*] 6, respectively. Two stages of secondary magnetization are also identified probably due to Early Permian and Early Cretaceous magmatic events. As preliminary results, the comparison of our new paleomagnetic poles with available data from <b>NCB,</b> MOB <b>and</b> Siberia indicates that (1) the paleolatitude of IMB, <b>NCB</b> <b>and</b> MOB are consistent between Late Devonian and Permian, suggesting pre-Late Devonian closure of the Paleo-Asian Ocean and further evaluation of these three blocks as a single entity; (2) post-Permian intracontinental deformation was significant and characterized by block rotations, which are due to strike-slip faulting within the welded NCB-IMB-MOB block...|$|R
