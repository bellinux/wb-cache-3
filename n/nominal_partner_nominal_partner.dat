Throughout the 250 {{years following the}} Muslim conquest of Syria in the 630s, the Bedouin were brought {{under the authority of}} the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750) and early Abbasid (750–861) caliphates. However, during this period, certain Bedouin tribes also participated in Umayyad dynastic struggles, the Abbasid Revolution, the rebellious Kharijite and Alid movements and isolated revolts. Following the Abbasid decline beginning in 861, state authority in the Syrian Desert receded significantly, leaving the Bedouin tribes to fill the void. The Hamdanid dynasty (890–1004), members of the Banu Taghlib tribe, represented the new-found strength of the Bedouin, and according to 14th-century historian Ibn Khaldun, they commanded the subservience of all Bedouin tribes in the Syrian steppe and Upper Mesopotamia. Other tribal dynasties that emerged in this region before or after the heyday of the Hamdanids included the Uqaylids (990–1096), Numayrids (990–1081), the Banu Asad and Banu Khafaja. By the late 10th century, the Jarrahids (970s–mid 11th century) of Banu Tayy and the Mirdasids (1024–1080) of Banu Kilab dominated southern and northern Syria, respectively, first in association with the Qarmatians, and then as <b>nominal</b> <b>partners</b> of the Fatimids, who ruled Syria between 977 and 1071.

Braving the censorship imposed on modernism by Antonescu's rule, and holding Lovinescu as their example, the Sibiu Literary Circle publicized its own critique of Sămănătorist ideals. Formulated as part of a manifesto drafted by young essayist Ion Negoițescu, it popularized the disparaging term pășunism (from pășune, [...] "pasture") to define neo-Sămănătorist literature, and alleged that its exponents were demagogues who glorified peasant values without themselves leaving [...] "the comfortable armchairs of the city". Shortly after the Royal Coup of 1944, which brought Romania under Allied supervision, voices condemning Sămănătorism again made themselves heard publicly. Writing for the National Peasants' Party Dreptatea newspaper, literary critic Vladimir Streinu paid homage to Lovinescu, Densusianu and Dragomirescu for their previous role in bringing up for discussion the negative aspects of the current, and noted that their objections only had to be slightly adapted when reviewing [...] "Orthodoxism" [...] or other local nationalist currents. The use of the term Sămănătorist as a pejorative for the far right's aesthetics was also present in the discourse of Romanian-born modernist essayist and dramatist Eugène Ionesco, better known as a founding figure for the Theatre of the Absurd. Ionesco discussed interwar and wartime Sămănătorism and other traditionalist trends as symptoms of [...] "a deep-seated intellectual affliction: the refusal of culture." ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{that there is}} a strong relation between state failure and the emergence of warlords. The power and legitimacy vacuum in Afghanistan, resulting from ineffective central state institutions, a traditional adherence to localised rule, sharp social cleavages and the country 9 ̆ 2 s subjection to external influences opened up the political space in which 'local strongmen', or so called 9 ̆ 1 warlords 9 ̆ 2 emerged. Under influence of modern developments, such as the introduction of Kalashnikovs, increased poppy production and the amplified importance of Islam, the right conditions were created for these Afghan warlords to exert certain amounts of local and regional authority {{at the expense of the}} central state. Consequently, the Afghan warlords have become undeniable actors within the Afghan political context. Given that Afghanistan 9 ̆ 2 s most prominent warlords have attained control over large parts of the country 9 ̆ 2 s territory, and as their political and economic power often exceeds that of central government, they pose a daunting threat to the country's political reconstruction process. As the Afghan warlords attempt to maintain their positions of power, they are likely to adopt a 9 ̆ 1 spoiler 9 ̆ 2 role. The Afghan warlords can be classified into the following categories: (1) total spoilers (2) partial (or limited) spoilers and, (3) collaborating spoilers. It is on this last category of warlords -warlords who have adopted a 9 ̆ 1 collaborating spoiler 9 ̆ 2 role- which this thesis focuses. 'Collaborating warlords' are those Afghan warlords who were previously associated with the Northern Alliance, who have received high-level posts within the central state system due to this affiliation, who have subsequently become <b>nominal</b> <b>partners</b> to Kabul, and who have nonetheless adhered to a personal agenda at the same time. This category of warlords has demonstrated a unique spoiler experience in the Afghan reconstruction process. With much authority and power organised around the Afghan warlords who claim to be loyal to the central state yet act in contradictory ways, the consolidation of a legitimate, democratic central state in Afghanistan remains distant. To create a greater understanding of the challenges posed by this type of local leadership, this thesis focuses primarily on the exact ways in which these 'collaborating' warlords have 9 ̆ 1 spoiled 9 ̆ 2, delayed and sometimes even paralysed Afghanistan 9 ̆ 2 s political reconstruction process...|$|R

30|$|Since {{the income}} policy {{agreements}} of 1993, the Italian industrial relations are organized around two pillars. The first pillar {{is the national}} collective agreement (Contratto Collettivo Nazionale di Lavoro, CCNL), a sector-specific labour contract negotiated between the sector employers’ association and the main trade unions. Its functions include {{the definition of the}} framework that disciplines the main aspects of labour utilization and the safeguard of real wage levels. The contracts are renewed every 3  years (since 2009, it used to be every 2  years before 2009) by the main social <b>partners.</b> <b>Nominal</b> increases of the base (minimum) wage are benchmarked to an independent 3 -year-ahead forecast of inflation net of imported energetic goods. The social parties agree on the level and the evolution of the base (minimum) wage to be applied to each occupation category (distinguishing various types of blue and white collar workers, as well as middle managers, depending on the sector) over the 3 -year horizon. The second pillar is constituted by firm- or area-level labour contracts. Pay negotiations at the firm level are intended to account for firm-specific developments and local conditions, such as improved productivity or the risk of job loss. These are subordinate to the national one and can (i) modify items related to labour utilization, if the national contract allows them to, or regulate aspects not explicitly covered by the first level and (ii) provide for additional wage increases, which should both redistribute firm-level productivity gains (possibly achieved by the very same firm-level contract through more efficient organization) and align the labour cost to the ongoing labour market conditions. However, only in well-delimited cases of firm’s restructuring or crisis, second-level deals can (temporarily) cut wages below the nationally set sectoral minimum. Still, although legally possible, there is little evidence of firm-level agreement envisaging a decrease in the wage below these minima during the period of our analysis (D’Amuri et al. 2015). Furthermore, despite the introduction of fiscal incentives to promote firm- and local-level bargaining, these agreements are not very widespread (only 20 % of firms with more than 20 employees in 2010) and are limited to larger firms and to specific sectors, respectively (D’Amuri et al. 2015).|$|R

The waters off the 754 km long coast of Mauritania are among the richest fishing grounds in the world, and in 1979 Mauritania initiated its New Fisheries Policy and established a 200 nmi km Exclusive Economic Zone. The New Fisheries Policy had three objectives: the formation of Mauritanian-controlled joint ventures, the creation of a national fishing fleet, and the establishment of a Mauritanian-controlled fish processing industry at Nouadhibou. The first of these objectives led to the replacement of licensing and royalties agreements with foreign operators by newly formed Mauritanian-controlled joint ventures. In principle, such joint ventures implied a 43 percent government share, an 8 percent local private sector share, and a 49 percent foreign share. In practice, Mauritanian control of these ventures was <b>nominal.</b> The foreign <b>partner</b> provided all the capital and equipment and controlled all operations. Government and private shares were to be purchased out of venture profits over periods as long as twenty years. By 1986 the most important of the joint venture agreements that had been established was the Mauritanian-Soviet Maritime Resources Company (Mauritanienne-Soviétique des Ressources Maritimes—MAUSSOV). Between 1985 and 1987, MAUSSOV accounted for about 55 percent of total export tonnage and 20 to 30 percent of the total value of fish exports.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-ung nominalizations of verbs {{of saying}} in German can be {{interpreted}} as events or propositions. There are context <b>partners</b> of such <b>nominals</b> which disambiguate the reading or suggest preferences. We consider a specific ambiguous constellation which is very frequent in German, where the nominal is the internal argument of a PP with nach. We detail the semantic representations of corresponding sentence types in the framework of Discourse Representation Theory and conclude from this an explanation of why some context partners suggest the one reading and some the other. The findings are currently used in corpus analyses to test the relevance and coverage of the stipulated criteria and to optimize preference weights statistically. This shows a way to avoid deep semantic evaluation with respect to disambiguation and to replace it by a combination of shallow semantic interpretation (based upon selectional restrictions and semantic hierarchies) and data driven methods. We present some of the results. 1 1...|$|R

40|$|The Restatement (Third) of Restitution 2 ̆ 6 Unjust Enrichment {{clarified}} and modernized a {{field that}} had become muddled {{since the publication of}} the Restatement (First) in 1937. One area of modernization relates to the changes in law towards women, particularly changes in law toward female cohabitants. Published in 2011, the Restatement (Third) added a new Section 28, which rejected the view that it would be immoral for one cohabitant to bring suit against the other, and relaxed the restriction on recovery in unjust enrichment for 2 ̆ 2 gratuitous 2 ̆ 2 contributions. This Article reviews societal and legal changes for women since 1937 and notes that, in adding Section 28, the Restatement (Third) followed the methodology of the Restatement (First). The Article reviews the principles of restitution and demonstrates how Section 28 follows them. Section 28 is a welcome addition to the law of restitution, but the author suggests that some of the recoveries described in the illustrations are inadequate. For example, since homemaking services do not have a market value, attempting to put a monetary value on them tends to undervalue them. Limiting recovery to the value of services also ignores the concept of tracing the value of one 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to an asset and recovering the enhanced value of the asset. The name in which the assets are titled should not negate the value of the contributions of the <b>partner</b> without <b>nominal</b> ownership. On the other hand, some illustrations to Section 28 describe adequate remedies, including sharing assets. The author notes the complexity inherent in measuring value in nonmarket, nonmarriage situations, but recommends that the illustrations with the more generous recoveries are appropriate for avoiding the unjust enrichment of one partner...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} empirical {{study of}} {{whether there was a}} misalignment of the real exchange rate (RER) in the Bangladesh economy during 1976 - 1991. The time series of multilateral and bilateral RER indexes were computed for the period 1976 - 1991. The computed series of RER were indexed to a base year of when the RER attained its highest level and thereby appeared to be closer to the actual long-run equilibrium RER. In the empirical part of this thesis, five different RER indexes were computed: multilateral real exchange rate index 1 (MRER 1), multilateral real exchange rate index 2 (MRER 2), bilateral real exchange index 1 (BRER 1), bilateral real exchange rate index 2 (BRER 2), and black market bilateral exchange rate index 1 (BMRER 1). Computation of the multilateral and bilateral RER indexes involved data on trade weights and wholesale and consumer price indexes of the domestic economy and its trading <b>partners,</b> besides their <b>nominal</b> official exchange rates. As a result, the study period was not large enough due to the unavailability of data on all variables involved. Misalignment of RER refers to the sustained deviation of the observed RER from its long-run equilibrium level. Three different measures of RER misalignment were constructed: purchasing power parity (RERMISPP), instability (RERMISINSTA), and black market (RERMISBLK). The MRER 1, BRER 2, and BMRER 1 indexes were used respectively, in contrasting RERMISPP, RERMISINSTA, and RERMISBLK measures of RER misalignment. All of these measures demonstrated RER misalignment in Bangladesh during 1976 - 1991. In order to compute the long-run equilibrium RER, a multivariate regression was executed with respect to the RER fundamental real variables. Later, a time series of three different measures of RER misalignment index was regressed on the time series of the growth rate of real GDP (gross domestic product), exports, imports, savings, and investment for 1976 - 1991 to bring about the effects of RER misalignment on the macroeconomic performance of Bangladesh. It was found that RER misalignment adversely affected the macroeconomic performance of Bangladesh. An effectiveness index of nominal devaluation as a preventive policy eroded in later years. Consequently, a cross episode regression was executed to appraise the efficacy of 10 nominal devaluation episodes. It was found that when supplementary macroeconomic policies, such as the growth rate of domestic credit, growth rate of domestic credit to the public sector, and the growth rate in the ratio of public sector to total domestic credit were taken into consideration, nominal devaluation became more effective in bringing about the real devaluation...|$|R
