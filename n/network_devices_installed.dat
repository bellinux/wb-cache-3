For instance, large scale earthquakes can cause extensive damages to land-based telecommunication infrastructures. In such circumstances, mobile phones installed with Lifeline program can be used to send emergency messages by the victims who are trapped under collapsed buildings. In addition, Lifeline also provides a function for the rescuers to estimate the positions of the victims based on network propagation techniques.

40|$|Abstract. Managing {{numerous}} security vulnerabilities {{has long}} been a difficult and daunting task especially due to the complexity, heterogeneity, and various operational constraints of the network. In this paper, we focus on the task of mitigating and managing network-device-specific vulnerabilities automatically and intelligently. We achieve the goal by a scalable, interactive, topology-aware framework that can provide mitigation actions at selectively chosen devices. The intuition behind our work is that more and more <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> are becoming security-capable {{so that they can be}} collectively used to achieve security goals while satisfying certain network policies. The intelligence utilizes integer programming to optimize a quantifiable objective conforming to the policy of a given network. An example would be to find the minimum number of <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> to <b>install</b> filters to effectively protect the entire network against potential attacks from external untrusted sources. The constraints of the integer programming are mainly based on the network topology and settings of vulnerable devices and untrusted sources. Our novel implementation uses an iterative algorithm to scale to networks of tens of thousands of nodes, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using both synthetic and realistic network topologies. Besides scalability, our tool is also operationally easy to use by enabling interactivity to input additional constraints during runtime. Key words: vulnerability management, optimization, integer programming. ...|$|R

In a cluster environment, scientific application distributed their data across multiple computation nodes. In {{order to improve}} {{the performance of the}} clusters', many issues in parallel I/ 0 have to be judiciously investigated.

In this paper, we address the bottleneck and performance factors' of parallel I/ 0 in a cluster environment. Our experiment shows that network is one of the potential bottlenecks' in cluster-based parallel I/ 0. Furthermore, the performance of the distributed RAID 5, which is built on the <b>network</b> block <b>device</b> (NBD) <b>installed</b> on the clusters' in our department, is evaluated and compared with single disk I/ 0. The experiment results confirm that, in most situations, the performance of distributed RAID is noticeably better than that of single disk system.

Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) is innovative electric equipment which has the capability to reduce fault current level within the first cycle of fault current.

40|$|MasterDesktop environment’s {{mobility}} {{is enabled}} {{by the development}} of mobile devices and virtualization technology. Thus users can use their desktop anywherehowever, desktop mobility has some drawbacks like lack of I/O devices. For instance, mobile devices have small screen and inconvenient input devices. Desktop virtualization solutions only use basic devices virtualized by VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor). So it is needed to extend I/O devices in such environments. This problem can be solved to allocate <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> to user’s desktop dynamically. But users must know <b>network</b> <b>device’s</b> address and driver s/w to use the devices. It isn’t proper solution in a dynamically changing environment. Thus, new device virtualization layer is required to support desktop mobility. The device virtualization layer must manage <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> dynamically and has extensibility for new <b>network</b> <b>devices.</b> In addition, the device virtualization should support that a desktop which want to use <b>network</b> <b>device</b> can access device virtualization layer without additional work. In this paper, we propose new device virtualization layer which satisfy above requirements. The device virtualization layer has new management protocol about allocation and management of <b>network</b> <b>devices.</b> Thanks to the protocol, the user can allocate and de-allocate a <b>network</b> <b>device</b> dynamically. In addition, device virtualization layer can be accessed through a web browser. So users don’t need any early action to use the <b>network</b> <b>devices.</b> Finally, device virtualization layer adopts a way that <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> supply their drivers. Because of the way, parts to be modified in the existing <b>network</b> <b>devices</b> could be minimized, and new <b>network</b> <b>device</b> can easily support device virtualization layer...|$|R
