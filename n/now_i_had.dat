500|$|Brooks {{attended}} Hale Primary School {{and trained}} at Beatty Park Pool, routinely dominating the State Age Championships. He won bronze in the 100m and 200m backstroke, and {{silver in the}} 200m freestyle at the 1974 Australian Age Championships. Owing {{to a lack of}} style, he was known during his primary school years as [...] "Basher Brooks", {{but by the time he}} entered Churchlands Senior High School, his stroke had become more technically refined. Nevertheless, he was always confident in his mental ability, stating [...] "before I just swam on guts, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the stroke as well as the guts. I was always the toughest kid in the race." ...|$|E

"Quite a lot, but in {{the sense}} in my {{preparation}} to find the Walter {{that we all know}} <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to go back to him right at the beginning to see where he came from. So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well.

500|$|Górecki now had two texts: {{one from}} a mother to her son, the other from a {{daughter}} to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century folk song from {{the southern city of}} Opole. Its text contains a passage in which the Virgin Mary speaks to her Son dying on the cross: [...] "O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother..." [...] (Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany...). Górecki said, [...] "this text was folk-like, anonymous. So <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> three acts, three persons... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from Psalm 93/94 in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated Your people, O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans. However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony [...] "about war". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent laments.|$|E

500|$|After Victoria's {{divorce from}} Ernst, Grand Duke Kirill, whom Victoria {{had seen on}} all her {{subsequent}} visits to Russia, was discouraged by his parents from {{trying to keep a}} close relationship with her. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna told Kirill to keep Victoria as his mistress and marry someone else. A few months later, war broke out between Russia and Japan. As {{a senior member of the}} navy, Kirill was sent on active service to the front in the Russo-Japanese War. His ship was blown up by a Japanese mine while entering Port Arthur and he was one of the few survivors. Sent home to recover, the Tsar finally allowed him permission to leave Russia and he left for Coburg to be with Victoria. The narrow escape from death had hardened Kirill's determination to marry Victoria. [...] "To those over whom the shadow of death has passed, life has a new meaning," [...] Kirill wrote in his memoirs. [...] "It is like daylight. And I was now within visible reach of fulfillment of the dream of my life. Nothing would cheat me of it <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone through much. Now, at last, the future lay radiant before me." ...|$|E

2500|$|From {{an early}} age, José showed a {{precocious}} intellect. He learned the alphabet {{from his mother}} at 3, and could read and write at age 5. Upon enrolling at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, he dropped the last three names that made up his full name, {{on the advice of}} his brother, Paciano and the Mercado family, thus rendering his name as [...] "José Protasio Rizal". Of this, he later wrote: [...] "My family never paid much attention , but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to use it, thus giving me the appearance of an illegitimate child!" [...] This was to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother, who had gained notoriety with his earlier links to Filipino priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora (popularly known as Gomburza) who had been accused and executed for treason.|$|E

[...] Pharaoh replied after them, saying the {{concluding}} words of [...] "Who is like You, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?" [...] Rabbi Nechunia, son of Hakkanah, thus cited Pharaoh {{as an example}} of the power of repentance. Pharaoh rebelled most grievously against God, saying, as reported in [...] "Who is the Lord, that I should hearken to His voice?" [...] But then Pharaoh repented using the same terms of speech with which he sinned, saying the words of [...] "Who is like You, O Lord, among the mighty?" [...] God thus delivered Pharaoh from the dead.
