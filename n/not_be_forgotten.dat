5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the others {{want to return to}} Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, because there was no need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten,</b> and that his work will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E

25|$|At low momenta (infrared limit) the {{question}} has been more involved to settle. The {{reason is that the}} theory becomes strongly coupled in this case and perturbation theory cannot be applied. The only reliable approach to get an answer is performing lattice computation on a computer powerful enough to afford large volumes. An answer to this question is a fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when one wants to get meaningful physical results.|$|E

These were regional or provincial gatherings open to everyone. Examples include that held at Tailtin each Lughnasadh, and that held at Uisneach each Bealtaine. The main purpose of these gatherings was to promulgate and reaffirm the laws – they were read aloud in public that they might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten,</b> and any changes in them carefully explained to those present.|$|E

The narrative voice asks that their contributions <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten</b> and predicts {{that they will}} not go back into hiding: [...] "a battalion was formed in those terrible years that would never again be completely disbanded". This military metaphor continues later in the novel when inverts in postwar Paris are repeatedly referred to as a [...] "miserable army". Hall invokes the image of the shell-shocked soldier to depict inverts as psychologically damaged by their outcast status: [...] "for bombs do not trouble the nerves of the invert, but rather that terrible silent bombardment from the batteries of God's good people".|$|E

Amnesty International similarly condemned the government crackdown and asked for an independent investigation into the events. Anonymous, an online hackers grouping, issued a statement condemning the crackdown and expressed its solidarity with the protesters: [...] "By interfering with the freedom to hold peaceful protests, the Bahrainian [...] government has made itself a clear enemy of its own citizens and of Anonymous.

500|$|Ohio-born Ezra Meeker had {{traveled}} the Trail {{with his family}} in 1852 and spent the final two decades of his long life before his death in 1928 publicizing the Oregon Trail, that it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> In 1926, at age 95, he appeared before a Senate committee, requesting that the government issue a commemorative coin that could be sold to raise money for markers to show where the Trail had been. The coin had originally been thought of by Idahoans, led by Dr. Minnie Howard, seeking to further preservation work at Fort Hall; Meeker broadened the idea. [...] Congress authorized six million half dollars, and placed no restriction on when or at what mint the coins would be struck. [...] Meeker's Oregon Trail Memorial Association (OTMA) had tens of thousands of pieces struck in 1926 and 1928, and did not sell them all. [...] Nevertheless, most years between 1933 and 1939, it had small quantities of the half dollar coined, in some years from all three operating mints to produce mintmarked varieties, and raised prices considerably.|$|E

500|$|Under the {{captaincy}} of Allen, Verity {{began the}} tour well. He took 16wickets before the Tests began with best figures of five for 50 against Queensland, his only five wicket haul of the Australian {{leg of the}} tour. England won the first two Tests of the series, assisted by poor weather which altered pitch conditions in their favour. In the first match, England scored 358 and bowled Australia out for 234. Although Verity took just one wicket, Wisden's correspondent praised him, reporting: [...] "Among the bowlers... Verity must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forgotten.</b> In the first innings he bowled in his best form and contributed to many of [...] Voce's wickets... So difficult was Verity to score from that batsmen in desperation tried to get runs off Voce, with disastrous results to themselves." [...] After England set Australia 381 to win, rain damaged the pitch; Allen and Voce bowled the home team out for 58. In the second Test, England won by an innings, again assisted by rain. Verity took three wickets in the match, including that of Bradman.|$|E

On 5 May 1805, a ceremony took place on the field of Marengo. Napoleon, dressed in the uniform he wore on 14 June 1800, together with Empress Joséphine seated on a throne placed under a tent, oversaw a military parade. Then, Chasseloup gave Napoleon the founding stone, on which was inscribed: [...] "Napoleon, Emperor of the French and King of Italy, to the manes of the defenders of the fatherland who perished on the day of Marengo." [...] This pyramid was actually part of a very ambitious project meant to glorify Bonaparte's conquests in Italy. The field of Marengo was supposed to become the site of a [...] "city of Victories" [...] whose boulevards, named after Italian battles, would converge to the pyramid. In the event, the project was abandoned in 1815 and the stones recovered by the peasants. The column erected in 1801 was also removed, only to be restored in 1922.|$|E
