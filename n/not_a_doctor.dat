25|$|Official biographies claim Charles Scott Sherrington {{was born}} in Islington, London, England, on 27 November 1857 {{and that he was}} the son of James Norton Sherrington, a country doctor, and his wife Anne Thurtell. However James Norton Sherrington was an {{ironmonger}} and artist's colourman in Great Yarmouth, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor,</b> and died in Yarmouth in 1848, nearly 9 years before Charles was born. In the 1861 census, Charles is recorded as Charles Scott (boarder, 4, born India) with Anne Sherrington (widow) as the head and Caleb Rose (visitor, married, surgeon). He was brought up in this household with Caleb recorded as head in 1871, although Ann and Caleb did not marry until after the death of his wife in 1880. The relationship between Charles and his childhood family is unknown. During the 1860s the whole family moved to Anglesea Road, Ipswich, reputedly because London exacerbated Caleb Rose's tendency to asthma.|$|E

The image of Schrader peering into Earnhardt's car, only to jump back and frantically signal for assistance, is etched into the minds of many racing fans; his interview with Jeanne Zelasko during Fox Sports' post-race show was the first sign to many that something was wrong with the seven-time Winston Cup champion, as he appeared visibly shaken and upon being asked if Earnhardt was okay, he said [...] "I don't really know.

On February 5, they won 92–83 at Brooklyn—their sixth win in seven games and third straight without Howard—but lost Gasol for an estimated six-to-eight weeks after he tore the plantar fascia of his right foot towards the end of the game. Bryant urged Howard to return and play through the pain, saying that the center [...] "worries too much" [...] and was tentative to return because he [...] "doesn't want to let anyone down". Howard mentioned that Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal needed three years to win a title together, but Bryant replied, [...] "We don't have three years. We've got this year."

2500|$|In a September 2011 Republican {{presidential debate}} in Tampa, FL, Bachmann criticized Rick Perry for {{his support for}} the humanpapilloma virus (HPV) vaccine and his support for mandating the HPV vaccine for all sixth-grade Texas girls. The American Academy of Pediatrics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and other medical {{organizations}} worldwide are in favor of immunizing girls and boys against HPV. HPV can cause lesions and genital warts, and has been linked to cervical cancer as well as genital and oral cancers in people of any gender. Because the vaccine is effective only if given before the onset of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to the virus, medical groups recommend the three dose vaccine be given to 11- and 12-year-olds. Bachmann, during the debate and in interviews following the event, accused Perry of “crony capitalism” (because Perry’s former chief of staff was chief lobbyist for a drug company manufacturing the vaccine), and claimed that the HPV vaccine was dangerous and caused mental retardation. She repeatedly referred to an anecdotal account from a mother of a girl who been immunized for HPV. “She told me that her little daughter took that vaccine, that injection, and she suffered mental retardation thereafter,” Bachmann said. “There is no second chance for these little girls if there is any dangerous consequences to their bodies." [...] Shortly after Bachmann’s statements at the debate, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement: “The American Academy of Pediatrics would like to correct false statements made in the Republican presidential campaign that HPV vaccine is dangerous and can cause mental retardation. There is absolutely no scientific validity to this statement. Since the vaccine has been introduced, more than 35 million doses have been administered, and it has an excellent safety record." [...] Fewer than one percent of those receiving the vaccine reported neurological side effects or, in rare cases, severe allergic reactions, none linked to changes in cognitive ability. Bachmann later acknowledged that she was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> or a scientist.|$|E
