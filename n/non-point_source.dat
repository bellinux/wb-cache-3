25|$|There {{are several}} factors {{contributing}} to {{the decline in the}} population of the sand tigers. Sand tigers reproduce at an unusually low rate, {{due to the fact that}} they do not have more than two pups at a time and because they breed only every second or third year. This shark is a highly prized food item in the western northern Pacific, off Ghana and off India and Pakistan where they are caught by fishing trawlers, although they are more commonly caught with a fishing line. Sand tigers' fins are a popular trade item in Japan. Off North America, it is fished for its hide and fins. Shark liver oil is a popular product in cosmetic products such as lipstick. It is sought by anglers in fishing competitions in South Africa and some other countries. In Australia it has been reduced in numbers by spear fishers using poison and where it is now protected. It is also prized as an aquarium exhibit in the United States, Europe, Australia and South Africa because of its docile and hardy nature. Thus, overfishing is a major contributor to the population decline. All indications show that the world population in sand tigers has been reduced significantly in size since 1980. Many sand tigers are caught in shark nets, and then either strangled or taken by fishermen. Estuaries along the United States of America's eastern Atlantic coast houses many of the young sand tiger sharks. These estuaries are susceptible to <b>non-point</b> <b>source</b> pollution that is harmful to the pups.|$|E
2500|$|Microalgae {{production}} {{also includes}} {{the ability to use}} saline waste or waste [...] streams as an energy source. [...] This opens a new strategy to produce biofuel in conjunction with waste water treatment, while being able to produce clean water as a byproduct. [...] When used in a microalgal bioreactor, harvested microalgae will capture significant quantities of organic compounds as well as heavy metal contaminants absorbed from wastewater streams that would otherwise be directly discharged into surface and ground-water. [...] Moreover, this process also allows the recovery of phosphorus from waste, which is an essential but scarce element in nature – the reserves of which are estimated to have depleted in the last 50 years. [...] Another possibility is the use of algae production systems to clean up <b>non-point</b> <b>source</b> pollution, in a system known as an algal turf scrubber (ATS). [...] This has been demonstrated to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels in rivers and other large bodies of water affected by eutrophication, and systems are being built that will be capable of processing up to 110 million liters of water per day. [...] ATS can also be used for treating point source pollution, such as the waste water mentioned above, or in treating livestock effluent.|$|E

5000|$|Water {{contamination}} usually occurs {{through a}} series of two mechanisms: point and <b>non-point</b> <b>sources</b> of pollution. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), point source pollution is [...] "any single identifiable source of pollution from which pollutants are discharged, such as a pipe, ditch, ship or factory smokestack.” Therefore, among the most common examples of point source pollution, poor factory and sewage treatment appear high on the list; although not as frequent, but, nevertheless, equally—if not more—dangerous, oil spills are another famous example of point source of pollution. On the other hand, <b>non-point</b> <b>sources</b> of pollution are those that may come from different sources, among which, poor and badly monitored agricultural activities can negatively affect the quality of any nearby sources of water.|$|R
40|$|Because {{the large}} rivers of the Seine {{watershed}} {{have a low}} microbiological water quality, the main sources of fecal contamination were investigated in the present study. The inputs of the point (wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluents) and <b>non-point</b> <b>sources</b> (surface runoff and soil leaching) of fecal bacteria were quantified for Escherichia coli and intestinal enteroccoci used as bacterial indicators. In order to assess the contamination through <b>non-point</b> <b>sources,</b> fecal indicators abundance was estimated in samples collected in small streams located in rural areas upstream from all point sources; these small rivers were characterized by the land use of their watershed. Bacterial indicator numbers were also measured in effluents of WWTPs, some using classical treatment (settling followed by activated sludge process) and some using an additional disinfection stage (UV irradiation). These data were used to estimate the respective importance of each type of source at {{the scale of the}} whole Seine river watershed taking into account the land use and the population density. It shows the predominant importance of the point sources of fecal indicator bacteria at the scale of the whole watershed. In a scenario in which activated sludge treatment would be complemented with UV in all WWTPs located in this watershed, the <b>non-point</b> <b>sources</b> of fecal indicator bacteria would be dominant. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

However, control of <b>non-point</b> <b>sources</b> of nitrogen, such as atmospheric deposition, leaking septic systems, runoff and agricultural runoff, has lagged. There is unanimous agreement that arresting nitrogen influxes into aquatic ecosystems is essential to control eutrophication. Protecting drinking water sources from elevated levels of nitrate and nitrite nitrogen from <b>non-point</b> <b>sources</b> is also necessary to protect public health. Elevated levels of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water are known to cause methemoglobinemia (blue-baby syndrome) in infants. The overall objective of this research project was to develop a robust and efficient bioretention system to control <b>non-point</b> <b>sources</b> of nitrogen. Two pilot-scale denitrifying bioretention systems were investigated, one was configured for autotrophic denitrification (S:OS unit) and the other was configured for heterotrophic denitrification (Denyte unit).

A synthetic stormwater, intended to mimic nitrogen levels in runoff from agricultural croplands, was utilized as the influent during laboratory testing.
