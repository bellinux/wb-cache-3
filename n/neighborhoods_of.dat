5|$|Crime in Washington, D.C., is {{concentrated}} in areas associated with poverty, drug abuse, and gangs.

Approximately 60,000 residents are ex-convicts.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, these {{algorithms}} can {{be extended}} to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as well. For instance, in a circle graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by applying the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>of</b> pairs of vertices.|$|E

5|$|NY78 {{takes on}} its best-known name as well when it leaves at Transit Road (US20), as NY16 assumes an eastwest heading across the {{suburban}} <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>of</b> West Seneca. It crosses NY277, a major retail strip, at Union Road in the hamlet of Ebenezer. One final trumpet exit to NY400 (and by extension, the New York State Thruway) precedes its junction with Harlem Road (NY240), where county maintenance of NY16, {{and thus the}} overlap with CR572, ends. Just west of NY240, NY16 crosses the Thruway itself as it begins {{to head to the}} northwest and enter the city of Buffalo, where the route is locally maintained. Running almost due northwest through the residential <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>of</b> South Buffalo, NY16 reaches its last major junction, with US62, at Bailey Avenue just after crossing the Buffalo River. Immediately afterwards it crosses I-190 with no exit (but with northbound access) and returns to a more eastwest course through industrial areas before ending at Main Street, NY5, in the city center.|$|E

5|$|The modern city of Ashdod {{city was}} built outside the {{historic}} settlement site, on virgin sands. The development followed a main development plan. The planners divided the city into seventeen <b>neighborhoods</b> <b>of</b> {{ten to fifteen}} thousand people. Wide avenues between the neighborhoods make traffic flow relatively freely inside the city. Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center, urban park, and health and education infrastructure. The original plan also called for a business and administrative center, built in the mid-1990s, when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling in ten years.|$|E
