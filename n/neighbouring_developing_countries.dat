30|$|The {{number of}} {{displaced}} persons worldwide is currently {{at its highest}} level since the Second World War. More than 65 million people around the globe were forcibly displaced in 2015, of which approximately a third (21 million) were displaced internationally (i.e. refugees). The vast majority of refugees reside in <b>neighbouring</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> (United High Commissioner for Refugees 2016 a). The consequences of displacement for those affected are significant and frequently long-lasting and affect multiple aspects of human life. One important aspect that displacement experiences can affect is access to education. Several studies suggest that forced displacement {{is one of the}} key channels through which conflict can have a detrimental impact on schooling outcomes (Chamarbagwala and Moran 2011; Justino et al. 2014; Verwimp and Van Bavel 2014). Most studies have, however, focused on internally displaced persons (IDPs) while there is scarce evidence on the impact of forced displacement on the education of refugees.|$|E

The analysis is set {{against the background of}} the process of regional integration between the EU and its <b>neighbouring</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> The underlying question is whether trade integration fosters or dampens learning and technological upgrading. We find that unit values of exports from these countries to the EU rose steadily between 1988 and 1996, relative to the unit values of world exports to Europe. If increases in unit values satisfactorily proxy increases in product quality, then trade integration has fostered product upgrading and technological learning in the sample countries. We find that imported technologies and other sources of knowledge have a strong bearing on this pattern.

We measure TFP growth using real gross value added as output and capital input, labour input and a stock input index based on the major fish stocks. In <b>developed</b> <b>neighbouring</b> <b>countries,</b> we expect rapid diffusion of fishing technology innovations contributing to productivity convergence. In addition, innovations in the public regulation and the industrial organization may also have influenced productivity growth during the period. We find that Iceland has had the highest annual TFP growth. Accounting for stock changes it amounts to 3 percent, while the corresponding figures for Sweden and Norway are 2. 8 and 0. 8 percent, respectively. Despite best-practice fishing technologies being widely available, we find no evidence of productivity convergence among the three countries...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the Australian public's expectations, concerns {{and willingness to}} accept vaccination with the pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 influenza vaccine. Design, setting and participants: A computer-assisted telephone interview survey was conducted between 20 August and 11 September 2009 by trained professional interviewers to study issues relating to vaccine uptake and perceived safety. The sample comprised 1155 randomly selected representative adults {{who had participated in}} a 2007 national study exploring knowledge and perceptions of pandemic influenza. Main outcome measures: Likely acceptance of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 vaccination, factors associated with acceptance, and respondents' willingness to share Australian vaccine with <b>neighbouring</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Results: Of 1155 possible participants, 830 (72 %) were successfully interviewed. Twenty per cent of the study group (169 / 830) reported that they had developed influenza-like symptoms during the 2009 pandemic period. Most respondents (645 / 830, 78 %) considered pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 to be a mild disease, and 211 / 830 (25 %) regarded themselves as being at increased risk of infection. Willingness to accept pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 vaccination was high (556 / 830, 67 %) but was significantly lower than when pandemic vaccination uptake was investigated in 2007 (88 %; P< 0. 0001). Respondents who had already been vaccinated against seasonal influenza and those who perceived pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 to be severe were significantly more willing to accept vaccination. Most respondents (793 / 822, 96 %) were willing to share surplus vaccine with developing countries in our region. Conclusion: Although two-thirds of Australian adults surveyed were willing to accept pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 vaccination, and most supported sharing vaccine with developing countries, {{there is a need for}} accessible information on vaccine safety for those who are undecided about vaccination...|$|E
40|$|Background: Switzerland is a {{traditional}} immigration country with immigrants from both <b>neighbouring,</b> and less <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> Since the early 1990 s, the migration rate has continuously increased and in 2013 {{almost a quarter of}} Swiss residents had an immigration background. Immigrants in Switzerland had fewer psychiatric hospitalisations, but more emergency and compulsory admissions than the local population. Therefore it is important to study the characteristics of the immigrant population presenting at the emergency department for mental health problems. Methods: Our retrospective data analysis included adult patients (age ≥ 16 years) admitted to our emergency department who consulted a psychiatrist, between 1 st of January 2007 and 30 th of October 2012. Results: Clinical data from a total of 1115 patients were available for analysis. Of these, 58. 6 % (n= 654) were male and 41. 4 % (n= 461) female. The mean age was 36. 3 years, with a range of 16 – 85 years. The most common reason for psychiatric presentation to the emergency department was psychosis (n= 227, 20. 3 %), followed by social problems with 18. 2 % (n= 203), auto-aggression with 16. 4 % (n= 193) and 16. 2 % (n= 181) suffering from depression. Conclusions: Translation services are very important. Therapy adherence programs for psychosis and autoaggression prevention programs are especially important for immigrants...|$|R

50|$|The {{economic}} {{basis for}} including <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> {{in efforts to}} reduce emissions is that emission cuts {{are thought to be}} less expensive in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> than <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p. 30; Grubb, 2003, p. 159).

50|$|Usually <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> have a {{positive}} or high natural increase rate. <b>Developed</b> <b>countries</b> have a negative/neutral or low natural increase rate, but many <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> have their population increasing due to immigration despite their negative RNI.

This is because <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> and <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> are in different stages of the demographic transition. <b>Developing</b> <b>countries</b> are generally in the earlier stages of the transition meaning they have high fertility, which would show an increase in crude birth rates. <b>Developed</b> <b>countries</b> usually have lower or more stable fertility rates so they don't show as high rates in natural increase.
