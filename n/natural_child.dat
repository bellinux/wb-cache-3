5|$|Sextus Pompeius {{was the son}} of First Triumvir Pompey {{and still}} a renegade general {{following}} Julius Caesar's victory over his father. He was established in Sicily and Sardinia as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39BC. Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, {{who was a member of}} the republican party, ironically, not the Caesarian faction. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40BC when he married Scribonia, a daughter of Lucius Scribonius Libo who was a follower of Sextus Pompeius as well as his father-in-law. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only <b>natural</b> <b>child,</b> Julia, who was born the same day that he divorced her to marry Livia Drusilla, little more than a year after their marriage.|$|E
25|$|Born in Antwerp, {{probably}} in 1560 (1557, {{according to one}} source), he was a <b>natural</b> <b>child</b> of Wenceslas Coeberger and Catharina Raems, which was attested by deed in May 1579. His name is also written as Wenceslaus, Wensel or Wenzel; his surname is sometimes recorded as Coberger, Cobergher, Coebergher, and Koeberger.|$|E

His father's {{forename}} was shortened to Rienzo, and his own, Nicola, to Cola; hence the Cola di Rienzo, or Rienzi, by which he is generally known.|$|E

Agrippina the Elder was {{remembered as}} a modest and heroic matron, who was the second {{daughter}} and fourth child of Julia the Elder and the statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. The father of Julia the Elder was the Emperor Augustus, and Julia was his only <b>natural</b> <b>child</b> from his second marriage to Scribonia, who had close blood relations with Pompey the Great and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Maternally, Agrippina descended directly from Augustus.|$|E
25|$|Christie {{adapted the}} book as a play {{of the same name}} in 1945. It is notable for being one of the most radical reworkings of a novel Christie ever did, not only {{eliminating}} Hercule Poirot from the story, but also changing the identity of the killer. In the play, the ill Mrs Boynton committed suicide and dropped several red herrings that pointed to her family members as possible suspects, hoping that they would suspect each other and therefore continue to live in her shadow even after her death. In addition, the character of Carol Boynton has been dropped, Ginevra is now a stepdaughter (rather than a <b>natural</b> <b>child)</b> of Mrs Boynton, Lady Westholme becomes an ex-Member of Parliament, Miss Pierce is now Miss Pryce, and Alderman Higgs has been added as a fellow vacationer/verbal sparring partner for Lady Westholme.|$|E
500|$|Santosky v. Kramer, , is a Supreme Court case {{involving}} {{the burden of}} proof for the revocation of parental rights. The case arose when the Ulster County, New York Department of Social Services sought to revoke John Santosky II and Annie Santosky's parental rights to their three children. Under Section 622 of the New York State Family Court Act, the state was permitted to revoke parental rights to a <b>natural</b> <b>child</b> if, after a fair preponderance of the evidence, a court found [...] "permanent neglect." [...] The New York State Family Court found such neglect by using the [...] "fair perponderance" [...] standard. The Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of {{the burden of proof}} used.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{being an}} {{original}} story, Spectre draws on Ian Fleming's source material, {{most notably in}} the character of Franz Oberhauser, played by Christoph Waltz, and his father Hannes. Hannes Oberhauser is a background character in the short story [...] "Octopussy" [...] from the Octopussy and The Living Daylights collection, and is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young Bond in 1983. As Sam Mendes searched for events in young Bond's life to follow the childhood discussed in Skyfall, he came across Hannes Oberhauser, who becomes a father figure to Bond. From there Mendes conceived the idea of [...] "a <b>natural</b> <b>child</b> who had been pushed out, cuckoo in the nest" [...] by Bond, which became Franz. Similarly, Charmian Bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian, observing the back story established by Fleming.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the time}} that Tiberius died, Agrippina had become pregnant. Domitius had {{acknowledged}} the paternity of the child. In {{the early morning hours}} in Antium of December 15, 37, Agrippina gave birth to a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after the Domitius' recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the Emperor Nero. Nero was Agrippina's only <b>natural</b> <b>child.</b> Suetonius states that Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, whereupon he replied [...] "I don't think anything produced by me and Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people".|$|E

In 1942, however, during a battle over a large trust fund established to benefit any descendants of her former husband, Bennett announced that her adopted son actually was her <b>natural</b> <b>child</b> by Plant, born after the divorce and kept hidden {{to ensure that the}} child's biological father did not get custody. During the court hearings, the actress told her former mother-in-law and her husband's widow that [...] "if she got to the witness stand she would give a complete account of her life with Plant.

2500|$|In case of Santosky v. Kramer, 455 US 745, Supreme Court {{reviewed}} a {{case when}} Department of Social Services removed two younger {{children from their}} natural parents only because the parents had been previously found negligent toward their oldest daughter. When the third child was only three days old, DSS transferred him to a foster home {{on the ground that}} immediate removal was necessary to avoid imminent danger to his life or health. The Supreme Court vacated previous judgment and stated: [...] "Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their <b>natural</b> <b>child,</b> due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence. <..> But until the State proves parental unfitness, the child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship".|$|E
2500|$|Feeling {{that too}} much of the Doctor's backstory had been {{revealed}} by the Seventh Doctor's era, writers Andrew Cartmel, Ben Aaronovitch and Marc Platt developed a new direction for the series. Cartmel wished to restore the character's [...] "awe, mystery and strength" [...] and make him [...] "once again more than a mere chump of a Time Lord" [...] – an idea the media dubbed the [...] "Cartmel Masterplan". Under Cartmel, the show foreshadowed this concept; however, its 1989 cancellation meant that it was never realised onscreen. The proposed backstory was fully explored in Platt's 1997 novel Lungbarrow, where the Doctor is revealed as [...] "the Other", a mysterious figure in Gallifreyan lore who co-founded Time Lord society with Rassilon and Omega. After a curse renders Gallifrey sterile, the Other devises biotechnological looms to [...] "weave" [...] new Time Lords; his granddaughter Susan is Gallifrey's last <b>natural</b> <b>child.</b> To escape a civil war with Rassilon, the Other throws himself into the loom system, where he is disintegrated and later woven into the Doctor.|$|E

Justice was now substantially done, and the judge's property being sufficient for his wants, the present situation of the lately reputed heir excited but little sympathy.
