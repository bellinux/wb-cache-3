Due to landlocked geography of Mongolia, Battulga views that a unified railway network would enhance the global competitiveness of its national mining industry by creating multiple access points through which the country can target multiple inland and seaborne markets. Furthermore, Battulga believes, given the cyclical <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> markets, industrial clusters designed to do value-add processing of mineral products should be established to create skilled jobs, introduce downstream industrial technologies and diversify the economy, enhancing local purchasing power that would create economic multiplier effect in housing, services and other economic sectors. Battulga thinks that agriculture has a prominent place in diversifying the economy as Mongolia is rich in livestock, about 60 million, with largest consumers of agricultural products as its neighbors. He believes cashmere and leather products could be successfully marketed internationally because of the scarcity factor.|$|E

40|$|It is now commonplace {{to assert}} that the {{contemporary}} discursive landscape is strewn {{with an abundance of}} environmental narratives. Yet these stories about <b>nature</b> seldom speak <b>of</b> the material geographies that link practices of postindustrial consumption to often-distant spaces <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> supply. A postscarcity narrative in which the availability of natural resources no longer poses a limiting factor on economic growth, therefore, characterizes the current period. In this paper I examine how these narratives of `resource triumphalism' construct the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> and the places that supply them. Using a range of sources, I illustrate how extractive spaces are constructed through a discursive dialectic which simultaneously erases socioecological histories and reinscribes space in the image <b>of</b> the <b>commodity.</b> The paper advances the claim that, despite their apparent marginality in narratives of postindustrialism, primary commodity-supply zones play a key role within broader narratives about modernity and social life. I draw on Hetherington's reworking of the concept of heterotopia to argue that commodity-supply zones be considered contemporary 'badlands', marginal spaces in and through which broader processes of sociospatial ordering are worked out. By examining the geographical imaginaries associated with mineral extraction, I demonstrate how contemporary discourses of commodity-supply space facilitate the material practices through which such ordering occurs. ...|$|R
50|$|To {{explain the}} {{peculiar}} Dutch success {{we have to}} take account of a number of factors that in isolation still do not explain the Dutch primacy in world trade, but whose interplay may go far in doing that. The Dutch had gained {{an important role in the}} Baltic trade (grain especially) in the 15th and 16th century because <b>of</b> the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> exchanged (herring for grain, a low-value, high-volume bulk trade) and the dominance of the Dutch in the herring fisheries. These factors became dominant in this trade because Dutch shippers experienced a structural fall in shipping costs due to revolutionary innovations in shipbuilding (the wind-driven sawmill) — which brought down construction costs — and in ship-design (the Fluyt ship that required smaller crews) at the turn of the 17th century. This so improved their competitive position that they soon dominated the European bulk trades, not only the Baltic trade, but also the salt trade of the Iberian Peninsula.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{stochastic}} or random <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> prices plays {{a central}} role in models for valuing financial contingent claims on commodities. In this paper, by enhancing a multi factor framework which is consistent not only with the market observable forward price curve but also the volatilities and correlations of forward prices, we propose a two factor stochastic volatility model for the evolution of the gas forward curve. The volatility is stochastic due to a hidden Markov Chain that causes it to switch between “on peak ” and “off peak ” states. Based on the structure functional forms for the volatility, we propose and implement the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to estimate the parameters of the forward curve model. Applications to simulated data indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to accommodate more general features, such as regime switching and seasonality. Applications to the market gas forward data shows that the MCMC approach provides stable estimates. 1. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} to a circular economy, where the value of resources is preserved in the technosphere, must be supported by policies and operational decision making based on evidence. Existing methods used to provide this evidence (e. g. LCA, LCSA, CBA) are not robust enough to adequately address the creation and dissipation of systemic and multidimensional value that spans the social, environmental, economic and technical domains. This study proposes a novel, conceptual approach that seeks to assess how complex value is created, destroyed and distributed in resource recovery from waste systems. This approach expands beyond conventional methods of estimating value. It combines scientific and engineering methods with a socio-political narrative grounded in the systems of provision (sop) approach, and provides a comprehensive, analytical framework for making the {{transition to}} a resource-efficient future. This framework has the potential to connect bottom-up and top-down approaches in assessing resource recovery from waste systems, and address systemic challenges through transparency and flexibility, while accounting for the dynamic and non-linear <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> flow and infrastructure provision in the overall system.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} three different commodity models that {{take into account}} the mean reverting <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodity</b> prices. The first model is a simple one-factor model based on the one proposed in [9]. In this model, the convenience yield and interest rate are assumed to be constant. The second model is the two-factor model developed in [21]. This model involves two factors: the short-term deviation and the equilibrium price level. The last model is a three-factor model proposed in [22]. We mainly focus on the second and third models since the first model and the second one are equivalent in general. We study these three models based on two aspects: discretization and filtering. For the first study, we observe and compare theoretically and empirically two well-known discretiza-tion schemes, namely, the Euler scheme and the Milstein scheme. This study turns out to be useful for the filtering aspect. Indeed, once a model has been put in a state space form which can be obtained by using a discretization technique, then this enables filtering techniques to be applied to solve the filtering recursion problem for the model.
