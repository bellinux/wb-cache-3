5|$|Although Edinburgh is {{the capital}} of Scotland, the largest city is Glasgow, which has just over 584,000 inhabitants. The Greater Glasgow conurbation, with a {{population}} of almost 1.2million, is home to <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> Scotland's population. The Central Belt is where most of the main towns and cities are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|During its {{formative}} stages, the typhoon brought high {{waves to}} Guam, resulting in one death. Twelve families were also left homeless. After passing near Taiwan, Andy brought strong winds, {{which resulted in}} 13deaths. Government offices, schools and airports were closed. At least 60 fishing boats in harbors were badly damaged or wrecked due to strong winds. A total of 300poer poles were brought down; consequently, <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> Taiwan residents lost power {{at the height of}} the storm. After moving ashore in China, Andy brought heavy rains to nearby Hong Kong.|$|E

50|$|In 1988, the World Bank {{estimated}} that 1-2% {{of the global}} population subsists by waste picking. A 2010 study estimates that there are 1.5 million waste pickers in India alone.

5|$|The 20th century saw {{a revival}} as local tourism {{developed}} {{and there are}} now two caravan parks. The census of 2001 recorded 135people in the Reculver area, <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> whom were in caravans at the time. The Reculver coastline is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area and a Ramsar site, including most of Reculver Country Park, which itself includes much of Bishopstone Cliffs local nature reserve. While nationally scarce plants and insects are found there, the location is also important for migrating birds and is of significant geological interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{labor force}} {{consists}} {{of more than}} four million people, among whom women hold slightly more jobs than men. In 2005, <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the population was employed by industrial factories. Employment is also high in agriculture, manufacturing sales, trading goods, and education. The unemployment rate, according to government statistics, was 1.5% in 2005. There were 679,000 unemployed Belarusians, two-thirds of whom were women. The unemployment rate has been in decline since 2003, and the overall rate of employment is the highest since statistics were first compiled in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Alfred died December 4, 1875, {{and left}} Edward with an {{inheritance}} of <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> a million dollars. Alfred's {{death was a}} blow to Cope; {{his father was a}} constant confidant. The same year marked a suspension of much of Cope's field work and a new emphasis on writing up discoveries of the previous years. His chief publication of the time, The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Formations of the West, was a collection of 303pages and 54illustration plates. The memoir summarized his experiences prospecting in New Jersey and Kansas. Cope now had the finances to hire multiple teams to search for fossils for him year-round and he advised the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition on their fossil displays. Cope's studies of marine reptiles of Kansas closed in 1876, opening a new focus on terrestrial reptiles. The same year, Cope moved from Haddonfield to 2100 and 2102 Pine Street in Philadelphia. He converted one of the two houses into a museum where he stored his growing collection of fossils. Cope's expeditions took him across Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Montana. His initial journey into the Clarendon beds of Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Texas led to an affiliation with the Geological Survey of Texas. Cope's papers on the region constitute some of his most important paleontological contributions. In 1877, he purchased half the rights to the American Naturalist to publish the papers he produced at a rate so high, Marsh questioned their dating.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} U. S. labor {{productivity}} rebounded {{in the second}} half of the 1990 s, after <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> century <b>of</b> sluggish gains. We assess the contribution of information technology to this rebound, using the same neoclassical framework as in our earlier work. We find that a surge in the use of information technology capital and faster efficiency gains in the production of computers account for about two-thirds of the speed-up in productivity growth between the first and second halves of the 1990 s. Thus, to answer the question posed in the title of the paper, information technology largely is the story. ...|$|R

50|$|It {{took more}} than a decade for another attempt to be made to restore the opera house. In 1996, after Mayor Harvey Bernier Jr. took office, {{restoration}} continued. Restoration focused mostly on bringing the unique flooring back to working condition, restoring the original stenciling, and bringing the opera house back to its original state. After only an impressive eighteen months, with over $300,000 of donated money and goods (above what the city had already agreed to pay), and ten thousand hours of volunteer labor, the Rochester Opera House restoration was completed. Following <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> century <b>of</b> dormancy, the opera house reopened its doors to the public in 1997.|$|R
25|$|More recently, {{many states}} have {{authorized}} financial requirements {{that will make it}} more difficult for working-poor adults to access coverage.

A survey in Minnesota found that more than half of those covered by Medicaid were unable to obtain prescription medications because of co-payments.|$|E

60|$|In {{this table}} {{we see that}} {{castings}} which had been ejected {{at the mouth of}} the same burrow, and which in most cases appeared fresh and always retained their vermiform configuration, generally exceeded an ounce in weight after being dried, and sometimes <b>nearly</b> equalled <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pound. On the Nilgiri mountains one casting even exceeded this latter weight. The largest castings in England were found on extremely poor pasture-land; and these, as far as I have seen, are generally larger than those on land producing a rich vegetation. It would appear that worms have to swallow a greater amount of earth on poor than on rich land, in order to obtain sufficient nutriment.|$|R
